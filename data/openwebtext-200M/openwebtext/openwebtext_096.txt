Al - Qaeda as an Anti-Muslim Movement
Still Dangerous to US
Al - Qaeda , at least as a vague franchise , still exists , and remains a major threat to the US .
That is , however , mostly because opportunistic forces on the American Right would use any further attacks on the US to abrogate more of our constitutional rights .
At the moment , al - Qaeda ’s biggest targets are other Muslims .
Al - Qaeda might well have faded away after Tora Bora .
It did not , despite having its command and control deeply disrupted and the capture of many top commanders and hundreds of operatives .
Why ?
The US occupation of Iraq is one big reason ( see below ) .
It has galvanized Gulf millionaires to begin giving money to al - Qaeda again , and Iraq generates both trained operatives and small amounts of cash for the central al - Qaeda organization , which operates in the badlands on the Pakistan - Afghanistan frontier .
Another thing that kept al - Qaeda alive was the internet .
Wonderful as the latter is , it is just a communications medium and can be used for good or evil .
Jihadi radicals have used it for recruitment and for spreading around knowledge of how to make explosives , etc .
Another important impetus to al - Qaeda ’s survival is that it has taken the place of the Communist Party as radical response to the status quo .
Al - Qaeda ’s top leadership is rich , not poor , and it is a movement of the Right , not the Left .
But it is a radical , populist Right that can attract the dispossessed .
Although al - Qaeda has struck with brutal inventiveness at Western countries , currently its biggest target is other Muslims , whom its leaders consider to be “ collaborators ” with the United States and Western Europe , or other status quo powers .
Friday ’s bombing of a mosque in Hyderabad , India , which killed a dozen and provoked riots in which there was further loss of life , appears to have been an operation by the Harakat ul - Jihad ul - Islami or HUJI of Bangladesh .
The sim cards used in the phones that set off the blast point to a Bengali network .
Some of the sim cards used had expired , saving dozens , perhaps hundres of lives .
So why would radical Muslims blow up a historic mosque and kill worshippers ?
They may have hoped that the bombing would be blamed on Hindus and would promote civil strife .
They certainly were hoping to radicalize Muslims and drive them to join HUJI .
Attacking Muslims is seen by the radicals as a way of radicalizing Muslims .
They grossly misjudged their public in this case , since Muslims in Hyderabad tend to vote Congress , the ruling party of India .
Sunday ’s market bombing in Afghanistan , which killed 14 and wounded 30 , was a similar tactic .
The Neo-Taliban in Afghanisan ( 3,000 to 5,000 fighters ) certainly make an attempt to associate themselves with dispossessed farmers in Helmand , whose poppie crops were burned by the government in an anti-drug campaign .
A mixture of criminality , turf wars , and grinding poverty also underpins the Fath Islam movement of Lebanon , which has come into deadly conflict with the Lebanese army .
Greg Miller of the LA Times reports that al - Qaeda in Mesopotamia is able to funnel a few tens of thousands of dollars to al - Qaeda in Waziristan ( a tribal area of Pakistan ) , easing a money cruch that had left Bin Laden and al - Zawahiri broke in 2005 .
Given the millions of dollars in oil and antiquities smuggling sloshing around Iraq , not to mention the kidnapping and ransom money , it does n’t sound to me like the al - Qaeda fund transfers are more than peanuts .
The money is enough , apparently , to convince Ayman al - Zawahiri to go along with the Iraqi jihadis ’ preference for hitting Iraqi Shiites as a way of mobilizing Sunni Arabs in Iraq .
More worrisome is that some jihadis who have gained experience fighting the US military in Iraq have fled to Pakistan and gotten in touch with Taliban remnants , passing over to them key operational knowledge .
Miller says that the CIA put an extra 50 operatives into the field in Pakistan to attempt to track down Bin Laden and al - Zawahiri , but without success .
One of the major reasons for the US to get out of Iraq is that its attempt to occupy a major Arab Muslim country is generating terrorism and support for terrorism at a pace much faster than US security agencies can fight it .
The longer we stay in Iraq , the more likely it is that it will produce another attack on the US mainland .
Since important elements of the US political , military and corporate elite are apparently not actually much interested in democracy , another such attack might provide the heavies with a pretext to do away with it in practice ( the Putin model ) , whatever trimmings they retain .
Former CENTCOM commander Tommy Franks once suggested as much .
So getting out of Iraq might be the only way to save the Republic .
End view of typical preassembled flat wall ICF block
Insulating concrete forms ( ICFs ) result in cast - in - place concrete walls that are sandwiched between two layers of insulation material .
These systems are strong and energy efficient .
Common applications for this method of construction are low - rise buildings , with property uses ranging from residential to commercial to industrial .
Traditional finishes are applied to interior and exterior faces , so the buildings look similar to typical construction , although the walls are usually thicker .
Overview and History
Thirty - foot tall ICF walls for multi-screen theatre project in Utah .
Advantages
Insulating concrete forms , or ICFs , are forms used to hold fresh concrete that remain in place permanently to provide insulation for the structure they enclose .
Their history dates back to after World War II , when blocks of treated wood fibers held together by cement were used in Switzerland .
In the 1940s and 1950s , chemical companies developed plastic foams , which by the 1960s allowed a Canadian inventor to develop a foam block that resembles today ’s typical ICFs .
Europeans were developing similar products around the same time .
In the 1980s and 1990s , some American companies got involved in the technology , manufacturing blocks and panels or planks .
By the mid-1990s , the Insulating Concrete Form Association ( ICFA ) was founded to do research and promotion of the products , working toward building code acceptance .
They also worked with the Portland Cement Association to build awareness of this type of construction .
Although there were some obstacles — costs could be greater than frame construction because people did n’t understand the system , builders had to work closely to get code approval , and materials were proprietary — the number of insulating concrete forms producers grew .
As a result , competition increased and costs moderated .
The new companies developed variations and innovations to distinguish one system from another .
Over time , some ICF manufacturers consolidated , leading to a smaller number of larger companies .
Because insulating concrete forms systems offered performance benefits like strength and energy efficiency and were initially more expensive to construct , the first target market was high end home construction .
Custom home clients were willing and able to pay extra for the premium quality .
As word of ICFs grew and innovations reduced manufacturing and installation costs , builders began using the forms for mid-price - range homes .
Some production builders now create entire large developments using insulating concrete forms .
In the past , single family residential accounted for about 70 percent of ICF construction — versus about 30 percent for commercial or multifamily uses — but the products are suitable for all these applications , and larger buildings appear to be a growing market for ICFs .
They have become popular for a variety of commercial projects including apartments or condos , hotel / motel , retail , and even movie theaters .
Insulating concrete forms provide benefits to builders and building owners alike .
Owners appreciate :
strong walls
disaster resistance and safety
mold , rot , mildew , and insect resistance ( below grade can require termite protection )
sound - blocking ability
overall comfort
energy efficiency and resultant cost savings
Contractors and builders like :
fast , easy construction
flexibility
light weight for easy shipping and erection
compatibility with carpenter trades
ability to meet higher energy code mandates with less complicated construction
Sizes , Components , Configurations , Systems
Insulating concrete forms systems can vary in their design .
" Flat " systems yield a continuous thickness of concrete , like a conventionally poured wall .
The wall produced by " grid " systems has a waffle pattern where the concrete is thicker at some points than others .
" Post and beam " systems have just that – discrete horizontal and vertical columns of concrete that are completely encapsulated in foam insulation .
Whatever their differences , all major ICF systems are engineer - designed , code - accepted , and field - proven .
The two insulating faces are separated by some type of connector or web .
Large preassembled blocks stack quickly on site .
Panels or planks ship more compactly , but must be assembled into formwork on the job .
Foam is most often expanded polystyrene ( EPS ) .
It can be extruded polystyrene ( XPS ) , which is stronger , but also more costly .
A few products are made with recycled foam or wood fiber in a nod to green construction .
The salvaged material is formed into blocks with cement , making units ideal for direct application of plaster finishes .
The ties that interconnect the two layers of insulated forming material can be plastic , metal , or additional projections of the insulation .
There are advantages to each type of material , but one current trend incorporates hinges into the ties that allow pre assembled forms to fold flat for easy , less costly shipping .
The joints between individual forms can feature interlocking teeth or a tongue and groove configuration molded into the forming material , or simple butt jointed seams .
Many manufacturers have developed units with universal interlocks that allow the forms to stack whether the form is flipped one way or the other .
These “ reversible ” forms save time during placement and prevent improper alignment .
Special units for corners , floors , and roof assemblies round out the product lines and improve the engineering of the system and energy efficiency of the final construction .
Stacking preassembled ICF formwork Example of preassembled corner blocks
Block sizes are typically on the order of 16 inches high by 48 inches long .
The cavities are commonly six or eight inches wide but can be larger or smaller as needed .
The foam faces are also capable of being varied , but 1 - 7/8 - to 2-3/4 - inch thickness is a usual range .
So an 8 - inch cavity with a two - inch foam face on either side would lead to a 12 - inch formed wall .
More recently some systems have developed the capability of offering thicker layers of foam to enhance performance .
After finishes are applied inside and out , typical final wall thickness is greater than one foot .
This means that the depth of window and door surrounds have to be wider than what is used for traditional frame construction , with resulting deep window sills — a nice feature for homeowners or other building occupants .
Installation , Connections , Finishes
Installation of insulating concrete form systems is similar to masonry construction .
Builders usually start at the corners and place a layer at a time to build up the wall .
Some units , particularly those that form a “ waffle ” or post–and –beam concrete wall profile must be glued together or taped at the joints during assembly .
Most systems today feature uniform cavities that improve flowability of the concrete , reduce the need for adhesives during stacking , resulting in flat concrete walls of consistent thickness .
Waffle grid ICF block creates variable concrete wall thickness
Once the forms are in place and braced and required reinforcement installed , concrete is pumped into the forms .
Even with the bracing , forms need to be filled at an appropriate rate based on formwork manufacturer recommendation to prevent misalignment and blowouts .
Product advancements and improved construction techniques have greatly reduced the potential for form failure .
It seldom occurs when manufacturer recommendations are followed .
Reinforcement in both directions maintains the wall strength .
Openings for doors and windows require bucks to surround the opening , contain the fresh concrete during placement , and provide suitable material for fastening window or door frames .
Placement of concrete in ICFs with pump
Block - outs are needed when bearing pockets are required for floor or roof items .
Insulating concrete form systems are compatible with concrete floors , and wood or steel floor joists .
In smaller buildings , ledger assemblies for floor framing attachment mounted to the side of the formwork are common .
In larger buildings or those for commercial uses , steel weld plates or bolt plates can be pre installed within the formwork so they become embedded in the fresh concrete .
Embedded weld plates for structural steel support
Finishes are usually attached via the flat ends of metal or plastic ties embedded in the forming material .
Finishes can alternately be furred out with furring strips .
Almost any type of finish can be used with these systems .
Wallboard remains the most common interior finish and is the most typical means of meeting the code requirement for a 15 - minute fire barrier over plastic foams surrounding living spaces .
Exteriors are much more varied and depend on customer preference .
Cement plasters are applied over ICFs in a manner similar to other sheathed systems .
Utilities are typically recessed into cutouts in foam after concrete has been placed
Sustainability and Energy
A major appeal of ICFs is the potential for reducing energy to heat and cool the building .
Some estimates place the savings at 20 percent or more .
The R-value for a typical Insulating concrete form is about 20 .
The walls can often have high air tightness 10 to 30 percent better than frame - with compatible windows , doors , and roof .
As a result , assuming a 100 - year service life , one single - family ICF home has the potential to save about 110 tons of CO2 compared to a traditional wood frame home .
This more than offsets the CO2 associated with the production of the cement used to make the concrete .
See graph below .
C02 Savings of ICF vs. Frame Home
Reference : PCA Tech Brief 12
Thermal mass is one of the reasons that Insulating concrete forms work so well to maintain a consistent temperature ; insulation is the other .
As the graph above demonstrates , this saves quite a bit of energy associated with heating and cooling , which not only saves money , but also provides a more comfortable interior .
Insulating concrete forms save trees because the wood frame is eliminated .
Insulating concrete forms systems can also contain a decent amount of recycled materials .
Concrete can be made using supplementary cementing materials like fly ash or slag to replace a portion of the cement .
Aggregate can be recycled ( crushed concrete ) to reduce the need for virgin aggregate .
Most steel for reinforcement is recycled .
Some polystyrenes are recycled .
From a sustainability viewpoint , the reduced operating energy , reduction of CO 2 , long service life , and use of local and recycled materials make ICF construction environmentally beneficial .
Building Codes
When ICFs were first introduced to North America , codes officials were not familiar with the system , so there was a learning curve associated with approval .
As reinforced concrete walls , Insulating concrete forms are quite strong .
But they are built in an entirely different manner than wood frame walls and require different evaluation criteria .
Many form manufacturers performed testing and prepared Evaluation Service Reports or something equivalent to that as a way to demonstrate the wall system ’s integrity .
Groups that generate these reports include the International Code Council Evaluation Service , Inc. and the Canadian Construction Materials Centre .
As insulating concrete forms have increased in popularity , code approval has become much simpler .
For one and two family dwellings , the International Residential Code ( IRC ) addresses foundations and below grade walls in Section R404 and above grade walls in R611 for homes up to two stories plus a basement .
For larger buildings like multi-family and commercial structures , an engineer is typically required for structural design and an Evaluation Service Report documenting approval of the ICF for the type of construction mandated for the project will often be needed to finalize approval .
A long - awaited federal report on the environmental impact of wind power suggests birds have far more to fear from high buildings , power lines and cats than they do from the swirling blades of wind generators at Altamont Pass and elsewhere .
But North America 's bats might have plenty more to worry about , according to a report released Thursday by the National Academy of Sciences .
The report said bats might be at considerable risk in the southwestern United States and elsewhere , where reliance on wind power has been growing .
The wind - power turbines generate sounds and , possibly , electromagnetic fields that lure the acoustically sensitive creatures into the spinning blades , scientists suggested .
Until Thursday 's report by the National Research Council , the research arm of the Academy of Sciences , most of the concern about the environmental effects of wind generators has focused on birds , but the report 's statistics showed that wind turbines hardly make a dent in the bird population , which , it noted , faced greater danger from cats and other foes .
In the United States in 2003 , wind generators accounted for only three - thousandths of 1 percent of bird killings -- no more than 37,000 birds .
That same year , possibly as many as a billion birds died in collisions with buildings , and electrical power lines may have accounted for more than a billion more deaths , the report said .
And domestic cats were responsible for the demise of an estimated hundreds of millions of songbirds and other species every year .
That aside , the report expressed concern about possible impacts from wind turbines on local bird populations , especially peregrine falcons and other raptors that are attracted to windy areas where the generators are likely to exist , and called for additional study .
Raptors " are lower in abundance than many other bird species , have symbolic and emotional value to many Americans , and are protected by federal and state laws , " the report noted .
The scientists ' biggest concern was reserved for bats .
Recent analysis of bat kills amidst wind stations in the middle Atlantic states revealed more victims than were expected .
The species impact could be significant partly because of an unrelated " decline in the populations of several species of bats in the eastern United States , " the report said .
In the eastern United States , up to 41 bats are killed annually for every megawatt of wind energy generated along forested ridge tops , the report said .
In Midwestern and Western states , the number is lower , no more than 9 dead bats per megawatt .
Unfortunately , poor statistics about the size of bat populations -- which are notoriously more elusive than birds -- make it hard to estimate how severely such kills affect bat populations , the report said .
The panel of scientists , chaired by botanist - ecologist Professor Paul Risser of the University of Oklahoma , cited 11 hypotheses for why bats are attracted to wind generators .
Among the more unusual possibilities is that the machines generate sounds , heat and electromagnetic fields that lure the creatures .
Or maybe curiosity killed the bat : " Because bats are curious animals , they may be killed as they explore novel objects in their environment , " the report said .
On the cheerful side , the report noted that to date , no evidence exists that a single member of an endangered bat species has been kayoed by a wind generator .
But , the scientists added , the statistics may not be complete , because when researchers sought dead bats around wind machines , bat corpses may have been missed or already absconded by predators .
The report calls for additional research into the problem , including the hypothesis that newer wind machines -- say , those with fewer but longer rotors -- will kill fewer birds and bats .
Swedish authorities have dropped the charges they brought against the Karlskrona ( Sweden ) municipality head of culture , who last year openly admitted to file sharing and encouraged others to follow .
The decision suggests a divine judgement on the thorny issue of file - sharing - his computer was struck by lightning and cannot be examined .
Or at least that is what Ivar Wenster told the police .
" They laughed when I told them , " he told Swedish site The Local .
According to Wenster his computer completely burnt out this summer .
" It was my children 's and wife 's pc too . "
Last year Wenster openly admitted in an article in Blekinge Läns Tidning that he downloads music from the internet without paying for it shortly after the raids on The Pirate Bay , one of the world 's largest sources of unauthorised copies of films and music .
" There 's a fundamental hypocrisy around these issues , " he argued .
He also encouraged others with established positions in society to reveal that they 're file sharing , in order to make the industry “ rethink its position ” .
When downloads became illegal in Sweden in July 2005 , Wenster immediately reported himself to the police , hoping it would lead to discussion .
He risked two years in jail under the new Swedish copyright laws .
Despite the tradegy with his PC , Wenster is determined to keep file sharing on the agenda . ®
Just like physical servers , Virtual Machines created with VMWare Virtual Server , may eventually run out of available disk space .
With physical servers , the solution is to add more hard disks and move data or use third party tools to resize the partition .
With Virtual Machines , you could also add virtual disks , but if you need to resize the partition , one solution is to use VMWare Server built - in command line utility called vmware - vdiskmanager , that can create , rename , defragment , shrink and expand virtual disks .
To expand an existing partition , the Virtual Machine must be shutdown and powered off .
The vmware - vdiskmanager utility resides in the directory that VMWare server was installed .
On my install , it is located at C : \Program Files \VMware \VMware Server .

Turkey and the EU
SIR – Despite being a staunch and informed supporter of Turkey 's full membership in the European Union , you seem now to conclude that Turkey is moving away from Europe ( “ Flying in the wrong direction ” , May 6th ) .
I very much disagree .
A comparison with only four years ago would go a long way in explaining how Turkey has in fact been moving into the core of Europe .
Just consider how many taboos have disappeared from the scene in Turkey .
The acquis of the EU is being adopted , and our accession process has so far been much less problematic than expected by some .
The European Commission has praised the performance of our team .
Additionally , we are creating and sustaining this dynamism on the heels of one of the most successful economic stories of our time .
Turkey has grown by no less than 35 % in cumulative terms in the last four years , substantially decreasing the difference in economic performance that exists between it and the EU .
Turkey 's commitment to the process of accession is as firm as ever .
Notwithstanding a certain reticence we encounter in parts of Europe , those who desire to see Turkey fully integrated in Europe are more steadfast .
In fact , I see your newspaper as being at the forefront of that effort , as you end your analysis on the right note , by wisely calling on Europe 's leaders to reassure Turkey .
I hope your call will be heeded .

Trade and Brazil
SIR – It is a factual error to assert that Brazil 's decision “ to stress relations with countries in Africa , the Middle East and Asia ” has yielded “ meagre results ” ( “ The diminishing of Brazil ” , May 13th ) .
Between 2002 and 2005 Brazilian exports to Africa rose by 153 % and imports from Africa by 149 % .
With the Middle East the increases were 84 % and 75 % respectively , and with Asia 111 % in both cases .
The total value of Brazil 's exports to these regions rose from $ 13.4 billion to $ 28.8 billion , while imports increased from $ 12.1 billion to $ 26 billion .
Brazil 's total exports in this period virtually doubled ( from $ 60.3 billion to $ 118.3 billion ) , due mainly to the expansion in trade with the developing world .
These countries absorbed 43 % of Brazilian exports in 2002 , but by 2005 the figure had risen to 53 % .

SIR – Is the root of America 's problems at home and abroad truly “ incompetent execution ” on the part of its current president ( “ Axis of feeble ” , May 13th ) ?
I think not .
We Americans gave up on the myth of a single , competent ruler over 200 years ago .
Our problem is a feeble , incompetent Congress that has shirked its responsibility to ensure that the executive branch of government does not become too powerful .
What we Americans need is not a strong John McCain or Hillary Clinton .
We simply need our Congress back .

SIR – George Bush and Tony Blair may have had their day , but they set in motion a series of events that cannot and should not be reversed .
The events of September 11th have defined the 21st century in the same way that the shot heard around the world in 1914 defined the 20th century .
Mr Bush and Mr Blair looked to the future , did n't like what they saw and decided to do something about it .

SIR – You suggest that St Petersburg “ rivals Moscow as the capital of race hatred ” in Russia ( “ Playing a dangerous game ” , May 13th ) .
As anyone who has spent time in the more remote parts of Russia will attest , Moscow and St Petersburg are by far the most tolerant and cosmopolitan cities in Russia .
Even though they are less well documented , the levels of xenophobia in places like Novokuznetsk and Voronezh make Moscow seem like a Slavic version of San Francisco for groups at risk .

SIR – There is nothing particularly forward - looking about Jimmy Iovine 's defence of a flat rate of 99 cents per song ( Face value , May 6th ) .
By siding with Apple against the other major labels on variable pricing for music online , Mr Iovine may well be shooting himself in the foot .
For the first time , the music industry is in a position to maximise revenue with megastar releases selling at a higher price than the music of lesser - known artists .
In the offline world , competition between retailers has pushed prices down to a uniform low level .
With Apple 's iTunes becoming almost a single point of sale for online music , variable pricing could , at last , help the recording industry by better reflecting demand .
Even if that move proves somewhat unpopular with younger consumers , research by IPSOS and others suggests that the online market is being colonised in droves by older folks .

A Googly
SIR – Google seems to be following the same line Ronald Reagan took with the Russians in the 1980s ( “ Is Google the new Microsoft ? ” , May 13th ) .
Reagan speeded up the break - up of the Soviet Union by forcing it to spend beyond its means on weaponry to defend against perceived , but actually unreal , threats such as the Star Wars programme .
In much the same way , Google is throwing up many cheap - but - flashy initiatives that force Microsoft to spend huge sums in order to contain perceived , but probably illusory , market threats .
Can we not anticipate the same outcome : the break - up of software 's acknowledged evil empire and the emergence of its captive technologies into the world of fair competition ?

Daniel Tammet is an autistic savant .
He can perform mind - boggling mathematical calculations at breakneck speeds .
But unlike other savants , who can perform similar feats , Tammet can describe how he does it .
He speaks seven languages and is even devising his own language .
Now scientists are asking whether his exceptional abilities are the key to unlock the secrets of autism .
Interview by Richard Johnson
Daniel Tammet is talking .
As he talks , he studies my shirt and counts the stitches .
Ever since the age of three , when he suffered an epileptic fit , Tammet has been obsessed with counting .
Now he is 26 , and a mathematical genius who can figure out cube roots quicker than a calculator and recall pi to 22,514 decimal places .
He also happens to be autistic , which is why he can't drive a car , wire a plug , or tell right from left .
He lives with extraordinary ability and disability .
Tammet is calculating 377 multiplied by 795 .
Actually , he is n't " calculating " : there is nothing conscious about what he is doing .
He arrives at the answer instantly .
Since his epileptic fit , he has been able to see numbers as shapes , colours and textures .
The number two , for instance , is a motion , and five is a clap of thunder .
" When I multiply numbers together , I see two shapes .
The image starts to change and evolve , and a third shape emerges .
That 's the answer .
It 's mental imagery .
It 's like maths without having to think . "
Tammet is a " savant " , an individual with an astonishing , extraordinary mental ability .
An estimated 10 % of the autistic population - and an estimated 1 % of the non-autistic population - have savant abilities , but no one knows exactly why .
A number of scientists now hope that Tammet might help us to understand better .
Professor Allan Snyder , from the Centre for the Mind at the Australian National University in Canberra , explains why Tammet is of particular , and international , scientific interest .
" Savants ca n't usually tell us how they do what they do , " says Snyder .
" It just comes to them .
Daniel can .
He describes what he sees in his head .
That 's why he 's exciting .
He could be the Rosetta Stone . "
There are many theories about savants .
Snyder , for instance , believes that we all possess the savant 's extraordinary abilities - it is just a question of us learning how to access them .
" Savants have usually had some kind of brain damage .
Whether it's an onset of dementia later in life , a blow to the head or , in the case of Daniel , an epileptic fit .
And it's that brain damage which creates the savant .
I think that it 's possible for a perfectly normal person to have access to these abilities , so working with Daniel could be very instructive . "
Scans of the brains of autistic savants suggest that the right hemisphere might be compensating for damage in the left hemisphere .
While many savants struggle with language and comprehension ( skills associated primarily with the left hemisphere ) , they often have amazing skills in mathematics and memory ( primarily right hemisphere skills ) .
Typically , savants have a limited vocabulary , but there is nothing limited about Tammet 's vocabulary .
Tammet is creating his own language , strongly influenced by the vowel and image - rich languages of northern Europe .
( He already speaks French , German , Spanish , Lithuanian , Icelandic and Esperanto . )
The vocabulary of his language - " Mänti " , meaning a type of tree - reflects the relationships between different things .
The word " ema " , for instance , translates as " mother " , and " ela " is what a mother creates : " life " .
" Päike " is " sun " , and " päive " is what the sun creates : " day " .
Tammet hopes to launch Mänti in academic circles later this year , his own personal exploration of the power of words and their inter-relationship .
Professor Simon Baron - Cohen , director of the Autism Research Centre ( ARC ) at Cambridge University , is interested in what Mänti might teach us about savant ability .
" I know of other savants who also speak a lot of languages , " says Baron - Cohen .
" But it 's rare for them to be able to reflect on how they do it - let alone create a language of their own . "
The ARC team has started scanning Tammet 's brain to find out if there are modules ( for number , for example , or for colour , or for texture ) that are connected in a way that is different from most of us .
" It 's too early to tell , but we hope it might throw some light on why we do n't all have savant abilities . "
Last year Tammet broke the European record for recalling pi , the mathematical constant , to the furthest decimal point .
He found it easy , he says , because he did n't even have to " think " .
To him , pi is n't an abstract set of digits ; it 's a visual story , a film projected in front of his eyes .
He learnt the number forwards and backwards and , last year , spent five hours recalling it in front of an adjudicator .
He wanted to prove a point .
" I memorised pi to 22,514 decimal places , and I am technically disabled .
I just wanted to show people that disability need n't get in the way . "
Tammet is softly spoken , and shy about making eye contact , which makes him seem younger than he is .
He lives on the Kent coast , but never goes near the beach - there are too many pebbles to count .
The thought of a mathematical problem with no solution makes him feel uncomfortable .
Trips to the supermarket are always a chore .
" There 's too much mental stimulus .
I have to look at every shape and texture .
Every price , and every arrangement of fruit and vegetables .
So instead of thinking , 'What cheese do I want this week ? ' , I 'm just really uncomfortable . "
Tammet has never been able to work 9 to 5 .
It would be too difficult to fit around his daily routine .
For instance , he has to drink his cups of tea at exactly the same time every day .
Things have to happen in the same order : he always brushes his teeth before he has his shower .
" I have tried to be more flexible , but I always end up feeling more uncomfortable .
Retaining a sense of control is really important .
I like to do things in my own time , and in my own style , so an office with targets and bureaucracy just would n't work . "
Instead , he has set up a business on his own , at home , writing email courses in language learning , numeracy and literacy for private clients .
It has had the fringe benefit of keeping human interaction to a minimum .
It also gives him time to work on the verb structures of Mänti .
Few people on the streets have recognised Tammet since his pi record attempt .
But , when a documentary about his life is broadcast on Channel 5 later this year , all that will change .
" The highlight of filming was to meet Kim Peek , the real - life character who inspired the film Rain Man .
Before I watched Rain Man , I was frightened .
As a nine - year - old schoolboy , you do n't want people to point at the screen and say , ' That 's you . '
But I watched it , and felt a real connection .
Getting to meet the real - life Rain Man was inspirational . "
Peek was shy and introspective , but he sat and held Tammet 's hand for hours .
" We shared so much - our love of key dates from history , for instance .
And our love of books .
As a child , I regularly took over a room in the house and started my own lending library .
I would separate out fiction and non-fiction , and then alphabetise them all .
I even introduced a ticketing system .
I love books so much .
I 've read more books than anyone else I know .
So I was delighted when Kim wanted to meet in a library . "
Peek can read two pages simultaneously , one with each eye .
He can also recall , in exact detail , the 7,600 books he has read .
When he is at home in Utah , he spends afternoons at the Salt Lake City public library , memorising phone books and address directories .
" He is such a lovely man , " says Tammet .
" Kim says , ' You do n't have to be handicapped to be different - everybody 's different ' .
And he 's right . "
Like Peek , Tammet will read anything and everything , but his favourite book is a good dictionary , or the works of GK Chesterton .
" With all those aphorisms , " he says , " Chesterton was the Groucho Marx of his day . "
Tammet is also a Christian , and likes the fact that Chesterton addressed some complex religious ideas .
" The other thing I like is that , judging by the descriptions of his home life , I reckon Chesterton was a savant .
He could n't dress himself , and would always forget where he was going .
His poor wife . "
Autistic savants have displayed a wide range of talents , from reciting all nine volumes of Grove 's Dictionary Of Music to measuring exact distances with the naked eye .
The blind American savant Leslie Lemke played Tchaikovsky 's Piano Concerto No1 , after he heard it for the first time , and he never had so much as a piano lesson .
And the British savant Stephen Wiltshire was able to draw a highly accurate map of the London skyline from memory after a single helicopter trip over the city .
Even so , Tammet could still turn out to be the more significant .
He was born on January 31 1979 .
He smiles as he points out that 31 , 19 , 79 and 1979 are all prime numbers - it 's a kind of sign .
He was actually born with another surname , which he prefers to keep private , but decided to change it by deed poll .
It did n't fit with the way he saw himself .
" I first saw ' Tammet ' online .
It means oak tree in Estonian , and I liked that association .
Besides , I 've always had a love of Estonian .
Such a vowel rich language . "
As a baby , he banged his head against the wall and cried constantly .
Nobody knew what was wrong .
His mother was anxious , and would swing him to sleep in a blanket .
She breastfed him for two years .
The only thing the doctors could say was that perhaps he was understimulated .
Then , one afternoon when he was playing with his brother in the living room , he had an epileptic fit .
" I was given medication - round blue tablets - to control my seizures , and told not to go out in direct sunlight .
I had to visit the hospital every month for regular blood tests .
I hated those tests , but I knew they were necessary .
To make up for it , my father would always buy me a cup of squash to drink while we sat in the waiting room .
It was a worrying time because my Dad 's father had epilepsy , and actually died of it , in the end .
They were thinking , ' This is the end of Daniel 's life ' . "
Tammet 's mother was a secretarial assistant , and his father a steelplate worker .
" They both left school without qualifications , but they made us feel special - all nine of us .
As the oldest of nine , I suppose it 's fair to say I 've always felt special . "
Even if his younger brothers and sisters could throw and catch better than him , swim better , kick a ball better , Daniel was always the oldest .
" They loved me because I was their big brother and I could read them stories . "
He remembers being given a Ladybird book called Counting when he was four .
" When I looked at the numbers I ' saw ' images .
It felt like a place I could go where I really belonged .
That was great .
I went to this other country whenever I could .
I would sit on the floor in my bedroom and just count .
I did n't notice that time was passing .
It was only when my Mum shouted up for dinner , or someone knocked at my door , that I would snap out of it . "
One day his brother asked him a sum .
" He asked me to multiply something in my head - like ' What is 82 x 82 x 82 x 82 ? '
I just looked at the floor and closed my eyes .
My back went very straight and I made my hands into fists .
But after five or 10 seconds , the answer just flowed out of my mouth .
He asked me several others , and I got every one right .
My parents did n't seem surprised .
And they never put pressure on me to perform for the neighbours .
They knew I was different , but wanted me to have a normal life as far as possible . "
Tammet could see the car park of his infant school from his bedroom window , which made him feel safe .
" I loved assembly because we got to sing hymns .
The notes formed a pattern in my head , just like the numbers did . "
The other children did n't know what to make of him , and would tease him .
The minute the bell went for playtime he would rush off .
" I went to the playground , but not to play .
The place was surrounded by trees .
While the other children were playing football , I would just stand and count the leaves . "
As Tammet grew older , he developed an obsessive need to collect - everything from conkers to newspapers .
" I remember seeing a ladybird for the first time , " he says .
" I loved it so much , I went round searching every hedge and every leaf for more .
I collected hundreds , and took them to show the teacher .
He was amazed , and asked me to get on with some assignment .
While I was busy he instructed a classmate to take the tub outside and let the ladybirds go .
I was so upset that I cried when I found out .
He did n't understand my world . "
Tammet may have been teased at school , but his teachers were always protective .
" I think my parents must have had a word with them , so I was pretty much left alone . "
He found it hard to socialise with anyone outside the family , and , with the advent of adolesence , his shyness got worse .
After leaving school with three A - levels ( History , French and German , all grade Bs ) , he decided he wanted to teach - only not the predictable , learn - by - rote type of teaching .
For a start , he went to teach in Lithuania , and he worked as a volunteer .
" Because I was there of my own free will , I was given a lot of leeway .
The times of the classes were n't set in stone , and the structures were all of my own making .
It was also the first time I was introduced as ' Daniel ' rather than ' the guy who can do weird stuff in his head ' .
It was such a pleasant relief . "
Later , he returned home to live with his parents , and found work as a maths tutor .
He met the great love of his life , a software engineer called Neil , online .
It began , as these things do , with emailed pictures , but ended up with a face - to - face meeting .
" Because I can't drive , Neil offered to pick me up at my parents ' house , and drive me back to his house in Kent .
He was silent all the way back .
I thought , ' Oh dear , this is n't going well ' .
Just before we got to his house , he stopped the car .
He reached over and pulled out a bouquet of flowers .
I only found out later that he was quiet because he likes to concentrate when he 's driving . "
Neil is shy , like Tammet .
They live , happily , on a quiet cul - de-sac .
The only aspect of Tammet 's autism that causes them problems is his lack of empathy .
" There 's a saying in Judaism , if somebody has a relative who has hanged themselves , do n't ask them where you should hang your coat .
I need to remember that .
Like the time I kept quizzing a friend of Neil 's who had just lost her mother .
I was asking her all these questions about faith and death .
But that 's down to my condition - no taboos . "
When he is n't working , Tammet likes to hang out with his friends on the church quiz team .
His knowledge of popular culture lets him down , but he 's a shoo - in when it comes to the maths questions .
" I do love numbers , " he says .
" It is n't only an intellectual or aloof thing that I do .
I really feel that there is an emotional attachment , a caring for numbers .
I think this is a human thing - in the same way that a poet humanises a river or a tree through metaphor , my world gives me a sense of numbers as personal .
It sounds silly , but numbers are my friends . "
Speaking of Jenny McCarthy , Carmen seems to have gotten a little wet like Jenny did on Howard Stern and Fergie did in concert .
However , to Carmen 's defense , she was seen leaving a salon so maybe she just got grossly sweaty .
BTW , we have not seen a public outing with Carmen and Dave recently .
I hope the splitting rumors are not true .
2006 seems to be more of a year about weddings and babies unlike last year 's long list of break - ups and divorces .
Lots more pics of Carmen so read more

“ We do not have any evidence at this time that they are connected directly to any other international terrorist movement around the world , ” Mr. Christie said .
“ But clearly they used the Internet to obtain this jihadist material , which they used as both educational and inspirational for their cause . ”
The complaint included an affidavit from John J. Ryan , a special agent with the F.B.I. , which said that a cooperating witness infiltrated the group and last year recorded some of their conversations .
During one of those meetings , the witness recorded Mr. Shnewer as saying that he , Mr. Tatar , Mr. Duka , Eljvir Duka and Shain Duka were part of a group that was planning to attack a United States military base , and specifically mentioned Fort Dix .
At other meetings they watched videos of American soldiers being attacked overseas and footage of Osama bin Laden , officials said .
“ During one meeting they watched the blowing off of the arm of a United States marine and the room burst out into laughter , ” Mr. Christie said .
“ These are the types of people we are dealing with . ”
In the complaint , Mr. Shnewer was quoted as saying that they could kill “ at least 100 soldiers ” using rocket - propelled grenades and other weapons , and that the witness was urged to help lead the attack because he had prior experience in the Egyptian military .
They would use a map procured by Mr. Tatar , who used to deliver pizza there , the affidavit said , and the attack would begin with a strike that would cause a power outage .

“ They wanted to do this to make it easier for them to kill as many American soldiers as possible , ” Mr. Christie said today .
Mr. Shnewer also conducted surveillance of other facilities , including the Army base at Fort Monmouth , N.J. ; the Dover Air Base in Delaware , and the Coast Guard building in Philadelphia , officials said .
Dritan Duka , Eljvir Duka and Shain Duka collected weapons including handguns , shotguns and semi-automatic assault weapons , and trained on firearms in the Poconos region of Pennsylvania .
The three men and Mr. Shnewer reviewed terrorist training videos .
In addition , he and Dritan Duka ordered AK - 47 machine guns .
Another witness recorded a conversation in which Mr. Tatar was said to have wanted to join the Army so he could kill American soldiers from the “ inside , ” the statement said .
All the while , as the men made trips to the Poconos and trained and planned for the attacks , they had no idea they were under surveillance , Mr. Christie said .

AUSTIN , TEX . —
Even if you try to look past the eight - metre - high chain - link fence , beyond the scores of uniformed guards patrolling the perimeter and away from the cameras , metal detectors and lasers , there is n't the slightest evidence of children inside the T. Don Hutto Family Detention Center .
No one is playing outside ; there are no sounds of laughter .
But inside the thick , whitewashed walls of this former maximum - security prison in the heart of Texas are about 170 children — including a nine - year - old Canadian boy named Kevin .
Call it international limbo .
Detained by U.S. Customs officials after their flight to Toronto made an unscheduled stop on American soil nearly four weeks ago , Kevin and his Iranian parents , Majid and Masomeh , feel they are being held hostage not only by the physical parameters of Hutto , but by the politics of nationality .
“ We can't go home because I am Canadian but my parents are not , ” Kevin said in a telephone interview with The Globe and Mail — no personal interviews have been granted .
Majid and Masomeh — they prefer their last name not be used — initially fled Iran for Canada in January , 1995 , to seek political asylum .
Majid did odd jobs , eventually becoming manager of an east Toronto pizza parlour , paying the rent for their one - bedroom apartment .
In 1997 , their only son , Kevin , was born .
“ For the first time , I was happy , ” Majid said from the Hutto detention facility .
“ I had my family with me — it 's the only family I have — we did n't have any problems and we lived happy in Toronto . ”
Kevin attended a Toronto school until Grade 3 .
Meanwhile , his parents were seeking refugee status , based on fear of persecution in Iran , but their application was denied and , in December , 2005 , the family of three was deported .
Upon their arrival in Tehran , Majid said he was taken away from his family to a prison cell .
For three months , he was detained , beaten and tortured , he said .
When he was released , the three were reunited , and , with the help of friends and relatives , they connected with a people smuggler in Tehran .
“ I pay him $ 40,000 to [ get us ] to Canada .
It included everything : fake passports , tickets .
He got $ 20,000 in Iran , and $ 20,000 in Turkey . ”
Carrying Greek passports — which do not require visas for entry into Canada — they travelled to Guyana , where they eventually boarded a Toronto - bound plane .
Lorne Waldman , an immigration lawyer in Toronto , said that because of the heightened security measures put in place after Sept. 11 , 2001 , people smugglers have found alternate routes to get into Canada .
“ We see people coming in with very exotic and complex and convoluted routes , ” he said .
“ Moscow was one .
Guyana is another ... because the smugglers believe it was a route that was subjected to less scrutiny . ”
It was that belief that got Kevin and his parents onto a Zoom Airlines chartered , non -stop flight from Georgetown to Toronto .
No one could have anticipated what happened next .
“ The woman sitting two seats behind me , she kept running to the washroom for vomiting .
They put oxygen on her , and tell us to stay in our seats .
They just said we have to divert to another city because of an emergency landing . ”
A woman had suffered a heart attack and died on board .
After landing in Puerto Rico , everyone was told to disembark while emergency crew removed the body .
“ They say we have to pass immigration , and they say because we have Greek passport , you need to get a visa for United States .
I said no , our ticket is to Toronto , we have no plan to come here . ”
After being held in Puerto Rico for five days , the family was brought to Taylor , Tex. , about 45 kilometres northeast of Austin , to the main U.S. family detention centre for immigrants .
“ My luggage go to Toronto , ” said Majid , 42 , “ and we have to stay here . ”
Now , the three of them are locked inside the centre that , U.S. refugee advocates recently alleged , features inadequate medical care , lack of privacy and abusive behaviour by staff toward the green - uniformed detainees .
Everyone must wake up by 5:30 a.m. to take showers .
They get 15 minutes to eat each meal .
Everyone must be in bed by 9:30 p.m. , when laser - triggered alarms are set to detect if anyone gets up .
“ The day is very regimented , ” said Barbara Hines , a law professor at the University of Texas who runs an immigration clinic with her students — the only way many of the detainees get representation .
“ This is a prison .
They have a head count three times a day where they have to be in their cells for an hour to be counted down . ”
At one point , Majid walked into the room where Kevin and his mother sleep to help them fix a broken bed .
“ They were told that if he violated rules , because the father 's not allowed into that room , the family would be separated , ” Ms. Hines said .
“ One of the things the detainees have reported to us is the threat of separation as a means of discipline . ”
The only other detention facility that holds families is in Pennsylvania , she said — but that used to be a nursing home , not a prison .
“ No amount of softening it [ Hutto ] up , as the government says , is going to change the fact that this is a secure prison facility , not a family residential centre , ” she said .
But an official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement , Jamie Zuieback , said the “ residential , non-secure setting at Hutto ” was opened in May to keep families together .
Kevin , meanwhile , has lost six pounds in the past two weeks because he has n't been eating , his father said .
Nearly all of the meals come from cans , Kevin complained .
“ Beans , beef , sometimes they give rice .
But it 's all garbage . ”
Kevin goes to school for four hours a day , of which only one is instructional .
He said that since he left Toronto , he has n't gone to a real school .
“ My biggest wish is to go to Canada and be free , to go to my school , go for my books , ” Kevin said , his father 's voice audible in the background .
“ I want to be safe with me and my parents , and see my teachers and my friends again . ”
When the consular officer at the Canadian consulate in Dallas visited the family at Hutto two weeks ago , Majid said , “ he asked about our rooms and our food .
Just regarding here .
I asked him what he can do for us , and he said , ‘ I do n't promise now .
But we can help Kevin , not you . ' ”
David Marshall , a consulate spokesman , said that he could not talk about the case , citing the Privacy Act .
Alain Cacchione , a spokesman for Foreign Affairs Canada , would not comment either .
But Audrey Macklin , a professor of immigration at the University of Toronto , said that this case highlights the asymmetry of Canadian citizenship .
“ We say that if adults are Canadian citizens , then they can somehow confer protection of their citizenship on their children .
But we do n't allow the reverse , ” she said from Toronto .
“ Instead , what we do is render , in effect , the Canadian citizenship of the child null , because he can't exercise it [ and sponsor his parents ] .
It 's as if his Canadian citizenship does n't exist or is worthless because his parents do n't have it . ”
She said that if the Canadian government wanted to protect Kevin , it could .
“ If protecting this child means letting the parents into Canada , is that a price worth paying ?
Well , I think we should seriously consider that . ”
If they were allowed back into Canada , Prof .
Macklin said , they could seek what is called a pre-risk removal assessment based on “ new facts about what happened in Iran when they were deported . ”
Above all else , Kevin , Majid and Masomeh say they want to live in Canada .
“ We want to be free and safe , ” Majid said .
“ Our plan was to go to Toronto , Canada , because it 's my son 's home and our home for the past few years .
We have nothing there , but we were there for 10 years and it was good . ”
Updated : 9 - Year - Old Canadian Citizen and Iranian Parents Arrive in Toronto After Six Weeks in Texas Immigration Jail
May 7 , 2006 -- --
The best - selling book " Freakonomics " examines the economics of some ordinary life situations .
If these situations involve sex , the analysis might be better termed Sexonomics .
One of the first practitioners of sexonomics was Nobel Prize - winning economist Gary Becker , whose 1970s paper " A Theory of Marriage " pushed the economic analysis of sex into the purview of his fellow economists .
More recently , two other economists , Lena Edlund of Columbia University and Evelyn Korn of Eberhard - Karls - Universitat Tubingen , have published an intriguing paper , " A Theory of Prostitution , " ( link : http://www.iies.su.se/seminars/papers/Edlund.pdf) in the Journal of Political Economy .
Making simplistic but more or less plausible assumptions and applying the tools of economic model - making , they searched for the answer to a puzzle :
Why is it that prostitution is so relatively well - paid ?
Before getting to why this is , they document that in diverse cultures and over many centuries , prostitutes have indeed made much more , sometimes several multiples more , than comparably ( un ) skilled women would make in more prosaic occupations .
From medieval France and imperial Japan to present - day Los Angeles and Buddhist Thailand , this income differential has persisted , although its size depends on various factors .
( That prostitutes generally make considerably more money than their skills would warrant may be obscured by biased sampling .
Studies of prostitutes often survey those in trouble with the law or on drugs and hence not earning what they might .
By analogy , if studies of marriage were frequently conducted at shelters for battered wives , people would probably soon develop a more jaundiced view of marriage as well . )
Prostitution Diminishes Marriage Chances
Developing the consequences of their mathematical model , Edlund and Korn argue that the primary reason for the income differential is not the risk sometimes associated with the practice of prostitution but rather that prostitutes greatly diminish their chances for marriage by virtue of their occupation .
Men generally do n't want to marry ( ex ) prostitutes , and so women must be relatively well - compensated in order to forgo the opportunity to marry .
Employing market concepts , doing some calculus and assuming that " women sell and men buy , " the authors also conclude that prostitution generally declines as men's incomes increase .
Wives and prostitutes are competing " commodities " ( in the reductionist view of economists , that is ) , but wives are distinctly superior in that they can produce children that are socially recognized as coming from the father .
Thus , if men have more money , they tend to buy the superior good and , at least when wives and prostitutes come from the same pool of women , tend to buy ( rent ) the cheaper good less frequently .
More obvious perhaps is that prostitution generally declines in areas where women 's incomes and opportunities are greater .
Putting these two tendencies together suggests that if one wishes to reduce prostitution , increasing the incomes of both men and women is likely to be more effective than imposing legal penalties .
Sex Ratios , Foreign Prostitutes and Cultural Factors
Another consequence of the authors ' model is that a high ratio of men to women tends to increase prostitution 's relative profitability ( versus marriage ) .
If the surplus of men over women is temporary , say , because of war or upheaval , then the surplus usually leads to an even greater incentive to prostitution .
As permanent residents in a location , men are potential participants in both the marriage market and the sex markets , whereas if they 're visitors , only the latter market is generally available and the supply of prostitutes and their incomes rise .
The authors cite examples from 12th century crusaders to modern sex tourists .
The model also predicts that how much a woman damages her chances to marry by becoming a prostitute depends on how likely it is that she 'll be exposed as one .
The likelihood shrinks if the woman leaves home and migrates to a different part of the country or to a different country altogether .
This would also explain why foreign prostitutes are likely to be cheaper than domestic ones .
More generally , the abundance of foreign prostitutes should n't come as a surprise .
Immigrants generally have difficulty finding employment and , except at the high end of the scale , prostitution does not place much of a premium on language skills .
As in other parts of the economy , globalization is controversial and is one reason the number of women trafficked for sexual purposes is exaggerated .
( It is considerably smaller than the number of people trafficked for nonsexual labor . )
There are good reasons -- from academic studies to the sheer ubiquity of prostitutes -- to believe that this heinous practice is relatively isolated and that only a small fraction of prostitutes are coerced into prostitution .
One last prediction the model makes is that the income differential paid to prostitutes will rise with the status the culture accords wives .
That is , if wives are valued highly , would - be prostitutes are giving up a lot by becoming prostitutes and will require more money to do so .
And if wives have few privileges , would - be prostitutes are n't giving up much to become prostitutes and thus need less inducement to do so .
Cultural tolerance , of course , is a determinant not only of the income differential but also of the number of women who become prostitutes .
Compare , for example , Thailand and Afghanistan .
Bottom Line
Like any statistical model , this one ignores the diversity of real people and the complexities of love and pleasure , changing social mores , et cetera .
Still , once all its equations have been solved , a simple fact remains :
Most women enter prostitution for the money .
This being so , legalizing it , regulating it ( strictly enforcing laws against pimping , child prostitution , public nuisance and so forth ) and improving the economic prospects for women seem to me a greatly preferable approach to it than moralistic denunciation .

In the light of evidence that Haskell programs compiled by GHC exhibit large numbers of mispredicted branches on modern processors , we re-examine the “ tagless ” aspect of the STG - machine that GHC uses as its evaluation model .
We propose two tagging strategies : a simple strategy called semi-tagging that seeks to avoid one common source of unpredictable indirect jumps , and a more complex strategy called dynamic pointer - tagging that uses the spare low bits in a pointer to encode information about the pointed - to object .
Both of these strategies have been implemented and exhaustively measured in the context of a production compiler , GHC , and the paper contains detailed descriptions of the implementations .
Our measurements demonstrate significant performance improvements ( 14 % for dynamic pointer - tagging with only a 2 % increase in code size ) , and we further demonstrate that much of the improvement can be attributed to the elimination of mispredicted branch instructions .
As part of our investigations we also discovered that one optimisation in the STG - machine , vectored - returns , is no longer worthwhile and we explain why .
HER name is MARIE , and her impressive set of skills comes in handy in a nursing home .
MARIE can walk around under her own power .
She can distinguish among similar - looking objects , such as different bottles of medicine , and has a delicate enough touch to work with frail patients .
MARIE can interpret a range of facial expressions and gestures , and respond in ways that suggest compassion .
Although her language skills are not ideal , she can recognise speech and respond clearly .
Above all , she is inexpensive .
Unfortunately for MARIE , however , she has one glaring trait that makes it hard for Japanese patients to accept her : she is a flesh - and - blood human being from the Philippines .
If only she were a robot instead .
Robots , you see , are wonderful creatures , as many a Japanese will tell you .
They are getting more adept all the time , and before too long will be able to do cheaply and easily many tasks that human workers do now .
They will care for the sick , collect the rubbish , guard homes and offices , and give directions on the street .
This is great news in Japan , where the population has peaked , and may have begun shrinking in 2005 .
With too few young workers supporting an ageing population , somebody — or something — needs to fill the gap , especially since many of Japan 's young people will be needed in science , business and other creative or knowledge - intensive jobs .
Many workers from low - wage countries are eager to work in Japan .
The Philippines , for example , has over 350,000 trained nurses , and has been pleading with Japan — which accepts only a token few — to let more in .
Foreign pundits keep telling Japan to do itself a favour and make better use of cheap imported labour .
But the consensus among Japanese is that visions of a future in which immigrant workers live harmoniously and unobtrusively in Japan are pure fancy .
Making humanoid robots is clearly the simple and practical way to go .
Japan certainly has the technology .
It is already the world leader in making industrial robots , which look nothing like pets or people but increasingly do much of the work in its factories .
Japan is also racing far ahead of other countries in developing robots with more human features , or that can interact more easily with people .
A government report released this May estimated that the market for “ service robots ” will reach ¥ 1.1 trillion ( $ 10 billion ) within a decade .
The country showed off its newest robots at a world exposition this summer in Aichi prefecture .
More than 22 m visitors came , 95 % of them Japanese .
The robots stole the show , from the nanny robot that babysits to a Toyota that plays a trumpet .
And Japan 's robots do not confine their talents to controlled environments .
As they gain skills and confidence , robots such as Sony 's QRIO ( pronounced “ curio ” ) and Honda 's ASIMO are venturing to unlikely places .
They have attended factory openings , greeted foreign leaders , and rung the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange .
ASIMO can even take the stage to accept awards .
The friendly face of technology
So Japan will need workers , and it is learning how to make robots that can do many of their jobs .
But the country 's keen interest in robots may also reflect something else : it seems that plenty of Japanese really like dealing with robots .
Few Japanese have the fear of robots that seems to haunt westerners in seminars and Hollywood films .
In western popular culture , robots are often a threat , either because they are manipulated by sinister forces or because something goes horribly wrong with them .
By contrast , most Japanese view robots as friendly and benign .
Robots like people , and can do good .
The Japanese are well aware of this cultural divide , and commentators devote lots of attention to explaining it .
The two most favoured theories , which are assumed to reinforce each other , involve religion and popular culture .
Most Japanese take an eclectic approach to religious beliefs , and the native religion , Shintoism , is infused with animism : it does not make clear distinctions between inanimate things and organic beings .
A popular Japanese theory about robots , therefore , is that there is no need to explain why Japanese are fond of them : what needs explaining , rather , is why westerners allow their Christian hang - ups to get in the way of a good technology .
When Honda started making real progress with its humanoid - robot project , it consulted the Vatican on whether westerners would object to a robot made in man 's image .

Japanese popular culture has also consistently portrayed robots in a positive light , ever since Japan created its first famous cartoon robot , Tetsuwan Atomu , in 1951 .
Its name in Japanese refers to its atomic heart .
Putting a nuclear core into a cartoon robot less than a decade after Hiroshima and Nagasaki might seem an odd way to endear people to the new character .
But Tetsuwan Atomu — being a robot , rather than a human — was able to use the technology for good .
Over the past half century , scores of other Japanese cartoons and films have featured benign robots that work with humans , in some cases even blending with them .
One of the latest is a film called “ Hinokio ” , in which a reclusive boy sends a robot to school on his behalf and uses virtual - reality technology to interact with classmates .
Among the broad Japanese public , it is a short leap to hope that real - world robots will soon be able to pursue good causes , whether helping to detect landmines in war - zones or finding and rescuing victims of disasters .
The prevailing view in Japan is that the country is lucky to be uninhibited by robophobia .
With fewer of the complexes that trouble many westerners , so the theory goes , Japan is free to make use of a great new tool , just when its needs and abilities are happily about to converge .
“ Of all the nations involved in such research , ” the Japan Times wrote in a 2004 editorial , “ Japan is the most inclined to approach it in a spirit of fun . ”
These sanguine explanations , however , may capture only part of the story .
Although they are at ease with robots , many Japanese are not as comfortable around other people .
That is especially true of foreigners .
Immigrants cannot be programmed as robots can .
You never know when they will do something spontaneous , ask an awkward question , or use the wrong honorific in conversation .
But , even leaving foreigners out of it , being Japanese , and having always to watch what you say and do around others , is no picnic .
It is no surprise , therefore , that Japanese researchers are forging ahead with research on human interfaces .
For many jobs , after all , lifelike features are superfluous .
A robotic arm can gently help to lift and reposition hospital patients without being attached to a humanoid form .
The same goes for robotic spoons that make it easier for the infirm to feed themselves , power suits that help lift heavy grocery bags , and a variety of machines that watch the house , vacuum the carpet and so on .
Yet the demand for better robots in Japan goes far beyond such functionality .
Many Japanese seem to like robot versions of living creatures precisely because they are different from the real thing .
An obvious example is AIBO , the robotic dog that Sony began selling in 1999 .
The bulk of its sales have been in Japan , and the company says there is a big difference between Japanese and American consumers .
American AIBO buyers tend to be computer geeks who want to hack the robotic dog 's programming and delve in its innards .
Most Japanese consumers , by contrast , like AIBO because it is a clean , safe and predictable pet .
AIBO is just a fake dog .
As the country gets better at building interactive robots , their advantages for Japanese users will multiply .
Hiroshi Ishiguro , a robotocist at Osaka University , cites the example of asking directions .
In Japan , says Mr Ishiguro , people are even more reluctant than in other places to approach a stranger .
Building robotic traffic police and guides will make it easier for people to overcome their diffidence .
Karl MacDorman , another researcher at Osaka , sees similar social forces at work .
Interacting with other people can be difficult for the Japanese , he says , “ because they always have to think about what the other person is feeling , and how what they say will affect the other person . ”
But it is impossible to embarrass a robot , or be embarrassed , by saying the wrong thing .
To understand how Japanese might find robots less intimidating than people , Mr MacDorman has been investigating eye movements , using headsets that monitor where subjects are looking .
One oft - cited myth about Japanese , that they rarely make eye contact , is not really true .
When answering questions put by another Japanese , Mr MacDorman 's subjects made eye contact around 30 % of the time .
But Japanese subjects behave intriguingly when they talk to Mr Ishiguro 's android , ReplieeQ1 .
The android 's face has been modeled on that of a famous newsreader , and sophisticated actuators allow it to mimic her facial movements .
When answering the android 's questions , Mr MacDorman 's Japanese subjects were much more likely to look it in the eye than they were a real person .
Mr MacDorman wants to do more tests , but he surmises that the discomfort many Japanese feel when dealing with other people has something to do with his results , and that they are much more at ease when talking to an android .
Eventually , interactive robots are going to become more common , not just in Japan but in other rich countries as well .
As children and the elderly begin spending time with them , they are likely to develop emotional reactions to such lifelike machines .
That is human nature .
Upon meeting Sony 's QRIO , your correspondent promptly referred to it as “ him ” three times , despite trying to remember that it is just a battery - operated device .
What seems to set Japan apart from other countries is that few Japanese are all that worried about the effects that hordes of robots might have on its citizens .
Nobody seems prepared to ask awkward questions about how it might turn out .
If this bold social experiment produces lots of isolated people , there will of course be an outlet for their loneliness : they can confide in their robot pets and partners .
Only in Japan could this be thought less risky than having a compassionate Filipina drop by for a chat .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Commodities investment guru Jim Rogers stepped into the U.S. subprime fray on Wednesday , predicting a real estate crash that would trigger defaults and spread contagion to emerging markets .

“ You ca n’t believe how bad it ’s going to get before it gets any better , ” the prominent U.S. fund manager told Reuters by telephone from New York .
“ It ’s going to be a disaster for many people who do n’t have a clue about what happens when a real estate bubble pops .
“ It is going to be a huge mess , ” said Rogers , who has put his $ 15 million belle epoque mansion on Manhattan ’s Upper West Side on the market and is planning to move to Asia .
Worries about losses in the U.S. mortgage market have sent stock prices falling in Asia and Europe , with shares in financial services companies falling the most .
Some investors fear the problems of lenders who make subprime loans to people with weak credit histories are spreading to mainstream financial firms and will worsen the U.S. housing slowdown .
“ Real estate prices will go down 40 - 50 percent in bubble areas .
There will be massive defaults .
This time it ’ll be worse because we have n’t had this kind of speculative buying in U.S. history , ” Rogers said .
“ When markets turn from bubble to reality , a lot of people get burned . ”
The fund manager , who co-founded the Quantum Fund with billionaire investor George Soros in the 1970s and has focused on commodities since 1998 , said the crisis would spread to emerging markets which he said now faced a prolonged bear run .
“ When you have a financial crisis , it reverberates in other financial markets , especially in those with speculative excess , ” he said .
“ Right now , there is huge speculative excess in emerging markets around the world .
There will be a lot of money coming out of emerging markets .
“ I ’ve sold out of emerging markets except for China , ” said Rogers , long a prominent China bull .
Even in China , the world ’s fastest expanding economy , Rogers said stocks were overvalued and could go down 30 - 40 percent .
But he added : “ China is one of the few countries in the world where I ’m willing to sit out a 30 - 40 percent decline . ”
The last stock market bubble to burst was the dot - com craze which sparked a crash from March 2000 to October 2002 .
When the last bubble burst in Japan , said Rogers , stock prices went down 85 percent despite the country ’s high savings rate and huge balance of payment surplus .
“ This is the end of the liquidity party , ” said Rogers .
“ Some emerging markets will go down 80 percent , some will go down 50 percent .
Some will most probably collapse . ”
Frederic Arthur ( Fred ) Clark , who had tired of reading obituaries noting other 's courageous battles with this or that disease , wanted it known that he lost his battle as a result of an automobile accident on June 18 , 2006 .
True to Fred 's personal style , his final hours were spent joking with medical personnel while he whimpered , cussed , begged for narcotics and bargained with God to look over his wife and kids .
He loved his family .
His heart beat faster when his wife of 37 years Alice Rennie Clark entered the room and saddened a little when she left .
His legacy was the good works performed by his sons , Frederic Arthur Clark III and Andrew Douglas Clark MD , PhD. , along with Andy 's wife , Sara Morgan Clark .
Fred 's back straightened and chest puffed out when he heard the Star Spangled Banner and his eyes teared when he heard Amazing Grace .
He would n't abide self important tight * censored * .
Always an interested observer of politics , particularly what the process does to its participants , he was amused by politician 's outrage when we lie to them and amazed at what the voters would tolerate .
His final wishes were " throw the bums out and do n't elect lawyers " ( though it seems to make little difference ) .
During his life he excelled at mediocrity .
He loved to hear and tell jokes , especially short ones due to his limited attention span .
He had a life long love affair with bacon , butter , cigars and bourbon .
You always knew what Fred was thinking much to the dismay of his friend and family .
His sons said of Fred , " he was often wrong , but never in doubt " .
When his family was asked what they remembered about Fred , they fondly recalled how Fred never peed in the shower - on purpose .
He died at MCV Hospital and sadly was deprived of his final wish which was to be run over by a beer truck on the way to the liquor store to buy booze for a double date to include his wife , Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter to crash an ACLU cocktail party .
In lieu of flowers , Fred asks that you make a sizable purchase at your local ABC store or Virginia winery ( please , nothing French - the * censored * ) and get rip roaring drunk at home with someone you love or hope to make love to .
Word of caution though , do n't go out in public to drink because of the alcohol related laws our elected officials have passed due to their inexplicable terror at the sight of a MADD lobbyist and overwhelming compulsion to meddle in our lives .
No funeral or service is planned .
However , a party will be held to celebrate Fred 's life .
It will be held in Midlothian , Va. Email [ email protected ] for more information .
Fred 's ashes will be fired from his favorite cannon at a private party on the Great Wicomico River where he had a home for 25 years .
Additionally , all of Fred 's friend ( sic ) will be asked to gather in a phone booth , to be designated in the future , to have a drink and wonder , " Fred who ?

In a landmark ruling Thursday , a federal judge forcefully refused to dismiss a civil liberties group 's lawsuit against AT&T for its alleged complicity in widespread warrantless government surveillance , despite the government 's argument that the suit could reveal state secrets – a rarely used claim that nearly always terminates a lawsuit .
In a 72 - page written ruling ( .pdf ) , U.S. District Court Chief Judge Vaughn Walker rejected the government 's argument that merely allowing the case to proceed would cause critical harm to U.S. national security .
The decision marks a significant victory for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , and puts a rare limitation on the reach of the president 's " state secrets privilege " to sweep alleged illegal government activities under the cloak of national security .
Inside the Secret Room Courtroom Clash !
A federal judge refuses to give AT&T back its internal documents , but orders the EFF not to give them out .
Whistle - Blower 's Precognition
Years before the NSA 's warrantless surveillance program made national headlines , then - AT&T technician Mark Klein suspected his company was colluding with the government to spy on Americans .
Exhibit A ?
Former AT&T technician Mark Klein offers a firsthand account of his alleged discovery of a secret room routing American internet traffic straight to the NSA – and provides documents he says prove his case .
The Ultimate Net Monitoring Tool
A little - known company called Narus makes the packet - inspection technology said to be the basis of the NSA 's internet surveillance .
Here 's how it works .
Plus :
Daily updates from 27B Stroke 6 , the Wired News security and privacy blog .
Walker found that the program was not a secret since " public disclosures by the government and AT&T indicate that AT&T is assisting the government to implement some kind of surveillance program . "
" Dismissing this case at the outset would sacrifice liberty for no apparent enhancement of security , " Walker wrote .
( Disclosure : Wired News has filed a motion to intervene in the case , asking the court to make public evidence , filed under seal , of AT&T 's alleged wiretapping activities . )
The administration has publicly confirmed a December report in The New York Times that revealed the National Security Agency was wiretapping Americans ' overseas phone calls to numbers or people the government suspected might be connected to terrorism , an effort the Bush administration later dubbed the " Terrorist Surveillance Program . "
The NSA is not seeking or obtaining court authorization for the wiretaps .
Under Thursday 's ruling , the lawsuit will continue , allowing the San Francisco - based EFF to begin obtaining documents through discovery from AT&T .
In a legally unprecedented move , the judge also wants to appoint an outside expert with a high - level clearance who can review such evidence to evaluate whether its release would compromise national security .
Walker also denied AT&T 's motions to dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiffs can't prove they were monitored by the program , and that the company can't be sued for helping the government in good faith .
EFF legal director Cindy Cohn applauded the judge 's decision , which came as the Senate Judiciary Committee is preparing to consider a bill that would move all lawsuits over government spying to the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in Washington .
" We think this shows the regular court system can handle these cases , and that as an open and free society , our regular court system should handle these cases , " Cohn said .
Recognizing that his ruling would be controversial , the judge is allowing both AT&T and the government to immediately appeal his ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals .
While both are widely expected to do so , neither announced such plans immediately .
In response to the ruling , AT&T released a statement , which read , in part , " We are reviewing Judge Walker 's order and evaluating possible next steps .
AT&T is fully committed to protecting our customers ' privacy and we would not provide customer information to any government agency except as specifically authorized under the law . "
Department of Justice spokesman Charles Miller said that the government " has made no determination as to what its next move is . "
The EFF 's suit relies heavily on evidence provided by former AT&T technician Mark Klein , who alleges he saw an NSA room in AT&T's San Francisco internet switching station .
Klein provided documents that purportedly show how AT&T siphoned off traffic across its fiber - optic cables into that room .
In May , Wired News published portions of those documents , which it acquired from a source not involved in the litigation .
In addition to denying the government 's motion to dismiss , Walker 's decision also allows AT&T to reveal whether or not the U.S. attorney general provided the company with a letter directing it to cooperate in wiretapping its customers , which could provide the company with a defense against the EFF 's lawsuit under federal wiretapping law .
" If the government 's public disclosures have been truthful , revealing whether AT&T has received a certification to assist in monitoring communication content should not reveal any new information that would assist a terrorist and adversely affect national security , " Walker wrote .
" And if the government has not been truthful , the state secrets privilege should not serve as a shield for its false public statements . "
The ruling was not a complete defeat for the Bush administration .
Noting that the government has n't confirmed stories in the Los Angeles Times and USA Today reporting that AT&T has allowed the NSA to troll through its trillion - record call detail database , the judge ruled that AT&T cannot confirm or deny that it received a letter directing such access , nor can the EFF ask for documents about that program .
Lawyers for each side have until July 31 to advise the judge on the appointment of an outside expert and to suggest candidates , while the next court hearing is scheduled for Aug .

The case is Hepting v. AT&T Corp .
Signing Statement Allows Cronyism to Thrive at FEMA
by TChris
The Constitution empowers the president to veto bills that the legislature enacts .
It does not authorize the president to rewrite legislation .
Untroubled by constitutional or legislative limits on executive power , President Bush again used a signing statement to explain his anticipated disobedience of the proposed law that Congress sent him .
The statement repeatedly asserts that Homeland Security Appropriations
Act " purports to " do certain things .
It " purport[s ] to require congressional committee approval for the execution of a law . "
It " purports to direct the conduct of security and suitability investigations . "
It " vests in the President authority to appoint the Administrator , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate , but purports to limit the qualifications of the pool of persons from whom the President may select the appointee ... "
The president claims that Congress can do none of these things .
Congress did not " purport " to do these things ; Congress did them .
If the president thought Congress passed an unconstitutional bill , he should have vetoed it .
Can our strict constructionist president point to the constitutional language that permits him to ignore limits that Congress places on the executive powers that it enacts , or to deprive Congress of an oversight role in a law 's implementation ?
Charlie Savage at the Boston Globe explains how the president 's power grab works to the detriment of FEMA , and of good government :
Ending two years of silence on his role in the Iraq war , former CIA Director George J. Tenet is using a new book and a barrage of upcoming television appearances to accuse the White House of making him a scapegoat and of ignoring early CIA warnings that Iraq was sinking into chaos .
In a taped interview scheduled to air Sunday on CBS , Tenet said President Bush had made up his mind to invade Iraq long before the CIA director made his infamous Oval Office remark that it was a “ slam - dunk ” case that Saddam Hussein ’s government had banned weapons .
Tenet was even more forceful in his criticism of Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , saying that the two had destroyed his reputation by repeatedly using the “ slam - dunk ” line to pin blame on him for the decision to go to war .
“ It ’s the most despicable thing that ever happened to me , ” Tenet said in the “ 60 Minutes ” interview , according to an excerpt CBS released Thursday .

Speaking about the December 2002 meeting in which he sought to assure President Bush that the evidence against Iraq was solid , Tenet said : “ I ’ll never believe that what happened that day informed the president ’s view or belief of the legitimacy or the timing of this war .
Never . ”
Tenet ’s comments represent a new and potentially politically damaging source of fire in the ongoing battle among Bush administration officials over blame for the Iraq war .
Tenet ’s entry is remarkable because he previously had been seen even by many of his supporters as excessively loyal to the Bush White House , which awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom when he left the CIA in 2004 .
Tenet ’s book , “ At the Center of the Storm , ” is to be released Monday .
The book ’s publisher , HarperCollins , has not issued advance copies .

But colleagues of Tenet and former CIA officials who have read all or portions of the 576 - page book said it offers a detailed account of the CIA ’s role -- as well as the agency ’s increasingly dysfunctional relationship with the White House -- through a tumultuous period including the Sept. 11 attacks and the aftermath of the Iraq invasion .
Former officials said the book makes a compelling case that Cheney and other administration hawks pressured the CIA to find nonexistent links between Iraq and the Al Qaeda terrorist network , and often were hostile to post- invasion assessments that portrayed conditions in Iraq as deteriorating .
“ The administration is not going to be happy , ” said Mark Lowenthal , a former senior aide to Tenet at the CIA who said he reviewed portions of the book .
“ But the administration is not happy with George anyway .
This administration and the intelligence community became estranged in 2004 to the point where the administration was convinced the CIA was actively working to elect John Kerry . ”
A spokesman for the White House National Security Council said administration officials had not seen the book or Tenet ’s interview , but he defended the decision to invade Iraq .

“ The president made the decision to remove Saddam Hussein for a number of reasons , mainly the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq and Saddam ’s own actions , ” the spokesman , Gordon Johndroe , said .
Lowenthal declined to discuss details of the book , saying he had promised to keep its contents under wraps until its release .
Other officials discussed aspects of the book on the condition that they not be identified because they were not authorized to disclose its contents .
Cheney has continued to suggest there was an IraqAl Qaeda connection in interviews and speeches , despite congressional findings and other investigations that have concluded that Hussein and Al Qaeda did not collaborate and were wary of each other .
“ George is going to talk not so much about Cheney the person but about what Cheney ’s actions caused , ” a former CIA official said .
“ We spent thousands of man -hours trying to prove this case . ”

As it became clear after the invasion that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction or close ties to Al Qaeda , Tenet initially defended the Bush administration , saying the CIA was not pressured into reaching conclusions before the war .
But a former senior CIA colleague of Tenet said there was a difference in how the White House approached the two issues .
“ We ’ve always drawn a distinction between the way the administration dealt with us on WMD and the way the administration dealt with us on the issue of Saddam ’s potential or possible links to 9/11 , ” said the former colleague .
“ On WMD , they asked a lot of questions and they pushed the evidence as far as they could ....
On the other issue , we developed the belief early on there was not a close connection between Saddam and Al Qaeda that could be called operational .
It ’s not really much of a secret that the administration kept looking for one . ”
Two former CIA officials said the part of the book with the most new information focuses on post - invasion warnings .
The book “ plowed some new ground as far as agency views and comments on the situation on the ground in Iraq , ” one official said .
In particular , the readers said , the book describes warnings from the CIA station in Baghdad that were greeted with dismay and mounting suspicion within the White House , including a November 2003 assessment that described the situation as an insurgency .

After that assessment was leaked to the press , Bush summoned Tenet and other CIA officials to the White House and warned that he did n’t want anyone in his administration to use the term “ insurgency , ” according to the officials .
“ There ’s a lot of stuff in the book that paints a picture of an administration wrapped in its own beliefs , not being able to handle information that was contrary to those beliefs , ” said the former official who commented about Tenet ’s view of Cheney .
The official said the book is also critical of Rice .
Tenet “ has a strong belief that Condoleezza Rice has been a failure as a national security advisor , and that ’s one of the themes , ” the official said .

Tenet , who served as CIA director for seven years , engages in some hairsplitting over his role in certain controversies .
He acknowledges having used the term “ slam - dunk , ” for example , but in his interview with “ 60 Minutes ” he insisted he had not meant that the evidence was unequivocal that Iraq possessed banned weapons -- only that he had believed the government could make a compelling case to the public .
Former officials said the book also examines the “ 16 words ” controversy surrounding the CIA ’s efforts to warn the White House against including in Bush ’s 2003 State of the Union address the allegation that Iraq had sought uranium from Africa .

How interesting is this .
There already is a thought crimes law on the books - it protects members of Congress from you and me even threatening them .
You go to jail for even saying something threatening to a member of Congress .
Yet many GOP members of Congress are opposed to hate crimes laws covering ACTUAL VIOLENCE because they call those " special rights . "
The only special rights I 'm seeing is that some members of Congress are okay with actual thought crimes legislation protecting them , but they 're not okay with violent crime legislation protecting me .
Typical Republican hypocrisy .
The law in question criminalizes threats to assault a member of Congress , and can be found in 18 U.S.C. SS 115 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) and 18 U.S.C. SS 115 ( b ) ( 4 ) .
Yes , it 's not only a " worse " crime if a member of Congress is punched than if your mom is punched , but it 's actually a worse crime if a member of Congress is simply threatened with words than if your mom is actually punched in the face .
Do as they say , not as they do .
Deadlocks , livelocks , and race conditions , oh my !
The biggest challenge facing game companies right now is the problem of writing multithreaded code that fully supports the multiple - core architectures of the latest PCs and the next - generation game consoles .
Last year , I wrote an article that discussed this issue , and suggested that , for a while at least , the lowest common denominator of development might prevail .
As evidence for my argument , I made use of quotes from one of the most vocal detractors of the new programming model : Gabe Newell , founder and president of Valve Software , Inc .
Well , things can change quite a bit in a year !
On the first day of November , a group of technology journalists were invited to a special press event held at Valve 's headquarters in Bellevue , Washington .
There , we were treated to an unveiling of the company 's new programming strategy , which has been completely realigned around supporting multiple CPU cores .
Valve is planning on more than just supporting them .
It wants to make the absolute maximum use of the extra power to deliver more than just extra frames per second , but also a more immersive gaming experience .
Programming applications and games that support multiple CPUs ( either multicore CPUs on the same die or discrete chips ) requires learning the art of multithreading .
The programmer divides an application into separate threads , which the operating system automatically allocates among available CPUs .
With each thread executing at the same time , potential problems crop up that are not normally an issue with single - threaded programming .
Imagine each of these weapons is a CPU core .
Now imagine trying to wield them all at the same time .
A deadlock occurs when one thread is waiting on a second thread to finish before it can proceed , but the second thread is waiting on the first for exactly the same thing .
With a livelock , both threads continue to execute , but make no progress towards their goals because the other thread is undoing the work of the first .
In a race condition , some part of memory that the first thread is working on gets modified by the second , producing an undesirable result .
All these problems can be dealt with by an experienced programmer , but they are difficult to debug and can often be frustrating for someone who is n't used to multithreading .
Valve 's challenge was to create a set of frameworks that would not only allow junior and specialist programmers ( what Gabe Newell calls " leaf coders " ) to not only be productive but to make maximum use of multiple cores .
Relying on existing tools that came with the operating system and off - the - shelf multithreading frameworks simply was n't good enough .
They would have to create their own toolset from scratch .
Valve 's hybrid threading model
Valve programmer Steve Bond demonstrates the results of
Valve 's hybrid threading .
The programmers at Valve considered three different models to solve their problem .
The first was called " coarse threading " and was the easiest to implement .
Many companies are already using coarse threading to improve their games for multiple core systems .
The idea is to put whole subsystems on separate cores ; for example , graphics rendering on one , AI on another , sound on a third , and so on .
The problem with this approach is that some subsystems are less demanding on CPU time than others .
Giving sound , for example , a whole core to itself would often leave up to 80 percent of that core sitting unused .
The second approach was fine - grained threading , which separates tasks into many discrete elements and then distributes them among as many cores as are available .
For example , a loop that updates the position of 1,000 objects based on their velocity can be divided among , say , four cores , with each core handling 250 objects apiece .
The drawback with this approach is that not all tasks divide neatly into discrete components that can operate independently .
Also , if some entries in the list take longer to update than others , it becomes harder to scale the tasks evenly across multiple cores .
Finally , the issue of memory bandwidth quickly becomes a limitation with this method .
For certain specialized tasks , such as compiling , fine - grained threading works really well .
Valve has already implemented a system whereby every computer in their offices automatically acts as a compiler node .
When the programmers were getting ready to demonstrate their results on the conference room computer with the big screen , they had to quickly deactivate this feature first !
The approach that Valve finally chose was a combination of the coarse and fine - grained , with some extra enhancements thrown in .
Some systems were split on multiple cores using coarse threading .
Other tasks , such as VVIS ( the calculations of what objects are visible to the player from their point of view ) were split up using fine - grained threading .
Lastly , whenever part of a core is idle , work that can be precalculated without lagging or adversely affecting the game experience ( such as AI calculations or pathfinding ) was queued up to be delivered to the game engine later .
Valve 's approach was the most difficult of all possible methods for utilizing multiple cores , but if they could pull it off , it would deliver the maximum possible benefits on systems like Intel 's new quad - core Kentsfield chips .
To deliver this hybrid threading platform , Valve made use of expert programmers like Tom Leonard , who was writing multithreaded code as early as 1991 when he worked on C++ development tools for companies like Zortech and Symantec .
Tom walked us through the thought process behind Valve 's new threading model .
Tom Brokaw was on Imus the other day and talked about the disastrous Saddam execution .
Another monumental blunder under the care of the Bush administration .

Hello Jon !
I actually signed up here to briefly comment on your opinions as expressed about RAID in general .
So first , let me say that in your position and from your perspective I can certainly understand your comments .
This about sums them all up for me :
It is generally well accepted that RAID0 carries a sizable risk of data loss .
... pretty much echoes what I consider to be a myth about RAID 0 and " the heightened risk " of data loss .
I 'll explain .
First of all , let 's consider a situation where a person purchases two of these : Western Digital ATA100 80.0 GB WD800JB 's , just as an example .
From your chart in the article , it has been your experience that this drive has a 1.72 % failure rate in terms of how many of these drives your company has sold that have required replacement because they failed .
Here 's the point I want to suggest to you :
If your customer decides on purchasing two of these drives to be used as normal IDE drives instead of RAID drives , then based on your company 's experience to date he 's running about a 1.72 % chance that either one or both of the drives he 's purchased could be defective from the factory and fail prematurely .
If it happens that one of the drives should fail while the other does n't , then your customer will lose the data from that drive ( assuming here no backups were done and so on ) even though he may not even know how to spell the word RAID .
If the drive that fails is a boot drive , then your customer will lose his boot drive and be unable to boot his system , and he 'll have to reconfigure his second hard drive as the boot drive and reinstall his OS there if he wishes to boot his system at all prior to getting a replacement drive .
All of this , of course , is possible even if no RAID was ever deployed in the system from the start .
The thing that most people do not understand in general is that two drives running as normal IDE drives are still the identical drives when configured under RAID 0 .
The drives themselves do not know about any differences between RAID and IDE , and they do not behave any differently at all when running as IDE instead of RAID 0 , or vice - versa .
Thus , the failure rate for each of the two drives running IDE is * exactly the same * as it would be for each of those same two drives running in a RAID 0 configuration .
Single drives running in IDE have no fault tolerance , just as single drives running in RAID 0 have no fault tolerance .
Again , the drives themselves just do not care whether you run them in IDE or in RAID 0 -- the drives have no preference -- they run and operate exactly the same way regardless .
This is an important point to remember when thinking about RAID and IDE drive operation .
OK , now , some people will say , " Aha , yes , but when running in RAID 0 you need two drives instead of one , and that means that your two drives , because they are two , are twice as likely to fail as the single IDE drive you could use instead of RAID 0 . "
Really ?
So , by that logic , then , the more components of a type that I have in my system , the higher the risk of failure accordingly ?
I do not believe , thankfully , that this is way things work ... ;)
If things worked this way in reality , well , all of us would have a very tough time finding anything that worked to any degree of reliability ... ;)
Here 's what I mean :
Let 's go back to your drive failure chart for a moment and consider the Western Digital ATA100 80.0 GB WD800JB drive .
According to your numbers you 've sold 290 of those drives and yet the chance of failure for each drive you 've sold is but 1.72 % -- which means that your company has seen ~ 5 ( 4.998 ... or so ) of those 290 drives fail .
So , if we take the logic that says using two drives instead of one means that the possibility of a drive failing is 100 % greater than the possibility of a single drive failing if only a single drive is deployed , then ought not the possibility of one of those 290 drives failing be 29000 % greater than if your company had sold but ONE Western Digital ATA100 80.0 GB WD800JB ?
Obviously , though , even though you have sold 290 Western Digital ATA100 80.0 GB WD800JBs , the odds of a drive failure are only 1.72 % , or roughly 5 drives out of the 290 , so we can see plainly that deploying more than a single drive does not increase the odds of a drive failure by 100 % x the total number of drives deployed .
Does it ?
And yet , this is the way that many people think about that issue , it seems to me .
They think , wrongly , that if they have two drives in a system the odds of a single drive failing are 100 % greater than if they had but a single drive .
Obviously , the experience of your company in selling hundreds of these drives and , indeed , the experience of Western Digital in selling millions of these drives is * not * that the risk of drive failure accelerates by 100 % for every additional drive you deploy after the first one .
Allow me to suggest that if it was then neither you nor Western Digital could conduct business ... ;)
So what * is* the risk that * a* drive will fail , regardless of how many such drives you either sell or else deploy in a single system ?
You 'll find that risk estimated by every hard drive manufacturer : it 's called the MTBF - hours number .
You 'll also find that number listed plainly in the specifications each hard drive maker lists for each drive he manufactures and sells .
So whether you have two drives in a system , five drives or ten drives , etc. , that have a MTBF - hour rating of , say , 10,000 hours ( just to throw out a number ) then you can be assured that on average the manufacturer expects that * each * drive he makes and sells will run that long before failing .
Of course , this is an average , and the actual drive you buy may last half that long or twice that long , but on average this is the kind of operational durability you should expect from each of your drives -- whether you have one , or two or ten , etc .
The * number * of drives in a system has , of course , no impact at all upon the manufacturer 's MTBF - hours estimates of operational life for each of his drives that you own .
The second point that needs addressing is this : are you really any safer in terms of your data if you have a single 300 Gb drive running as IDE than if you had two 150 Gb drives running as one RAID 0 300 Gb drive ?
Well , if it turns out that that the MTBF - hours estimates for the 300 GB drive is the same as for the 150 Gb drives -- then the answer is " no . "
In that case , there is exactly the same risk between the 300 Gb drive failing and one of the two 150 Gb drives that comprise your RAID 0 drive .
Indeed , in this scenario , if you lose you single 300 Gb IDE drive , or you lose one of your two 150 Gb RAID 0 drives , then you lose * all * your data , do n't you ?
Likewise , if the 300 Gb drive you buy to use as an IDE drive has a MTBF - hour rating of 50,000 hours , but each of the 150 Gb drives you use in your RAID 0 configuration has a MTBF - hour rating of 25,000 hours , then you may expect that your IDE drive will possibly run twice as long as your RAID drives before failing .
You could as easily reverse that to see your RAID 0 drives logically being expected to outlive your single IDE drive by twice as long , too .
So , it is n't the number of drives a user has in his system that determines the likelihood of a drive failure , it is the MTBF - hour rating that each drive has that is the only barometer for judging how likely it is that a drive will fail , and whether you are running your drives as IDE or running them as RAID 0 makes no difference whatever .
At home , for instance , I am in my * fourth year * of running RAID 0 configurations -- and although I 've used several different types of drives and RAID controllers over that span , I have yet to have a single RAID 0 drive failure .
Conversely , though , in the years prior to that before I ever ran RAID 0 and was running either SCSI or IDE , I had two ( that I can remember ) drives fail - - both of which were replaced under warranty by the manufacturer .
If I thought like many people do about RAID 0 then certainly I would reach the conclusion that running IDE or SCSI was much more risky than running RAID 0 -- heh ...;) -- but of course I do n't think like that so that 's not what I think .
If anything , I think that drives today are just made a lot better than they were a decade ago , and they just last a lot longer , too -- and of course , whether I 'm running them as RAID 0 or as IDE makes not a whit of difference there .
But , to answer your complaints about some RAID 0 configurations , I think you 'll agree with me that the weakest link in a RAID 0 configuration is the RAID * controller * one chooses to use .
In the last four years , since I decided to try RAID 0 for myself , I 've used only Promise FastTrack TX RAID controllers at home -- first the TX2200 and most recently the TX4200 ( TX4200 is coupled to two Maxtor 300 Gb SataII drives -- it 's two years now using the 4200 without a single drive error or failure .
The TX2200 I moved to my wife 's box , with a pair of WD100 0JBs , has been operating for * four years * without a failure of any kind . )
OK , these are dedicated , hardware , PCI RAID controllers which I consider to be several steps above the mostly software - RAID - type controllers found on most motherboards these days as standard equipment .
Yes , people * are * reporting a sizable number of RAID 0 ( and other RAID mode problems ) with these controllers .
I think the issue boils down to the quality of the RAID controller -- which is exactly what I mean when I say that the efficacy of a RAID setup is greatly dependent on " how " you set it up , and " what " you set it up with in terms of controllers , and of course hard drives , too .
IE , you go " cheap " then you get cheap , if you know what I mean ... ;)
When it comes to components of any sort I believe that very often you get exactly what you pay for -- which is also why I 'm not a believer in motherboard sound , or motherboard graphics , either .
Generally , it 's been my experience that the drivers for motherboard - integrated devices of all kinds are just not as good nor as reliable as the kind of driver support you get with name - brand discrete peripherals .
Anyway , Jon , this has been my experience at home with RAID 0 over the last four years , and I appreciate the opportunity to share it .
Thanks again .

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[ 0014 ]
The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus that uses a software breakpoint function 100 , which may be a specially named void function , to implement a software breakpoint .
Implementation of the present invention requires only minimal modification of the application program 102 into which software breakpoints are desired .
Instead , the present invention relies on a debugging tool 104 that , in one preferred embodiment , includes a software breakpoint monitoring processor 106 , a software breakpoint action determinator 108 , and a software breakpoint action implementor 110 .
Using the debugging tool 104 of the present invention offers portability between different types of CPUs and safe operation of the application program 102 when the debugging tool 104 is not running .
[ 0015 ]
The term “ function ” is generally defined as a section of a program that performs a specific task .
When a function call is executed , program control transfers to the section of the program where the function is located .
After the function executes , program control returns to the next statement following the function call .
Although the present invention has been discussed in terms of “ functions , ” it should be noted that any type of subprogram could be used to implement the invention as long as the particular programming language allowed for a void or empty subprogram to be called .
Alternative exemplary subprograms include subroutines , procedures , macros , or any type of subprogram .
[ 0016 ]
The term “ void function ” is used to describe any function that does nothing .
For example , although the term “ void function ” as it is used in “ C ” is generally defined as a function that has no input or output arguments , if a C void function did nothing when it was run it would fall into the category of a void function for the present invention .
If , however , a C void function did something ( e.g. performed a step ) it would not fall into the category of a void function for the present invention .
In other words , for the preferred embodiment of the present invention , a void function preferably does nothing .
[ 0017 ]
For the purpose of illustrating the present invention , the invention will be discussed in source code terms .
However , in actual implementation , the debugging tool 104 would probably be executing and monitoring object code .
[ 0018 ]
For the purpose of illustrating the present invention , several exemplary programs and functions will be used .
Although the exemplary programs are written in ADA ( or loosely based on the ADA programming language ) , the present invention could be applied to programs that were written in any programming language .
“ Function Code 1 : function MAX ” is an exemplary function that finds the larger of two integers .
“ Program Code 1 : MAX_DEMO ” is an exemplary program that uses function MAX to find the largest of three integers .
1 Function Code 1 : function MAX function MAX ( X, Y : INTEGER ) return INTEGER is begin if X > Y then return X ; else return Y ; end if ; end MAX ; Program Code 1 : MAX_DEMO with TEXT_IO , BASIC_NUM_IO ; use TEXT_IO , BASIC_NUM_IO ; procedure MAX_DEMO is A , B , C , M : INTEGER function MAX ( X, Y : INTEGER ) return INTEGER is begin if X > Y then return X ; else return Y ; end if ; end MAX ; begin loop PUT_LINE ( “ Enter three whole numbers ” ) ; Exit when END_OF_FILE ; GET(A ) ; GET(B ) ; GET(C ) ; M := MAX( A , B ) ; M := MAX ( M , C ) ; PUT ( “ The biggest of them is “ ) ; PUT(M ) ; NEW_LINE ; end loop ; end MAX_DEMO ;
[ 0019 ]
A software breakpoint function 100 of the present invention itself does not perform an operation .
That is , the software breakpoint function 100 of the present invention is a void function .
For example , one exemplary software breakpoint function 100 might be named “ DEBUG TERMINATE . ”
As a second example , a software breakpoint function 100 might be named simply “ SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT . ”
These are shown in “ Function Code 2 : function DEBUG TERMINATE ” and “ Function Code 3 : function SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT . ” 2 Function Code 2 : function DEBUG TERMINATE function DEBUG TERMINATE ( ) is begin end DEBUG TERMINATE ; Function Code 3 : function SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT function SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT ( ) is begin end SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT ;
[ 0020 ] “ Program Code 2 : MAX_DEMO_DEBUG ” is a modified version of Program Code 2 : MAX_DEMO that includes software breakpoint functions 100 “ Function Code 2 : function DEBUG TERMINATE ” and “ Function Code 3 : function SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT . ”
If a programmer were to try to debug MAX_DEMO , then MAX_DEMO would be modified to look something like MAX_DEMO_DEBUG .
3 Program Code 2 : MAX_DEMO_DEBUG with TEXT_IO , BASIC_NUM_IO ; use TEXT_IO , BASIC_NUM_IO ; procedure MAX_DEMO_DEBUG is A , B , C , M : INTEGER function DEBUG TERMINATE ( ) is begin end DEBUG TERMINATE ; function SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT ( ) is begin end SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT ; function MAX ( X, Y : INTEGER ) return INTEGER is begin if X > Y then return X ; SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT ; else return Y ; end if ; end MAX ; begin loop PUT_LINE ( “ Enter three whole numbers ” ) ; Exit when END_OF_FILE ; GET(A ) ; GET(B ) ; GET(C ) ; SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT ; M := MAX( A , B ) ; M := MAX ( M , C ) ; SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT ; PUT ( “ The biggest of them is “ ) ; PUT(M ) ; NEW_LINE ; DEBUG TERMINATE ; end loop ; end MAX_DEMO_DEBUG ;
[ 0021 ]
As shown in MAX_DEMO_DEBUG , multiple software breakpoint functions 100 and multiple types of software breakpoint functions 100 ( e.g. SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT and DEBUG TERMINATE ) may be inserted into each program .
Further , software breakpoint functions may be inserted into subprograms ( such as function MAX ( X , Y : INTEGER ) which includes the software breakpoint function SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT .
[ 0022 ]
A programmer desiring to use the present invention to debug an application program would take his programming code ( e.g. MAX_DEMO ) and define one or more software breakpoint functions 100 as void functions ( e.g. SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT and DEBUG TERMINATE ) .
Alternatively , a programming language could include a library of predefined software breakpoint functions 100 .
[ 0023 ]
In one preferred embodiment , the debugging tool 104 would recognize any predefined void functions having specific names as a software breakpoint function 100 .
In another alternative preferred embodiment , the debugging tool 104 could be modified to accept user defined void functions as a software breakpoint function 100 .
In yet another preferred embodiment , the debugging tool 104 would recognize any void function , and check to see if it is a software breakpoint function 100 .
In still yet another alternative preferred embodiment , the debugging tool 100 could have a combination of the aforementioned possibilities .
[ 0024 ]
The programmer would then insert at least one software breakpoint function ( e.g. SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT and DEBUG TERMINATE ) into the application program ( e.g. MAX_DEMO ) as is shown in MAX_DEMO_DEBUG .
[ 0025 ]
The action performed by the debugging tool 104 may be any known debugging procedure , such as halting , pausing , terminating , or single - stepping program execution .
In an interactive debugging system , a graphical user interface may be used to allow the programmer to monitor , control , and / or have input in the debugging process .
In one preferred embodiment the software breakpoint functions 100 are given specific names that are associated with a desired breakpoint action .
When the debugging tool 104 detects that the named software breakpoint function 100 has been called , the debugging tool 104 performs the desired breakpoint action .
The action performed by the debugging tool 104 may be any known debugging procedure , such as halting , pausing , or single - stepping program execution .
If the desired breakpoint action was halting , the function might be named SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT HALTING or just HALTING .
Similarly , if the desired breakpoint action was single - stepping program execution , the function might be named SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT SINGLE or just SINGLE - STEPPING PROGRAM EXECUTION .
Although for ease of understanding code these meaningful names would be preferable , for complicated programs or just for consistency , alternative non-meaningful names ( e.g. codes or numbers ) could be used .
[ 0026 ]
Once the programmer has programmed his application program , the application program may be compiled ( converting the source code to object code ) .
Significantly , because the software breakpoint functions 100 are implemented as standard functions for a particular type of program , the compiler would compile the software breakpoint functions 100 as it would any other function .
The compiled software breakpoint function 100 , however , would perform no action .
[ 0027 ]
Although most compilers include a debugging tool 104 that runs substantially simultaneously with the compiler , for purposes of this invention the debugging tool 104 will be discussed as separate from the compiler .
Alternative embodiments could include a combined compiler and debugging tool 104 .
[ 0028 ] Turing to FIG .
1 , the present invention is directed to a debugging tool 104 for debugging an application program 102 having at least one software breakpoint function 100 .
The debugging tool 104 , in one preferred embodiment , includes a software breakpoint monitoring processor 106 , a software breakpoint action determinator 108 , and a software breakpoint action implementor 110 .
The software breakpoint monitoring processor 106 monitors the application program 102 and recognizes the software breakpoint function 100 .
As shown in FIG .
1 , the software breakpoint monitoring processor 106 monitors each line of code until the software breakpoint function 100 is detected .
Using Program Code 2 : MAX_DEMO_DEBUG
as an example , the software breakpoint monitoring processor 106 of the debugging tool 104 would start monitoring as the main program ( MAX_DEMO_DEBUG ) began .
Since the code line “ loop ” is not a software breakpoint function 100 , the application program 102 would execute that line of code .
Since the code line “ PUT_LINE ( “ Enter three whole numbers ” ) ; ” is not a software breakpoint function 100 , the application program 102 would execute that line of code .
Since the code line “ Exit when END_OF_FILE ; ” is not a software breakpoint function 100 , the application program 102 would execute that line of code .
Since the code line “ GET ( A ) ; GET( B ) ; GET(C ) ; ” is not a software breakpoint function 100 , the application program 102 would execute that line of code .
However , when the software breakpoint monitoring processor 106 came to the code line “ SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT ; ” the software breakpoint monitoring processor 106 would recognize it as a software breakpoint function 100 and call the software breakpoint action determinator 108 .
[ 0029 ]
The software breakpoint action determinator 108 would then determine an action to be performed based on the software breakpoint function .
For example , the software breakpoint action determinator 108 may determine that the software breakpoint function 100 is an instruction for halting , pausing , terminating , or single - stepping program execution .
The software breakpoint action determinator 108 may be a table lookup in which the specially named function is used to look - up the appropriate action .
Alternatively , the software breakpoint action determinator 108 may use the specially named function to call a function within the debugging tool 104 .
Upon determining the action to be performed , the software breakpoint action determinator 108 provides instructions to the software breakpoint action implementor 110 .
[ 0030 ]
The software breakpoint action implementor 110 , upon receiving the instructions from the software breakpoint action determinator 108 , implements the action .
For example , if the software breakpoint action implementor 110 could perform any any known debugging procedure , such as halting , pausing , terminating , or single - stepping program execution .
[ 0031 ]
It should be noted that in one preferred embodiment the software breakpoint monitoring processor 106 and the software breakpoint action determinator 108 are significantly interconnected and may be implemented by a single device or as a single step .
For example , the software breakpoint monitoring processor 106 may use the a lookup table in the software breakpoint action determinator 108 to determine whether a particular line of code is a software breakpoint function 100 .
[ 0032 ]
It should be noted that in one preferred embodiment the software breakpoint action determinator 108 and the software breakpoint action implementer 110 are implemented by a single device or as a single step .
For example , in the embodiment in which the specially named function is used to call a function within the debugging tool 104 which is immediately executed , the software breakpoint action determinator 108 and the software breakpoint action implementer 110 would essentially be carried out simultaneously .
[ 0033 ] Turning to FIG .
2 , a method according to the present invention begins with two optional steps : programming an application program 200 and inserting at least one software breakpoint function into the application program 202 .
These steps , which are discussed above in detail , are optional because code may be used that has the software breakpoint functions preprogrammed .
The next step is running the application program for the purpose of debugging 204 .
As set forth above , this may include compiling and debugging either separately or in combination .
While the application program is running , the software breakpoint monitoring processor is monitoring the application program for software breakpoint functions such as a specially named function 206 .
Upon recognizing a software breakpoint function or specially named function , the next step is determining an action to be performed based on the software breakpoint function or specially named function 208 .
The action prescribed by the software breakpoint function or specially named function is then implemented 210 .
Finally , the debugging program returns to the application program 220 and continues the monitoring .
[ 0034 ] FIG .
3 shows the step - by - step process used by the debugging tool 104 to implement one preferred embodiment of the present invention .
Specifically , the debugging process is started 300 and a first line of code of the running application program is monitored 302 .
The debugging tool then determines whether the first line of code includes a software breakpoint function 304 .
If the first line of code includes a software breakpoint function , the debugging tool determines what action is appropriate 306 , implements the action prescribed by the software breakpoint function 308 , and returns to the application program 310 .
If the first line of code does not include a software breakpoint function or if the debugging tool returns to the application program , the debugging tool then looks to whether the line is the last line of code in the application program 312 .
If it is , the debugging process ends 316 .
If it is not the last line of code , then the process advances once line of code 314 and the monitoring processes begins for the new line of code 302 .
[ 0035 ]
If the debugging tool 104 is not running , no operation is performed by the named software breakpoint function 100 , and program control returns to the next statement following the function call .
This is one of the advantages of using a function to implement a software breakpoint .
Specifically , the inadvertent failure of a programmer to remove a software breakpoint function 100 after debugging does not result in harmful consequences .
As an example , if Program Code 2 : MAX_DEMO_DEBUG were running and the debugging tool 104 was not turned on , the code lines “ loop , ” “ PUT_LINE ( “ Enter three whole numbers ” ) ; , ” “ Exit when END_OF_FILE ; , ” and “ GET ( A ) ; GET( B ) ; GET(C ) ; ” would run normally .
When the code line with the software breakpoint monitoring function 100 “ SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT ; ” was encountered , the function SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT ( ) would be called .
SOFTWARE BREAKPOINT ( ) would then run , but since it is a void function with no actions to execute , program control would return to the next line of code ( “ M:=MAX ( A , B ) ; ” ) following the function call .
[ 0036 ]
The present invention may be implemented as a medium readable by a device such as a processor or other computing device .
The medium may be any storage device including , but not limited to software , hardware , firmware , or any device capable of embodying a program of instructions for execution by the device to perform a method for debugging an application program .
In one preferred embodiment of the present invention the medium has instructions thereon for receiving code having a software breakpoint function , running the code for the purpose of debugging , monitoring the code to detect the presence of the software breakpoint function , recognizing the software breakpoint function , determining an action to be performed based on the software breakpoint function , and implementing the action .
The medium may have instructions thereon for returning to the code and continuing monitoring the code .
Further , the medium may have instructions thereon for recognizing one software breakpoint function by the code to a list of known software breakpoint functions .
Further , the medium may have instructions thereon for determining an action to be performed by comparing the software breakpoint function to a list of known software breakpoint functions with associated actions and using an associated action to a known software breakpoint function equivalent to the software breakpoint function as the action to be performed .
[ 0037 ]
For purposes of illustration , the following example of an exemplary specific use of the present invention is provided .
The present invention may be implemented as part of a self - contained ARM CPU based development board ( “ platform ” ) having a CPU , display , and several peripherals .
Development tools such as a compiler , a linker , and a debugger are used to write programs that run on this platform in a preferably user - friendly environment .
For example , in an IDE ( Integrated Development Environment ) , Free Software Foundation ( “ GNU ” ) tools such as GCC ( compiler ) , LD ( linker ) , GDB ( debugger ) may be used .
For purposes of this example , the development tools run on a standard PC .
Programs to run on the platform are created on the PC and then loaded and executed on the platform .
Compiler input is the source code of the program as written by a programmer and the compiler output ( with linker cooperation ) is the executable program image .
The debugger enables the user to monitor ( e.g. stop , peek , poke , etc. ) the running program .
The compiler and the linker can produce an image that contains information useful to the debugger , for example the machine code addresses of every source code line of the source code .
Preferably debugger does not interfere with the running program , so that it can emulate exactly the same behavior from the running program regardless whether it is debugged or not .
In other words , the running program is unaware that it is being debugged .
[ 0038 ]
In this example , instead of placing a special instruction in the place of interest in the source code , a software call to a specially named function is issued .
There is no other function of the same name in the code and the debugger always sets a breakpoint at the function of that name .
Using an exemplary specially named function , _DebugBreak , what would happen would be the program would execute until it reaches the place where _DebugBreak would be called .
The debugger would detect this .
The name of the function , _DebugBreak , would be recognized .
Then , the exemplary desired action would be to break the execution at the place where _DebugBreak returns .
The net result would be that the programs breaks the execution and allows single stepping at exactly the place the programmer intended .
[ 0039 ]
In this example , a similar mechanism is also used to detect the program termination .
When the program “ terminates , ” it typically enters an endless loop , effectively continuing to run , doing nothing .
As the program is unaware of being debugged , it cannot ( and in any case does not know how to ) signal to the debugger that it terminated .
The debugger then keeps running until a human operator manually stops it .
To terminate the debug session once the debugged program terminated , another specially named function _DebugTerminate , is added .
When the function _DebugTerminate is called the debug session is terminated .
[ 0040 ]
In this example , both of the functions _ DebugBreak and _DebugTerminate are always present in the runtime libraries , so the programmer does not have to write them .
They are quite minimalistic , as by themselves they do n't perform any action ; their purpose is simply to be called to signal something to the debugger .
[ 0041 ]
In this example , the action of setting breakpoints at specially named functions is done automatically by the IDE every time the program is debugged .
The actions to be performed when a specially named function call is detected are performed automatically by the IDE as well .
To implement this exemplary method , none of the tools ( e.g. compiler , linker , debugger ) need to be modified .
[ 0042 ]
It should be noted that the debugging tool 104 may be implemented as a software program , as hardware ( or firmware ) , or as a single programmable integrated circuit chip .
[ 0043 ]
The use of a software breakpoint function 100 is advantageous when developing an application running on a remote target ( such as a development board or a cellular telephone ) that communicates via a serial connection with a development environment running on a personal computer .

The terms and expressions that have been employed in the foregoing specification are used as terms of description and not of limitation , and are not intended to exclude equivalents of the features shown and described or portions of them .
The scope of the invention is defined and limited only by the claims that follow .
“ I really try to stay away from the doctor because I am so scared of what everything will cost , ” said Ms. Readling , who is divorced and has twin 18 - year - old sons .
Before every doctor ’s visit and test , she asks , “ How much are you going to charge me ? ”
She says she tries to arrange “ the best deals I can . ”
But in many cases , the price is still unaffordable , and “ I have to do without . ”
Even those with insurance have reason to be concerned , economists say , because they end up paying for the uninsured in various ways .
Some of the costs are also passed on to taxpayers and employers .
To help cover the cost of treating the uninsured , hospitals often increase charges to other patients .
Insurers then increase premiums for companies that provide health benefits , and they in turn shift some costs to employees .
Ms. Readling is engaged to be married in June , to another real estate agent .
But she said she may postpone the wedding because she would not want her husband to be legally responsible for her medical bills .
“ I am scared to get married because I do n’t have insurance , ” Ms. Readling said .
“ If I have to go to the hospital and I ca n’t pay my hospital bills , what happens ?
Do they go after him ?
Can they take your home ? ”
To collect unpaid medical bills , health care providers often obtain judgments against a patient ’s spouse , as well as the patient , and file liens against their homes .
Ms. Readling says she does not own a house , but her fiancé does .
The idea of universal coverage , in the form proposed by President Bill Clinton , proved politically untenable .
Since the Clinton plan collapsed in 1994 , the politics of health care have changed because of the steady rise in health costs , the increase in the number of uninsured and the erosion of employer - sponsored insurance .
Politicians are once again speaking about universal coverage as a goal , though opinion polls show that many voters still oppose the idea of a government - run health care system .
Ms. Readling said it was stressful enough visiting doctors every few months for her cancer follow - ups .
Without coverage , she said , the experience is even more stressful .
No , it is n’t .
But that ’s what the headline suggests at the top of this blog entry
The post and the comments which follow are interesting , particularly with regard to property rights in developing countries .
But still , the headline is clearly provocative , and deliberately so .
The fair trade coffee movement is human .
It seeks to do the right thing , but is still flawed in its execution .
But regardless of problems with its policing and administration , fair trade does result in improvements to the lives of small coffee growers .
And beyond that , it has a very important influence on western consumers .
It makes us aware and conscious of the impact of our buying choices .
When we buy fair trade produce and products , we are making a conscious choice , based on increased awareness and the desire to do what is right .
At a time when so many of our buying and life choices are largely unconscious – that is to say , we make them without critical thinking and careful self - examination of our reasons – fair trade provides an important balance .
When people buy fair trade coffee , they not only support individuals , groups and communities in developing countries , but also raise the social consciousness of Western consumers , even if only by a fraction .
And over time , that can make a big difference , even if the number of people consistently supporting fair trade is still relatively small .
As anthropologist Margaret Meade said , " Never underestimate the ability of a small , dedicated group of people to change the world .
Indeed , that 's the only way it 's ever happened " .
According to tradition , the transformation of the blood of San Gennaro , preserved in two phials , protects the city from disasters such as earthquakes or an eruption of Mount Vesuvius .
Scepticism about this popular event on the religious calendar , held in Naples cathedral and witnessed by thousands of people every year , has been heard before .
This time , members of the Italian Committee for the Investigation of the Paranormal ( Cicap ) have said the red-coloured contents are a thixotropic substance , based on iron chloride .
This means that it liquefies when stirred or vibrated and returns to solid form when left to stand .
According to Cicap , the substance was probably stumbled upon by an alchemist or a painter in medieval times .
Attempts to explode the myth about Naples ' much - loved patron saint has however , reignited the debate about science versus faith in Italy .
Members of Cicap , who include Umberto Eco and two winners of the Nobel Prize , have been accused of trying to undermine the religious beliefs of the dwindling numbers of the faithful .
They have also been called spoilsports and compared to magicians who reveal their tricks .
The Church , as usual , has sidestepped the issue .
It has never claimed that the San Gennaro event is a miracle but it has not allowed independent tests on the phials containing the blood .
It did consent to an examination by a scientist appointed by the Church , who reported that he found traces of blood , but his work has never been published in any scientific journal .
Defence of the San Gennaro tradition has come from Vittorio Messori , a noted Catholic writer who is close to Pope Benedict XVI .
He says he has seen with his own eyes the blood emit tiny bubbles and change into liquid .
No single occasion when the relic is brought out is the same , he adds .
Sometimes the colour is a dark red , sometimes it is lighter .
One year the liquid is thin and another year it is more viscose .
Mr Messori says successive cardinals of Naples have been willing to allow independent scientists to examine the liquid but the glass phials are incredibly delicate and what would happen if they broke and the precious liquid was exposed to the air ?
There are many other important things for scientists to investigate , he adds .
Furthermore , he says , Catholics do not claim the liquification is a miracle , only " a sign " .
Cicap is unrepentant about stirring up the controversy again .
" We are accused of being blasphemous but we are not interested in people 's religious beliefs , " says spokesman Massimo Polidoro .
" We are people who want to understand the world around us .
When people have both sides of a story they can make up their own minds . "
The organisation has undermined quite a few myths .
Holy statues that weep tears of blood are a common occurrence in Italy , but nobody ever sees the actual flows of blood , only the stains .
According to Cicap , most of the blood is found to be human , smeared on by owners of the statues after they have pricked their fingers or opened a small cut on their hands .
" In the late 1940s there were dozens and dozens of weeping Madonnas in Italy , " says Mr Polidoro .
" The message was that people should vote for the Catholic parties in order to defeat the Communists . "
An outbreak of weeping Madonnas also occurred in 1994 , he said , in support of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi who also promised to defend the country against Communism .
The Padre Pio phenomenon has also been investigated .
The monk from southern Italy was said to have lived with stigmata , the wounds suffered by Christ on the cross , for most of his life .
He was also seen flying in the air , protecting his hometown from enemy bombings during the Second World War , and apparently had the gift of bi-location - the ability to be in two places at once .
He was canonized in 2002 .
" There are all these legends about this guy but when you look for proof , there is none , " says Mr Polidoro .
Cicap 's next project is to investigate crop circles , a new phenomenon in Italy in the past two years .
" They 're pretty simple at the moment , nothing like the ones you see in England .
But I 'm sure the people who are doing them here will catch up soon , " laughs Mr Polidoro .
I was reading Loren ’s write up on a new link selling service from V7N .
He points out an interesting claim from the company , which says
Contextual Links @ V7N are undetectable to search engines .
Whether it be by human or algorithmic filtering , our links are impossible to detect .
Additionally , an enforced non-disclosure agreement prevents both publishers and advertisers from revealing participating publishers and advertisers .
( emphasis preserved from the original . )
Suffice it to say , if “ undetectable to search engines ” is listed as one of the major selling points of a particular link scheme , it probably violates our quality guidelines and the guidelines of other major search engines .
The “ undetectable ” claim brought up fond memories of another time someone claimed to me that their spam was undetectable .
It was November 2002 , so cue up the wavy time - warp special effect and let ’s go back in time . 🙂
I had just removed a very large data recovery website from Google .
They asked me why their website appeared to be penalized .
I replied with this email :
Pages like
http://www.xxxxxxxxxx.com/data-recovery-software-cw.html
http://www.xxxxxxxxxx.com/data-recovery-software-dr.html
http://www.xxxxxxxxxx.com/data-recovery-software-mn.html
http://www.xxxxxxxxxx.com/data-recovery-software-aa.html
http://www.xxxxxxxxxx.com/data-recovery-software-it.html
http://www.xxxxxxxxxx.com/data-recovery-software-gl.html appear to have garbage doorways with text about random SCSI things .
Visiting those pages in Internet Explorer just redirects to your
homepage .
Using doorways + sneaky redirects is a serious violation
of Google ’s spam guidelines .
In order to relist you ( and it will take
about 7 - 8 weeks ) , we need to have clear evidence that all these pages
are gone , and that we wo n’t see these sort of tricks on your domain
again .
Matt
( domain name removed to protect the guilty back in 2002 . )
By the way , you can see the main criteria for a successful reinclusion request to Google have n’t changed in the last four years : remove the spam and find a way to assure us it wo n’t happen again .
The data recovery company evidently forwarded their email to their SEO to get an explanation .
I like to imagine that they said something like “ Um , dude .
Google removed us completely because they found a bunch of crappy doorway pages that you made .
What do you have to say for yourself ? ”
All well and good , but what happened next is where it gets funny .
The SEO replies , but he does n’t write back to the data recovery company that he spammed out of Google ’s index .
No , the SEO accidentally wrote back to me instead of his client .
And here is what the SEO tried to say to his client but said to me instead :
SHIT !!!!!!
It ’s my fault !!!!
Oh my Gawd .
This is the first time – why you ?
No doubt in my mind it was a search engine savvy competitor who turned you in , because it ’s undetectable to spiders .
First time the search engines have found my doorways .
This is scary !
Weird that this happened right now , i have been worried that this would happen someday , so i have been working all month on a new system to make the pages look undetectably “ real ” so that someone with javascript turned off will just see a nicely formatted page , with images & stuff .
– now we will be undetectable to spiders , and humans , hence 99 % bulletproof .
I know what to do .
I ’m going to call you …
( name trimmed so as not to reveal the identity of the SEO )
I laughed so hard , I nearly bust a gut .
His old system was undetectable , but he was worried he might be caught , so he was working on a spiffy new scheme which was really * really * undetectable .
But only 99 % bulletproof . 🙂
As you might be able to guess , I was easily able to find all of the fellow ’s “ undetectable ” doorway pages and all of his clients with a single Google query — I did n’t even have to use any of my internal tools .
I still chuckle when I hear the word “ undetectable . ”
One thing I do like about working on webspam at Google is that you collect really good stories .
I do n’t always tell the funny ones , but I share this one to make a point .
The moral of this story is that “ undetectable ” spam sometimes stands out a lot more than you ’d think . 🙂

Once again we ’re seeing stories , like this one from Anick Jesdanun at AP , saying that the Internet is broken and needs to be redesigned .
The idea may seem unthinkable , even absurd , but many believe a “ clean slate ” approach is the only way to truly address security , mobility and other challenges that have cropped up since UCLA professor Leonard Kleinrock helped supervise the first exchange of meaningless test data between two machines on Sept. 2 , 1969 .
The Internet “ works well in many situations but was designed for completely different assumptions , ” said Dipankar Raychaudhuri , a Rutgers University professor overseeing three clean - slate projects .
“ It ’s sort of a miracle that it continues to work well today . ”
It ’s absolutely worthwhile to ask what kind of Net we would design if we were starting over , knowing what we know now .
But it ’s folly to think we can or should actually scrap the Net and build a new one .
For one thing , the Net is working very nicely already .
Sure , there are problems , but they mostly stem from the fact that the Net is full of human beings – which is exactly what makes the Net so great .
The Net has succeeded brilliantly at lowering the cost of communication and opening the tools of mass communication to many more people .
That ’s why most members of the redesign - the - Net brigade spend hours everyday online .
Let ’s stop to think about what would happen if we really were going to redesign the Net .
Law enforcement would show up with their requests .
Copyright owners would want consideration .
ISPs would want some concessions , and broadcasters .
The FCC would show up with an anti-indecency strategy .
We ’d see an endless parade of lawyers and lobbyists .
Would the engineers even be allowed in the room ?
The original design of the Internet escaped this fate because nobody thought it mattered .
The engineers were left alone while everyone else argued about things that seemed more important .
That ’s a lucky break that wo n’t be repeated .
The good news is that despite the rhetoric , hardly anybody believes the Internet will be rebuilt , so these research efforts have a chance of avoiding political entanglements .
The redesign will be a useful intellectual exercise , and maybe we ’ll learn some tricks useful for the future .
But for better or worse , we ’re stuck with the Internet we have .
I 've been using Scarab lately , I 've also use Bugzilla and GNATS .
Each is wonderful and sucks , in its own special way .
One thing that has come to mind recently is that I 've never actually had any kind of training with any of them .
I do n't know anybody that has .
The knowledge of issue tracking has come from the development culture .
So , I am wondering , what is there that I do not know ?
What practices and techniques am I missing from simple ignorance ?
Speaking with non-developers who 've tried to file bugs against projects ( as they are always told to do ) shows that it is non-intuitive , and most just forget it out of frustration .
Often there are rants in open source projects about duplicate bugs that just cause further pain to the users .
A look at many sourceforge projects shows that most developers want people to file bugs .
Yet they complain that people do n't search to see if a condition already exists .
The average neophyte ( and many experienced alike ) are lost at the process of dealing with a bug tracker , let alone trying to find if its already been filed .
Searching amazon find little to nothing on books that cover issue / defect / bug tracking .
Searching google finds very little to nothing on tutorials , howtos , or best practices , other than trivial introductions .
We all are using a bug tracking system is important .
Yet , knowledge is simply passed from user to user .
Where are the tutorials ?
Where are the getting started guides ?
Where are the in depth articles for those who are beyond the submit / assign / fix basics ?
How can we get better at using the tools ?
How can we help those new to the tools ?
About Q Q is a functional programming language based on term rewriting .
Thus , a Q program or " script " is simply a collection of equations which are used to evaluate expressions in a symbolic fashion .
The equations establish algebraic identities and are interpreted as rewriting rules in order to reduce expressions to " normal forms " .
For instance , here is how you define a function sqr which squares its argument by multiplying it with itself : sqr X = X*X ; Note that , as in Prolog , capitalized identifiers are used to indicate the variables in an equation , which are bound to the actual values when an equation is applied .
Equations may also include a condition part , as in the following definition of the factorial function : fact N = N*fact ( N - 1 ) if N>0 ; = 1 otherwise ; Functions on structured arguments are defined by " pattern matching " .
E.g. , the product of a list ( denoted in Prolog - like syntax ) can be computed with these two equations : prod [ ] = 1 ; prod [ X|Xs ] = X*prod Xs ;
With this definition , the factorial can now also be defined as follows ( the notation [ 1..N ] , as in Haskell , denotes an arithmetic sequence ) : fact N = prod [ 1..N ] ;
As you can see , the definitions are really just like mathematical equations .
The syntax is superficially similar to other modern functional languages like Miranda and Haskell , except that Q is " free - format " , i.e. , it does not use layout to indicate syntactical structure ( thus the semicolon is used to terminate an equation ) .
Due to its term rewriting heritage , Q goes well beyond most other functional languages in that it also allows you to perform computations with symbolic expressions .
For instance , with the definition of the sqr function from above , you will find that sqr ( X+1 ) evaluates to ( X+1 ) * ( X+1 ) .
This might first look like an arcane feature , but it is actually quite useful , because you can try your definitions with symbolic inputs , too .
Functional Programming Power Despite its conceptual simplicity , Q is a full - featured functional programming language with a modern syntax , curried function applications ( which implies that functions are first - class citizens which can be parameters and results of function applications ) , dynamic typing ( using a single - inheritance OO type system , akin to Smalltalk ) , exception handling , and POSIX multithreading .
Scripts are executed in a bytecode interpreter which byte - compiles scripts in an eye blink and runs them about as fast as interpreted Lisp or Haskell .
The interpreter provides a built - in symbolic debugger which allows you to trace the reductions performed during expression evaluation .
Just like other modern functional languages , Q supports a terse and abstract mathematical style , and it is not uncommon that the equivalent of dozens of lines of C is just a one - or two - liner in Q .
Even more important than raw code size is the high level of abstraction which enables you to handle complex data structures with ease , and tackle complicated programming tasks which are almost hopeless endeavours with conventional programming languages .
That is not to say that you wo n't ever write a line of C again .
C has its uses for interfacing to third - party software and for time - critical processing .
Like most scripting languages , Q also has a C interface .
The Q interpreter is both extensible ( new primitives written in C / C++ can be loaded at runtime ) and embeddable ( Q can be called inside your C/ C++ applications ) .
The distribution already includes a number of modules for interfacing to various popular third - party libraries , which makes Q a powerful tool for scientific programming , computer music , multimedia , and other advanced applications .
As of version 6.0 , Q now also supports SWIG which makes it easy to interface to other libraries if needed .
Using Q Using
Q is supposed to be fairly simple : you throw together some equations , start the interpreter and then type in the expressions you wish to evaluate .
All this can be done with a few keystrokes , using " Q mode " in GNU Emacs / XEmacs .
The distribution also includes a syntax file to enjoy syntax highlighting for the Q language in the advanced KDE editor Kate , and the Windows version comes with a graphical application called " Qpad " for editing and running Q scripts .
As of Q 7.9 , there also is a new Qt - based application called " QCalc " available , which is useful both as a Q spreadsheet and as an alternative frontend to the Q interpreter ; please refer to the QCalc manual for more information .
Of course , you can also run the Q programming utilities from the command line if you prefer that , and Q scripts can be run as standalone programs , too .
Batteries Included
The Q distribution is divided into a number of different packages .
The core package is designed to be fairly portable and includes the Q interpreter and related tools , a standard library ( written mostly in Q itself ) and a set of standard modules .
The standard library implements a lot of useful Q types and functions , such as rational and complex numbers , additional list processing functions ( including list comprehensions ) , " streams " ( a " lazy " variant of lists ) , container data structures ( sets , dictionaries , etc. ) , and a PostScript interface .
Also included in the core is a POSIX system interface which provides , among other goodies , lowlevel I/O , process and thread management , sockets , filename globbing and regular expression matching .
A number of other modules add the necessary facilities for doing portable graphics ( GGI / ImageMagick ) , Tcl / Tk GUIs ( including support for Peter G. Baum 's Gnocl and a GUI builder which lets you create GNOME / GTK + applications ) , scientific programming ( Octave ) and visualization ( OpenDX ) , databases ( ODBC ) and web programming ( Curl , XML / XSLT ) .
A Q module for the Apache web server is also available , which enables you to run your Q scripts " on the web " .
There is also a growing number of different add - on modules .
These may not be as portable as the core , but usually run at least under the more popular operating systems .
Currently available are a combinatorial graph library and editor , an interface to the Qt GUI toolkit , and several multimedia - related modules ( OpenGL+AL , MIDI , sound and synthesis , video , etc. ) , more are under development .
Also take a look at the examples for some other applications which have been written using Q. Open Source Last but not least , Q is open source software , which means that the sources of all programs and software modules included in the Q programming system are freely available .
Q is also free software which is distributed under the GNU General Public License ; see the COPYING file for details .
It ’s been shown that the left side of the brain processes language and the right side processes music ; but what about a language like Mandarin Chinese , which is musical in nature with wide tonal ranges "
UC Irvine researcher Fan -Gang Zeng and Chinese colleagues studied brain scans of subjects as they listened to spoken Mandarin .
They found that the brain processes the music , or pitch , of the words first in the right hemisphere before the left side of the brain processes the semantics , or meaning , of the information .
The results show that language processing is more complex than previously thought , and it gives clues to why people who use auditory prosthetic devices have difficulty understanding Mandarin .
The study appears in this week ’s online early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
In the English language , Zeng says , changes in pitch dictate the difference between a spoken statement and question , or in mood , but the meaning of the words does not change .
This is different in Mandarin , in which changes in pitch affect the meaning of words .
" Most cochlear implant devices lack the ability to register large tonal ranges , which is why these device users have difficulty enjoying music … or understanding a tonal language , " says Zeng , a professor of otolaryngology , biomedical engineering , cognitive sciences , and anatomy and neurobiology .
In his hearing and speech lab at UCI , Zeng has made advances in cochlear implant development , discovering that enhancing the detection of frequency modulation ( FM ) significantly boosts the performance of many hearing aids devices by increasing tonal recognition , which is essential to hearing music and understanding certain spoken languages like Mandarin .

Iacocca : Where Have All the Leaders Gone ?
American Empire | Books
Excerpt on Information Clearing House
By Lee Iacocca with Catherine Whitney
We ’ve got a gang of clueless bozos steering our ship of state right over a cliff , we ’ve got corporate gangsters stealing us blind , and we ca n’t even clean up after a hurricane much less build a hybrid car .
But instead of getting mad , everyone sits around and nods their heads when the politicians say , “ Stay the course . ”
Stay the course ?
You ’ve got to be kidding .
This is America , not the damned Titanic .
I ’ll give you a sound bite :
Throw the bums out !

Klare 's presentation at ASPO - USA is nicely summarized by Chris Vernon of The Oil Drum 's United Kingdom section please read Chris ' report along with this interview .
At the conference , I arranged to e-mail him some questions which he kindly took the time to answer .
Subsequently , we did a follow - up interview on the phone .
Both the questions and answers are presented verbatim .
Dr. Michael T. Klare is the Five College Professor of Peace and World Security Studies at Hampshire College in Amherst , Massachusetts .
One of the world 's leading experts on the energy geopolitics , Klare is perhaps best known for his history and analysis Blood and Oil : The Dangers and Consequences of America 's Growing Dependency on Imported Petroleum .
Klare is a frequent contributor at TomDispatch , where he provides a welcome alternative to the mainstream media 's spoonfed pablum concerning crucial issues like America 's preemptive war on Iraq , the Iranian nuclear stand - off and the global chess game to control oil & natural gas resources .
I asked Klare about Venezuela , Hugo Chavez , Bolivia and geopolitical issues in South America but he declined to answer , stating that he does not watch events in that region closely .
In a follow - up phone interview , I requested further clarifications and asked some additional questions .
I amand Michael Klare is indicated by .
I have paraphrased his remarks on the phone .
These are summarized byinserted in the text .
Some links have been added where appropriate .
DC : You have written " Beware Empires In Decline " , referring to the United States .
Generally speaking , what do the historical precedents tell us about the geopolitical behavior of such empires , particularly as regards what you have termed " senseless , self - destructive acts " ?
Also , please touch on why you think America is indeed in decline .
MK : The establishment and maintenance of an empire is an immensely energy - demanding enterprise .
It takes enormous energy and resources to conquer foreign nations , maintain overseas garrisons , suppress rebellions , administer colonies , pay the salaries of soldiers and imperial bureaucrats , key fleets at sea , and so on .
Every empire that ever was has struggled with this dilemma , and every empire that ever was collapsed sooner or later when the expense of maintaining the empire exceeded the revenues obtained from possessing the empire .
For the United States , I believe , Iraq represents that turning point : before the United States entered Iraq , it was the dominant world power and possessed the strength to exercise hegemony in almost every corner of the globe ; but the Bush administration vastly miscalculated the costs of occupying Iraq ( now estimated at $ 1 - $ 2 trillion ) and that misjudgment will so deplete the US Treasury that American will never be able to undertake such a costly imperial undertaking again -- not without bankrupting the country and reducing us all to beggars .
This having been said , the reality of our altered circumstances may not penetrate the thinking of our top officials , who may falsely believe that we still enjoy our pre-Iraq preponderance of wealth and power , and so undertake Iraq - like adventures abroad that will cripple this nation forever .
DC : Moving on to specific cases , let 's talk about Iraq .
Skipping over the reasons for the war itself , which have been thoroughly discussed , tell us what you see happening in Iraq going forward .
There is apparently a civil war now in progress between the Shia ' and Sunnis .
You 've said that something like the Dayton Accords ( agreed to for Bosnia in 1995 ) is necessary now , Baghdad must become a neutral , international city and the Sunnis must have a share of the oil revenues .
Do you think there is any chance that all or some of this will actually happen ?
Does n't history tell us that such civil wars , once started , take many years , if not decades , to get resolved ?
Already , there is a significant refugee problem .
How do the Kurds fit into the picture ?
Finally , the United States can not remain engaged at current troop levels in Iraq forever .
What do you think will happen there ?
MK : Well , it is obviously risky for anyone to make predictions about Iraq today , given the volatility of the situation there and the failure of all previous efforts to establish order in the country .
However , let me begin by saying that Iraq was an invented country -- it was invented by the British during and after World War I to facilitate their exploitation of the oil in the region .
They created the fictitious " Kingdom of Iraq " by patching together three provinces of the former Ottoman Empire , Mosul in the ( mostly Kurdish ) north , Baghdad in the ( mostly ) Sunni center , and Basra in the ( mostly ) Shiite south , and by parachuting in a fake king from what later became Saudi Arabia .
To keep this patchwork together , the British relied on bribery and sheer force -- the same tactics employed by Saddam Hussein when the British were forced out .
So the United States faces an existential choice : copy the British and Hussein , and use force and bribery to keep this mess together , or find some way to allow it to revert to its original condition with a minimum of bloodshed .
I favor the latter as the most realistic option .
This will not be easy , I know , but the other choice is now untenable .
I think that once it becomes clear that Iraq will devolve into three states with an internationalized Baghdad and some provision for dividing up the oil revenues fairly ( as I propose ) -- and that American forces will begin leaving -- the various elites will sit down together and work out a modus operandi for making this happen .
I think that this formula will also make possible the deployment of an international peacekeeping force under UN auspices that all sides can respect , instead of a US - dominated force that is a flashpoint for so much violence .
Note on Iraq : Refugees are pouring out of Iraq into Syria , Jordan and the other surrounding countries .
When I asked Klare about the view that this exodus would destabilize those countries , he emphasized that many of Iraq 's " best and brightest " were the ones fleeing the situation .
The loss of Iraq 's educated , professional classes leaves the poor at the mercy of the " thugs and crooks " taking advantage of the political chaos there .
DC : Shifting over to Iran , you are on the record as saying that you expect a military action -- specifically a " Shock & Awe " bombing strike --- in 2007 .
Do you still believe that will occur ?
Such an action would seem to imply that America has learned no lessons from Iraq , yet the fallout from such an action could be disastrous , especially in its effect on the oil supply & price .
What do you think the consequences would be ?
Would there be spillover to Iraq and , if yes , what form might that take ?
Similar questions apply to Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states .
MK : Yes , I do believe that the US will conduct air and missile strikes against Iran in 2007 , unless Ahmadinejad capitulates to Western demands and abandons uranium enrichment , which I do n't see happening .
I think Bush did learn something from Iraq :
If you 're going to invade a country because of suspicious WMD behavior , FIRST EXHAUST ALL DIPLOMATIC OPTIONS before your resort to force , so you can claim you had no choice in the matter .
Bush was criticized because he rushed into Iraq before allowing the diplomatic process to run its course , making America look like a trigger - happy cowboy state and sparking anti-Americanism around the world .
This time , he will not act until the Europeans say " We 've tried eveything , and nothing worked , " and UN sanctions haved proved to have zero impact .
Then he can say to Congress and the public : " Look , I did it their way .
I exercized Job - like patience .
But the national security of America is at stake here , and I can wait no longer . "
In the meantime , he will fill up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to deal with an oil crisis and station more U.S. forces in the Gulf to deal with various imaginable forms of Iranian retaliation .
I still think there will be chaos , but I do n't think that this will deter Bush from going ahead with an attack on Iran .
Note on the fallout of an attack on Iran :
Klare assumed that any U.S. bombing attack would include plans to take out Iran 's conventional missile batteries , thus hampering their ability to disrupt shipping in the Strait of Hormuz .
The Persian Gulf and
the Strait of Hormuz
Klare therefore anticipated an asymmetric Iranian response for example , mining the Strait and attempts to sow chaos in all the Shiite regions of the Middle East , including Southern Iraq and Saudi Arabia .
This would lead to U.S. countermeasures and further escalation of conflicts in the region .
DC : In the last few months , there has been a steep decline in the oil price , partly attributed to the lifting of the " risk premium " regarding fears of major supply disruptions in the Middle East or other regions .
Yet , it would seem in your view that the risks have not gone away and , in fact , the geopolitical situation is deteriorating , not getting better .
How do terrorist acts against oil & natural gas production facilities -- for example , Ras Tanura in Saudi Arabia -- affect the risks ?
Please comment on the oil price decreases and how you calculate the current geopolitical risk premium on price .
MK : Well , the fear premium was half driven by a possible war with Iran and half driven by fears of another hurricane season like 2005 , with Katrina and Rita .
Obviously , neither of these occurred .
Had either occurred , the premium would have been justified .
So what is the probability that we will go through another year with ( a ) no major crisis in the Middle East and ( b ) no big hurricanes ?
I can't imagine it 's very low .
And the fact is , there is very little spare capacity in the international oil equation , while demand is rising steadily .
So we have to assume that from now on we will remain just one major crisis or hurricance away from another spike in prices ; and if we get both of those together , we 'll have a super - spike .
Note on Terrorism : I asked Klare about the geopolitical importance of terrorist attacks against oil production facilities .
He emphasized that the word " terrorism " is a bit of a misnomer in many cases .
In fact there is a wide spectrum of such groups running the gamut from ideologically motivated jihadist terrorists to quasi-criminal organizations to political reformers , any of whom might carry out such attacks .
For example , FARC and ELN in Columbia often act like criminal organizations using blackmail .
Seeking " protection money " , these groups threaten to blow - up oil pipelines unless they are paid off .
In Iraq , Klare spoke of so - called " insurgents " working with oil facilities security organizations in a kind of " revolving door " arrangement whereby the people blowing up the pipelines are sometimes the same people protecting them .
Again , this resembles organized crime more than it does jihadist terrorism .
On the other hand , MEND , operating in Nigeria 's Niger delta , may lie closer to the political reform part of the spectrum .
Klare observed that Osama Bin-Laden 's original organization has been largely broken up .
Al - Qaeda is now decentralized and not as " professional " as before .
Nevertheless , Klare expects continued attacks or threats on oil production facilities like Ras Tanura by terrorist groups .
DC : Tell us your thoughts on China -- a large and rapidly growing consumer of the world 's oil & gas -- and Russia -- now the world 's largest oil producer and , via Gazprom , the preeminent gas reserves holder & supplier .
What is the strategic geopolitical relationship between these two countries ?
Do you see " Energy Blocs " coming about in the future ?
If yes , what would these look like ?
For example , you noted that Japan has cast its lot with American energy interests .
Please comment .
MK : There is no doubt that China will need a great deal of energy in the years ahead , and that it will be competing with the United States for access to overseas supplies of oil and gas , especially in Africa , the Middle East , and Central Asia .
I think that the Chinese would like to compete with the USA on something approaching equal terms , as one big consumer vs. another - with each side brandishing their giant energy corporations - but I fear that Beijing has become paranoid that the USA is out to limit their access to global sources of supply and so they see themselves being pushed willy - nilly into Russia 's embrace .
This , at least , is the lesson I think they took from the Unocal fiasco , which I think was a terrible mistake because it suggested that the USA will not allow China to compete with us on equal terms in the global energy market , leaving them no choice but to rely increasingly on Russia and other friendly states like Iran , and to try to seek advantage in places like Sudan , Kazakhstan , Venezuela , and Nigeria , where they see an opening .
So yes , I do see " energy blocs " emerging , and I do not think it is a healthy development for world affairs , insofar as it could so easily lead to military blocs , as in the period before World War I .
Note on Japan :
In the context of " Energy Blocs " , Klare brought up the recent experience of Japan , whose Inpex Holding Inc. had invested $ 2 billion toward developing Iran 's Azedegan field .
After signing on in 2004 , Inpex could not attract any investment partners from the EU .
Under additional pressure from the United States , Inpex was unable to proceed with its Azedegan plans , which finally resulted in Iran cancelling the contract as reported by Rigzone , who also tell us that " Japan is Iran 's largest foreign oil customer , purchasing 581,000 barrels of crude a day last year , or 14 % of Japan 's total oil imports . "
Before the action , Bloomberg had reported that :
Japan , which imports almost all its oil , needs the $ 2.5 billion [ Azedegan ] project to help boost overseas oil assets to 40 percent of imports by 2030 .
Iran is trying to ward off sanctions demanded by the U.S. for its nuclear development program and may strengthen ties with countries such as China and Russia by allowing greater access to the oilfield , said energy researcher Tomomichi Akuta .
" China and Russia are freer to act against what the U.S. says , while it 's hard for Japan to , " Akuta at UFJ Institute Ltd. said by phone today .
" From Iran 's point of view , countries such as China have more credibility when it comes to implementing oil projects under the current circumstances . "
Now , there is talk that Japan will turn to Iraq and Indonesia to try to meet its future supply needs .
DC : Nigerian production has been subject to large disruptions for some time now through the operations of MEND in the Niger Delta .
Angola is increasingly an important oil exporter , especially to China .
Overall , the Gulf of Guinea is now , and will remain for some years to come , a key regional production center for light sweet crude oil .
Will the West intervene militarily in West Africa ?
Would this bring it into open conflict with Chinese interests there and elsewhere in Africa ?
MK : Bear in mind that " military intervention " typically occurs along a spectrum , beginning with the transfer of arms , followed by the deployment of military instructors and advisers , then the use of special forces attached to local irregular forces ( e.g. , the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan ) , and only then , in the final stages , regular combat troops .
It may be some time ( if ever ) before the USA reaches this final stage in Africa , but it has already commenced the early stages ( arms transfers and instructors ) and there have been reports of US special forces operating against extremist Islamic groups in the Sahara region , so I would say that the process of intervention in Africa is well under way .
The Chinese are also engaged in indirect forms of intervention , most notably in Sudan , where they have assisted the northern government in its efforts to suppress the SPLA in the oil regions in the south .
I do not believe that this will ever lead to a direct clash between US and Chinese forces , but I certainly anticipate other forms of friction between the USA and China in Africa .
Indeed , this has already begun : for example , the US has sought to isolate the Sudanese government at the UN Security Council , while China has resisted such efforts .
DC : Finally , will you comment on the likelihood of fossil fuel resource wars in the future ?
Here , I have in mind actual military conflict .
Perhaps you could also touch on some regions I have n't mentioned above such as the FSU countries in and around the Caspian Basin , the South China Sea , etc .
MK : I assume you 're distinguishing here between civil wars over the allocation of resource rents , like those now under way in Iraq and Nigeria , and full - scale war between the major powers over access to oil - producing areas .
Wars of the first kind are happening now , and I would expect more of them in the future .
As for the second , I think we have to consider the problem of " unintended escalation . "
I do not think that any of the major powers will deliberately choose to provoke a war over oil , as when Japan invaded the Dutch East Indies in 1941 ( and bombed Pearl Harbor as a preemptive move against likely American retaliation ) , but I do think that they may engage in provocative behavior that could lead to accidental escalation under conditions of panic , confusion , and over - reaction ( as in the circumstances that triggered World War I ) .
A possible flashpoint for such a scenario is the East China Sea , where both China and Japan have deployed military ships / planes in a disputed energy zone and employed them in a threatening manner , risking potential panic fire and escalation to actual war - a situation that could get out of hand quickly and lead to full - scale war .
So yes , in this sense , I think war over oil and gas is entirely possible .
I wish to thank Michael Klare for taking time to talk to The Oil Drum .
Clearly , geopolitical events have the power to trump more pedestrian supply & demand calculations in the future .

The claims have been repeated so often that many people believe them to be true .
But are they ?
Fat people , especially women , have been told that their obesity will kill them and that bariatric surgery is their best option to save their lives .
They ’re assured , even by our most trusted health organizations , that the risks of bariatric surgery are far less than the risks from extreme obesity .
The incessant news about the deadliness of their fat have terrified countless people .
The claims also help justify the federal government ’s spending of more than $ 600 million annually “ to fight obesity . ”
But when it comes to bariatric surgery , these are lives at stake , mostly those of young women .
In order for people to make a truly informed decision about whether to elect surgery , they deserve the most objective , credible data available , not death threats and statistical manipulations being made to sell them on these surgeries .
A few simple facts can help to put their real risks into perspective .
It ’s an easy math problem : compare the risks of dying from the most “ morbid obesity ” to the risks of dying from the surgeries .
Incredibly , no one has ....

Introduction
I 've written lots of software over the past years .
Some of it was intended to be released in a nice package to the world at some point , some was even meant to be useful , but most of it was written because I was curious how it would turn out and / or because I was bored at the time .
As it happens , I have released and continue to maintain a few projects , which you can find on my homepage , but there 's also a lot of stuff that did n't make it , in most cases because I was too lazy to get it into a form fit for public consumption .
I still think that most of these pieces of software - some of them very simple , others not so - will be of interest to somebody , but since I 'm still too lazy I have chosen to create this page as a place for my abandoned software .
Just because I put a project on this page does n't mean that I do n't care about it , or do n't want to be bothered with it any more , though , so if you have any questions , comments , or even consider using some piece of this software for whatever purpose , do n't hesitate to mail me .

Solving a Minesweeper configuration , meaning given a configuration , finding out which fields are certain to be mines and which are certain not to be , is really very easy .
Here 's an algorithm to do it :
Put together a list of all unvisited fields which have at least one visited neighbour .
For these fields , try out all combinations of assigning each field either bomb status or no -bomb status .
Eliminate all combinations where the resulting configurations contain trivial contradictions ( i.e. , where visited fields have either too many or too few neighbouring bombs ) .
For all the remaining combinations ( the ones without contradictions ) , find out which fields have the same statuses in all combinations .
If in all combinations a field has bomb status , it 's sure to contain a bomb .
If it has non -bomb status in all configurations , it 's sure not to contain a bomb .
Of all the other fields , no certain statement can be made .
This algorithm will solve all solvable Minesweeper configurations .
Unfortunately , it 's also very inefficient .
For example , take this configuration : -----------
-8-8-8-8-8- ----------- -----------
-8-8-8-8-8- ----------- -----------
-8-8-8-8-8- -----------
The - signs are fields which are not yet visited , the 8 s are visited fields with 8 mines in their neighbourhood .
Although it 's obvious that all unvisited fields contain mines , the above algorithm would have to try 2^84 combinations to find that out .
Assuming you have a 10 GHz Pentium 6 and your implementation can generate and check each combination in only 10 cycles , you 'll have to wait about 613 million years for the solution .
Even worse , it could be that there is no algorithm for solving a Minesweeper configuration which has better worst - case asymptotic performance than the one above .
Richard Kaye has proven that determining whether a Minesweeper configuration is consistent , i.e. , whether it could arise during normal play and does not contradict itself , is NP - complete .
Note that that does not mean that solving a configuration is requires exponential time , but it does at least make it somewhat likely .
It 's not surprising , then , that my solver does n't solve all solvable configurations .
For those that it does solve , it 's reasonably efficient , though .
It can solve an expert board ( 99 mines in 30x16 fields ) from start to finish in less than one tenth of a second , if it 's successful .
The solver works by making deductions about minimum and maximum numbers of mines in sets of fields , very similar to how I usually think when I play the game .
Here 's an example ( a + signifies a known mine ) : +33 + ---+
Via the left 3 we know that the three unvisited fields contain exactly two mines , while via the right 3 we know that the two right unvisited fields contain exactly one mine .
If we combine that information , we can conclude that the left unvisited field contains a mine , although we cannot say which one of the other two contains a mine .
In general , let 's say we have a set N with | N| fields , about which we know that it contains at least Nl mines and at most Nu mines .
We also have a set M with | M| fields , containing at least Ml mines and at most Mu mines .
We 'll first consider the intersection I of the two sets , which contains all fields that are both in N as well as in M .
How many mines does this set contain at a minimum ?
Assume N contains its minimum amount of mines , Nl .
Also assume that as many of those mines as possible are in those fields that are not in the intersection set I , namely |N| - |I| ( that 's the number of fields in N but not in I ) .
So , I must contain at least Nl - ( |N| - |I| ) mines .
We can use the same argument for the set M and arrive at another lower bound of Ml - ( |M| - |I| ) mines .
Note that both of these numbers could be zero , so our third lower bound is 0 .
The best lower bound we can give , therefore , is the largest of these three numbers .
Next we 'll see what we can say about the maximum number of mines in the set I .
One upper bound is the maximum number of mines in N , Nu .
The other one is Mu .
Of course , I cannot contain more mines than it contains fields , so the third upper bound is |I| .
The best upper bound we can give is the lowest of these three numbers .
Having established lower and upper mine bounds
Il and Iu for the intersection set I , we 'll now consider the difference set D=N - M , which contains all fields in N which are not in M .
To establish its lower bound , assume that N contains as few mines as possible ( Nl ) , and that as many of N's mines as possible are in the intersection I ( that 's the part of N that is not in D ) .
We know this latter number , too , it 's Iu , the maximum number of mines in I .
That gives us a lower bound of Nl - Iu , which can , unfortunately , be negative , so the second lower bound is 0 .
We can establish the upper bound very similarly : Assume that N contains as many mines as possible ( Nu ) , and that as few mines as possible are in the intersection I ( Il ) , giving an upper bound of Nu- Il , with the other upper bound being | D| , the number of fields in the difference set .
The algorithm my solver uses is this : Given a configuration , for each visited field which neighbours on at least one non-visited field , build a set containing all neighbouring non-visited fields .
The lower and upper bounds of this set is the number of mines the visited field still misses in its neighbourhood , i.e. , the number on the field minus the number of already identified mines in its neighbourhood .
Put all those sets into the list Q .
Set D to be the empty list .
Repeat the following until Q is empty :
Take one set N out of Q and for each set M in D do : Build the difference set N - M according to the description above .
If there is no set in D containing the same fields as this difference set , add it to D .
If there is , and its bounds are at least as good as those of our new N - M , do nothing .
If there is , but at least one of the bounds of N - M is better than the old bound , take the old set out of D , set its bounds to the improved values ( if only one new bound is better , than only that bound is improved , i.e. , if one of the new bounds is worse than the old one , it is not put in ) , and put the set into Q .
Then do the same for the set M - N as well .
When the algorithm terminates , the list D will contain zero or more sets with lower and upper bounds .
Of real interest are only those sets whose lower and upper bounds are equal and are also equal to the number of fields in the set , or equal to zero .
If both bounds are equal to the number of fields in the set , we know that all fields contain mines .
If both bounds are zero , none of them do .
The lower and upper bounds of the other sets can at best be interpreted as approximate probabilities for the presence of mines .
If a set containing one field has a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 1 , it is wrong to conclude that it has a 50 % chance of containing a mine .
An exhaustive algorithm might find that that field must contain a mine , for example .
In fact , a program for finding the exact probabilities in all configurations must be at least as inefficient as a program for solving all solvable configurations ( after all , solving a configuration is nothing else than finding the probabilities for only those fields which are certain to contain mines and for those which are certain not to , which are 100 % and 0 % , respectively ) .
To illustrate this point a bit further , here 's a configuration my solver cannot solve : ++4-2 --++- +6--3 ++22 +
After finishing its algorithm , my solver proclaims that the second field in the second row ( the one directly above the 6 ) contains at least 0 mines and at most 1 .
While this is certainly true ( the bounds my solver produces are always accurate , though not necessarily the tightest ones possible ) , the probability that that field contains a mine is nowhere near 50 % .
The exact probability is in fact 100 % , meaning that field must contain a mine .
You can easily verify this by examining the consequences of there being no mine in that field .
Obviously , there is room for improvement in my solver .
One such improvement which would probably take care of most cases arising during solving random mine fields would be , in case the above algorithm fails to unearth some certain mines or clear fields , to go through all unvisited fields neighbouring at least one visited field and try what the consequences would be if there were a mine in that field , and what if there were not .
If one of these two scenarios resulted in a trivial contradiction , the other scenario would inevitably reflect the truth ( assuming , of course , that the whole configuration does not in itself contain a conflict ) .
Note that if none of the two possibilities turn out to result in contradiction , no conclusion can be made .
Of course , that new solver would still not be able to solve all configurations , although it would take care of the example above .

The 12 coins problem can be stated as follows :
You have 12 similar looking coins , 11 of which have exactly the same weight .
The 12th coin is a counterfeit and has a different weight , but you do n't know if it 's lighter or heavier than the others .
You have a scales and are allowed 3 weighings to determine the counterfeit coin .
This is a description of my solution .
It turns out that there are analytical solutions which do n't require the help of a computer and which extend to larger numbers of coins , but those are not the solution I found .
I figured out ( or , rather , I hoped ) that it might be possible to set up three weighings in advance and from the results determine the counterfeit coin .
By " in advance " I mean that the configuration of the second weighing does n't depend on the result of the first , etc .
My instincts told me that in each of the weighings I should weight 4 coins against 4 others and leave the remaining 4 coins alone .
Let 's name the 12 coins " A " to " L " and set up the weighings like this : ABCDEFGHIJKL 1 000011112222 2 011100021222 3 101201202012
Line 1 is the configuration for the first weighing , line 2 for the second and 3 for the third .
A " 0 " in a coin 's column means that it is n't weighed in that round .
A " 1 " means it's on the left scale and a " 2 " says it 's on the right scale .
Hence , according to this table , we first weigh EFGH against IJKL , then BCDI against HJKL , and finally ACFK against DGIL .
Now , let 's say in our first weighing the left scale is heavier ( we denote that as " 1 " ) , in the second one the right scale is heavier ( denoted as " 2 " ) and in the third weighing they were level ( " 0 " ) .
Let 's assume that the counterfeit is lighter than the other coins .
That means it must have been on the right scale in the first weighing , on the left in the second and on the bench in the third , i.e. , it should have the numbers " 210 " in its column .
Referring to the table we note that there is no such coin .
Let 's assume that it was heavier , then .
In this case it should have " 120 " in its columns , and indeed , coin H ( and only coin H ) fits our criteria .
The question is now , would we always be so lucky to find one , and only one , matching coin if we weighed according to this table ?
It turns out that there are three ( very obvious ) criteria that our table must fit for that to be the case :
In each weighing , there must be the same number of coins in each scale ( in our case , that number is always 4 ) .
There must be no two ( different ) coins which are in the same scale in each weighing , because we could n't differentiate between them .
There must be no two ( different ) coins which are in opposite scales ( or both on the bench ) in each weighing , because we could n't tell if one of them is a lighter or the other one is a heavier counterfeit .
As if by magic , the table above fits these criteria , as well as a fourth one : Each coin is weighed at least once .
This fourth criterion ensures the we can even tell whether the counterfeit is lighter or heaver ( if one coin is never weighed , we might be able to tell it 's counterfeit because all the others have the same weight , but we could n't tell whether it 's lighter or heavier ) .
The above table was calculated with my little program , which you can download below .
It uses a simple brute - force approach , eventually trying out all possibilities .
For only 12 coins this works very well and gives solutions instantly , but of course it does n't scale .
Note that if you discard the fourth criterion you can extend the table with a coin which is n't weighed at all and you 'd have a solution to the same problem with 13 coins .

When I learn a new programming language , the first program I write in that language is usually an interpreter for a small subset of Lisp or Scheme .
I have found that to be a good way to quickly familiarize myself with most aspects of a new language .
These are some of the results of my efforts .
This is an interpreter for a really simple dynamically scoped Scheme dialect .
It only runs with Gforth , because it uses Gforth 's structs to implement its data structures .
One of the more involved parts of this interpreter is the reader , where I had to do quite a lot of stack juggling to keep everything in line .
It does n't look very involved now but I remember spending quite some time thinking about the stack layout for the reader routines .

This is a very efficient interpreter for a small statically scoped subset of Scheme .
In the hopelessly contrived recursive Fibonacci benchmark it beats Guile by about a factor of 2.5 .
It operates by compiling Scheme code into an intermediate data structure which can be executed more efficiently .
Most importantly , no symbol lookup needs to happen during execution .
I think it 's a very nice little piece of software , so I 'll present the more important parts of it here .
The two main data types are lisp_expr , which describes all Scheme data ( including uncompiled code , which is of course nothing else but lists ) , and lisp_code , which describes compiled code .
We 'll start with lisp_expr : type lisp_expr = Nil |
Cons of lisp_expr * lisp_expr |
Int of int
This is simple enough .
Nil is the empty list , a Cons is a list cell and an Int is an integer .
We need integers so that the fib benchmark will run .
It goes on : | Symbol of symbol
This is a symbol , which , as we 'll see below , has a name .
Now it gets more complicated , though : | Builtin of ( lisp_expr array -> lisp_expr )
A builtin is a function that 's built into the Scheme interpreter , hence the name .
A more modern name would probably be " native function " .
For example , the function " + " for adding integers is a builtin .
Builtins cannot be written in Scheme , but they can be passed around and stored in variables ( i.e. , they are first class values ) , that 's why they need to be included in this type .
A builtin is simply a function taking an array of values ( the arguments ) and returning a value ( the result ) .
| Closure of lisp_code * ( lisp_expr array list )
This , finally , is a Scheme function , complete with environment .
The first part , of type lisp_code , is the code of the function .
We 'll see the definition of that type below .
The second part is the environment of the function ( or actually closure ) .
If you 're not familiar with closures and environments , here 's a short introduction :
Let 's say you have this function : ( lambda ( x ) ( lambda ( y ) (+ x y ) ) )
It 's a function that takes one argument x and returns another function , or closure ( a " closure " is what we call code with an environment which it needs to execute ) .
You can call this resulting closure with another argument y and it 'll give you the sum of the two arguments .
Note that you do n't need to remember the argument x you gave to the first function , because it 's contained in the closure it returned .
The value of this argument is therefore contained in the environment of the returned closure .
Of course environments can contain more than one value .
Most importantly , environments can be deep , as this example illustrates : ( lambda ( a b ) ( lambda ( c d ) ( lambda ( e f ) (- (+ (- a b ) (- c d ) ) (+ e f ) ) ) ) )
When you call this function you 'll get a closure whose environment contains the arguments a and b .
This closure , when called , returns yet another closure , whose environment contains the arguments c and d , but also a and b as well .
Let 's say you called the function above with the arguments 1 and 2 , and the resulting closure with 3 and 4 .
You'd get a closure whose environment is the list of arrays [ [ | 3 ; 4 | ] ; [ | 1 ; 2 | ] ] .
The most " recent " argument are always at the front of the list , that 's why 3 and 4 are first .
Note that the environment does not contain the names of the arguments .
Instead , the compiler figures out automatically where in the environment it needs to look for the value of an argument .
Note also that the closure does not specify how many arguments it takes , which means that the interpreter cannot catch the error of giving too many or too few arguments to a closure .
This is only intentional as far as I was too lazy to make it any fancier .
Next are symbols , which are easy : and symbol_value =
Value of lisp_expr and symbol = { name : string ; mutable value : symbol_value } ; ; A symbol has a name , obviously , but also a value .
All symbols are stored in a global symbol table and a symbol 's value is the value of the global variable with that name .
Whenever the reader encounters a symbol , it looks it up in the symbol table and if it's not there , a new entry is made ( that process is called " interning " the symbol ) .
This means that whenever you use a new symbol you get a new global variable ( whose default value is Nil ) , which is usually not what you want , but I was too lazy to change this .
The easiest way would probably be to add an Undefined alternative to the symbol_value type , so that the interpreter can give an error message whenever an undefined global variable is referenced .
We now come to the definition of compiled code : and lisp_code = Quote of lisp_expr
This is just a quoted expression , like 'a ( which is syntactic sugar for ( quote a ) . | Global of symbol
This is a reference to a global variable .
| Global_set of symbol * lisp_code
This is code for setting the value of a global variable , the Scheme syntax for which is ( define name value ) . |
Var of int * int
This is a reference to a local variable , i.e. , to a value in the current environment .
The first of the two integers says how deep into the environment the interpreter must reach , while the second integer says which element in the resulting array is to be fetched .
In the environment example above , for example , to get to the value of a , we'd have to take the second array and from that the first element , hence the numbers would be 1 and 0 ( since the first element has number 0 ) . |
If of lisp_code * lisp_code * lisp_code
This is a simple conditional .
The first lisp_code is the condition , the second is the code for the consequent and the third for the alternative .
| Application of lisp_code * ( lisp_code array )
This is a function application .
The first lisp_code is supposed to evaluate to a function , i.e. , either a builtin or a closure , and the array contains the code for the arguments .
| Build_closure of lisp_code
This , finally , is closure - generating code , i.e. , a lambda expression .
Again , it does n't say how many arguments the closure is supposed to take , which is neither an oversight nor a feature , but merely the result of my laziness .
Now that we 're through with the data structures , we 're ready to discuss the interpreter , which consists of the classical functions eval and apply .
I wo n't discuss the compiler because it 's not as pretty as the interpreter .
The only really " complicated " thing in the compiler is keeping track of local symbols , so that it can know where in the environment the interpreter has to look for a variable value .
Anyway , here 's the interpreter : let rec eval x e = eval takes a lisp_code x and an environment e in which to execute x .
For a top - level expression , this environment is of course the empty list .
eval returns the result of the execution of the code , which is a lisp_expr .
match x with Quote q -> q
Quoting an expression is really easy - just return it .
| Global { value = Value v } ->
v
Referencing a global variable simply means getting its value .
| Global_set ( s , c ) -> s.value <- Value ( eval c e ) ; Nil Setting a global variable , on the other hand , means setting its value ( and returning Nil ) .
The value it is set to is the result of executing the corresponding code in the current environment .
| Var ( depth , index ) -> ( nth e depth ) . ( index )
Since we know exactly where to look for in the environment for a local variable , this is really easy .
First we select the array out of the list and then we select the element out of the array .
|
If ( cond , cons , alt ) -> if eval cond e == Nil then eval alt e else eval cons e
This is one of the two more complicated rules .
First we evaluate the condition .
If it 's Nil , i.e. , false , we evaluate the alternative , otherwise , i.e. , if it 's true , we evaluate the consequent .
| Application ( f , args ) -> apply ( eval f e ) ( Array.map ( function a -> eval a e ) args )
Applying a function means first evaluating the function and all its arguments , and then calling apply , which performs the application once we know the function and the value of its arguments .
We 'll investigate apply below ( it 's very simple ) .
| Build_closure c ->
Closure ( c , e ) Building a closure just means putting its code and the current environment into a Closure .
Here 's apply , which takes a function ( in the form of a lisp_expr ) and an array of arguments : and apply f a = match f with Builtin b -> b a
The function can be a builtin , in which case we just use the native OCaml function application .
| Closure ( c , e ) -> eval c ( a :: e)
The function can also be a closure , in which case we need to make a new environment for it first , which really only means putting the argument array in front of the closure 's existing environment .
Then we evaluate its code in this new environment .
| _ -> raise
Hell ; ; Applying anything else ( like an integer ) is an error .

Data Munging for Non-Programming Biologists
Have you ever renamed 768 files ?
Merged the content from 96 files into a spreadsheet ?
Filtered 100 lines out of a 20,000 - line file ?
Have you ever done these things by hand ?
Disciples of laziness–one of the three Perl programmer ’s virtues –know that you should never repeat anything five times , let alone 768 .
It dismayed me to learn that biologists do this kind of thing all the time .
On the Origin of Scripts : The Problem
Experimental biologists increasingly face large sets of large files in often - incompatible formats , which they need to filter , reformat , merge , and otherwise munge ( definition 3 ) .
Biologists who ca n’t write Perl ( most of them ) often end up editing large files by hand .
When they have the same problem a week later , they do the same thing again–or they just give up .
My job description includes helping biologists to use computers .
I could just write tailored , one - off scripts for them , right ?
As an answer , let me tell you about Neeraj .
Neeraj is a typical NPB ( non-programming biologist ) who works down the hall .
He came into my office , saying , “ I have 12,000 sequences that I need to make primers for . ”
I said , “ Make what ? ” ( I have n’t been doing biology for very long . )
Luckily , we figured out pretty quickly that all he wants to do is get characters 201-400 from each DNA sequence in a file .
Those of you who have been Perling for a while can do this with your eyes closed ( if you can touch type ) :
perl - ne ' print substr ( $_ , 200 , 200 ) , "
" ' sequences .
in > primers.out
Voilá !
I gave Neeraj his output file and he went away , happy , to finish building his clone army to take over the world .
( Or was he going to genetically modify rice to solve world hunger ?
I keep forgetting . )
Unfortunately , that was n’t the end .
The next day , Neeraj came back , because he also wanted primers from the back end of the sequences ( substr ( $_ , - 400 , 200 ) ) .
Because he ’s doing cutting - edge research , he may have totally different requirements next month , when he finishes his experiments .
With just a few people in our group supporting hundreds or even thousands of biologists , writing tailored scripts , even quick one - liners , does n’t scale .
Other common solutions , such as teaching biologists
Perl or creating graphical workflow managers , did n’t seem to fully address the data manipulation problem especially for occasional users , who wo n’t be munging every day .
We need some tool that allows Neeraj , or any NPB , to munge his own data , rather than relying on ( and explaining biology to ) a programmer .
Keeping the biologist in the loop this way gives him the best chance of applying the relevant data and algorithms to answer the right questions .
The tool must be easy for a non-programmer to learn and to remember after a month harvesting fish eyes in Africa .
It should also be TMTOWTDI - compliant , allowing him to play with data until he can sculpt it in the most meaningful way .
While we ’re at it , the tool will need to evolve rapidly as biologists ask new questions and create new kinds of data at an ever - increasing rate .
When I told Neeraj ’s story to others in our group , they said that they have struggled with this problem for years .
During one of our brainstorming sessions , my not - so - pointy - haired boss , Eitan Rubin , said , “ Would n’t it be nice if we could just give them a book of magical data - munging scripts that Just Work ? ” “ Hm–a sort of Script Tome ? ”
And thus the Scriptome was born .
( The joke here is that every self - respecting area of study in biology these days needs to have “ ome ” in its name : the genome , proteome , metabolome .
There ’s even a journal called OMICS now . )
Harnessing the Power of the Atom
The Scriptome is a cookbook for munging biological data .
The cookbook model nicely fits the UNIX paradigm of small tools that do simple operations .
Instead of UNIX pipes , though , we encourage the use of intermediate files to avoid errors .
We use a couple of tricks in order to make this cookbook accessible to NPBs .
We use the familiar web browser as our GUI and harness the power of hyperlinking to develop a highly granular , hierarchical table of contents for the tools .
This means we can include dozens to hundreds of tools , without requiring users to remember command names .
Another trick is syntax highlighting .
We gray out most of the Perl , to signify that reading it is optional .
Parameters–such as filenames , or maximum values to filter a certain column by–we highlight in attention - getting red .
Finally , we make a conscious effort to avoid computer science or invented terminology .
Instead , we use language biologists find familiar .
For example , tools are “ atoms , ” rather than “ snippets . ”
Each Scriptome tool consists of a Perl one - liner in a colored box , along with a couple of sentences of documentation ( any more than that and no one will read it ) , and sample inputs and outputs .
In order to use a tool , you :
Pick a tool type , perhaps “ Choose ” to choose certain lines or columns from a file .
Browse a hierarchical table of contents .
Cut and paste the code from the colored box onto a Unix , Mac OS X , or Windows command line .
( Friendlier interfaces are in alpha testing–a later section explains more . )
Change red text as desired , using arrow keys or a text editor .
Hit Enter .
.
That ’s it !
Figure 1 . A Scriptome tool for finding unique lines in a file -- click image for full - size screen shot .
The tool in Figure 1 reads the input line by line , using Perl ’s -n option , and prints each line only when it sees the value in a given , user - editable column for the first time .
The substitution removes a newline , even if it ’s a Windows file being read on a UNIX machine .
Then the line is split on tabs .
A hash keeps track of unique values in the given column , deciding which lines to print .
Finally , the script prints to the screen a very quick diagnostic , specifically how many lines it chose out of how many total lines it read .
( Choosing all lines or zero lines may mean you ’re not filtering correctly . )
By cutting and pasting tools like this , a biologist can perform basic data munging operations , without any programming knowledge or program installation ( except for ActivePerl on Windows ) .
Unfortunately , that ’s still not really enough to solve real - world problems .
Splicing the Scriptome
As it happens , the story I told you about Neeraj earlier was n’t entirely accurate .
He actually wanted to print both the beginning and ending substrings from his sequences .
Also , his input was in the common FASTA format , where each sequence has an ID line like > A2352334 followed by a variable number of lines with DNA letters .
We do n’t have one tool that parses FASTA and takes out two different substrings ; writing every possible combination of tools would take even longer than writing Perl 6 ( ahem ) .
Instead , again following UNIX , we leave it up to the biologist to combine the tools into problem - specific solutions .
In this case , that solution would involve using the FASTA - to - table converter , followed by a tool to pull out the sequence column , and then two copies of the substring tool .
We ’re asking biologists to break a problem down into pieces–each of which is solvable using some set of tools–and then to string those tools together in the right order with the right parameters .
That sounds an awful lot like programming , does n’t it ?
Although you may not think about it anymore , some of the fundamental concepts of programming are new and difficult .
Luckily , it turns out that biologists learned more in grad school than how to extract things out of ( reluctant ) other things .
In fact , they already know how to break down problems , loop , branch , and debug ; instead of programming , though , they call it developing protocols .
They also already have cookbooks for experimental molecular biology .
Such a protocol might include lines like :
Add 1 ml of such - and - such enzyme to the DNA .
Incubate test tube at 90 degrees C for an hour .
If the mixture turns clear , goto step 5 .
Repeat steps 2 - 3 three times .
Pour liquid into a sterile bottle very carefully .
We borrowed the term “ protocol ” to describe an ordered set of parameterized Scriptome tools that solves a larger problem .
( The right word for this is a script , but do n’t tell our users –they might realize they ’re learning how to program . )
We feature some pre-written protocols on the website .
Note that because each tool is a command - line command , a set of them together is really just an executable shell script .
The Scriptome may be even more than a high - level , mostly syntax - free , non -toy language for NPBs .
Because it exposes the Perl directly on the website–giving new meaning to the term “ open source ” –some curious biologists may even start reading the short , simple , relevant examples of Perl code .
( Unfortunately , putting the command into one line makes it harder to read .
One of our TODOs is an Explain button next to each tool , which would show you a commented , multi-line version of each script . )
From there , it ’s a short hop to tweaking the tools , and before you know it , we ’ll have more annoying newbie posts on comp.lang.perl.misc !
Intelligent Design : The Geeky Details
If you ’ve read this far , you may have realized by now that the Scriptome is not a programming project at heart .
Design , interface , documentation , and examples are as important as the programming itself , which is pretty easy .
This being an article on Perl.com , though , I want to discuss the use of Perl throughout the project .
Why Perl ?
Several people asked me why we did n’t write the Scriptome in Python , or R , or just use UNIX sh for everything .
Well , other than the obvious ( “ It ’s the One True Language ! ” ) ,
Perl data munges by design , it ’s great for fast tool development , it ’s portable to many platforms , and it ’s already installed on every Unix and Mac OS X box .
Moreover , the Bioperl modules offer me a huge number of tools to steal , um , reuse .
Finally , Perl is the preferred language of the entire Scriptome development team ( me ) .
What kind of Perl ?
Perl allows you to write pretty impressive tools in only a couple of hundred characters , with Perl Golf tricks such as the -n option , autovivification , and the implicit $ _ variable .
On the other hand , we want the code to be readable , especially if we want newbies to learn from it , so we can't use too many Golf shortcuts .
( For example , here 's the winning solution in the Perl Golf contest for a script to find the last non-zero digit of N factorial by Juho Snellman : #! perl -l $ _*=$`%9e9 , ??for+1=~?0*$ ?.. pop ; print$`%10
Some might consider this difficult for newbies to read . )
The Scriptome Build
Even though we ’re trying to keep the tools pretty generic and simple , we know we ’ll need several dozen at least , to be at all useful .
In addition , data formats and biologists ’ interests will change over time .
We knew we had to make the process of creating a new tool fast and automatic .
I write the tool pages in POD , which lets me use Vim rather than a fancy web - page editor .
My Makefile runs pod2html to create a nice , if simple , web page that includes the table of contents for free .
A Perl filter then adds a navigation bar and some simple interface - enhancing JavaScript , and makes the parameters red .
I may give in and switch to a templating system , database back end , or XML eventually , and automated testing would be great .
For now , keeping it simple means I can create , test , document , and publish a new tool in under an hour .
( Okay , I did n’t include debugging in that time . )
Perl Culture
There ’s lots of Perl code in the project , but I ’m trying to incorporate some Perl attitude as well .
The “ Aha ! ” moment of the Scriptome came when we realized we could just post a bunch of hacked one - liners on the Web to help biologists now , rather than spend six or 12 months crafting the perfect solution .
While many computational biologists focus on writing O ( N ) programs for sophisticated sequence analysis or gene expression studies , we ’re not ashamed to write glue instead ; we solve the unglamorous problem of taking the output from their fancy programs and throwing it into tabular format , so that a biologist can study the results in Excel .
After all , if data munging is even one step in Neeraj ’s pipeline , then he still ca n’t get his paper published without these tools .
Finally , we ’re listening aggressively to our users , because only they can tell us which easy things to make easy and which hard things to make possible .
Filling the Niche : The Scriptome and Other Solutions
One of my greatest concerns in talking to people about biologists ’ data munging is that people do n’t even realize that there ’s a problem , or they think it ’s already been solved .
Biologists –who happily pipette things over and over and over again – do n’t realize that computers could save them lots of time .
Too many programmers figure that anyone who needs to can just read Learning Perl .
I ’m all for that , of course , but experimental biologists need to spend much more of their time getting data ( dissecting bee brains , say ) than analyzing it , so they ca n’t afford the time it takes to become programmers .
They should n’t have to .
Does the average biologist need multiple inheritance , getprotobyname ( ) , and negative look - behind regexes ?
There ’s a large body of problems out there that are too diverse for simple , inflexible tools to handle , but are too simple to need full - fledged programming .
How about teaching a three - hour course with just enough Perl to munge simple data ?
At minimum , it should teach variables , arrays , hashes , regular expressions , and control structures–and then there ’s syntax .
“ Wait , what ’s the difference between @ {$ a [ $ a ] } and @a { $ a [ $ a]} again ? ”
“ Oh , my , look at the time . ”
As Damian Conway writes in “ Seven Deadly Sins of Introductory Programming Language Design ” ( PDF link ) , syntax oddities often distract newbies from learning basic programming concepts .
How much can you teach in three hours , and how much will they remember after a month without practicing ?
Another route would be building a graphical program that can do everything a biologist would want , where pipelines are developed by dragging and dropping icons and connectors .
Unfortunately , a comprehensive graphical environment requires a major programming effort to build , and to keep current .
Not only that , but the interface for such a full - featured , graphical program will necessarily be complex , raising the learning barrier .
In building the Scriptome , we purposely narrowed our scope , to maximize learnability and memorability for occasional users .
While teaching programming and graphical tools are effective solutions for some , I believe the Scriptome fills an empty niche in the data munging ecosphere ( the greposphere ? ) .
Creation Is Not Easy
How much progress have we made in addressing the problem space between tool use and programming ?
Our early reviews have been mostly positive , or at least constructive .
Suzy , our first power user , started out skeptical , saying she ’d probably have to learn
Perl because any tools we gave her would n’t be flexible enough .
I encouraged her to use the Scriptome in parallel with learning Perl .
She ended up a self - described “ Scriptome monster , ” tweaking tool code and creating a 16 - step protocol that did real bioinformatics .
Still , one good review wo n’t get you any Webby awards .
Our first priority at this point is to build a user base and to get feedback on the learnability , memorability , and effectiveness of the website , with its 50 or so tools .
It will take more than just feedback to implement the myriad ideas we have for improving the Scriptome , which is why I ’m here to make a bald - faced plea for your help .
The project needs lots of new tools , new protocols , and possibly new interfaces .
You , the Perl.com reader , can certainly write code for new tools ; the real question is whether you ( unlike certain , unnamed CPAN contributors ) can also write good documentation and examples , or find bugs in early versions of tools .
We would also love to get relevant protocol ideas .
Check out the Scriptome project page and send something to me or the scriptome - users mailing list .
Here ’s a little challenge .
I really did have a client who renamed 768 files by hand before I could Perl it for him .
Can you write a generic renaming atom that a NPB could use ?
( Hint : “ Tell the user to learn regular expressions ” is not a valid solution . )
The winner will receive a commemorative plaque ( < bgcolor = " gold " > ) on the Scriptome website .
Speaking of new interfaces , one common concern we hear from programmers is that NPBs wo n’t be able or willing to handle the command - line paradigm shift and the few commands needed ( cd , more , dir / ls ) to use the Scriptome .
In case our users do tell us it ’s a problem , we ’re exploring a few different ways to wrap the Scriptome tools , such as :
A Firefox plugin that gives you a command line in a toolbar and displays your output file in the browser .
( Currently being developed by Rob Miller and his group at MIT . )
An Excel VBA that lets you put command lines into a column , and creates a shell script out of it .
Wrapping the command - line tools in Pise ( web forms around shell commands ) or GenePattern ( a more general GUI bio tool ) .
We ’ll probably try several of these avenues , because they allow us to keep using the command - line interface if desired .
As for the future , well , who says that only biologists are interested in munging tabular data ?
Certainly , chemists and astronomers could get into this .
I set my sights even higher .
How about a Scriptome for a business manager wanting to munge reports ?
An Apache Scriptome to munge your website ’s access logs ?
An iTunes Scriptome to manage your music ?
Let ’s give users the power to do what they want with their data .
Sorry , GUI Neanderthalis , but you ca n’t adapt to today ’s data munging needs .
Make room for Homo Scriptiens !

DIGG THIS
There are two major values of public schooling , from the perspective of government officials .
One , this institution provides the means by which government officials can slowly but surely , over a period of 12 years , mold the mindsets of children into one of conformity and obedience to authority .
Second , public schooling enables government officials to fill children ’s minds with officially approved political , historical , and economic doctrine .
Public schooling is much like the military .
What is the first thing that the military does to new recruits ?
No , not teach them to fight or kill .
That comes later .
First comes boot camp , a seemingly nonsensical period of time in which soldiers are ordered to drop down for pushups at the whim of an officer .
Soldiers learn to march together in unison , mastering such movements as right - face and left - face .
They ’re taught to respond without hesitation with  Yes , sir and  No , sir to an officer barking questions a few inches away from their face .
Why ?
Why does the military spend time teaching those things to new soldiers ?
After all , none of them comes in very handy once the actual fighting begins .
The reason is very simple : to mold each person ’s mindset into one of strict conformity and obedience .
That is , higher - ups in the military know that if they can compel a person to do something as ridiculous and nonsensical as a right - face and a left - face , then there is a greater likelihood that that person will obey other orders without question .
Or if a person can be taught to obey orders to march in unison within a group of people , all of whom are wearing the same uniform , there is a strong likelihood that such a person will lose his sense of individuality and instead simply consider himself part of the collective .
That is the real value of military boot camp — it very quickly eliminates all notions of individuality within the human being and makes him feel that conformity and obedience are the only acceptable states of mind .
In principle , the public - schooling system is no different , although government officials have a much longer period of time — 12 years — in which to accomplish the same task — produce mindsets of conformity and obedience .
That ’s not only what compulsory - attendance laws are all about but also the manner in which public schools are operated .
Compulsory - attendance laws are , in principle , no different from the compulsory draft that the military employs .
In the draft system , the government sends a notice to a citizen commanding him to appear at a military installation for compulsory service in the military .
If the citizen refuses , he faces criminal indictment , prosecution , conviction , imprisonment , and fine .
In the public - school system , families are required to submit their children to a state - approved education .
While this encompasses attendance at state - approved private schools and homeschooling , for most families compulsory - attendance laws mean sending their children into public schools in their neighborhood for education .
Those families who refuse to submit their children to a state - approved education face the same things that draft resisters face : criminal indictment , prosecution , conviction , imprisonment , and fine .
Equally important , the operation of public schools tends to produce the same type of mindset that the military produces — one of conformity and obedience to state authority .
Just as in the military , the student is taught to conform to what some people would ordinarily consider nonsensical rules and regulations that bear no relationship to a genuine love of learning .
For example , consider the rigid class schedules that are imposed in public schools .
All students are required to attend a daily series of 50 - minute classes addressing several different subjects .
When the bell rings at the end of one class , the student is expected to immediately proceed to the next class .
If he fails to arrive on time , he is punished .
Never mind that he might not be interested in the subject matter of the next class or that he might want to stay and talk with other students or the teacher about a subject that he is genuinely interested in .
That does n’t matter .
What matters is that he respond to the bells and obey .
That rigidity , conformity , and obedience may be perfectly suitable for some types of people , just as the military way of life is perfectly suitable for some types of people .
The problem , however , is that not everyone is suited to that way of life .
For those who are more individualistic , more free - spirited , the public - school experience becomes a long , 12 - year battle in which the military - like school system tends toward grinding away at the natural sense of individualism and independence that characterize those students , a process that such students naturally resist .
For example , suppose a student says to his public - school administrators ,  I absolutely love playing the piano .
I am totally uninterested in math , chemistry , and a foreign language .
Therefore , I have made the decision to stay in music class six hours every day for the next three months and take no other classes . 
How would the public - school administrator respond ?
He would laugh out loud at such an audacious statement .
He would firmly tell the student to follow the class schedule that the school has provided him . . . or else .
In earlier years , the student would have even faced a paddling with a board of education if he insisted on skipping regularly scheduled , mandatory classes to play the piano .
One might respond that the student has the choice of dropping out of public school and receiving his state - approved education from a private school or through homeschooling .
The problem , however , is that most private schools have the same rigid - type curriculum system that public schools have .
After all , private schools must be approved by the state in order to meet the standard of a state - approved education .
Moreover , many parents simply lack the competence or time to homeschool .
Under a free - market educational system , however , each family would be free to fashion the education that would fit each child in the family .
If a child said ,  I want to do nothing but play the piano for the next six months and study nothing else ,  that would be up to the family , not the state .
And before someone says ,  It would be irresponsible for a family to educate the child in that way ,  reflect on the fact that many students travel abroad each summer to study nothing but a foreign language and that they study that language for several hours every single day for several weeks at a time .
No math or science classes .
Just the foreign language .
The point is that in the compulsory state system , the military - like way of learning is imposed on everyone , even those who are not suited for that way of life .
The result is an endless battle in which individualistic students come to hate school and learning in general .
In a noncoerced educational system — that is , one in which the state is not involved in any way — the family controls the educational environment of its children .
Thus , if a child says ,  I think I ’ll just go fishing today and reflect on the ideas and philosophies I ’ve been studying ,  the parents are free to say ,  That sounds like an exciting idea . 
If the student tries that in the state system , he will be told ,  Try it and you ’ll find yourself in detention for the next three weeks . 
What happens to those public - school students who rebel against the military - like regimentation that characterizes public schools ?
Government administrators make them feel like something is wrong with them .
Even worse , they convince their parents that something is wrong with them .
The students are sent to school psychiatrists who diagnose mental disorders such as attention deficit disorder . 
Think about how a new military recruit who announced  I ’m going fishing today instead of learning how to march  would be treated .
Would not everyone in his unit think he was crazy ?
That ’s the same way school administrators would feel about the student who said the same thing .
He ’d be considered crazy — or at least distracted .
Of course , in the mind of the state official , the malady is nothing that drugs , such as Ritalin , ca n’t cure .
Given the right dosage of drugs , over time the mind of the recalcitrant , independent - minded student will be molded in the proper way , especially over the 12 long years that the state has control over him .
Indoctrination and textbooks
The other value of public schooling , from the standpoint of the state , is the ability of government officials to fill the minds of children with important , officially approved ideas , philosophies , and standpoints , especially with respect to politics , history , government , and economics .
After all , what textbooks are used in public schools ?
Those textbooks that have been carefully chosen by state officials .
If a proposed textbook contains objectionable material or omits important officially approved material , what chance does it have to become the official textbook used in public schools across the state ?
Answer :
No chance at all .
By the very nature of government schooling , the matter of what goes into school textbooks must necessarily be a political matter , to be decided by those in political power .
And since the choice of textbooks customarily applies to public schools across the state , all children receive the same government - approved information .
Moreover , there is virtually no choice for the parents who cannot afford to send their children to private school or who are unable or unwilling to home - school .
They must send their children to the public school in their neighborhood .
That is , there is not a multitude of public schools from which to choose .
And even if there were , they would most likely all be using the same textbooks .
Why is the textbook important ?
Because the teacher is expected to base his teaching on it .
Sure , a teacher has some leeway to be flexible but imagine what would happen to a public - school teacher who announced to his classes ,  What is written in these textbooks is claptrap , lies , and deceptions .
I ’m going to be teaching you the truth about the nature of the government , government schooling , free markets , individualism , and liberty . 
What would happen to that teacher ?
He would slowly ( or perhaps quickly ) be grinded down , to the point where he either got pushed out of the public - school system or be made to conform .
Here ’s what would happen : A student would return home and report to his parents what the teacher was saying .
A major political crisis would quickly erupt .
His parents would call a member of the school board , which consists of elected officials , and complain .
The school board , scared of the political consequences , would contact the principal , who would have a talk with the teacher .
If the teacher refused to back down , the school board would call a public meeting , where the teacher would be given the opportunity to state his case to the board — and to the voters .
Given the nature of politics , voter sentiment would play an important role in the school board ’s ultimate decision .
Since the teacher ’s teaching would be contrary to the official doctrines found in the textbook , he would have a heavy burden to overcome .
Most likely , he would lose .
The teacher would be left with a choice : stand fast and lose his job or give in and teach the information contained in the textbook .
Libertarianism and public schooling
That ’s why it is extremely unlikely that one would ever find libertarianism taught as a philosophy in any public school .
For one thing , libertarian principles would contradict most of the claptrap found in government textbooks .
Do you have doubts ?
Well , imagine a public - school teacher openly announcing at the beginning of the semester that he would be teaching the following things in his government class :
The drug war is an immoral sham that has accomplished nothing more than enriching government officials and drug dealers .
Drugs should be decriminalized .
Public schooling is nothing more than a system of socialism applied to education .
It should be abolished , leaving education to the free market .
Abraham Lincoln waged war on the Confederacy for the purpose not of freeing the slaves but of preserving the Union .
U.S. intervention in World War I constituted a horrible waste of American life .
It did not accomplish its purported goal of making the world safe for democracy and ending all future wars and actually contributed to the rise of N. Lenin and Adolf Hitler .
The federal government , not free enterprise , caused the 1929 stock - market crash and the Great Depression .
Franklin Roosevelt intentionally lied to the American people when he said that he was doing his best to keep America out of World War II .
U.S. officials during World War II intentionally delivered East Germany and Eastern Europe into the clutches of the Soviet communists .
Lyndon Johnson won his 1948 U.S. Senate race by stuffing the ballot box with fake ballots and later , as president , he intentionally lied about the supposed attack on U.S. forces in the Gulf of Tonkin .
The U.S. government ’s interventionist foreign policy in the Middle East gave rise to the 9/11 attacks .
Given that Iraq never attacked the United States , President Bush ’s war on Iraq constitutes a war of aggression ,  a type of war that was punished as a war crime by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal .
Minimum - wage laws hurt the poor and should be repealed .
Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid are immoral , socialist programs that should be abolished immediately , along with the taxes that fund them .
What do you think would happen to that teacher ?
Public schooling and Cuba
I ’m not suggesting , of course , that there are no libertarians teaching in the public schools .
In fact , there are and they do a great job introducing libertarian principles to students .
But they must be very careful about how they present their arguments .
Usually they learn to carefully couch them in terms of improving the system .
In fact , that ’s also how things work in Cuba , where public schooling is one of Fidel Castro ’s proudest accomplishments ( along with government - provided health care ) .
It ’s illegal for any public - school teacher in Cuba to challenge the Cuban system .
But as long as arguments are couched in terms of improving the Revolution ,  teachers have some degree of flexibility .
As a matter of fact , a comparison of public schooling in Cuba and the United States will help to drive home the points I am making in this article .
The systems in both countries are based on the same principles .
Government officials are in charge of educating the children in the nation .
Government - approved textbooks that contain government - approved doctrine are used .
Government employees teach the students .
The curriculum is set by the government .
So is there any difference ?
Yes , both in the mindsets that are produced and in the materials taught , which is why maintaining control over education is so important , both to U.S. officials and to Cuban officials .
For example , most Cubans know that public schooling and government - provided health care constitute socialism , and they are very proud of their educational and healthcare systems .
They would not want to see them abolished .
On the other hand , most Americans honestly believe that public schooling and Medicare and Medicaid constitute  free enterprise ,  and they are very proud of their educational and health - care systems .
They too would not want to see them abolished .
The mindsets in both countries reflect the value of doctrines taught by government officials during the 12 - year period when government officials had control over children .
Do you recall the big battle of Elin , the young boy whose mother died while trying to escape Cuba and make it to the United States ?
Everyone knew that whichever government school got ahold of him — and maintained a hold over him for 12 years — would ultimately win out in terms of his mindset .
Today , Elin praises Fidel Castro and the Cuban system .
No doubt he thinks he ’s free , especially given that the Cuban system involves free education and free health care .
If he had remained in America ’s public schools , he would very likely have felt differently about matters in Cuba but would have been nevertheless praising public schooling , Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid in the United States .
That ’s the power of public schooling .
Several years ago , I visited Cuba and was walking through a museum that detailed all the attempts that the CIA had made to assassinate Castro and effect regime change in Cuba , including the invasion at the Bay of Pigs .
I saw a class of primary - school students and their teacher taking a field trip through the museum .
To no one ’s surprise , the teacher was filling the students ’ minds with the Cuban government ’s officially approved doctrine .
But it would not have been any different in principle if a class of public - school students from Miami had been taking a field trip through a CIA museum in the United States .
The Cuban students would be taught that the U.S. government wrongfully interferes in the affairs of other countries , even making use of assassination .
American students would be taught that their government spreads freedom and democracy around the globe and would probably not be told that their government uses assassination as one of its policy tools .
One amusing aspect of the comparison between the Cuban and U.S. educational systems appeared recently .
A controversy arose in Miami because the library of some public school carried a book that praised public schooling in Cuba .
There was an outcry because it ’s considered improper and unpatriotic to say good things about Castro or his system in American public schools .
A Cuban woman who had served in the Cuban public - school system and who was now living in Miami said that the whole controversy confirmed the advantages of democracy over tyranny .
She explained that at least in the U.S. educational system , there are discussions and debates among government bureaucrats over what books should be permitted in public schools , while in Cuba , only one official — Fidel Castro — makes that decision .
The woman obviously is convinced that public schooling in the United States is freedom because education in this country is centrally planned by government bureaucracies , while in Cuba , education is tyranny  because it is centrally planned by only one government official .

If you ’re an OS X user you already now about Spotlight , the file metadata indexer that comes with Tiger .
I ’m not a heavy user of Spotlight , but today i’ve made a discovery that may change this a bit : John “ Lemonodor ” Wiseman ’s Lisp Metadata Importer , a plug - in that makes Spotlight aware of Common Lisp constructs in your files .
John wrote a nice howto in the above page , complete with screenshots like this one showing a search for Lisp definitions :
and here you can see Pathfinder showing the Lisp metadata associated to one of my files :
Nifty .
Although i think that the possibility of using the command line interface for querying Spotlight metadata is even more interesting … i’m already thinking of writing some Elisp to perform queries within Emacs with Spotlight ’s mdfind as a backend ( albeit admittedly Slime makes those scripts less useful than one would think ! ) .
One can also use John ’s importer ’s source code as the basis for new plug-ins supporting other languages ( Scheme comes to ( my ) mind , stay tuned ! ) .
There ’re already importers for Python and Ruby , but it ’s quite easy to write your own if those are not your cup of tea ( and learn a bit of Objective - C in the process ) .
Happy searching !
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Chimpanzees have been seen using spears to hunt bush babies , U.S. researchers said on Thursday in a study that demonstrates a whole new level of tool use and planning by our closest living relatives .

Perhaps even more intriguing , it was only the females who fashioned and used the wooden spears , Jill Pruetz and Paco Bertolani of Iowa State University reported .
Bertolani saw an adolescent female chimp use a spear to stab a bush baby as it slept in a tree hollow , pull it out and eat it .
Pruetz and Bertolani , now at Cambridge University in Britain , had been watching the Fongoli community of savanna - dwelling chimpanzees in southeastern Senegal .
The chimps apparently had to invent new ways to gather food because they live in an unusual area for their species , the researchers report in the journal Current Biology .
“ This is just an innovative way of having to make up for a pretty harsh environment , ” Pruetz said in a telephone interview .
The chimps must come down from trees to gather food and rest in dry caves during the hot season .
“ It is similar to what we say about early hominids that lived maybe 6 million years ago and were basically the precursors to humans . ”
Chimpanzees are genetically the closest living relatives to human beings , sharing more than 98 percent of our DNA .
Scientists believe the precursors to chimps and humans split off from a common ancestor about 7 million years ago .
Chimps are known to use tools to crack open nuts and fish for termites .
Some birds use tools , as do other animals such as gorillas , orangutans and even naked mole rats .
But the sophisticated use of a tool to hunt with had never been seen .
Pruetz thought it was a fluke when Bertolani saw the adolescent female hunt and kill the bush baby , a tiny nocturnal primate .
But then she saw almost the same thing .
“ I saw the behavior over the course of 19 days almost daily , ” she said .
PLANNING AND FORESIGHT
The chimps choose a branch , strip it of leaves and twigs , trim it down to a stable size and then chew the ends to a point .
Then they use it to stab into holes where bush babies might be sleeping .
It is not a highly successful method of hunting .
They only ever saw one chimpanzee succeed in getting a bush baby once .
The apes mostly eat fruit , bark and legumes .
Part of the problem is this group of chimps is shy of humans , and the females , who seem to do most of this type of hunting , are especially wary .
“ I am willing to bet the females do it even more than we have seen , ” she said .
Pruetz noted that male chimps never used the spears .
She believes the males use their greater strength and size to grab food and kill prey more easily , so the females must come up with other methods .
“ That to me was just as intriguing if not even more so , ” Pruetz said .
The spear - hunting occurred when the group was foraging together , again unchimplike behavior that might produce more competition between males and females , she said .
Maybe females invented weapons for hunting , Pruetz said .
“ The observation that individuals hunting with tools include females and immature chimpanzees suggests that we should rethink traditional explanations for the evolution of such behavior in our own lineage , ” she concluded in her paper .
“ The multiple steps taken by Fongoli chimpanzees in making tools to dispatch mammalian prey involve the kind of foresight and intellectual complexity that most likely typified early human relatives . ”

I recommend looking at the Equipment & Gear : Knife Parts article to get an idea of what to look for in general when selecting a knife .
We 'll also be using the terminology laid out in that article to identify knife parts .
Each of the chef 's knives tested was selected for a reason .
I started with Henckels and Wüsthof - the two most popular " high - end " chef 's knives available in the United States .
These are the manufacturers that have been pushed as quality cutlery at most home kitchen supply stores .
( The knives tested were the Henckels Pro-S and the Wusthof Classic .
Both companies produce lower quality , budget lines that are inferior to their high - end knives .
Heckels manufacturers , under the premium branding of Zwilling J.A. Henckels , the Pro-S , Four Star , Five Star , and Twin collections .
Wüsthof - Trident makes the Classic , Grand Prix series , Culinar , and Le Cordon Bleu lines as their premium knives . ) I then added the R.H. Forshner / Victorinox chef 's knife as a relatively low cost entry .
This knife was the Cook 's Illustrated Editor 's Choice in their knife testing ( actually , it 's from the same family - I was n't able to figure out exactly which knife was tested by Cook 's Illustrated without a model number ) .
The Global cook 's knife was included because they are the most popular Japanese kitchen knives available to the average American consumer .
In the last several years they have made a big impression with their stainless steel handles and imposing presence in stores like Sur La Table , Williams - Sonoma , and , most recently , Bed Bath & Beyond .
The Kershaw Shun is another Japanese manufactured line that has practically leaped onto the stage .
Described by Cook 's Illustrated as the " Cadillac " of chef 's knives and personally endorsed by Alton Brown , I had to include it in the roundup .
The Shun was also a personal favorite of mine ( as expressed in the Equipment & Gear : Kitchen Knives article ) .
I then included one more well - known brand - Cutco .
Cutco is not sold in stores but is instead marketed in the U.S. through a referral based direct marketing method ( similar to the old party system ) .
The Cutco claim is that they are the best selling high - end kitchen knife manufactured in the United States .
The other knives I included are not as well - known , but are well respected : MAC , Tojiro , and Nenox .
I attempted to contact several other knife manufacturers ( including Kyocera for their ceramic chef 's knife ) but failed to receive a response ( and I had reached my limit on knives I was willing to buy for this test ) .
All of the knives were tested out - of - the - box because I made the assumption that most readers will not be hand sharpening their knives .
( In addition , once a knife has been sharpened , it would be difficult to compare the performance of the knives because of the added factor of the sharpener 's skill and equipment . ) I started off with the desire to measure the physical dimensions of the knives : thickness of spine at bolster and at tip and angle of bevel at the cutting edge .
Unfortunately , I was n't able to measure the angle of bevel to any degree of accuracy ( most of the knives taper to the edge and the actual bevel is over a very short distance of perhaps a millimeter ) .
I did use calipers to measure the spine thickness at two points on each knife and determined that the thickness of the spine does not affect the cutting performance ( it may play a role in other factors to be considered when selecting a knife , like weight ) .
The knives were also weighed .
The rest of the testing was focused on subjective cutting performance .
I spent a month thinking about how I would set up an apparatus to make objective measurements , but could n't come up with a feasible test that did not seem contrived and too abstract to compare to how a knife would actually be used in the kitchen .
As such , I settled on making the subjective testing as " accurate " as possible , performing the same cuts over and over again with the knives .
First all the knives were subjected to the particular cutting test and roughly ranked against each other .
Then knives close together in the ranking order repeated the cutting test ( often alternating cuts ) until I could determine if one was noticeable superior to the other or they were pretty much equal in performance .
Prior to each cutting test , the knives were steeled to realign their edges .
Test 1 : Carrot TestDescription : Unpeeled carrots were cut in two different ways .
The first method started by positioning the carrot parallel to the counter and driving the heel of the knife into the carrot at a 30° ( from horizontal ) angle .
The blade was driven in ( like a wedge ) for about 2 mm , enough for the knife to stay in place .
The knife was then pulled from heel to tip along that groove .
The motion was completed with no conscious downward pressure .
The result was examined - a sharp knife would be able to slice cleanly through the carrot , a duller knife might slice through most of the way but end with the carrot snapping off , while a very dull knife would simply slide in the groove .
The second test method involved cutting thin ( 1 mm or less ) cross-sectional slices from the carrot .
The slicing was accomplished by starting the tip ( about an inch from the point ) of the knife on the surface of the carrot and pushing the knife forward and down ( usually traversing only a couple inches ) to cut through .
The effort required to cut through as well as the cleanliness of the cut were compared to rank the knives .
Test 2 : Potato TestDescription : A potato was first cut in half along its major axis ( long side ) .
A potato half was then set down on the cutting board with its cut side down to keep the potato from rolling or moving during the test .
Thin slices of potato were cut off by starting the tip on the surface of the potato and pushing the knife forward .
This technique was used to perform the majority of the ranking based on effort needed to cut through , cleanliness of cut , and how straight the cut was .
In cases where it was difficult to determine if one knife was superior to another with similar performance , a reverse stroke was used as well : the stroke started with the heel of the knife and the knife was pulled back without any additional downward effort .
Test 3 : TomatoesDescription :
This is a very popular demonstration ( although I 'm not sure why - I 've only seen extremely dull knives perform badly with tomatoes ) .
Because , in my experience , all knives cut tomatoes reasonably well , I focused on the feel of the knife during the cut .
Specifically , I watched for any slipping while cutting and the level of ease with which the knife slid through the tomato .
None of the tomatoes were crushed , were mangled , or lost excessive juice during the test .
The tomato was first cut in half through its axis of symmetry ( through the stem to the tip ) and laid down to prevent rolling .
The heel of the knife was placed on the skin and the knife was pulled back allowing the weight of the knife to help the blade slide through the tomato .
Test 4 : ScallionsDescription :
The greens of fresh scallions were thinly sliced into circles using both a mincing motion ( keeping the point anchored on the cutting board and pushing the heel of the blade down ) and a short slicing motion ( placing the point on the board and the scallions under the middle of the knife and sliding the knife forward about an inch ) .
Both actions were repeated for several seconds as scallions were fed under the knife with the left hand .
Both the feel of the knife and the cleanliness of the chopped scallions ( clean cuts or signs of crushing , bruising , or tearing ) were taken into account in this test .( in alphabetic order )

( 3.4 mm ) @ bolster ; 5/128 in . ( 1.0 mm ) @ tipI 've numerically ranked each knife starting with " 1 " as the best performing knife .
Knives with the same ranking are so close in performance that I was not able to differentiate between the knives .
Please note that these numbers are for ranking only and are not a relative performance level ( for example the difference between a 1 & 2 ranking may be much smaller than the performance difference between a 5 & 6 ) .
Knives of the same ranking are listed in alphabetic order .
In addition to relative ranks , a rating is assigned to each knife : U - Unacceptable ; S - Serviceable ; E - Excellent ; O - Outstanding . knives do not cut as expected .
Either the cuts were not clean ( requiring excessive force or multiple strokes ) or the blade bruised or crushed the ingredient to an unacceptable degree.
knives performed their cutting action as expected .
There is nothing exceptional about the knife - it simply performs as you 'd expect an average knife to perform .
More force is needed when using a serviceable knife than an excellent or outstanding one .
knives slice with ease .
The knives are properly balanced and sharp enough to feel as if the user is simply guiding the knife and the knife is performing the cutting .
knives simply perform beyond all expectations .
The knife 's cutting ability is noticeably better than that of an excellent knife .
These rankings do not take in account other factors such as cost , handle shape , and weight .
They simply portray the cutting performance of the knife .
Carrot testPotato testTomato testScallions test Examining pure performance , the Global G - 2 is the best of the bunch .
However , the MAC places a very , very close second ( with the 8 - in. with dimples [ MTH - 80 ] coming out just a bit better than the 8.5 - in. without dimples [ MBK - 85 ] ) .
In fact , all three are exceptional performing knives .
However , the purchase of a knife should not be based solely on its cutting performance .
Other important factors to consider are up to the individual chef.may be the most important factor when buying a knife .
If the handle does n't feel comfortable , then chances are you wo n't be comfortable using the knife .
A handle that feels comfortable in one grip may be uncomfortable when gripped another way .
Unfortunately , this means I can't tell you which knife handle is best for you .
I recommend going to a store where you can actually hold the knife .
A store like Sur La Table , where you can practice a slicing motion on a cutting board , is your best bet for picking the right knife .
Another factor to consider is how the knife feels with your particular cutting motion .
If the knife delivers a lot of shock to your hand as you chop or slice , you may want to seek out a slightly different design .
For example , the two MAC knives have slightly different feels even though , visually , they seem to have identical curvatures .
The general balance of the knife should feel nice to your particular style as well .
Choosing a knife that is comfortable to you will help ensure that you wo n't wear yourself out when you have to do a lot of cutting .
I find that the Global G - 2 , although very light and an excellent performer , just does n't fit my hand as comfortably as some of the other knives .
The relatively thin handle and shallow taper to the blade makes holding the knife slightly awkward for me .
I prefer a grip where my hand is choked up on the handle a bit allowing my thumb and forefinger to rest on opposite sides of the blade just in front of the bolster lip .
The design of the Global knives just does n't seem to let me grip that way and keep the knife from trying to twist out from under me .
For that reason , my personal preference is the MAC MTH - 80 MAC Mighty Chef 8 " with dimples .
The styling and finished look of a knife is very important to many .
For example , the Global G - 2 has a very distinct look at many will find compliments the decor of their kitchens .
The fit and finish of the Nenox S1 is one of the best I 've ever seen .
I find that the handle feels wonderful in my hand and also looks beautiful .
In addition , the Nenox has some more detail work than the mass produced knives - for example , the spin of the knife has been carefully rounded and smoothed .
( However , the bolster lip of the Nenox is a sharp right angle causing it to be a little more difficult to use . ) A final factor that I 'm going to mention is the care of the knives .
Although , many of the knives claim to be dishwasher safe , none of the knives should actually be washed in a dishwasher , except two - the Forschner Fibrox and the Cutco French Chef 's will easily survive multiple cycles in a dish washing machine .
You do need to make sure the blade will not bounce around or touch other objects in the dishwasher .
The Cutco knife 's handle may change color after several washes in the machine .
My recommendation for all knives is to hand wash them and dry them immediately with a clean cloth.}? >

A “ minor ” rebellion over at digg yesterday has simply reinforced my perception that the comments section of said news aggregator is filled with either a ) 14 - year - old males with little - to - no understanding of the real world or b ) grown men acting like 14 - year - olds , petulantly thumbing their collective nose at “ The Man ” in a vain attempt to appear hip and / or rebellious .
Slashdot has a post collecting many of the details , but the story in brief runs thusly :
Some enterprising hackers ( and I mean that in the good , Eric S. Raymond - esque form of the word , not the Johnny Lee Miller / Angelina Jolie sense ) managed to discover a simple hexadecimal keystring that single - handedly pretty much breaks the encryption scheme employed on the new HD - DVD format .
The AAC - LA and its affiliates had virtually guaranteed content producers that the encryption ( AACS ) used on both Blu - Ray and HD - DVD formatted discs would be hack - and crack - proof , so this deciphering of the system obviously constituted a fairly major technology news story .
Users of digg began submitting links to blog and forum posts containing the hex string and even placing the string within submission headlines and blurb texts which caused the digg administrators to react quickly and bury posts and even disable the accounts of the stories ’ submitters .
The official editorial stance of Revision 3 / digg was that these submissions placed R3 / digg at risk of lawsuits from the AACSLA / MPAA and thus violated digg ’s Terms of Service .
digg users took these buries to represent a form of “ censorship ” and staged a minor revolt , at one point filling the entire digg front page with stories containing references to the hex string , a course of action that led digg co-founder Kevin Rose to throw his hands up in frustration and state
But now , after seeing hundreds of stories and reading thousands of comments , you ’ve made it clear .
You ’d rather see Digg go down fighting than bow down to a bigger company .
We hear you , and effective immediately we wo n’t delete stories or comments containing the code and will deal with whatever the consequences might be .
To put it frankly , the actions of the digg community are idiotic .
They are not “ brave ” .
R3 was not “ censoring ” their “ speech ” and the infantile kicking of the ox goad that resulted was ludicrous in the extreme .
“ Brave ” users seeking to stick it to the MPAA “ Man ” would have posted the offending string on their own blogs and thus exposed themselves to potential litigation , rather than dragging an unwilling digg into the fight .
If they seek the destruction of the community they take part in , I can think of no quicker route than to get the creators sued into oblivion .
So well - played , diggers .
You managed to make Slashdotters seem principled and Farkers seem reasonable by comparison .
Dunces .

It was n’t really even something to be momentarily amused by then forget , though that ’s certainly tempting given the absurdity of it all .
If you take a minute to think about it , what happened last night is that a bunch of kids on the playground banded together to beat up another kid , a kid they saw as richer or more powerful or more snotty than them .
â€œThe teachers can’t expel us all , â€ they said , so they put the other kid in the center of a big circle and took turns punching him , then turned out his pockets and took his lunch money .
That ’s not an uprising .
That ’s not even really a riot .
It ’s a lynching .
And for facilitating it , Kevin Rose and his colleagues ought to be ashamed of themselves .
Though some of these ideas may seem far fetched , it may not be too long until we actually see jet - powered , armored , or dual - touchscreen laptops .
The Lenovo Tapes
Someone acquired these tapes from an “ acquaintance ” — showing test footage from Lenovo ’s research facility .
They include a holographic , armored , and hovering laptop .
Fun to watch , but purely concepts , nice job Lenovo .
“ When my acquaintance watched the tapes back , he found some footage that he just had to get it out into the public domain .
I ’ve watched the material myself and I ’ve got to agree with him – it ’s pretty amazing stuff . ”
Jet -Powered Laptops
That ’s right , according to MIT ’s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics , future laptops could be powered by mini gas turbine engines that are “ no larger than a quarter — delivering five to ten times the endurance of a similarly sized battery pack . ”
Espstein and his team are building the first engine using a sandwich of six silicon wafers that are bonded together at an atomic level , and plan to power it with liquid butane , the same stuff used in cigarette lighters , to avoid having the thing smell like an airport runway

Estari DC15 : The World ’s First Dual - Touchscreen Notebook
The Estari DC15 is the world ’s first dual - touchscreen notebook , keyboard not included .
It features an Intel Core Duo ( 1.83 - GHz ) processor , 2GB RAM , up to 100 GB HDD , and dual 15 - inch touchscreen displays .
No word yet on pricing and availability .
The company has installed virtual keyboard software and users can even use wireless keyboards ( or USB ones ) if they feel uncomfortable with the concept .
One drawback of this model is that it weighs a whole 5.9kg
Last week , George Bush said :
We can debate Iraq -- and should .
There should be no debate about making sure that money gets there on a timely basis so our kids can do the job we 've asked them to do .
And today :
Eight more American troops were killed in Iraq , seven of them on a single day , the US military said Saturday , amid raging violence and a desperate search for three captured soldiers .
The only debate we should be having is how to get our troops home .
And George ?
They 're not your kids .

JENNER --
Signs have been posted on beaches near the mouth of the Russian River warning people to stay way from a stretch of the river where a rogue elephant seal has gone on a rampage in the past month , biting a surfer and a dog and killing several harbor seals , officials said today .
The seal , nicknamed Nibbles , is an adolescent male who has been frequenting a sandy point on the Sonoma County coast .
Witnesses say the seal , who has been tagged , lunges at its victims like a crocodile .
Officials are cautioning people not to swim or wade in the estuary waters near Goat Rock Beach near Jenner , and not to approach the 2,500 - pound animal should they see him " hauled out , " or basking in the sun .
" A point we really need to get across is the public safety issue , " said Sarah Allen , a National Park Service biologist stationed at Pt. Reyes National Seashore .
" Just because elephant seals are big does n't mean they wo n't move quickly .
On beach sand , a bull can charge faster than I can run . "
Allen , an expert in elephant seals , put a pink tag on the bull 's hind flippers when he showed up at the river estuary .
While males are customarily aggressive , this one 's behavior goes far beyond what is typical .
It has crushed the skulls of female harbor seals and disemboweled male harbor seals .
After running a maze , rats mentally replay their actions - but backward , like a film played in reverse , a researcher at the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT reports Feb. 12 in the advance online edition of Nature .
In 2001 , Matthew A. Wilson , a professor in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences , reported that animals have complex dreams and are able to retain and recall long sequences of events while asleep .
Like people , rats go through multiple stages of sleep , from slow - wave sleep to REM sleep .
Slow - wave sleep , also referred to as non-REM sleep , makes up a large fraction of the normal sleep cycle and occurs earlier than REM sleep .
REM sleep , which takes its name from the rapid eye movements that occur during this type of sleep , is associated with dreaming .
Wilson found that during slow - wave sleep , animals replayed spatial experiences in the same order they were experienced .
His latest results show that , following a spatial experience such as running laps on a track , the awake animal replays the memory so precisely that its recorded brain activity corresponds exactly to the places it has just been .
However , to the researchers ' surprise , the episode is replayed in time - reverse order , with the most recent locations first , proceeding sequentially back to the beginning of the task .
This backward instant replay may play a significant role in reinforcing learning , Wilson said .
" Understanding this replay is likely to be critical in understanding how animals - and humans - learn from experience .
This phenomenon may constitute a general mechanism of learning and memory . "
The hippocampus , a seahorse - shaped brain structure in the temporal lobe , has long been known to be involved in spatial navigational learning in rodents , as well as in the ability of rodents , primates and humans to remember events .
Wilson and MIT postdoctoral fellow David J. Foster measured the activity of cells in the rat hippocampus during periods of running and stopping .
During each session , each animal ran several laps on familiar and unfamiliar tracks , occasionally stopping for a food reward .
After eating , the animal paused to groom its fur , move its whiskers or just stand still before running again .
It was during this pause that the reverse replay occurred , and it was most likely to occur when an animal ran an unfamiliar track , supporting the idea that this phenomenon helps the hippocampus reinforce a newly learned task .
While running , the animal 's hippocampal cells fired in order , corresponding with the animal 's position on the track .
When the animal stopped , many of the same cells fired again , but the sequence of cell activation was in reverse order and spanned the entire track .
This replay was literally instant - it took less than a second to replay up to 30 seconds of running .
Wilson says that the ability to eavesdrop on both the sleeping and conscious brain could be a valuable tool in treating memory disorders such as amnesia or Alzheimer 's disease , or it may prove helpful in finding ways for people to learn and memorize information more effectively .

the momentum had clearly shifted in favor of considering an increase of at least $ 2 in the $ 5.15 an hour minimum wage , despite strong resistance from conservative Republicans and the party 's allies in the business community .
not
appear
warned that Republicans might try to tie the increase to an unacceptable piece of legislation on taxes or health care as a " poison pill " to drive off Democrats and make certain the increase could not clear the Senate or become law .
Fun Facts
The federal minimum wage has not been raised in ten years .
Its purchasing power is now the lowest it 's been in fifty years .
A full - time worker with a family earning the minimum wage is below the official poverty line .
If you 're a Republican lawmaker in a tough election year , beholden to corporate interests but on the wrong side of public opinion when it comes to raising the minimum wage , what do you do ?
It 's easy : allow a vote on a bill to raise the wage from $ 5.15 to $ 7.25 over two years , but attach a couple of poison pill amendments to it such that it does n't have a chance of actually passing .
That way , you can get the benefit of friendly headlines in the New York Times like " G.O.P. Nears Vote to Increase U.S. Wage " without having to deal with the headache of actually raising the purchasing power of working families .
And the best part is that readers of the Times will have no idea !
Carl Hulse 's story asserts that The only problem with this sentence ?
It is n't true .
Willingness to raise the minimum wage hasincreased among Republicans , just a willingness toas though it has .
Hulse 's only acknowledgement of the poison pills is a watered down , tepid paragraph that DemocratsWith no elaboration on what those " unacceptable piece[s ] of legislation " actually are , Hulse makes it sound as though Democrats are merely crying wolf for the hell of it .
To learn the real details , you 'll have to read the Associated Press ' surprisingly clear - headed story ( printed here in the Post ) .
Not only is the G.O.P. trying to tie the minimum wage vote to an amendment cutting the inheritance tax on multi-million dollar households , they want to make it more expensive for small businesses to purchase health care for their employees ( see Think Progress for more on this issue ) .

If you dropped a bundle on a high - end computer display or HDTV , you could be in for an unpleasant surprise when you slip your new high - definition DVD of Star Wars : Episode III into your Windows Vista PC .
Vista , the next version of Windows that 's slated to appear in about a year , will feature a new systemwide content protection scheme called PVP - OPM ( see box below ) .
If your monitor does n't work with PVP - OPM , all you 'll likely see is either a fuzzy rendition of your high - def flick or Hollywood 's version of the Blue Screen of Death - - a message warning you that the display has been ' revoked ' .
High - Def Hard - Liners
Forthcoming Blu-ray and HD - DVD discs promise higher resolution than a standard DVD 's 480 - line maximum .
But to protect its high - quality content from pirating , the film industry , along with disc and hardware makers , has created an umbrella content protection scheme known as AACS .
If Windows is to play the new discs , Microsoft has little choice but to support AACS , which is where PVP - OPM comes in .
According to Microsoft , PVP - OPM will prevent pirates from attaching recording devices directly to the PC graphics card 's DVI or HDMI video outputs in order to capture a pristine digital copy of the disc 's otherwise encrypted content .
A related component , PVP - UAB , will prevent savvy computer owners from installing data capture cards in order to grab high - def movies straight off the PCI Express bus .
Unfortunately , PVP - OPM will also shut out plenty of law - abiding video watchers whose current displays are n't future - proof .
To comply with the film industry 's protection scheme , PVP - OPM employs HDCP technology to determine whether graphics boards and displays are allowed to output and display high - def video .
If HDCP sees a blocked display ( such as a video capture device ) or one that does not support HDCP ( including any HDTV with only analog connectors ) , it prevents output or reduces the video resolution until the offending display or protected content is removed from the system .
Costly Upgrades
If that scenario sounds disturbing , it gets worse : Few existing wide - screen desktop displays support HDCP .
If you 're one of the hundreds of thousands of current wide - screen desktop display owners , you can probably forget about viewing Blu-ray or HD - DVD discs on your nearly new ( and far from cheap ) monitor .
To watch high - def content , you 'll likely have to upgrade your monitor .
A handful of HDCP - compliant displays from NEC , Samsung , Sony , and ViewSonic are just starting to appear , according to market research firm iSuppli .
And manufacturers such as Dell have plans to incorporate HDCP support into future wide - screen displays , though details are scarce .
Think you could avoid this expense by sticking with XP ?
No such luck .
To see HD , you 'll have to upgrade to Windows Vista as well ; Windows XP 's security and driver models lack the ability to support HDCP .
Consumers intent on viewing HD discs via their PCs will have little choice but to spring for the new operating system in addition to an HDCP - compliant monitor .
Decode the Jargon AACS : Advanced Access Control System .
A specification for guarding next - generation optical - media content created by the film , electronics , and software industries .
HDCP : High - Bandwidth Digital Content Protection .
Intel 's content protection scheme for digital displays , not supported by most currently available PC monitors .
PVP - OPM : Protected Video Path Output Protection Management .
Downgrades video resolution or blocks the picture entirely if the connected display does n't support content protection .
PVP - UAB : Protected Video Path User - Accessible Bus .
Encrypts video content as it passes over the PCI Express bus from the high - def disc to prevent other PCI Express devices from intercepting the video stream .
Olbermann :
Are they escalating the escalation ?
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday May 23 , 2007 Print This Email This MSNBC 's Countdown with Keith Olbermann examined reports of White House plans for a " second surge " that could nearly double the number of combat troops in Iraq by the end of the year .
Olbermann speaks with Paul Reickhoff , director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America .
Reickhoff agrees that just sending in more troops is unlikely to have a positive effect without diplomatic and other efforts .
He says that continually extending tours of duty is unsustainable and that the expectations being placed on the troops are " ridiculous . "
However , Reickhoff 's sharpest criticism is saved for the Democrats in Congress .
He believes the president has been able to frame the funding issue successfully and the troops are just glad the money will be coming .
And he says , " I do n't really think that this is really the beginning of the end .
I think it shows that there 's a lot of integrity problems within the Democrat Party .
...
They 're in this middle ground and I think they 're really losing the political battle , even among their own constituents . "
TRANSCRIPT : # OLBERMANN : And while Congress inches ever closer to not getting troops out of Iraq , it appears the administration is planning to stealthily use even more of them , Hearst Newspapers , analyzing the Pentagon depart deployment papers , concluding that the White House is quietly planning to nearly double the amount of combat troops in Iraq by the end of this year , from 52,500 in January to 98,000 by December .
Current troop increase plans call for 20 brigades in Iraq , but through a combination of extended tours and additional deployments , there could be an overlap of troops going in and coming out of Iraq , so that , at least temporarily , there could be as many as 28 brigades there , more than 200,000 troops in Iraq , later this year .
Cue the denials .
The Pentagon says the newspapers analysis is , quote , fuzzy math ,  and when the White House was asked ( INAUDIBLE ) the story about a , quote , second surge was correct , press secretary Tony Snow said no , at least about the surge part .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) SNOW : Its , it s just we , we right now , we are ( INAUDIBLE ) -- the question is a second surge to Iraq .
No .
We , were in the middle of the Iraq plan that General Petraeus put together .
( END VIDEO CLIP ) OLBERMANN : Joining us now , the executive director , founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America , author of  Chasing Ghosts ,  Paul Rieckhoff .
Paul , thanks for some of your time tonight .
PAUL RIECKHOFF , IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN VETERANS OF AMERICA :
Good to be with you , Keith .
OLBERMANN : Well get to the bit about the Democratic collapse in a moment .
But if this is not a surge , a second surge , what is it ?
RIECKHOFF : Well , it could be an overlap .
It definitely looks like its going to be an increase in troop numbers , from around 160,000 to about 200,000 if this Hearst story checks out to be true .
And you do have a degree of overlap , when one units coming in and another ones going out .
You can have elements of a brigade remaining behind .
But during the surge , we went up to 20 brigades , and at this point , it looks like later this year will be as high as 28 brigades , elements of 28 brigades .
So it may be a transitional overlap .
But theres no guarantee that the Department of Defense wont keep them there longer .
That s the key issue here .
They have the discrepancy and the flexibility to be able to keep people there as long as they want .
OLBERMANN : You have told us before , others have said before , the U.S. never really had enough troops or equipment or anything else there to actually succeed in Iraq .
Would 28 brigades somehow be better ?
Could that kind of increase , on some short - term basis , actually help ?
RIECKHOFF : It s possible .
But I think the problem with that is , it falls into this idea that troops are the answer .
It s not some kind of geopolitical cup of soup or where you just add troops and things are going to get better .
We need to complement troops with diplomatic options , economic options , some kind of international support .
And at this point , it may not work anyway .
So 28 brigades is not the solution , in my opinion .
But also , it s unsustainable .
Our military is so dramatically overextended , the 28 brigades will really break an already breaking military .
Youve got about four brigades from the National Guard whove just been called up for a second time .
By the end of the year , youll probably have nine .
And we have to think about the long - term damage this is going to have on our military that will extend far beyond Iraq and may ultimately jeopardize our national security in other places .
OLBERMANN : All right , weve gone from 12 - month tours to 15 - month tours .
Are we getting close to the premise of the Joseph Heller novel  Catch - 22  , that just as soon as the flying men from the Second World War in that fictional account reach the number of missions required to fly , you simply raise the number of missions required to fly ?
Are we doing that with the troops now ?
We are as soon as they get close to the number of months served required before they can go home , we just raise the number of months served required ?
RIECKHOFF : Absolutely .
I mean , the expectations that weve put on our troops have , quite honestly , been ridiculous .
And its hard to keep retention numbers , its hard to recruit new people , when you dont stand by your word .
And the military is starting to lose confidence and starting to lose its faith in our civilian leadership .
It s hard to work toward a goal line that keeps moving back every time .
And it s really having a tremendous impact on the families , where divorce rates are skyrocketing and people coming home are already facing wounds and post - traumatic stress disorder .
We re just running this military so hard .
And the people are really showing tremendous signs of wear .
OLBERMANN : And finally , Paul , speaking of betraying words , whats the reaction you re getting ?
What are you expecting from troops about the fact that the Democrats have dropped out of the timeline business , and the president can waive any benchmarks in that Iraq funding bill ?
RIECKHOFF : Well , beyond the political posturing , I think they re happy the moneys coming .
I think the president was effective in structuring this or framing this so it looked like if the veto went through , troops wouldnt be getting the money .
Whether that s true or not is debatable .
But I think the troops , at the end of the day , are happy the moneys coming so they can get the funding that theyll need throughout the summer .
And they expect another round of partisan bickering and political cheap when the fall comes back and the politicians get back at it again while our guys are on their third and fourth tour .
OLBERMANN : Do you have any sense of this being a disaster , in terms of ending , or beginning the end of this conflict ?
RIECKHOFF : No , I dont really think that this is the beginning of the end .
I think it shows that theres a lot of integrity problems within the Democratic Party .
And they still , as a party , havent figured out what their position is and what their tactics are going to be in taking on this president , and how they re going to go back to their districts and explain that they did take the position of defunding the war .
If they re going to do it , theyve got to do it , but they re in this middle ground , and I think they re really losing the political battle , even among their own constituents .
OLBERMANN : Paul Rieckhoff , Iraq
War veteran , now executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America .
As always , Paul , great thanks .
RIECKHOFF : Thank you , Keith .

The Pistols ' hits included Pretty Vacant
In a handwritten note posted on their website , they called the institution " urine in wine " .
" We 're not your monkeys , we 're not coming .
You 're not paying attention , " continued the statement .
The band , named as inductees alongside Blondie , Herb Alpert and Black Sabbath , were due to take part in an induction ceremony in New York on 13 March .
Executive director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation , Susan Evans , said : " They are being the outrageous punksters they are , and that 's rock ' n ' roll . "
' Old famous '
The note further criticised the Hall of Fame for offering " fame at $ 25,000 if we paid for a table or $ 15,000 to squeak up in the gallery " .
It further claimed that the money " goes to a non-profit organisation , selling us a load of old famous " .
A Hall of Fame representative said each inductee gets two free tickets , with additional ones costing $ 2,500 ( £ 1,432 ) .
The group 's letter acknowledged that the organisation 's judges are anonymous , but denounced them as " music industry people " .
The Sex Pistols , including Johnny Rotten , returned in 1996
Pistols lead singer Johnny Rotten once famously derided the rock ' n ' roll institution as " a place where old rockers go to die " , dubbing it the " Rock and Roll Hall of Shame " .
The Sex Pistols ' notorious hits from the late 1970s include Pretty Vacant and God Save The Queen , while they released just one album before splitting .
They reformed for a tour in 1996 , and came back in 2002 to re-release God Save The Queen to coincide with the Golden Jubilee .
This was followed with a brief tour of the US a year later .
Musicians for the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , based in Cleveland , Ohio , are considered for induction 25 years after their first recording .
A shortlist of nominees is sent to an international body of about 700 voting " rock experts " .
Following the 1997 agreement between Apple and Microsoft , there was a surface appearance that the two companies were now working as partners instead of rivals .
In many ways , this was actually true .
Microsoft not only delivered the critically important update of Office 98 for the Mac , but also invested in developing Internet Explorer 4.0 , which shipped with Microsoft 's Java virtual machine for the Mac OS .
Without Microsoft , Apple would have been left to rewrite ClarisWorks , develop its own Java VM , and try to salvage the remains of its OpenDoc - based Cyberdog web browser , which it had just retired months earlier .
Alternatively , Apple could also depend on other third parties , including Sun for Java and Netscape for its web browser .
As Apple headed towards apparent ruin however , third parties were increasingly dismissive of the Mac platform , making the agreement with Microsoft extremely important .
Two Birds , One Stone
Microsoft also benefitted from the deal ; with a relatively small amount of work , it could maintain its cross-platform Office hegemony and earn back hundreds of million of dollars in profit .
While it made no direct profits from continued development of the free Internet Explorer , establishing it as the default browser on the Mac helped to neutralize two competitive threats in one blow : Netscape and Sun .
Using the Mac platform helped Microsoft to jump from minimal market share with its second rate Internet Explorer 3.0 browser to simply obliterating Netscape Navigator within three years .
Netscape 's fall was in part due to its own problems , but Microsoft 's move was so swift and deadly that it prompted analysts and commentators to jump in line to assure the industry that Microsoft could simply do whatever it planned , and nobody stood any chance against it .
Veni , Vidi , Vici
History reveals that partnering with Microsoft is like accepting a dinner invitation from Hannibal Lecter .
One might as well just roll in seasonings and jump in the oven .
Course 1 : the Desktop OS Monopoly
• Microsoft snared CP / M code to sell as DOS , then blocked Digital Research from competing with its own product .
• Microsoft partnered with IBM to use it as a vehicle for establishing its purloined MS - DOS as a standard .
• After Compaq cloned IBM 's hardware , Microsoft dumped IBM to court PC clone makers .
• Microsoft used its remaining charms to get IBM to develop OS / 2 as its DOS replacement .
•
After hiring away VMS engineers , Microsoft used that company 's technology in NT , and dumped IBM's OS / 2 .
• NeXTSTEP , Solaris / Intel , and BeOS were all prevented from competing through exclusive OEM contracts .
Course 2 : the Office Suite Monopoly
• Leveraging that monopoly , Microsoft used Windows 95 APIs to destroy any market for DOS and OS / 2 software .
• Microsoft delivered Windows versions of its Mac Office apps , defeating Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 and WordPerfect .
•
Using proprietary file formats and exclusive bundling , Microsoft prevented any room for Office competitors .
Course 3 : the Windows Server Monopoly
• Microsoft partnered with -- and then threw away -- SpyGlass to ship its Mosaic code as Internet Explorer .
• Tying Internet Explorer to Windows , Microsoft was able to kill Netscape as a web platform threat .
• Microsoft partnered with -- then disposed of Sun -- to present Java as a Windows - bound technology .
And for Dessert : QuickTime
After rapidly devouring a series of partners who first tried to cooperate , and then ineffectually resisted only after being beaten senseless and thrown into the soup , Microsoft next turned its attention to Apple 's QuickTime .
Just like Sun's Java , QuickTime threatened Microsoft 's Windows monopoly by offering a way for developers to build code that was not dependent upon Microsoft .
However , the real interest in swallowing QuickTime was n't so Microsoft could provide its own set of media content tools .
Microsoft did n't even see " content authoring " as a market worth entering ; it had other plans in mind .
In contrast , Apple aimed QuickTime at media publishing from the beginning .
Just as Adobe 's PostScript had fueled the desktop publishing revolution , Apple intended QuickTime to act as an enabling technology to deliver the next generation of publishing : audio and video .
QuickTime : Designed to Create
QuickTime is n't a just playback system or file format , but an entire architecture for working with synchronized , time - based media .
To illustrate how QuickTime works , compare media creation with print production :
Desktop publishing applications used the PostScript language to draw two dimensional graphics , save the drawings to a file , or print them .
PostScript contains an editable recipe for assembling the graphical design it stores .
Graphics saved into a playback - only file such as a JPEG can no longer be freely modified ; while PostScript files contain all the information needed to rearrange and edit the document , JPEG only offers a viewable snapshot of a finished result .
Multimedia publishing applications similarly use QuickTime to organize a timeline of video , audio , effects , subtitles , and programing , then save them to a file or output them as audio or interactive videos .
A specialized " .MOV " movie file format was designed for QuickTime as a media container file .
Any number of data streams encoded using any available codec can be assembled into tracks within a .MOV container file .
In other words , an MP3 song , a series of JPEG photos , and an MPEG video track can all be layered within a QuickTime .MOV container file without recoding any of them into a different format ; it merely acts as an envelope .
The QuickTime container file was unique in that it was designed specifically to allow editing tracks without needing to rewrite the file for playback .
Files can even reference data stored in other files .
This flexibility was included to make QuickTime a complete and sophisticated authoring environment , not just a playback - only system .
Video for Windows : Designed to Fill Space
After Apple demonstrated its new QuickTime technology in 1991 , Microsoft rushed to deliver its own competing system called Video for Windows ; it arrived a year after Apple shipped QuickTime .
Apple also announced plans to port QuickTime to Windows , to allow media files to play back cross-platform .
Microsoft saw little value in developing a complex framework for sophisticated media creation ; it merely wanted to deliver the appearance of similar video playback features .
Video for Windows introduced the .AVI container format , which like QuickTime 's .
MOV , can contain chunks of media using a variety of different codecs .
Today , .AVI is used primarily in video file sharing ; users commonly make the mistake of comparing the popular DivX video that .AVI files often hold with the .MOV QuickTime container file , and jump to the conclusion that “ DivX is better than QuickTime , ” when they are really not comparable at all .
DivX encoded video can also be put into a .MOV file , and QuickTime can also open the simpler .AVI container .
Both simply require installing the necessary codecs to allow decoding of the contained audio or video format .
AVI does not offer any sort of sophisticated support for authoring however , and is really just a recycled version of IFF , created in the mid 80s .
This severely limited .AVI as codecs became more sophisticated .
Microsoft's Video for Windows was only intended to fill space in the playback market and direct attention away from QuickTime .
Since it was built on top of Windows , it was forced to use the unsophisticated graphics subsystem Windows provided , with poor results .
QuickTime for Windows vs QuickTime for Video for Windows
Apple brought QuickTime to Windows by simply porting large chunks of the Macintosh 's native drawing system .
QuickTime performance on Windows was vastly better than Microsoft 's Video for Windows because Apple bypassed the GDI Windows graphics subsystem .
Microsoft and Intel were both shocked to find that Apple could deliver smooth video on the PC that was beyond what either company had imagined to be possible .
When Microsoft requested a free license for QuickTime for Windows in 1993 , Apple refused .
Meanwhile , Intel wanted to accelerate Microsoft 's Video for Windows in hardware .
It approached Apple 's partner Canyon to develop a video driver that would provide similar performance to QuickTime .
While knowing that Canyon possessed Apple 's code , Intel did not specify that Canyon needed to do clean room development , and gave the company an unrealistically short timeframe to develop the code .
As expected , Canyon simply delivered Apple 's code to Intel , which then licensed it to Microsoft .
When Video for Windows suddenly improved in 1994 , Apple investigated and found that Microsoft had simply stolen code from QuickTime in order to compete with QuickTime .
Apple sued and won an injunction that stopped Microsoft from distributing portions of the stolen code , and the case was eventually resolved as part of the 1997 agreement between the two companies .
A New Round of Competition
Apple continued to develop QuickTime and expand its features with QuickTime VR , music synthesis features , and sprite animation tracks .
Apple engineers also began work on “ QuickTime interactive , ” which planned to embed a HyperCard programing track into movies .
Apple was beginning to lose its product - oriented focus and ended up with a lot of raw technology development with no clear application .
This peaked with the Copland fiasco and contributed toward an exodus of engineering talent .
Bruce Leak , who pioneered QuickTime development at Apple , left in 1995 to help start WebTV .
In early 1997 , Microsoft bought WebTV .
Meanwhile , Microsoft had renamed its tainted Video for Windows to ActiveMovie , to fit the Active branding associated with its various Internet efforts :
• ActiveX , which exposed OLE scripting to insecure networks and ushered in a new world of web - based malware • Active Channel , which intended to Push subscription - based ads , turning the web into another TV • Active Desktop , which replaced the Windows desktop with an Internet Explorer web browser view
In order to suggest the appearance of real competition to QuickTime , Microsoft promised to deliver a version of ActiveMovie for the Mac , assuring the market that it would serve as a drop in replacement for QuickTime .
Microsoft promised a wide range of features that matched QuickTime 's , including a copy of QTVR called Surround Video .
The company never delivered it , nor did it ever ship ActiveMovie for the Mac .
It was all vaporware .

Office monopoly leverage against Apple to not only smash the cross-platform threat of Netscape Navigator and Sun 's Java , but also to kill Apple ’s QuickTime .
QuickTime was still at version 2.x , where it had been stuck since 1994 ; it was nearly as out of date as Microsoft 's Mac Office .
Microsoft assured Apple that it was n't interested in QuickTime 's core business of multimedia authoring , but only wanted to own media playback technology , particularly on Windows .
Prior to the July 1997 agreement , Microsoft 's Christopher Phillips famously told QuickTime manager Peter Hoddie , " we want you to knife the baby . "
Apple refused , and QuickTime survived the Mac Office and patent licensing deal intact .
That was not the end of Microsoft 's assault on QuickTime however , but rather only the beginning .
Give It Up , Or We'll Take It
In the Microsoft monopoly trial , Apple 's Avie Tevanian , Phil Schiller and Tim Schaaff all testified that Microsoft had approached them repeatedly , offering to allow Apple to keep QuickTime authoring if the company agreed to pull out of the media player market .
After Apple repeatedly refused to drop QuickTime for Windows , Microsoft made it clear that if Apple did not hand over media playback to Microsoft , the company would throw its weight into developing its own authoring tools and simply obliterate Apple .
Deposition testimony reported that Eric Engstrom , Microsoft 's manager of multimedia technology , threatened that “ if necessary , Microsoft would assign 150 engineers to an authoring development project in order to displace Apple from that market . ”
At that time , Apple 's entire QuickTime group only had around 100 engineers .
Engstrom reported that Bill Gates was not interested in an authoring program because the market for was too small .
He assured them , however , that “ if Microsoft needed to make an investment in providing authoring tools in order to push Apple out of the playback market , then the company would devote all the necessary resources to accomplish that goal . ”
“ We 're going to compete fiercely on multimedia playback , and we wo n't let anybody [ else ] have playback in Windows .
We consider that part of the operating system , so you 're going to have to give up multimedia playback on Windows , ” Engstrom repeated in a phone conversation .
Apple Fights Back
Apple was already facing the enormous development challenge of retooling NeXTSTEP to serve the needs of Mac users .
That effort was turning out to be far more difficult than anticipated , not only from an engineering standpoint , but also because the outlook for the Mac market was looking increasingly bleak .
Apple 's largest Mac developers were expressing doubts about supporting the Rhapsody plan , and demanded that Apple reinvent an entirely new operating system that looked more like Copland .
As NeXT began rebuilding Apple from the inside out , QuickTime was discovered to be one of the company 's key assets , and efforts were taken to modernize and overhaul it .
Work on version 3.0 was revamped ; it downsized the QTi plans to integrate HyperCard , while still providing for a new level of interaction within movies .
It also expanded to provide a wide range of graphic file format importers , added effect tracks , support for FireWire , and included licenses for high quality Sorenson video and QDesign audio codecs .
Like every other project at the new NeXT - flavored Apple , efforts were made to incorporate support for open standards .
Despite the renewed efforts to update QuickTime , it had fallen into in a distant third place in the multimedia market that Apple had originally invented back in 1991 .
Microsoft made rapid gains on QuickTime simply by bundling its own media playback software with Windows .
Given Apple 's weak position , why would Microsoft even bother threatening Apple over playback ?
The Real Reason Why Microsoft Wanted QuickTime 's Share
At the time , it appeared that the real money in media was going to be made from Internet streaming and playback , not in content authoring , which still belonged to Apple .
The lack of any real competition in authoring was one of the reasons QuickTime had survived .
Microsoft targeted streaming after watching RealNetworks surpass Apple in delivering audio and then video streaming technology .
In 1997 , Real was the dominate leader , with 85 % of the streaming market .
Microsoft planned to use everything at its disposal to kill Real and take that market .
That meant using its Windows monopoly to distribute its own media streaming software , but also using its Office monopoly to force Apple to drop QuickTime and act as another distributor of its own Windows Media .
Microsoft followed the same strategy against Real that it used against Netscape : give away free client software tied to Windows , then use that installed base of users to sell proprietary server software that only worked on Windows servers .
In the case of streaming video , Microsoft wanted to sell its Net Show server to stream data to Windows Media Players using its proprietary and undocumented streaming protocols , providing no room for interoperable competition .
Advanced Streaming Format
When Apple failed to support its plans , Microsoft determined to obliterate QuickTime entirely .
The company began work on Advanced Streaming Format , a new container format to replace the quaint and archaic .AVI used in ActiveMovie née Video for Windows .
ActiveMovie itself was being renamed again to DirectShow , to shake the performance problems associated with it , and also give it the Direct brand used in Windows 98 for components that dealt directly with hardware :
• Direct3D , Microsoft 's proprietary alternative to OpenGL for 3D graphics , particularly in games • DirectX , the remainder of video game related development tools bound to Windows
Microsoft's DirectShow frameworks , the Windows Media Player client , and the new ASF container format were all components designed to compete against what Apple collectively referred to as QuickTime .
One Ring to Bind Them All
Microsoft planned to establish its ASF container format as the ISO standard for the new MPEG - 4 specification , giving itself a head start in developing the servers and players for everything that would use it .
The ASF container file is also the basis for Windows Media Video and Windows Media Audio file formats , which Microsoft planned to use to replace all existing , standard , and DRM - free formats including DivX video and MP3 audio .
WMA and WMV files are ASF files .
ASF is tightly bound to Windows Media and the Janus DRM developed to shepherd the world ’s content .
It would be enforced by Palladium , the impossibly secure new version of PC which would n’t allow anything that had n’t been approved by central command .
The world appeared headed toward a future where Microsoft decreed all standards , built all standards , deployed all standards , policed all standards , and charged for all standards .
Fortunately , its plans did n't work out as expected .
Apple Gets
In the Way
MPEG , the Moving Picture Experts Group , had worked to codify a series of industry standards for audio , video , and other technical specifications with the ISO :
• MPEG - 1 was used in CD - ROMs and VCD • MPEG - 2 was used by DVDs and in cable and satellite TV broadcasting • MPEG - 3 was intended for use in HDTV , but later canceled after MPEG - 2 was found suitable • MPEG - 4 was in the planing stages for delivering media over the Internet and on mobile devices
MPEG standards are not free , but they share interoperable technology at a low cost .
Royalties for encoding and decoding , and broadcasting or distributing encoded content , are in the ballpark of a $ 1 per product .
Those royalties are shared among the two dozen companies that pooled their patents to build the standards .
Microsoft 's plans to establish its new ASF as the basis of MPEG - 4 were dashed when Apple submitted its own QuickTime container format .
Apple partnered with Sun , IBM , Oracle , Silicon Graphics and Netscape to submit the format , which was accepted by the ISO in February 1998 , despite vigorous opposition from Microsoft .
Apple 's partnership with the industry enraged Microsoft because it sidelined ASF .
Who would now pay to license an unproven container format that was n't compatible with anything else ?
Suddenly , nobody had any compelling need to support Windows Media at all .
Microsoft Sabotages QuickTime on Windows
While Microsoft was pressing Apple to withdraw from the media playback market , " Microsoft took several steps to sabotage QuickTime , " reported Tevanian in his monopoly trial testimony .
Microsoft 's sabotage " included creating misleading error messages and introducing technical bypasses that deprived QuickTime of the opportunity to process certain types of multimedia files .
In some instances users were left with the false impression that QuickTime was not functioning properly . "
Microsoft lawyers insisted that Tevanian could not provide conclusive proof that Microsoft was trying to sabotage Quicktime , asking , " Is n't it a fact , Dr. Tevanian , that you have no personal knowledge or basis to assert that any of the incompatibilities were created to do anything to harm QuickTime ? "
The message in question was a warning Windows 95 presented after the installation of QuickTime , stating that some file types might no longer play , and offering to reinstall Microsoft 's player as the default media application .
That was n't an isolated incident , as Microsoft 's legal team tried to suggest .
If It ’s Broke , Do n’t Fix It
In 1997 , Tevanian emailed Gates saying , " I 've learned that IE4 on Windows disables QuickTime and QuickTime VR .
My understanding is that IE4 sets the default for .MOV files to be ActiveMovie instead of QuickTime .
As you know , .MOV files have long been QuickTime files .
Can you look into this and get it reversed ? "
Gates forwarded the email around internally within Microsoft , adding , " I want to get as much mileage as possible out of our browser and JAVA relationship here .
In other words a real advantage against SUN and Netscape .
Who should Avie be working with ?
Do we have a clear plan what we want Apple to do to undermine SUN ? "
A year later , Microsoft later reported that it had " discovered bugs " that might be to blame , but as problems between Windows and QuickTime continued , Microsoft recommended to Apple that it rewrite its QuickTime plugin as a proprietary ActiveX control in order to work properly with Internet Explorer .
Apple had no significant problems with Netscape 's browser .
In the trial , Apple presented a chart of 22 media file types , all of which were passed to QuickTime by Netscape 4 on Windows 95 .
In Internet Explorer 3 however , only 15 were passed to the QuickTime plugin ; in IE 4.0 only 11 were passed , and under Windows 98 , only 4 .
Blame Apple !
Microsoft later issued a fix that addressed problems it was apparently unable to communicate to Apple within the previous year , along with a press release that blamed all of the problems on Apple :
" Though it is clearly not Microsoft 's responsibility to provide fixes to another vendor 's product , we decided to offer the fix to customers because we feel they should not pay the price for Apple 's programming mistakes , groundless allegations and courtroom antics . "
Paul Thurrott was quick to regurgitate the press release and announce his firm conviction that the testimony about Microsoft 's sabotage of QuickTime was merely an invention and that all Microsoft ever wanted was for everyone to just get along .
“ The heavy weight of Microsoft Office once again swings like a guillotine over Apple Computer , ” he wrote in celebration .
Microsoft Threatens QuickTime Partners
In addition to providing roadblocks to QuickTime running on Windows , Microsoft also worked to stop QuickTime by threatening its partners to abandon licensing , distribution , or development of anything related to QuickTime , or else prepare to face the retribution Microsoft could deliver .
Hardware : Microsoft leaned on its Windows PC OEMs to prevent them from bundling QuickTime ; trial testimony revealed specifically how Microsoft took quick steps to block Compaq 's licensing of QuickTime .
While Compaq was enthusiastic about licensing QuickTime to help differentiate its PCs from those of rivals , after Microsoft heard about the plans and expressed its disapproval , the company suddenly withdrew and refused to continue any talks with Apple .
Applications : Microsoft also jumped on Avid Cinema , a new consumer video editing product based on QuickTime that long time Apple partner Avid was preparing to release .
Microsoft told Avid engineers , " You need to rip QuickTime out of your product if you want to be in this channel . "
Months later , Avid announced a partnership with Microsoft on its new AAF format for multimedia authoring .
Drivers : Microsoft also pounced on Truevision , a video capture card vendor .
After learning that the company was developing QuickTime drivers for its video capture cards , Microsoft invested in the company with the proviso that the company could not market , brand , or refer to the drivers as a QuickTime driver , and could only bundle them with a specific application , not offer the drivers for sale separately .
Advanced Authoring Format
Microsoft had backed up its threats to jump into the media authoring business to kill QuickTime entirely by developing the Advanced Authoring Format , the last missing component of Microsoft 's rival offerings .
In June 1998 , Microsoft advised Apple that its only remaining choice in the matter would be to agree to a broad technology sharing plan that donated its technology to Microsoft and abandoned its own competitive efforts :
• Apple had to agree to cross-license its codecs and collaborate with Microsoft on all future codec development • Apple had to adopt Microsoft 's DirectX run-time platform on Windows in place of QuickTime • Apple had to adopt Microsoft 's proprietary streaming technology •
Apple had to adopt Microsoft 's new proprietary AAF file format for media authoring
With the entire industry left cowering under the domination of Microsoft and its force - fed AAF , Apple realized that if it wanted any hope of a chance to face the threat of Microsoft obliterating QuickTime , it would need to own its own applications that made use of it .
The Beginning of the End
Steve Jobs refused Microsoft 's demands , and set in place efforts to mount an open , rival attack on Microsoft 's multifaceted assault againsts QuickTime .
Apple became the first company to stare Microsoft down , and the showdown established Apple as an impossible to ignore competitor , providing a model for other companies to follow in challenging the once unquestionable position Microsoft held as a monopoly tyrant standing above the law .
While almost completely invisible for years , Apple ’s progress in media has resulted in overturning Microsoft ’s domination of the entertainment industry , established a resistance to unchecked DRM , and has extinguished Microsoft ’s efforts to establish new proprietary technologies as de facto industry standards .
The trigger unleashing this retribution was actually pulled by Microsoft .

HUMOR : Granny Picks Linux / KDE
Over Windows , OS/X , FreeBasd , Next Step , etc. G ranny P icks L inux Over Windows , OS/X , FreeBSD ...
Granny heads out on a new adventure and realizes there 's nothing so sweet as Linux running KDE .
Read more of our Reallylinux.com Granny Files : Linux Makes Granny Cry and Even Granny Has Linux Installed and Granny Dumps MS - Office for Star - Office .
H ello my dear Linux friend ,
Thank you for stopping in to read my newest thoughts about Linux and that very easy to learn and use KDE desktop .
I want to share an adventure I had thanks to my son .
I 'll be the first to admit that I do n't get out much .
Between my rheumatism , bursitis , and my rather clunky hip , going to the bathroom is an adventure in itself .
But I did indeed go last week .
Thanks to my son's perseverance and patience I was finally able to visit his office .
I 'm very proud of him and all of those brilliant computer people .
I think people who write computer programs are absolutely amazing !
It all began last Friday , when Jason , that 's my big boy , drove me to his office .
We began the tour downstairs and Jason showed me where the receptionists spend their days .
I met a nice blonde gal named Susie .
She was a pretty little lady although a bit thin .
As I approached her , I thought she might be great for Jason until ...
She let out an " Oh , sh$@ ! "
It shocked me so much that I had to sit down right there on the floor of the lobby .
Susie , such a sweet looking young gal , seemed so upset .
She apologized and helped me up and then went back to working .
As Jason held my arm keeping me steady , dear little Susie yelped again .
This time I was thankfully holding on to the front desk and Jason had my arm .
When I asked this young lady what was bothering her so greatly , she pushed her monitor slightly so I could have a look .
All I saw was a bright blue screen with some jibberish text .
I did n't have my glasses on so I can't tell you what it said , but the message must have been quite upsetting to make a nice young gal spew such harsh words !
I looked up at Jason who was still holding my arm , and he softly said , " Windows , mom . "
Now I finally understood why this sweet young gal suffered so .
I opened my purse and handed little Susie , my goodness how thin and pale she looked , a Knoppix Live Linux CD .
" Here you are honey .
This will help cheer you up . "
I wanted to share some of my raisin and date snack with this young emaciated gal , but Jason was already pulling me along to the next stop .
If that poor girl knew how easy and compatible using OpenOffice is , or the stability of Linux she would be a lot better off .
We walked a few steps down the hall and entered a large room filled with posters , pictures , signs , and paper everywhere .
I had never seen such a clutter and immediately began to pick up papers that had fallen on the floor or been thrown together in untidy piles on nearby desks .
Jason kept insisting I stop cleaning up and meet his friends .
One of the gentleman , a tall stout man , stood and greeted me .
He was very well dressed and impressively courteous .
I turned the corner to peak at his monitor .
He was designing a sphere of some kind with many details .
It looked like he was painting a picture of a planet and I was quite impressed by the beauty and the detail .
I asked him how long it took to draw this pretty sphere , to which he replied , " oh , a couple of days . "
I could n't believe my ears .
How could a sphere like this take him so long ?
I shook my head in disbelief .
Jason tried to explain that he was creating three dimentional figgy majiggy , but it did n't matter .
I told that young man he should be ashamed of taking so much time to draw a sphere .
Oh , if I had my KDE running Gimp I could draw a sphere with shading , directional lighting and floating star background in just a few minutes .
Jason kept insisting the graphic was much more complex than all that , but I would n't have it .
I told that young man to get cracking or his employer may crack a few with his whip !
Of course it would also not hurt if instead of paying a lot of money for all that fancy software he was using , he could enjoy the benefits from free open source programs .
Next we stepped into a fancy elevator .
" Is this where you work Jason ? "
" No mom , I 'm on the next floor up , this is the computer room . "
" You work all the way up top then ! " I was so proud of my son .
As we stepped out we were greeted by a burly man , bearded and soft spoken .
He welcomed us and asked if I would like to see the computer room .
I was n't sure I could keep walking like this , even with my prosthetic shoes .
But he kindly grabbed my hand and led me into a very large and noisy room .
It was so cold I felt my bones freeze up .
I was told this was the server room and that all of these machines were running free BS .
Jason kept insisting I refer to it as Dee , he said , " no mom , it 's Free BS Dee . "
But I could n't figure how some lady named Dee could conceive of such a thing .
All I noticed was that these machines were apparently running so hot using this Dee software that the room was set to arctic frost .
The big burly man explained how the major part of his day is spent making sure the servers are all up and running .
I began to share with him how I never have to worry about my Linux server at home .
I asked him if he could show me the monitor he uses .
He walked me over to a large cabinet and pulled out a keyboard and flicked on the monitor .
I understand why this poor man had to keep standing even to use his computer in such an extremely cold room .
I felt myself weaken and had trouble standing .
Nevertheless , he quickly showed me some of what he does .
I asked him if he would n't prefer to use a more graphical desktop , and whether he did n't prefer to point and click rather than type so many commands .
He did n't quite understand me , so Jason helped .
" My mom 's quite fond of using Linux running the KDE desktop .
She loves the icons and all . "
To which the burly man smiled in acknowledgment .
I wish I had remembered to share with that gentleman this great article regarding the comparison between FreeBSD and Linux as web servers .
Well , off we went .
It was finally time for me to visit Jason 's office .
I wished the nice man farewell and walked back into the elevator .
As we stepped out , Jason met another of his friends .
They were all so courteous and friendly .
Everyone was on such good terms , calling each other by their first names and patting each other on the back .
Jason led me into a room that looked more like a dumping ground for computer parts .
In the corner , on the only clean desk , was a large black cube with a monitor , printer and other fancy gadgets .
" What 's that Jason , " I asked , pointing at the black cube .
" Oh , that 's the next machine , " Jason responded matter - of - factly .
I was excited to be able to see the future and pleaded with Jason to let me try out this next machine before we moved on .
He did n't seem to be very interested .
But he compliantly pushed up a chair and told me to enjoy .
I thought the black mouse was very fancy and the whole system was quite spectacular looking .
Jason typed his name and password and then told me to try out a few things .
I was impressed by the uncluttered desktop .
It was very pretty to look at .
I clicked a few icons and then suddenly was shocked to hear a woman 's voice .
" Your printer is out of paper . "
" Your printer is out of paper . "
" What 's this all about , " I demanded of Jason .
This next system talked with such femininity and seductiveness I began to worry about all of these young vulnerable men .
I demanded to know who had concocted such a machine that it would try to seduce men and distract them with a female voice .
Jason told me it was made by the same man who had led the creation of those systems the artists were using .
" He 's trying to distract you men from working !
You need to get a practical computer that fosters work ! "
Jason just shook his head .
Then he grabbed my arm and gently led me into his office next door .
There I saw several systems all running that familiar and comforting KDE desktop .
I sat down and let out a sigh .
I asked Jason if I could send aunt Bertha an email using Kmail to share my adventure .
I clicked a few icons , typed away in glee , then sent off my note .
I started Gimp and made a sphere using the script - fu , added a few extra lighting effects , used supernova to create a few dozen brilliant stars and showed Jason what I had been telling his friend from downstairs .
Jason just smiled .
Then I started his Kwrite and began typing my adventure of the day so I would not forget .
Time flew as I played with more and more applications that I was so familiar with in the KDE environment .
" All these wonderful free programs , " I thought to myself as I opened application after application .
All too soon it was time for me to head back home .
I needed to take my medicine and to have a few hours of snoozing before dinner .
Jason had shown me so many wonderful and interesting things .
I begged him to go back and check on that poor little Susie .
Jason assured me he intended to check her out every day .
Thankfully , I was back at home and my last act before going to sleep was to kiss my monitor and say a word of thanks that I had a computer with Linux / KDE that treated me so kindly .
So ends my adventure of the week .
I must admit I enjoyed seeing so many different computers , but nothing could ever replace my friendly and familiar Linux / KDE .
Love ,

今日、まさにまさにそうだなあと思う瞬間がありました。
FPNさんの楽天がWEB2.0で楽天2.0という記事見出しを見て、
「 APIは2.0だけど楽天がやってもなんか2.0って感じがしない」
と思ったのですが、これはまさにはてながメルマガをやったら2.0と感じる逆のことで、
「 1.0だと思われている企業が2.0的なことをやっても、2.0だとは思われないことがある」
のでは、と思いました。
今後と1.0だと思われている企業がぞくぞくと2.0的なことをやっていくと、そのこと自体が1.0的に感じるようになっていく気がします。
Think of it as Hollywood ’s version of a salary cap .
With moviegoing declining and production costs skyrocketing , studio executives are taking a harder look at the industry ’s most cherished and costliest perk : first - dollar gross profit .
The practice of giving A - listers first dibs on a studio’s box - office take has long allowed the industry ’s top actors , writers and producers to grab the bulk of a movie ’s total receipts well before a studio has earned back its investment .
But what ’s been good for the likes of Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg has become increasingly problematic for studio executives .
In a move that some leading talent agents say would have been unthinkable just a few years back , studios are now placing a hard cap -- usually about 25 % -- on how much of a film ’s revenue will be split with the talent .
A growing number of studio deal makers also are eliminating the old pay system on a broad spectrum of projects , suggesting instead that actors , directors and producers essentially become financial partners in a movie ’s making .

The upshot of these new deals , which are called cash break - even , is simple :
If the film is a hit , the directors , lead actors , writers and others will enjoy an even richer payday , but only after the studio has recouped its investment .
If it ’s a bomb , the studio will be spared the ignoble task of cutting bonus checks on a money - losing dog .
“ The economics are evolving in the movie business , ” said Adam Goodman , production chief at DreamWorks SKG .
“ Everybody has to recognize that . ”
The new formula is being used in deals for several upcoming features , including Walt Disney Co. 's big - budget “ Pirates of the Caribbean ” sequels and Steven Soderbergh ’s $ 30 - million , black - and - white World War II drama “ The Good German , ” which stars George Clooney .
Disney ’s dealings on its “ Pirates of the Caribbean ” movies dramatize why the new formula makes sense for the studios .
It will cost Disney some $ 600 million to make and market the next two “ Pirates ” films , the first of which comes out this summer .
For example , if Disney were to pay star Johnny Depp , director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer under the old formula , the studio would pocket only about 70 cents on every dollar coming in .

At that rate , Disney might not recover its investment for years .
But under the new formula , the studio will keep 100 % of the revenue until it is reimbursed for its costs .
After that , Disney will split the remaining proceeds with the film ’s cast and creators -- which could yield a windfall far greater than they might have received under the old system .
( Director Michael Bay struck a similar deal on “ Pearl Harbor , ” and his ultimate payday exceeded $ 40 million . )
“ The budgets [ of big movies ] are just too high , ” said Disney production chief Nina Jacobson , who declined to comment on the “ Pirates ” deal .
“ You can find yourself , under a traditional first - dollar gross deal , writing huge checks while you are bleeding .
It just does n’t seem fair .
It feels great to be writing checks in success .
But it kills you to be writing checks in failure . ”
Talent agents and show business lawyers are skeptical of the shift .
They fear the new contract terms are another way for the studios to amass more profit for themselves while sharing fewer proceeds with the people who actually dream up and make the movies .
After all , Hollywood studios have a reputation for getting creative with their bookkeeping .

Peter Nelson , an entertainment industry lawyer whose clients include Peter Jackson of “ King Kong ” and Andrew Adamson , the filmmaker behind “ The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , ” worries that the new compensation formula is more an accounting ruse than a true partnership .
“ The studios have made a fine art out of creating contract definitions that have no relation to reality , ” Nelson said .
“ These definitions just create new profit streams for the studios . ”
He notes that even though studios complain that mid-priced dramas have become the most financially risky productions , the studios are pushing for the new pay formula on high - budget franchise films .
“ If the middle movies are the ones where the studios are getting hurt , why are n’t the studios pushing for cash break - even on those movies , rather than on the big movies , where they are theoretically making most of their money ? ”
Nelson asked .

The new formula is one of many strategies that Hollywood is employing to improve its movie margins as it grapples with growing costs , declining ticket sales and slowing growth in ancillary markets , such as DVD sales .
Warner Bros. , for example , has enlisted Wall Street investors to split the budgets on some of its priciest productions , including “ Batman Begins ” and “ Superman Returns . ”
The speed in which Hollywood ’s deal - making sands are shifting is evident when it comes to writer - director Nancy Meyers and her movie “ Holiday , ” which is due out this Christmas .
When it comes to big romantic comedies , Meyers enjoys one of the best track records in town , putting her in the elite club of first - dollar gross directors .
Her last three films -- “ Something ’s Gotta Give , ” “ What Women Want ” and “ The Parent Trap ” -- were hits , grossing a combined $ 373 million in U.S. theaters .
But when Sony Pictures looked at Meyers ’ latest film ’s budget and its star - laden cast ( Cameron Diaz , Jack Black , Jude Law and Kate Winslet ) , the studio worried that if it paid everyone his or her going rate , “ Holiday ” would have to have to be a blockbuster -- grossing at least $ 200 million -- before Sony would see a dime .
( Studios typically split movie ticket revenue with theater chains . )

So the studio , the director and the actors all settled on the new formula .
Under the film ’s reworked contract , Sony will not pay out any gross profit until the studio has recouped its production , marketing and distribution costs , which are estimated to be more than $ 100 million .
“ If the studio wins , the talent wins , ” said Bob Osher , chief operating officer of Sony ’s Columbia Pictures .
Moviemaking deals that include profit sharing have a rich and storied history , dating to a pact negotiated by legendary talent agent Lew Wasserman for Jimmy Stewart that guaranteed the actor a percentage of the returns of the 1950 movies “ Harvey ” and “ Winchester ’ 73 . ”
In the ensuing years , various actors were given a share in a movie ’s revenue .
But as the studios became more creative with their accounting , people sharing in a film ’s “ net profit ” often discovered that even mammoth blockbusters had somehow become money losers on a studio ’s books , as was the case with “ Batman ” and “ Forrest Gump . ”

During the rise to power of Michael Ovitz and Creative Artist Agency in the 1980s , a larger number of performers and filmmakers were contractually entitled to first - dollar gross , meaning the studios had to share every dollar that passed through the studio tills .
Today , the spreadsheets of studio executives contain as many iterations of the new compensation formula as there are brands of bottled water .
Some of the deals allow the studios to charge for inflated overhead , interest and distribution fees ( as opposed to their actual costs for such services ) , although the best deals for talent do not .
Some contracts mandate that a studio count all of a movie ’s video revenue toward its recoupment , rather than the usual 20 % that is returned to the bottom line .
Rich Klubeck , an agent at United Talent Agency , said the new deal structures might help studios manage costs and make more daring movies .
“ The bargain is the studio takes a lot less risk , ” Klubeck said .
“ And everyone who makes the movie enjoys a bigger [ profit participation ] if it succeeds . ”

Recasting the bottom line
Studios increasingly are steering top - drawer actors and filmmakers away from Hollywood ’s established compensation system , known as first - dollar gross .
The new pay formula , called cash - break - even , allows studios to recoup their costs before sharing revenue with a film ’s creative talent .
Here ’s an illustration of how the two plans work .

First - dollar gross method
*--* Gross revenue to studio : $ 250.0 million Profit shared with filmmakers and cast at 25 % of that revenue : - $ 62.5 million Studio gross revenue : +$ 187.50 million Total cost of making the movie : - $ 190.0 million Studio bottom line : - $ 2.5 million

Cash break - even method
*--* Gross revenue to studio : $ 250.0 million Studio payback for cost of making the movie : -$ 190.0 million
Net revenue for filmmakers , cast and studio : +$ 60.0 million Payments to filmmakers and cast at 50 % of net revenue : - $ 30.0 million Studio bottom line : +$ 30.0 million

Eti Khuman 's face lies cradled on her mother 's shoulder , her cheek resting in against Mina 's collarbone .
Eti is beautiful , but she is poorly : her breathing is heavy , and Mina has the distracted look of a mother who is very worried indeed .
Eti's illness - first vomiting , then diarrhoea - struck without warning .
Like all mothers in Bangladesh , Mina knew to fear diarrhoea : in this country , diarrhoea can kill .
So she wasted no time in bringing her eight - week - old daughter here , to the main diarrhoea hospital near her home in the capital , Dhaka .
Eti was admitted , and now she and Mina are in the main ward , a sweltering room so packed with beds that there is barely space to walk between them .
It 's a general ward , but most of the patients are babies .
Some , like Eti , are being held by their mothers : others lie quietly on their beds attached to drips .
Not one is crying : they are all much too weak for that .
Twenty - five years ago , when Dr Iqbal Kabir first came to work at this hospital , small babies were almost unknown as patients .
Today , he says , infants make up as many as 70 % of admissions .
The reason ?
Kabir shakes his head , and points to a poster on the wall above Eti's bed .
The same poster is displayed , many times , around the ward .
It shows a baby 's bottle , with a big cross drawn heavily through it .
The message is clear .
" Bottlefeeding is harmful , " says Kabir .
" Because bottlefed babies get diarrhoea , since their formula is mixed with dirty water and since their bottles are not sterile .
Do you know how many breastfed babies are admitted here with diarrhoea ?
The number is almost zero . "
Eti has been bottlefed almost since birth : Mina says she wanted to breastfeed , but when she had difficulties there was no one to give advice or support .
Mina 's story was typical of those of many of the mothers I met in Bangladesh : when she hit problems and went to a doctor , the suggestion was to try formula .
In doctors ' surgeries and pharmacies across the country , it seems , health professionals are quick - far too quick , say breastfeeding campaigners - to suggest bottlefeeding as the way forward .
Kabir is appalled by her tale , as he has been appalled many times before : in a perfect world , he'd like to see formula milk and bottles removed from general shops , and available only as a last resort , on prescription .
" It sounds extreme - but then , it sounded extreme when people first talked about banning smoking .
This is the same issue - only with bottlefeeding in my country it 's not consenting adults who die , it 's tiny babies . "
For the moment , though , Kabir 's anger is directed at the manufacturers of baby formula .
Like many of his fellow health professionals , he believes these manufacturers push their products too aggressively , sometimes breaching the stipulations of an international code on the marketing of formula milk drawn up in 1981 , ratified by member states of the World Health Organisation , and enshrined in law in Bangladesh since 1984 .
That code , in turn , had been prompted by public support of an international boycott of the products of the company that seemed most culpable 30 years ago : Nestlé .
The code could have ended the boycott , but campaigners continue to flag it up because , they claim , the company - and many other baby - milk manufacturers - fail to abide by its requirements .
Despite the safeguards it affords , they say , mothers in developing countries - the most vulnerable of mothers anywhere , the ones least able to afford formula milk , the ones whose babies most need the breast milk they could and should be getting for free - were being , and continue to be , targeted by corporate giants bent on carving out their share of a valuable market ( Save the Children , which today publishes a report on the baby - milk industry , reckons that the total value of baby - milk and baby - food imports is worth almost £ 16 m a year in Bangladesh alone - but the potential , if more mothers were bottlefeeding , is a lot higher than that ) .
So , three decades on from the boycott 's inception , I have come to Bangladesh to find out whether Nestlé has - as it claims - changed its behaviour , and is now a reformed organisation , or whether the campaigners have been right to keep up the pressure all these years , not just on Nestlé but on other formula manufacturers too .
Down the road from the diarrhoea hospital is the whitewashed Sajida hospital , a private hospital like the one in which Eti was born .
Giving birth in a private hospital in Bangladesh is n't just for the wealthy - having a baby here costs only a few pounds - but it is staff in hospitals such as this , say campaigners such as Dr Munir Ahmed of Save the Children in Dhaka , who are targeted by reps from the formula companies .
Dr Khaliq Zaman is the paediatrician at the Sajida hospital : yes , he tells us , he receives frequent visits from milk manufacturers , including Nestlé , makers of Lactogen , one of the leading brands in Bangladesh .
" The reps are very aggressive - there are three or four companies , and they come in every two weeks or so , " he says .
" Their main aim is to recommend their product .
Sometimes they bring gifts - Nestlé brought me a big cake at new year .
Some companies give things like pens and notebooks , with their brand name on them .
They try very hard - even though they know I am not interested , that I always recommend breastfeeding , still they come . "
As we talk Zaman holds a pen with the name of a well - known brand of formula milk clearly imprinted on it : the pen is n't expensive , but the giving of all presents to health workers is prohibited under the code .
So , too , is the direct promotion of their products to mothers : and yet , the evidence from Zaman is that Nestlé and other manufacturers are getting their message through to mothers none the less .
Here 's how : on Zaman 's desk , lots of small pads lie scattered : each contains sheets with information about formula milk , plus pictures of the relevant tin .
The idea , he says , is that when a mother comes to him to ask for help with feeding , he will tear a page out of the pad and give it to her .
The mother - who may be illiterate - will then take the piece of paper ( which seems to all intents and purposes a flyer for the product concerned ) to her local shop or pharmacy , and ask for that particular product either by pointing the picture out to the pharmacist or shopkeeper , or by simply searching the shelves for a tin identical to the one in the picture on their piece of paper .
" I 'd never give these pieces of paper out - when I 've got a big enough bundle , I take them home and burn them , " says Zaman .
But that does not mean every other health worker would do the same .
At least three types of Nestlé formula are among the brands whose tear - off pads are on Zaman 's desk .
Nestlé spokesman Robin Tickle denies that tear - off pads equate to promoting Lactogen .
In fact , he says , the device is " essentially a safety measure .
The pads are distributed as information to healthcare workers which ... is allowed under the code .
Individual sheets of these are then indeed handed over to mothers , but only after the infant formula has been prescribed by a doctor . "
He does not accept that the code fails to distinguish between tear - off pads and other sorts of promotion , or that any piece of paper that features a picture of a product a company wants to sell is , arguably , de facto advertising .
The point , he says , is that doctors need - for safety reasons - to make clear to women whether they need Lactogen 1 ( for younger babies ) or Lactogen 2 ( for older ones ) .
So it is n't , then , simply a case of Nestlé exploiting a loophole in the international code ?
Absolutely not , says Tickle : Nestlé is , he says , one of the largest private distributors of information about the benefits of breastfeeding .
And yet , as I tell him , I saw no evidence whatsoever of any Nestlé - sponsored pro-breastfeeding literature , despite spending two days touring hospitals , maternity wards and paediatric clinics : does n't it seem odd that Nestlé is highly efficient at getting its tear - off slips into mothers ' hands in Bangladesh ( there were prescription pads in abundance in many of the places we visited ) , and yet fails , as far as I could tell , in getting them what they could really use , which is information on how to breastfeed ?
And anyway , campaigners question how realistic it is to think that a company such as Nestlé - which has huge amounts of money tied up in formula milk sales - is going to be committed to spreading the " breast is best " gospel .
" The Nestle leaflets with the picture of Lactogen violates the Code if given to mothers , " says Costanza de Toma , author of the Save the Children report .
" The truth is that formula manufacturers are clever - they look for grey areas in the code , and they exploit them . "
Given that the code does not allow them direct access to mothers , she alleges , the companies have become adept at channelling their efforts into getting health workers on side .
In any country , but particularly in a country such as Bangladesh where antenatal education is minimal , and where access to other sources of information is limited , the messages new mothers get from doctors , nurses and midwives are crucial .
Many of the women I met said it was precisely these people who had suggested a move to not just formula in general , but a specific make - often Lactogen .
Samsun Shahida Akhter Rita , 19 , mother of 12 - week - old Mim , told me she had gone to a doctor because she was worried about how much Mim was crying .
" The doctor said to try Lactogen ... he said give breast milk as well , but try Lactogen . "
( Breastfeeding experts warn that - aside from the dangers of dirty water being used - giving even some formula milk undermines the breastfeeding process . )
Another young woman , 17 - year - old Samsun Nahar Shenli , mother of 13 - week - old Tanjila , told me she was advised to start bottlefeeding on the first day of her baby 's life .
" I talked to the doctor and he said to put her on a certain type of formula .
He said the formula and breast milk were very similar , with the same vitamins . "
Since then , she says , four of her friends have had babies and when they 've encountered problems with breastfeeding , she has passed on the word to them to try My Boy .
Even in the UK , formula companies exploit loopholes where they can .
In 2006 , when the government here launched a new scheme , Healthy Start , to replace the Welfare Food Scheme , two of the biggest producers of formula in Britain - Cow & Gate and Heinz - tried to use it as a marketing opportunity .
" Cow & Gate produced adverts saying its baby milk was ' closest to breast milk ' , a claim which is disallowed under the code , until the Department of Health clamped down on them ; and Heinz published a graph suggesting its formula was close to breast milk and better than competing brands .
Both companies were not only violating the code , but also UK legislation , " says De Toma .
One of the problems with the WHO code - apart from its many grey areas - is how it is policed .
Many countries , Bangladesh and the UK included , have backed its requirements up with legislation .
But , says Save the Children , WHO and Unicef could do more .
" The WHO ... must be bolder in getting companies to comply , " it says in today 's report .
" Unicef must ensure that compliance with the code becomes a measure of progress on countries ' implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child . "
Within Bangladesh , there is a feeling that if breastfeeding campaigners take their eye off the ball for even a moment , the formula companies will quickly gain ground .
At the Institute of Public Health and Nutrition in Dhaka - the government body charged with implementing the curbs on formula manufacturers - director Professor Dr Fatima Parveen Chowdhury is looking askance at several tins of formula milk piled up on her desk .
She frowns at the cartoon pictures on the cover - too attractive , she says ; too tempting - and frets over the wording on the cans .
" The code requires companies to put words on the can saying there is no substitute for breast milk , but on this can those words are too small , it 's written in tiny letters that it 's a breast - milk substitute , and it wo n't do , " she says .
There are other problems , too : many companies that sell formula milk in Bangladesh have failed in their legal duty to register with her department , and that makes it difficult to keep track of what they 're up to .
" I talk to companies and in front of me they seem to be reasonable , " Chowdhury says .
" But I 'm not convinced .
We have to be watchful .
They push their products in different ways .
They are doing wrong things .
They are very technical , very sly . "
Or even , sometimes , outrageously flagrant .
Public advertising by baby - milk manufacturers is explicitly banned in the WHO code and in Bangladeshi law , but Ahmed takes me to a doctor 's waiting room in a Dhaka suburb whose walls are adorned with posters showing healthy - looking babies , and the names of baby - milk manufacturers ( not Nestlé , in this case ) .
Strangely , it seems to me , the babies in the posters are all Caucasian : but Ahmed has an explanation .
" For many people here , what white people do is the right thing to do , " he says .
" So putting white people on posters like these sends out the message that it 's the western way , the best way .
It 's one of the many subtle ways in which breastfeeding is undermined here . "
So is breastfeeding declining in Bangladesh ?
It 's difficult to tell , says Dr Swapn Roy , secretary general of the Bangladeshi Breastfeeding Foundation , because the statistics are not reliable .
Around 95 % of mothers are believed to start breastfeeding , but by one month the figure is down to maybe around 89 % , and at six months ( the age to which , under WHO recommendations , all babies should be wholly breastfed ) , the figure is maybe 25 % , but could be as low as 16 % .
Anecdotally , many health professionals feel the tide is shifting against them , and if you cast around at hospital paediatric clinics , as I did last week , there is certainly no shortage of mothers who bottlefeed their babies .
No shortage of mothers , and no shortage of sad tales .
Because bottlefeeding is more than a health tragedy in this country : it is an economic tragedy , too .
Happi Akther , 35 , talks to me as she waits to see a doctor about her nine - month - old son 's flaky - skin problem :
Nur has been bottlefed , she says , since he was about a month old .
" I felt I did n't have enough milk , " says Happi , whose two previous babies both died soon after birth .
" What else could I do ?
No one had any other ideas . "
( In fact , breastfeeding experts believe at least 98 % of women - even those on nutritionally deficient diets in developing countries such as Bangladesh - can make sufficient milk to feed their babies , given proper advice and support . )
Nur has been fed on Lactogen from the outset , but his formula , she says , costs her and her husband Gias , who works in a mustard - dyeing factory , around 800 taka ( £ 2 ) a week .
And if that does n't sound much , set it against the fact that Gias earns only £ 6 a week .
" We ca n't afford it at all , " says Happi , shaking her head .
" The milk uses up all our money . "
All the mothers I spoke to - most of whom were non-working wives whose husbands worked in factories or did manual jobs - had similar stories .
( Of the 10 women I interviewed in the clinics , only one said she had begun using formula because she needed to go back to work . )
For some families , the burden of buying formula milk is simply too much .
" They can't afford to mix it at the required proportion , so to make it go further they use too little powder , " says Dr Roy .
" Or they resort to using ordinary powdered milk , which is a lot cheaper to buy than branded baby formula .
The result is babies whose milk is little more than what you might call white water . "
According to Save the Children 's report , infant mortality in Bangladesh alone could be cut by almost a third - saving the lives of 314 children every day - if breastfeeding rates were improved .
Globally , the organisation believes , 3,800 lives could be saved each day .
Given that world leaders are committed to cutting infant mortality by two thirds by 2015 as one of the Millennium Development Goals , protecting and promoting breastfeeding is almost certainly the biggest single thing that could be done to better child survival rates .
But the formula companies , despite the international code , continue to undermine campaigners ' efforts .
Throughout the west as well as in the developing world , the amounts spent on " breast is best " campaigns are dwarfed by the amounts food manufacturers spend on promoting their products : in the UK , for example , Save the Children reckons that for every £ 1 spent in 2006 - 7 on breastfeeding promotion , £ 10 was spent by manufacturers on advertising and promoting baby milk and foods .
If companies such as Nestlé genuinely wanted to do what Tickle says they want to do , which is support breastfeeding , there is a simple way forward : convert its efficient , and effective , network of sales reps into an equally efficient and effective network of breastfeeding advisors .
With the right support , there is no doubt that babies such as Eti Khuman and Nur Akther would be breastfed , along with all the other babies whose mothers I spoke to in Bangladesh , because all were very clear about one thing , which is that breastfeeding would be preferable to the expense of formula and the dangers of diarrhoea .
Back in Dhaka , at the diarrhoea hospital , Eti is on the mend .
She and her mother Mina have spent time with a breastfeeding counsellor , and Mina has agreed to try to start breastfeeding again .
Dr Kabir is delighted - he says as many as 70 % of mothers who give up breastfeeding can get their milk going again , given proper support and advice .
All the same , it would have been infinitely better if women such as Mina never stopped breastfeeding in the first place , and that would be easier to achieve if formula - milk companies such as Nestlé curbed their efforts to sell their products .
Because the truth at the centre of this story is this : for babies such as Eti and Nur , in countries like Bangladesh , there is no healthy substitute for breastfeeding .
The history of the Nestlé boycott
Henri Nestlé , founder of the world 's largest food and drink company , is credited with being the inventor of formula milk , back in 1867 .
By the late 20th century , the formula - milk market had grown into an industry worth billions of dollars worldwide , and Nestlé was a major player .
With such a huge market at stake , formula companies were accused of acting in ways calculated to undermine breastfeeding mothers , giving out free samples of their products and targeting women directly through advertising campaigns .
The marketing message was that formula was as healthy as breast - even though in some countries the women had no access to clean water to mix up the formula with .
In some instances , cans of formula were being sold with the instructions in the wrong language for the women being targeted .
These allegations first came to prominence in the late 1970s , in a notorious court case .
The charity War on Want had published a pamphlet called The Baby Killer in 1974 .
When it was released ( in amended form ) in Switzerland with the title Nestlé Kills Babies , the food giant began a legal suit .
It eventually won the case , but it was a Pyrrhic victory : the organisation responsible for publishing the booklet in Switzerland was ordered to pay only a token fine .
The following year , 1977 , saw the start of calls for a boycott of all Nestlé products in the US ; the boycott quickly spread to Europe .
In 1981 , as a result of the boycott , the World Health Assembly ( the decision - making body for WHO ) adopted the International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes , calling it " a minimum requirement " to be adopted " in its entirety " .
In 1984 , Nestlé agreed to implement the code , and the boycott was officially suspended by the groups who had done most to promote it .
But in 1988 the International Baby Food Action Network ( Ibfan ) alleged that baby - milk companies were flooding health facilities in the developing world with free and low - cost supplies , and the Nestlé boycott was resumed the following year .
In 2000 , Nestlé 's chief executive said the company would ensure labels always had instructions in the appropriate language - but campaigners claim many aspects of the code continue to be violated , and argue that consumers should still boycott the company .
No one argues that Nestlé is the only company to have been involved in less - than - perfect practices - Ibfan and , in the UK , the campaigning group Baby Milk Action , say they target the company because they claim it has violated the code more than any other single company worldwide , and also that - as a market leader - it should be setting an example .
Nestlé is tight - lipped about the effect of the boycott on its sales or public image .
But , 30 years on , feelings continue to run high .
This week , users of a UK parenting website , Netmums , took its founders to task after the site agreed a sponsorship deal with Nestlé , and on Saturday demonstrators will gather outside the company 's HQ for a show of strength in favour of a cause that refuses to go away .

The Conservatives ' new environmental platform is a ``complete and total fraud " that is " designed to mislead the Canadian people , " former U.S. vice - president Al Gore said today .
The noted environmentalist was presenting his documentary " An Inconvenient Truth " in Toronto at a consumer environmental show , with Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty and environmentalist David Suzuki in attendance .
Gore praised Suzuki for confronting Environment Minister John Baird on Friday , saying he saw the two exchange words on TV .
When Baird told Suzuki the Conservatives were going further than any other government in Canadian history , Suzuki said it was n't enough .
The Conservative government strategy focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality .
But the plan failed to spell out precisely what many of its regulations will look like .
" In my opinion , it is a complete and total fraud , " Gore said .
`` It is designed to mislead the Canadian people . "
Gore acknowledged he is not a Canadian citizen and said he has ``no right to interfere in your decisions . "
However , he said , the rest of the world looks to Canada for moral leadership , and that 's why this week 's announcement was so " shocking . "
Baird released a statement later in the day in which he refuted Gore 's criticisms .
" The fact is our plan is vastly tougher than any measures introduced by the administration of which the former vice president was a member , " Baird said in the statement .
Baird 's statement also offered an invitation for Gore to discuss climate change and the Conservatives ' environmental policies with him .

Most climatologists agree that the earth 's temperature has increased about a degree over the last century .
The debate is how much of it is due to mankind 's activity .
Britain 's Channel 4 television has just produced " The Great Global Warming Swindle , " a documentary that devastates most of the claims made by the environmentalist movement .
The scientists interviewed include top climatologists from MIT and other prestigious universities around the world .
The documentary has n't aired in the U.S. , but it 's available on the Internet .
Among the many findings that dispute environmentalists ' claims are : Manmade carbon dioxide emissions are roughly 5 percent of the total ; the rest are from natural sources such as volcanoes , dying vegetation and animals .
Annually , volcanoes alone produce more carbon dioxide than all of mankind 's activities .
Oceans are responsible for most greenhouse gases .
Contrary to environmentalists ' claims , the higher the Earth 's temperature , the higher the carbon dioxide levels .
In other words , carbon dioxide levels are a product of climate change .
Some of the documentary 's scientists argue that the greatest influence on the Earth 's temperature is our sun 's sunspot activity .
The bottom line is , the bulk of scientific evidence shows that what we 've been told by environmentalists is pure bunk .
Throughout the Earth 's billions of years there have been countless periods of global warming and cooling .
In fact , in the year 1,000 A.D. , a time when there were no SUVs , the Earth 's climate was much warmer than it is now .
Most of this century 's warming occurred before 1940 .
For several decades after WWII , when there was massive worldwide industrialization , there was cooling .
There 's a much more important issue that poses an even greater danger to mankind .
That 's the effort by environmentalists to suppress disagreement with their view .
According to a March 11 article in London 's Sunday Telegraph , Timothy Ball , a former climatology professor at the University of Winnipeg in Canada , has received five death threats since he started questioning whether man was affecting climate change .
Richard Lindzen , professor of Atmospheric Science at MIT , said , " Scientists who dissent from the alarmism have seen their funds disappear , their work derided , and themselves labeled as industry stooges . "
Nigel Calder , a former editor of New Scientist , said , " Governments are trying to achieve unanimity by stifling any scientist who disagrees .
Einstein could not have got funding under the present system . "
Suppressing dissent is nothing new .
Italian cosmologist Giordano Bruno taught that stars were at different distances from each other surrounded by limitless territory .
He was imprisoned in 1592 , and eight years later he was tried as a heretic and burned at the stake .
Because he disagreed that the Earth was the center of the universe , Galileo was ordered to stand trial on suspicion of heresy in 1633 .
Under the threat of torture , he recanted and was placed under house arrest for the rest of his life .
Today 's version of yesteryear 's inquisitors include people like the Weather Channel 's Dr. Heidi Cullen , who advocates that the American Meteorological Society ( AMS ) strip their seal of approval from any TV weatherman expressing skepticism about the predictions of manmade global warming .
Columnist Dave Roberts , in his Sept. 19 , 2006 , online publication , said , " When we 've finally gotten serious about global warming , when the impacts are really hitting us and we 're in a full worldwide scramble to minimize the damage , we should have war crimes trials for these bastards -- some sort of climate Nuremberg . "
There are literally billions of taxpayer dollars being handed out to global warming alarmists , not to mention their dream of controlling our lives .
Their agenda is threatened by dissent .
They have the politician 's ear ; not we , who will suffer if they have their way .
Okay , the Senators put it more diplomatically in letter sent today to the Attorney General , but in essence , that ’s the gist .
What known - liar Gonzales said under oath conflicts with what James Comey said under oath .
My money is on Comey telling the truth :
Specifically , Mr. Comey testified that you and former White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card went to Mr. Ashcroft ’s bedside at George Washington Hospital , where he was in intensive care , in an effort to get him to agree to certify the legality of a classified program that he and Mr. Comey , who was serving as acting Attorney General at the time , had concluded should not be so certified .
Mr. Comey stated that when the Administration decided to go forward with reauthorizing this classified program without that certification , he and several other Justice Department officials , including possibly Attorney General Ashcroft himself , were ready to tender their resignations .
You testified last year before both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House Judiciary Committee about this incident .
On February 6 , 2006 , at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing , you were asked whether Mr. Comey and others at the Justice Department had raised concerns about the NSA wiretapping program .
You stated in response that the disagreement that occurred was not related to the wiretapping program confirmed by the President in December 2005 , which was the topic of the hearing .
Huh .
Imagine George Bush ’s lawyer telling a lie — under oath , no less .
Bush and Gonzales never , ever thought they ’d be held accountable for their lies .
And , if the GOP still controlled Congress , they would n’t be .
Josh Marshall has video of Comey ’s testimony .
Not to be overlooked was Comey ’s recollection that Bush himself had called Ashcroft ’s hospital room to arrange the visit by Card and Gonzales .
It ’s worth a watch .
Reading the reports about Comey ’s testimony do n’t do it justice .
Lancing The Boil
During the trial of Scooter " I. Lewis " Libby , the notes of Cathie Martin were flashed up on a courtroom screen .
Martin was an aide to Vice President Darth Vader , I mean Dick Cheney , and her notes concerned ways in which Cheney might combat the notion that the White House had not been honest about Iraq 's nuclear capabilities .
As option number one , Martin wrote " MTP - VP , " meaning either that the Vice President should aim his Death Star at some hapless planet and " massacre their people " or , more likely , that the Vice President should appear on the program you are not going to watch today .
Martin then did a pros and cons notation about this strategy .
On the pro side she wrote " control message . "
Really ?
That 's the best thing about sending Vice President Cheney on " Meet the Press ? "
That you can control the message you want to get out ?
Interesting .
But then there were more notes presented at the trial .
These notes were taken by Libby himself about a conversation he had with Cheney adviser Mary Matalin about how to deal with that meddlesome NBC fellow Chris Matthews .
" Call Tim .
He hates Chris - he needs to know it all , " was the advice from Matalin jotted down by Libby .
Hmmm .
A Cheney adviser knows that NBC's Russert hates NBC's Matthews and that Russert will be helpful .
A couple of connectable dots involve Matalin 's husband , James Carville , and Russert 's son , Luke , who together launched a satellite radio sports talk show called " 60/20 , " a reference to their respective age groups , apparently because the title " A Giant Talking Adder and an Unqualified Stripling With a Famous Dad Discuss Big Strong Sweaty Men " was already taken by the Sci-Fi Channel .
Tim Russert and Carville actually promoted the sports show on " Meet the Press " ( where Carville and Matalin regularly appear ) without revealing that Luke Russert was the second host , as if that somehow removed the taint of hand - in - glove favoritism from this plug .
So Russert gets his kid a fancy gig with a famous and wired guy like Carville .
It hardly comes as a surprise to think that Carville 's wife feels she has a little inside advantage in playing Russert for Cheney 's benefit .
But wait .
There 's more .
When Russert was first subpoenaed , in 2004 , to speak to the grand jury in the Libby case , he and NBC made a great show of fighting to quash that subpoena because , in the words of NBC News president Neil Shapiro , " The American public will be deprived of important information if the government can freely question journalists about their efforts to gather news . "
This quote appeared in a " story " on the MSNBC website about NBC 's brave resistance .
Stirring words .
Only one problem .
It emerged at trial that Russert spoke freely to an FBI agent about this whole matter the first time he was ever contacted .
The whole pageant of refusing to cooperate was kind of a charade .
He had already cooperated .
I mean , should n't the story MSNBC ran about NBC 's commitment to the American public have explained that Russert compromised at least some of that commitment the first chance he got ?
OK .
Just a little more .
In his own trial testimony , Russert explained his own unique approach to the concept of " off the record " conversations with public officials .
Russert said public officials do not have to ask to go off the record with him .
They are always presumptively off the record .
Then , if he wants to get them on the record , he revisits the point and asks them to go public .
This is a wonderful , generous strategy , and the only problem with it is that it represents a complete inversion of the standard operating practices of journalism .
Every reporter who works at this newspaper , and pretty much every reporter professionally employed at any other reputable organ of the press has been instructed to do the opposite : assume that every utterance is on the record unless the utterer has explicitly gone off the record before uttering .
People who deal with the press are expected to know that .
You 're not even allowed to say , " The U.S. government blew up Pluto in November of last year , but that 's off the record , " although some reporters will give you the NBA continuation rule if you do n't pause for breath anywhere in there .
A gray area would be something like , " The real Zodiac killer was - and this is off the record - Andy Rooney . "
That 's probably a legitimate off the record statement .
But Russert 's policy is one of his own invention , and it's the kind of policy you 'd have if you prized your cozy relationship with powerful people more highly than you prized your role as a reporter .
I mention all this because , here and there , you read comments about the prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald and how much he damaged the First Amendment by sweating a bunch of journalists .
Please .
It 's more like he lanced some kind of infectious boil .
MS . PRIEST : Every time there ’s a national security story they do n’t want published , they say it will damage national security .
But they — for one thing , they ’ve never given us any proof .
They say it will stop cooperation , but the fact is that the countries of the world understand that they have to cooperate on counterterrorism .
And just like the banks that did not pull out of the system , other countries continue to cooperate , because it ’s a common problem .
MS. MITCHELL : But , Dana ...
MR . HARWOOD : Have you heard ...( unintelligible ) ... are pulling out from this system ?
I do n’t think so .
MS. MITCHELL : Dana , let me point out that The Washington Post , your newspaper , was behind the others but also did publish this story .
And a story you wrote last year disclosing the secret CIA prisons won the Pulitzer Prize , but it also led to William Bennett , sitting here , saying that three reporters who won the Pulitzer Prize — you for that story and Jim Risen and others for another story — were , “ not worthy of an award but rather worthy of jail . ”
Dana , how do you plead ?
MS . PRIEST : Well , it ’s not a crime to publish classified information .
And this is one of the things Mr. Bennett keeps telling people that it is .
But , in fact , there are some narrow categories of information you can’t publish , certain signals , communications , intelligence , the names of covert operatives and nuclear secrets .
Now why is n’t it a crime ?
I mean , some people would like to make casino gambling a crime , but it is not a crime .
Why is n’t it not a crime ?
Because the framers of the Constitution wanted to protect the press so that they could perform a basic role in government oversight [ emphasis mine ] , and you ca n’t do that .
Look at the criticism that the press got after Iraq that we did not do our job on WMD .
And that was all in a classified arena .
To do a better job — and I believe that we should ’ve done a better job — we would ’ve again , found ourselves in the arena of ...

The PVI measures how much more Republican than the nation the district is .
Bush 's margin of victory the last two cycles combined is 2 percent .
So a PVI of 4 means Bush won the district by 7 6 points .
Take a look at that list , and see how many of our representatives are deep behind enemy lines .
We have 59 Democrats who represent districts won by Bush in 2004 .
Republicans have nothing like this , just a handful of reps in even marginal Democratic districts .
That 's why it 's harder to keep our caucus in line than it is for them to do the same .
It 's also a sign that our party is stronger than theirs -- we can win in hostile territory .
They can't .
So while it may be cathartic to take out aggressions on those Dems that abandoned the leadership on this bill , let 's also give props to those who voted the right way despite representing tough districts .

As I said yesterday , this is a message battle since our options to end the war with King George in the White House are slim .
What we need to do is lay the foundation for overwhelming victories up and down the ballot in 2008 , which would then give us the tools ( i.e. the White House ) to end this boondoggle once and for all .
And on that front , this is what America is seeing today :
House OKs Timetable For Troops
In Iraq ( CBS News )
House Narrowly Backs Iraq Timetable ( NY Times )
House approves end date for Iraq war ( ABC News )
House OKs timetable for troops in Iraq ( Houston Chronicle )
House approves deadline for ending Iraq war ( Reuters )
The next batch of headlines will feature Bush 's threat to veto Democratic efforts to end the war .
Retroactive immunity from prosecution is a beautiful thing if you 're a major telecommunications provider in the US , and phone companies are about to receive it if the Bush administration gets its way .
The administration 's new appropriations request for intelligence agencies was recently disclosed at a hearing of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , and it includes a massive gift to the phone companies who have been ( can we drop the " allegedly " at this point ? ) helping the NSA and other agencies .
Prepare yourself for the longest single sentence you have ever read :
Notwithstanding any other law , and in addition to the immunities , privileges , and defenses provided by any other source of law , no action shall lie or be maintained in any court , and no penalty , sanction , or other form of remedy or relief shall be imposed by any court or any other body , against any person for the alleged provision to an element of the intelligence community of any information ( including records or other information pertaining to a customer ) , facilities , or any other form of assistance , during the period of time beginning on September 11 , 2001 , and ending on the date that is the effective date of this Act , in connection with any alleged classified communications intelligence activity that the Attorney General or a designee of the Attorney General certifies , in a manner consistent with the protection of State secrets , is , was , would be , or would have been intended to protect the United States from a terrorist attack .
That 's from section 408 of the proposed bill , and it 's buried beneath the innocuous headline " Liability Defense . "
As the government explains later in an analysis of the bill , " companies that cooperate with the Government in the war on terror deserve our appreciation and protection — not litigation . "
Any court case dealing with the issue would be thrown out of court , and the protection would include all phone company interaction with the intelligence community since September 11 .
The issue of whether any of this behavior was legal is not important .
The government has already argued that legality does n't matter when it comes to the phone companies , since even a ruling that their actions were illegal would expose the existence of the intelligence - gathering program in question .
Therefore , such cases should not even be considered by the courts .
Kenneth Wainstein , an assistant attorney general at the Department of Justice , told the assembled Senators that this provision of the bill would simply " fill a gap in our laws " by allowing the phone companies to assist the government .
When news of the NSA 's alleged wiretapping of American firms ( with their knowledge ) broke back in 2005 , we reported on the powerful technology apparently being deployed inside secret rooms at telco facilities .
Despite the fact that this raised all sorts of questions about domestic surveillance and legality , Congress decided that it simply was n't worth looking into after hearing from Vice President Cheney about the matter .
With Congress unwilling to figure out what was going on , individuals and advocacy groups began filing lawsuits against the phone companies .
The EFF and others argued that communications privacy laws had been violated , but the government countered by claiming that a " state secrets " privilege meant that the cases should simply be thrown out .
Though some cases were dismissed , the EFF 's case against AT&T continues , though it would also be dismissed if the proposed new legislation passes .
With the Democrats now holding much more power , though , it 's not clear that the blanket immunity grant will survive .
However , the bill itself needs to pass in some form in order to keep funding the US intelligence apparatus .
The common view that nerves transmit impulses through electricity is wrong and they really transmit sound , according toateam of Danish scientists .
The Copenhagen University researchersargue thatbiology and medical textbooks that say nerves relay electrical impulses from the brain to the rest of the body are incorrect .
" For us as physicists , this cannot be the explanation , " said Thomas Heimburg , an associate professor at the university 's Niels Bohr Institute .
" The physical laws of thermodynamics tell us that electrical impulses must produce heat as they travel along the nerve , but experiments find that no such heat is produced . "
Heimburg , an expert in biophysics who received his PhD from the Max Planck Institute in Goettingen , Germany — where biologists and physicists often work together in a rare arrangement — developed the theory with Copenhagen University 's Andrew Jackson , an expert in theoretical physics .
According to the traditional explanation of molecular biology , an electrical pulse is sent from one end of the nerve to the other with the help of electrically charged salts that pass through ion channels and a membrane that sheathes the nerves .
That membrane is made of lipids and proteins .
Heimburg and Jackson theorize that sound propagation is a much more likely explanation .
Although sound waves usually weaken as they spread out , a medium with the right physical properties could create a special kind of sound pulse or " soliton " that can propagate without spreading or losing strength .
The physicists say because the nerve membrane is made of a material similar to olive oil that can change from liquid to solid through temperature variations , they can freeze and propagate the solitons .
The scientists , whose work is in the Biophysical Society 's Biophysical Journal , suggested that anesthetics change the melting point of the membrane and make it impossible for their theorized sound pulses to propagate .
The researchers could notimmediately be reached for comment .
ADD another item to the well - equipped soldier 's duffel .
An evangelical radio ministry has developed a book kit meant to help soldiers protect their sexual purity , and is raising money to send 6,000 kits to chaplains who have requested them .
The kits , from New Life Ministries , which broadcasts on 150 stations nationally , is intended to promote Bible - based abstinence from pornography , adultery , nonmarital sex and masturbation .
" Your goal is sexual purity , " the authors write .
" You are sexually pure when no sexual gratification comes from anyone or anything but your wife . "
The five - book " Every Soldier 's Battle " kit , boxed in camouflage , arrives at a time of " increased underlying tension in military chaplaincy , " as more chaplains come from evangelical Christian traditions , said David Segal , director of the Center for Research on Military Organization at the University of Maryland .
These chaplains often bring a culture of proselytizing , Mr. Segal said , that is " not in consonance with the way the military defines chaplaincy . "
" Every Soldier 's Battle " began with a call earlier this year to New Life from Michael Music , a chaplain 's assistant ( official rank : religious program specialist first class ) , with a Navy unit then in Iraq .
Energy Ontario Boards the Bulb - Banning Bandwagon By Ryan McGreal
Published April 18 , 2007
City Council is off scot free : at least one opportunity to take the lead has been taken out of its hands .
The Ontario Government has announced that it will introduce legislation to ban energy - inefficient lights by 2012 .
The law will apply to retailers selling bulbs , not to consumers using them .
I have n't seen the details of the legislation yet , but I hope the province passes the law based on enegy efficiency - e.g. a minimum standard of so many lumens per watt - rather than identifying particular technologies and limiting potential research .
The opposition parties support the legislation , but the NDP argues it should take effect in 2010 , when Australia 's ban takes effect , not 2012 .
Ryan McGreal , the editor of Raise the Hammer , lives in Hamilton with his family and works as a programmer , writer and consultant .
Ryan volunteers with Hamilton Light Rail , a citizen group dedicated to bringing light rail transit to Hamilton .
Ryan wrote a city affairs column in Hamilton Magazine , and several of his articles have been published in the Hamilton Spectator .
His articles have also been published in The Walrus , HuffPost and Behind the Numbers .
He maintains a personal website , has been known to share passing thoughts on Twitter and Facebook , and posts the occasional cat photo on Instagram .

Sailors : Iran mistreated us
Posted
Apr. 6 - British sailors and marines held by Iran for nearly two weeks say they were subjected to intense psychological pressure by their captors .
The BBC Trust has given final approval for the iPlayer , the corporation 's proposed online seven - day catch - up TV service .
After the trust 's first application of its new public value test , approval was granted with two further amendments proposed by the trust in addition to BBC management 's original plans .
The trust has now said that no more than 15 % of the content on the iPlayer can be available for so - called " series stacking " , where users can download multiple episodes of a particular TV series .
Only certain types of programming will be offered this way , such as limited - run drama series .
But the iPlayer will allow users to stack up previous episodes for the duration of the series , not just seven days after it aired .
All other content on the iPlayer will be less than seven days old .
The second change is that after noting what it described as " strong public demand " , the trust will audit the BBC 's progress in making the iPlayer platform neutral .
BBC management originally proposed that the iPlayer would run only on Microsoft 's Windows operating system and the Windows Media Player 10 because it wanted to use Microsoft digital - rights management technology .
Management also told the trust it would be unworkable to make the service available on other operating systems , such as Apple and Linux , within two years .
However , the trust will now audit the BBC 's progress on this issue every six months and will publish its findings .
The iPlayer project will cost £ 132 m over five years .
Diane Coyle , BBC trustee and chair of the trust 's public value test steering group , said : " The Trust is satisfied that the BBC 's new on - demand services will create significant public value with limited market impact .
We have therefore given our final approval for the services to be launched .
" When considering the potential market impact of new service applications from the BBC , we must focus primarily on the effect on consumers who enjoy the choice offered by content and services beyond those provided by the BBC . "
Other on - demand services given the go - ahead by the trust today include audio podcasts , simulcast TV online and seven - day catch - up TV via cable .
Cable catch - up will function under the same series - stacking conditions as iPlayer content , and podcasts will be used for all audio that does not include rights - protected material , such as music recordings .
Classical music and audio book material should not be included in on - demand services , the trust decided , because it was felt that such a service would impact too heavily on the market .
BBC director general Mark Thompson welcomed the trust 's decision and said the public value test had been " extremely rigorous and exhaustive " .
" This is a significant decision as the new on - demand proposals are at the heart of the BBC's Creative Future , " he said .
" However , we disagree with the trust 's decision to exclude classical music podcasts from the proposal : our research suggests that classical music audiences would wish to download classical music programmes from the BBC and to listen to them on their terms , free at the point of use . "
The trust said it had received an unprecedented 10,608 submissions over the iPlayer proposals , 10,500 of which were from members of the public .
Most submissions supported the plans , the trust added .
More than 85 % of respondents said it was important for catch - up services to be available on software other than Microsoft , and nearly 80 % said a series - stacking feature should be included .
Only a quarter said that they felt parental controls were necessary .

Wrapping up the series on " How women sabotage themselves in the workplace " , the following are more issues that Debra Burrell CSW , claims women are guilty of doing : Women are generally less comfortable with a hierarchal , “ report only to your immediate supervisor ” framework .
While men may be comfortable with clear lines of authority , most women prefer to view work as a collaborative effort .
We want to reach a concensus , respect all participants equally , regardless of position .
We want to understand why we have to do something and mightly resent “ Because I said so ” as an explanation .
Our need for inclusion is greater than our ability to be subordinate ..
Women are basically curious and care about other ’s personal lives .
We like to know who is married ; single , just had a baby , where people went on vacation , if they bought a new home , etc .
It ’s one way that we connect to others and build relationships – by caring about the details in people ’s personal lives .
Yet a woman who spends too much time chit chatting – passing around birthday cards , ooohing and ahhhing of vacation / child / pet photos may be taken less seriously than her position and responsibilities demand .
Our interest in others as full human beings is perceived as a waste of time ..
A woman ’s tendency is to want to be liked .
Therefore , we can be excessively validating and complimentary in order to get on people ’s “ good sides ” .
We say about others what we would like said about us .
“ I do n’t know what I would do without my assistant Janet . ”
“ This report would just not be as good if I did n’t have Bob ’s expertise on the computer . ”
This creates a climate in which colleagues and assistants really do think we would n’t make it if it were n’t for them .
It also contributes to the perception that we must need more help than our less effusive colleagues ..
A man will go into his boss ’ office , and ask for a raise .
A woman will sit at her desk , thinking , “ If I do a really good job , someone is going to notice .
I should n’t have to ASK for recognition , or a raise , or a promotion . ”
We are the same way when it comes to personal gifts … if we have to ask for flowers , then what ’s the point ?
We want it to come freely .
What we do n’t understand is that all employers will try to get us to accept the lowest possible compensation for the longest possible time .
We do n’t want to think that if we really wanted it , we would be willing to fight for it .
We need to be willing to send the message “ We want to play in the game ” ..
It hurts to hear we spoke too much at a meeting , or no one liked our presentation or that others find us difficult ( who me ? ) .
The challenge is to take what ’s said and understand our impact on others and make changes where possible .
Women are polite .
So if we hear someone say , No , we think it means no - a straightforward don’t - ask - again .
A man however , has grown up hearing no from girls and discovering that sometimes
No really means not yet or maybe .
Another example would be when a guy tries out for a sports team – and will try and try and try whenever possible to get on .
A girl will try to get on a team , and if she is rejected will automatically think I ’m not good enough and then not try again .
Women need to know it ’s okay to try again and not be afraid to keep going for something .
When a woman gives up after the first
No , it looks as if she is n’t trying that hard .

Clubbers who take the “ love drug ” ecstasy really might be “ loved up ” .
Studies in rats suggest the drug causes a brain surge of oxytocin – the hormone that helps bond couples , as well as mothers to their babies .
Earlier research found increased oxytocin in the blood of people who had taken ecstasy .
However , many drugs increase blood oxytocin without raising it in the brain – something thought necessary for any “ pro-social ” effects .
Iain McGregor at the University of Sydney in Australia , and his colleagues studied the effects of ecstasy in rats , which , like people , become more sociable on the drug .
“ It ’s very characteristic behaviour .
They lie next to each other and chill out , ” McGregor says .
The team gave the rats the equivalent of two to three ecstasy tablets in an adult human and found that the drug activated oxytocin - containing neurons in an area of their brains called the hypothalamus .
When they gave the rats a drug that blocked brain receptors for oxytocin , the increased sociability almost disappeared .

Why it did n’t disappear entirely is n’t clear .
It could be that the dose of the receptor blocker was too low , or that other brain chemicals , such as dopamine , are also involved in triggering the sociable behaviour , McGregor says .
“ Sensual , not sexual ”
The finding ties in with reports from people on ecstasy about how they feel , McGregor points out .
Rodent studies have shown a massive surge of oxytocin after orgasm in males .
“ It ’s interesting that guys on ecstasy feel more sensual than sexual , ” McGregor says .
“ It could be that raising oxytocin levels puts them in that sort of post - orgasmic state where they ’re actually not very good at performing sexually but they feel really good about the person they ’re with . ”
McGregor ’s team now plan to investigate the levels of oxytocin in rats ’ brains after they ’ve taken MDMA , and to see which parts of the brain in particular are affected .
They suspect that the oxytocin release might be implicated not only in the pro-social effects of ecstasy but also in the reinforcing effects .
There is much research to be done on how drugs of abuse affect oxytocin in the brain , says McGregor .
“ What we know at the moment could be written on the back of a postage stamp . ”

Update : [ 2018-10 - 29 ]
As this blog post is over 10 years old , I have posted my configuration as of 2018
Tabs to show overlapping windows are becoming more common these days , especially in terminals , browsers , and chat programs .
The idea is that a single window can contain several … buffers .
Emacs already has this , and has had this for a long time .
It 's just that by default Emacs does n't have visible tabs to show the buffers .
XEmacs and SXEmacs can show tabs with “ buffer tabs ” ; for GNU Emacs 21 you need to install TabBar mode ( thanks to Jemima for finding this ) , which gives you tabs like this :
Well , it does n't look like that by default .
The standard settings give each tab a 3d button appearance .
I wanted something simpler , so I changed the settings :
;; Note : for tabbar 2.0 use ;; tabbar - default not tabbar - default - face , ;; tabbar - selected not tabbar - selected - face , ;; tabbar - button not tabbar - button - face , ;; tabbar - separator not tabbar - separator - face ( set - face - attribute ' tabbar - default - face nil : background " gray60 " ) ( set - face - attribute ' tabbar - unselected - face nil : background " gray85 " : foreground " gray30 " : box nil ) ( set - face - attribute ' tabbar - selected - face nil : background " # f2f2f6 " : foreground " black " : box nil ) ( set - face - attribute ' tabbar - button - face nil : box ' ( : line - width 1 : color " gray72 " : style released - button ) ) ( set - face - attribute ' tabbar - separator - face nil : height 0.7 ) ( tabbar - mode 1 ) ( define - key global - map [ ( alt j ) ] ' tabbar - backward ) ( define - key global - map [ ( alt k ) ] ' tabbar - forward )
This makes the currently selected tab match my default background ( # f2f2f6 ) , removes the 3d borders , and adds a bit of space between the tabs .
I also define Alt + J and Alt +
K to switch tabs ; I use the same keys in other tabbed apps , because they 're easier to type than moving my hands to the arrow keys .
TabBar - mode looks neat , but I 'm not sure how useful it will be .
In Emacs I have lots of buffers — more than will fit as tabs .
The main thing I like so far are the keys for cycling between related buffers , but as the number of buffers grows it becomes faster to switch directly to the buffer I want .
Edit : [ 2010 -11 - 20 ]
I like tabbar - mode but I also find myself using other buffer switching quite a bit .
I 'm using tabbar within a project , and ido - switch - buffer for moving between projects .
I 've changed the tabbar groups to show only buffers in the same directory :
( defun my - tabbar - buffer - groups ( buffer ) " Put files in the same directory into the same tab bar " ( with - current - buffer ( get - buffer buffer ) ( list ( expand - file - name default - directory ) ) ) ) ( setq tabbar - buffer- groups- function ' my - tabbar-buffer- groups )
Update : [ 2017-09 - 24 ]
I wanted to make the tabs look more like tabs in other apps , so I used powerline 's " wave " separators with tabbar :
( defvar my / tabbar - left " / " " Separator on left side of tab " ) ( defvar my / tabbar - right " \\ " " Separator on right side of tab " ) ( defun my / tabbar - tab - label - function ( tab ) ( powerline - render ( list my / tabbar - left ( format " %s " ( car tab ) ) my / tabbar - right ) ) ) ( require ' powerline ) ( setq my / tabbar - left ( powerline - wave - right ' tabbar - default nil 24 ) ) ( setq my / tabbar - right ( powerline - wave - left nil ' tabbar - default 24 ) ) ( tabbar - mode 1 ) ( setq tabbar-tab- label- function #'my /tabbar-tab-label - function ) ) )
Note that tabbar resets tabbar - tab - label - function after you run ( tabbar - mode 1 ) so you need to make you set it after you 've already activated tabbar - mode .

Whoa !
This looks like a long post with a lot of code snippets .
Am I going to have to do a lot of hard thinking , or can I just relax and enjoy a good rambling essay ?
This is a bit long , probably ( like all my posts ) 200 % longer than necessary .
If you just want to see a neat DSL that implements Haskell and Python ’s List Comprehensions written in Ruby , just scroll to the bottom
If I do bother to read it all , will I learn some neat hacks ?
Yes , but you could learn them just as well by reading the source code directly .
So the benefit of reading the whole thing is ...?
The List Comprehensions DSL is the .
The source code is the .
But the essay is the Reading the whole thing will take you through some of the pitfalls of writing DSLs and explain why I chose my particular workarounds .
Furthermore , there are a lot of corners in Ruby where you can easily assume that things work one way , but really they do n’t .
If you actually try the snippets on your computer , you ’ll have a much better chance of remembering where the pitfalls are .
That ’s why I tried to give a working example for every point , rather than just explaining things in words .
Of course , if you have no interest in writing your own Domain Specific Languages in Ruby just yet ... this is n’t meant as a popular essay , rather it ’s meant as an experience report for fellow practitioners .
And honestly , there ’s a world market for maybe five tools for writing DSLs in Ruby .
But since you ’re here , the essay starts below !
Ruby is often touted as a good language for writing Domain - Specific Languages ( “ DSLs ” ) .
There are a few arguments in favour of writing a DSL as part of an application .
The first argument that comes to mind is that if the application ’s domain experts have a specific natural language or jargon of their own , writing a DSL makes it easy for programmers and domain experts to collaborate .
While it is rare to find substantial applications entirely written by non-programmers at this time in any language , it is quite feasible for non-programmers to write or validate portions of an application representing its “ business rules ” or domain logic , while programmers maintain its infrastructure .

is the perfect second Ruby book for serious programmers .
The Ruby Way contains more than four hundred examples explaining how to do everything from distribute Ruby with Rinda to dynamic programming techniques just like these .
Lispers are among the best grads of the Sweep - It - Under - Someone - Else ’s - Carpet School of Simulated Simplicity .
Another argument in favour of a DSL is that even when non-programmers are not involved directly in coding an application , the programmers themselves often have a jargon of their own to describe entities , algorithms and data structures in the application .
Having portions of the application written in a language closely resembling the programmer ’s own jargon makes it easy for them to read each other ’s work and understand its intent .
Successful examples of DSLs embedded within existing languages and frameworks include Ruby on Rails ’ ActiveRecord , where statements such as : Are self - documenting to anyone familiar with relational models .
The final argument I ’ll repeat here is that a DSL is a very effective way to separate the what from the how of an algorithm .
Separation of concerns is a desirable property of good programs , and DSLs provide this separation very clearly .
In the ActiveRecord examples above , the exact mechanisms of relating tables , validating records , and performing searches is “ abstracted away ” from the code where the programmer declares how she would like the results used .
DSLs can be hacked together quickly in Ruby ( whether they can be made sufficiently robust for your production needs may require considerably more care ) .
Hacking a DSL together with little effort is a benefit , especially when prototyping : sometimes the best way to design a DSL is to try to use it , so you can discover what you need to express .
Some developers have raised the concern that extensive use of “ magic ” features leads to code that cannot be understood or maintained .
My own feeling is that DSLs lead to code that is easier to understand , not more difficult to understand .
This leaves an argument about maintenance .
Some techniques for meta - programming , such as extending core classes like Array , have what you might call “ non-local effects .
” For example , two different pieces of code might try to extend the same core class , interfering with each other .
Each works in isolation and passes all of its unit tests .
But when plugged into a larger application that uses them together , they break .

I ’m trying to get the Zen of building DSLs using Ruby .
After reading a dozen or so pieces referenced by my favourite search engine , I have a feeling I ’m still not quite getting it .
Another problem occurs with extending theclass or creating “ top level ” methods to be used as verbs in a DSL .
You end up with name space crowding : you must be very careful that you do not redefine en existing method .
To fix this problem , the code that implements the DSL needs to be contained so that it does not interfere with other code .
We can still implement verbs as methods , but we must implement those methods in separate objects , classes , or modules .
An established technique for implementing methods in objects is to define the methods and then execute a block of code usingso that it has access to the object ’s methods .

I generally call “ Bullshit ! ” on any line of reasoning that sets up a straw man argument just to knock it down .
So read on with skepticism !
Alan Kay has said that he regrets popularizing the notion of “ Object - Oriented ” programming , and that he should have called it “ Message - Oriented ” programming .
You know , code expresses an idea better than words express an idea … when the idea is about coding .
Please try this example in irb .
Do n’t just skim the text and nod : there ’s a powerful learning mechanism at work when you physically do things as you ’re learning , even if it ’s just copying , pasting , comparing the result in one window to the text in another , and so on :
What does this show ?
Well , we have created a way to use a method defined in ourobject , a local variable , and a top - level method .
We can imagine scaling this up to defining a rich DSL in our DSL object and being able to mix verbs from the DSL with instance variables and other methods as we please .
Touching back on the subject of containment , we have definedin .
Nowis essentially global .
If we already definedsomewhere else , we just clobbered it .
And if we later run a piece of code that defines , we ’ll clobber our own version .
is different .
It ’s defined inside of an object , and it does n’t conflict with any otherwe define elsewhere .
Great !
So …
Can we cite a few examples of this technique in action ( such as Jamis ’ post where he callsandexamples of Sandboxing and Top - level methods ) and end the post here ?
No .
The code above looks fine .
But there is a hidden problem with this sandboxing technique : WTF ?!
This looks just like our top - level example , but we ’ve placed our code inside of amethod .
Andis a method in ClientCode : this way we can continue to separate concerns , keepinginside our DSL andinside of the class where we are using the DSL .
But it does n’t work .
As you know , everything in Ruby is either a variable or a method ( how it figures out the difference is a major irritation ) .
When you invoke a method , you are actually sending a message to a receiver .
Sometimes you name the receiver ( ) , and there is no ambiguity .
But when you just name the method ( like ) , Ruby tries to find the method for itself .
It does so by looking to see whether it is an instance method , in which case it behaves like .
If not , it looks to see whetheris top - level , in which case it calls that method in the .
See for yourself : See ?
It looks for instance methods and then for top - level methods if it ca n’t find anything .
( Again , we are hand - waving over the pesky problem with instance variables in the case where we do n’t use ) .
What ’s the problem ?
Well , I actually mis-described what happens .
Here it is again , with more precision :
It looks for methods defined in the object , and then for top - level methods if it ca n’t find anything .
Of course , is the current object .
Unless it is n’t :
That ’s whatdoes : it evaluates a block but it changesto point to its receiver instead of the object where the code is executing .
Everything else stays the same .
One more example to show the mechanism :
Now we see : when we use , we route around our current object and all of our methods are ignored within the block .
Ruby really only has two levels of scope : whatever belongs to self and whatever belongs to Kernel .
This state of affairs is unsatisfactory : we would like to introduce a DSL in such a way that we retain access to all of our methods without kludges ( like storing the current object in an instance variable ) .
You can think of the current scope as being nested inside of the top - level scope .
does n’t change the scope for things like local variables , it just pointselsewhere .
What we want is a new scope for our DSL nested inside of the current scope .
So when we search for a method , we should check the DSL .
If we do n’t find it there , check the current object ’s scope .
If we do n’t find it there , check the top - level .
Oops .
John McCarthy called from 1960 .
He wants Lisp ’s dynamic scoping back .
Yes , our new feature is almost fifty years old .
This is why either a through grounding in CS theory or a hobbyist ’s interest in the history of programming are important for programming : much of what we want to do has already been done before , and sometimes in unexpected contexts .
Who would have thought that a technique for helping programmers collaborate with Bond Traders has roots in Lisp 1.5 ?
Here ’s an implementation of a nested scope construct that does exactly what we want .
You declare a new class that extends , and then you can use methods from your DSL , from your current object , and from the top - level ( if you so choose ) .
For example : This does exactly what we want with methods .
There 's also a single extension to , the methodreplaces themethod so you can also say :
Themethod creates a new instance of your DSL class , so you can track state within an evaluation .
For example :
The first obvious drawback of this approach is that the blocks we pass tocannot take parameters .
For this reason , rumour has it that a method calledwill be added to Ruby in 1.9 .
( There are some implementations available that work in Ruby 1.8 if you would like to experiment . )
The second is that you do n’t get anything like nested local variables , a ‘ la Pascal , Scheme , or any other language with block structure .
Block structure is very powerful :
You can use a variable within a particular scope and nowhere else .
Here ’s a trivial example :
We 're using thesyntax .
In theDSL , there ’s a new method calledcreates a new DSL within .
You can see that re-declaringdoes not clobber the value in the outer scope .
That is because whenwrote a new DSL , it addedandas methods .
So really , that block of code says “ Write a new DSL whereandare methods returning zero and one .
Execute some code in that new DSL .
That code will createDSL whereis a method returning two .
” Becausedefines methods and not local variables , bad things happen when you try to override real local variables .
It ’s best to usefor some things and local variables for others , but not mix the two .
Like what , you ask ?
List Comprehension is syntactic sugar that lets you build collections using set - like notation .
For example , is a list comprehension in Haskell .
Here is a List Comprehensions DSL in Ruby .
Let ’s say we ’re building up a multiplication table .
We want tuples of the formgivenis in the rangeandis in the range .
Let ’s write that : ( In everyday use , you do n’t need a class and a method for each comprehension : the important bit is .
I just wrote it this way so you could see that comprehensions work fine inside of methods .
You can also use more than one comprehension inside of a singleblock : see the unit tests for examples . )
The expression in the block does n’t have to be a tuple :
And you can stick a “ where ” block on the end : Would you like to nest them ?
Your expression is the interpreter ’s command : What is the relationship to ?
Well , builds the scopes needed for evaluating the where clause and the block defining the elements of the list .
Yes , we ’ve built a DSL on top of a DSL on top of a DSL .
Does this seem like weird trickery ?
I do n’t know why .
Do you have any idea how many levels of abstraction are responsible for you reading this essay right now ?
This is what we humans do : we build tools on top of tools .
Your browser runs on an OS , possibly in a VM , perhaps in a hypervisor , on top of a BIOS , and on and on .
This is the normal state of affairs , not an exception .
It is possible to build DSLs in Ruby to facilitate cross-functional teamwork and separation of concerns .
Care must be taken to avoid polluting the top - level name space , but it is possible to work within sandboxes and still have access to the current object ’s context .

The Iraqi oil deal set to go before the country ’s parliament next month could spell the end of the country as a nation state , and signals a major Bush victory in the war .
The proposed law not only opens the door to the big international oil companies , but offers them lucrative contract deals , and even a place on the national oil board that will run the industry .
The Byzantine scheme for dividing up oil revenues on the basis of population is little more than a facade for the biggest rip off of resources since the British barged into Mesopotamia more than a century ago .
This law sanctions contracts between Iraq ’s individual regions and foreign oil companies .
It effectively puts an end to a nationalized petroleum industry that has provided most of the country ’s revenue .
Over time , the oil revenues might sustain an independent Kurdistan , along with a Shia state , and a Sunni state ( though the Sunnis do n’t have much oil , at least among the known Iraqi reserves ) .
The law sets up a system that opens the door for foreign companies to make the country ’s oil policy .
A new federal Oil and Gas Council is to assist the Council of Ministers , “ in coordination with the producing provinces and regions . ”
This council is to include the prime minister and other cabinet members , directors of the central bank , representatives from the various regions , and “ executive managers from important related petroleum companies , including the national Iraqi oil company and the oil marketing company . ”
Thanks to Raed Jarrar , you can read an English translation of the new law at Al - Ghad , the “ voice of the democratic left in Iraq . ”
The main opposition to the proposal comes from the federation of Iraq oil unions , whose president , Hasan Jum`ah ` Awwad al - Asadi , Head of the Federation of Oil Unions , said in a February 6 speech that “ We strongly warn all the foreign companies and foreign capital in the form of American companies against coming into our lands under the guise of production - sharing agreements . ”
Al - Asadi called the law “ unbalanced , ” arguing that “ it has been drafted in a great rush in harsh circumstances ” and would set “ region against region . ”
Other opponents of the deal have formed a coalition led by the London - based group Platform .
While the deal , on its face , splits up control of Iraq ’s oil among Kurds , Shia and Sunnis , the real power remains in the hands of international companies that will craft contracts with Iraq ’s regional entities and put up most or all of the money for exploration , development of infrastructure , and actual production , primarily through financial devices known as production sharing agreements .
These agreements , which are not widely used in the industry , typically involve a public and a private partner , and stipulate that oil revenue will first go to the private partner to cover expenses and exploration costs .
In Iraq , those costs are likely to be considerable since the industrial infrastructure will have to be rebuilt in many areas and much of the country ’s oil has not yet been mapped .
Arguments between the parties will be settled by tribunals outside Iraq .
The new law would give the international companies the right to set the rates of production of each oil field .
These fields are immense ; a single one can account for 10 percent of the nation ’s budget .
“ Sovereignty is surrendered with this law , ” Ewa Jasiecz of Platform , the London - based group that has followed the evolution of the new law , tells Mother Jones from London .
“ Their dealings are secretive , in English .
Disputes will be settled by international tribunals in Paris or Geneva .
They operate outside Iraqi law . ”
( Platform has published an extensive critique of Iraqi oil politics here . )
Iraq currently has the second or third largest known oil reserves in the world ; once completely mapped , it may turn out to have the largest reserves , period .
These reserves will become more important over time because Saudi Arabia ’s reserves are now widely believed to have been overstated , and are in any case beginning to decline .
In that context , private control of oil in Iraq — not a member of OPEC — also presents a serious challenge to whatever control OPEC still has over prices and production .
People who say the United States lost the war are missing an important point .
The oil companies may well be winning .
Claim : Films are routinely made for entertainment purposes in which participants are murdered on camera .
Status : False .
Origins :
All the fretting about it aside , not so much as one snuff film has been found .
Time and again , what is originally decried in the press as a film of a murder turns out , upon further investigation , to be a fake .
Police on three continents routinely investigate films brought to them , and so far this has always been their verdict .
No snuff films .
Some clever fakes , yes .
But no real
product .
( Al Goldstein , publisher of Screw magazine , has a standing offer of $ 1 million for anyone who can come up with a commercially sold snuff film .
That offer has been in place for years .
No one has yet laid claim to it . )
It ’s not enough to fear there might be one snuff film out there ; the belief runs strong that a large creation and distribution network is in operation , with children and young people routinely kidnapped then killed while the cameras roll to meet demand and the films of same circulated through this underground to connoisseurs of the genre .
The prurience of human nature being what it is , it ’s not unreasonable to assume if the films existed , there would be those willing to pay to have them .
This assumption lies at the heart of the belief that the distribution network is in place .
However , fears that a market for such offerings exists are unfounded ; even if the market did exist , the product to satisfy it is not there .
Hence , there ’s no market .
Each of the following four elements contributes to the belief that snuff films exist :
Society ’s fascination with gore has led filmmakers to experiment with how realistic they can make a horror scene .
This has led to the creation of some incredible fakes , including the infamous Flower of Flesh and Blood of the “ Guinea Pig ” series .
of the “ Guinea Pig ” series .
Numerous compilation films in which death scenes — both real and staged — exist .
Of these , the Faces of Death series is the most widely known .
series is the most widely known .
A number of horror films use as their premise the making of a snuff film or the discovery of same .
Rumors about various serial killers videotaping the last moments of their victims abound .
( In an extension of the serial killer rumor , some claim these films subsequently found their way into the marketplace . )
What with all of these elements being interwoven into the fabric of current society as tightly as they are , it ’s close to impossible for any rational person to conclude snuff films do n’t exist .
Offhand references to them pop up everywhere .
Indeed , the genre for this group of videos even has a name , one we casually invoke the same way we would speak of “ horror ” films or “ romantic comedies ” — could something we speak of so confidently be a chimera ?
And yet , that is exactly the case .
Capturing a murder on film would be foolhardy at best .
Only the most deranged would consider preserving for a jury a perfect video record of a crime he could go to the executioner for .
Even if he stays completely out of the camera ’s way , too much of who the killer is , how the murder was carried out , and where it took place would be part of such a film , and these details would quickly lead police to the right door .
Though someone whose mania has caused him to lose touch with reality might skip over this point , those who are supposedly in the business for the money would be all too aware of this .
It does n’t make sense to flirt with the electric chair for the profits derived from a video .
Let ’s start by defining the term and locating its origin , then move on to examine some high - profile films often believed to contain snuff footage , and finish with an examination of the serial killers “ souvenir of the kill ” angle .
Definition of the Term :
As to what is or is not a snuff film , according to Kerekes and Slater , authors of Killing for Culture , the bible on the snuff film rumor :
Snuff films depict the killing of a human being — a human sacrifice ( without the aid of special effects or other trickery ) perpetuated for the medium of film and circulated amongst a jaded few for the purpose of entertainment .
It ’s a simple definition , but a workable one .
Some will further claim that a profit motive must exist , that the final product has to be offered for sale ( as opposed to being passed around without charge within a select circle , or remaining solely in the possession of its maker ) .
That detail is extraneous .
It ’s the recording of the death itself which constitutes the “ snuff ” in snuff films , not who makes a buck out of it .
Likewise , claims that the filmmaker must have had no other motivation than the production of the film should be dismissed .
A psychopath who tortures and murders solely to satisfy his personal demons but who videotapes the event to create a reliveable record of the experience has produced a snuff film .
Origin of the Term : Unbelievably , the term was coined during the furor arising from the Manson Family murders of 1969 .
On 9 August 1969 , Sharon Tate and four others were butchered by members of Charles Manson ’s “ Family . ”
The next night , a married couple in a neighborhood far distant from that of the Tate residence were slaughtered in similar fashion by the same group .
Manson and four of his followers were brought to trial in June , 1970 , found guilty of the murders , and sentenced to die .
Their sentences were later commuted to life in prison when the death penalty was abolished in 1972 .
Reinstatement of the death penalty in 1977 did not affect the revised sentences as re-sentencing them ( or any of the other inmates whose death sentences had been commuted to life during the “ no death penalty ” phase ) to the original penalty was deemed “ cruel and unusual . ”
Manson and his group are still in prison .
Numerous books were written about the Family , their practices , and the murders they took part in .
The best known is Vincent Bugliosi ’s 1974 Helter Skelter .
However , it is towards Ed Sanders ’ 1971 The Family : The Story of Charles Manson ’s Dune Buggy Attack Battalion to which we turn .
In it , Sanders relates that the Family may have been involved in the making of “ brutality ” ( or as he later terms them , “ snuff ” ) films .
This was the first recorded use of the term .
Pausing for a moment to deal with the rumor raised about Manson and snuff films , Family members stole an NBC - TV truck loaded with film equipment sometime during the summer of 1969 .
The truck was later dumped and most of the film given away , but Manson kept one of the NBC cameras .
The Family were also said to be in possession of three Super - 8 cameras and to have used them to make homegrown porn films .
The snuff film allegation comes from Sander ’s interview with an anonymous one - time member of the Family in which Sanders hears about a “ short movie depicting a female victim dead on a beach . ”
ANON : I , I , I knew , I know , I only know about one snuff movie .
I , uh , you know —
SANDERS : Which snuff movie do you know about ?
ANON : I just know like a young chick maybe about 27 , short hair … yeah … and chopped her head off , that was . . .
SANDERS : What did the girl look like ?
What was the scenario ?
ANON : What was what ?
SANDERS : What was the scenario ?
Was she tied up ?
Did she look willing ?
ANON : She was dead .
She was just lying there .
SANDERS : She was already dead ?
ANON : Yeah .
Legs spread , uh .
She was nude but nobody was fucking her .
They said her head was just chopped off and she was just laying there .
( At this point the interviewee acknowledged he had n’t actually seen the film himself but was instead relating a story he ’d heard . )
From this fanciful beginning , the term “ snuff ” came to be used to identify films of this nature .
As for Manson and the NBC camera , police seized the last of the stolen equipment — consisting of a camera loaded with unexposed film — during a 10 October 1969 raid on Spahn Ranch .
In later editions of The Family , Sanders admits no films depicting actual murder or murder victims have surfaced .
A 1984 film called Family Movies is sometimes mistaken for home movies of the Family , but all of its characters are friends of the director , John Aes - Nihil .
The First “ Snuff ” Film :
In 1976 the movie Snuff caused a tremendous stir when the word hit the street that an actual film depicting the on - screen murder of an actress had been smuggled into the States from South America , and this was it .
Widely - believed hype aside , the film ’s origin was much more mundane .
Snuff was a product of Monarch Releasing Corporation and had been filmed in Argentina in 1971 as Slaughter , a film about bad girls , motorcycles , and bad guys .
Slaughter was so ineptly made as to be unreleasable .
Five years later , the head of Monarch breathed new life into this terrible piece by splicing on five minutes of additional footage , releasing it as Snuff , and spreading the word this was an actual snuff film .
People were horrified , sickened , titillated , outraged . . . and they went to see it , shelling out the ticket price without argument .
Faces of Death :
Possibly the most famous of all films pointed to as “ snuff ” is the Faces Of Death series , a sequence of six videos made up of footage of accidents , suicides , autopsies , and executions , liberally peppered with outright fakes scenes .
Most of the actual death scenes shown in these films are of the post - death variety .
The multiple camera angles give away the acted - out nature of many of the most compelling scenes .
Guinea Pig : Early in 1991 , a film of Asian origin rumored to contain actual snuff footage came into the possession of actor Charlie Sheen .
Sheen turned it over to the FBI , quite convinced he ’d stumbled onto the real thing , and heartily sickened by what he ’d seen .
The film in question was Flower of Flesh and Blood , part of a series of films collectively known as “ Guinea Pig . ”
Some of the “ Guinea Pig ” films have at least temporarily fooled the authorities , fueling news stories about the unearthing of snuff films .
It ’s no wonder either ; the special effects are very cleverly executed .
Flower of Flesh and Blood is the episode which stirs much of the controversy .
It features a samurai torturing then dismembering a captive girl until she eventually expires in front of the cameras .
It was n’t real .
According to The San Francisco Chronicle :
The FBI confiscated Sheen ’s tape and proceeded to investigate all involved , including Charles Balun , an early distributor of the film .
Balun fiercely asserted that the film was a hoax and was merely a series of startling special effects .
Propitiously , the Japanese took this time to release ” Guinea Pig Two : The Making of Guinea Pig One , ” revealing the technical sleight of hand in all its bone - cracking glory .
After viewing this film , the FBI backed off and dropped the investigation .
In a stunning display of bad taste , this film was shown on San Francisco ’s public access channel in October 1996 .
Serial Killers :
As serial killers are apprehended and brought to trial , it is not uncommon for the “ snuff film rumor ” to surface about the murders they committed .
Perhaps these whispers are born of an attempt to explain the inexplicable , to make some sense of that which is beyond the abilities of most of us to grasp .
It ’s at least a motive we ’ve a chance of understanding .
Almost every time the rumor arises , there ’s utterly nothing to it other than the public ’s attempt to make sense of a monster .
Rumors spring up , swirl around for a while , then disappear as the evidence to support them fails to materialize and the public ’s fevered imagination is captured by newer , more horrific events .
Yet every now and then , there ’s at least a little bit of fire lurking beneath all that generated smoke .
Such is the case with the murders committed by Charles Ng and Leonard Lake and with those perpetuated by Paul Bernardo ( aka Paul Teale ) and Karla Homolka .
For both of those murderous pairings , videotape of the victims featured prominently , both in the investigations and at trial .
Not videotapes of the murders though — videotape of the victims while they were still alive .
One other deadly pair deserves mention : Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris .
You ’ll soon see why .
Serial Killers — Lake and Ng : In northern California , during a span of eight months in 1984 and 1985 , Leonard Lake and Charles Ng murdered more victims than the police can even now properly count up .
Next to the cabin Lake lived in , seven bodies and 45 pounds of bones and ash scattered across a 2 - acre Calaveras County compound were discovered .
More bodies were uncovered over time , but the police do n’t believe they ’ve found all of them .
They conservatively estimate the pair ’s body count at upwards of 20 victims .
Lake and Ng kidnapped women and held them as sexual slaves before murdering them .
Men who got in the way or children the women had with them were murdered outright .
Lake committed suicide in 1985 shortly after being arrested on suspicion of shoplifting .
After fleeing to Canada and finally being extradited from there , in 1999 Ng stood trial in Orange County , California , for 12 of those murders and was found guilty of 11 of them .
He was sentenced to death and is currently on death row at San Quentin State Prison .
Videotape of Ng interacting with two of the women subsequently butchered by the pair was introduced at his trial .
In one he ’s seen releasing Kathleen Allen from her bonds while Lake ( off - camera ) demands , “ Undress for us .
We want to see what we bought . ”
In another , Ng is seen using a large knife to cut the bra off Brenda O’Connor , then dispassionately telling her , “ Nothing is yours now .
It ’ll be totally ours . ”
Though there is no doubt about the eventual fate of these women , it does n’t take place on camera .
All rumors to the contrary , no film exists of Lake or Ng killing anyone .
Serial Killers — Bernardo and Homolka :
As serial killers , Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka can be considered less depraved than Lake and Ng only in so far as they did n’t murder nearly as many .
And that is about the most charitable thing that can be said of them .
They too were monsters .
In 1991 in southern Ontario ( Canada ) , this husband - and - wife team kidnapped , kept as a sex slave , then two weeks later murdered 14 - year - old Leslie Mahaffy .
In 1992 , they abducted 15 - year - old Kristen French , kept her for the same purpose for one week , then likewise ended her life .
Videotape of French being raped at knifepoint and Mahaffy being assaulted while blindfolded and with her hands cuffed behind her back were shown to the jury during Bernardo ’s trial .
Bernardo is also seen urinating on French and attempting to defecate on her .
However , as with Lake and Ng , there ’s no film of either murder .
Predating the deaths of French and Mahaffy , the pair had taken the life of another young victim , Homolka ’s 15 - year - old sister , Tammy Lyn .
On Christmas Eve 1990 and as her Christmas present to her then - boyfriend , Homolka drugged the girl with animal tranquilizers , making it possible for Bernardo to rape her at leisure .
The child never regained consciousness .
She choked on her own vomit and died that night .
Videotape of the rape exists .
The audio portions of it were played for the jury during Bernardo ’s trial .
The video portion was omitted — the judge deemed it too terrible to be viewed in the courtroom .
In 1993 , for her part in all three murders , Homolka was sentenced to 12 years behind bars .
Bernardo was sentenced to life in prison in 1995 .
Serial Killers — Bittaker and Norris :
In 1979 Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris bought , then made over a 1977 silver GMC cargo van to facilitate the kidnapping of young girls in southern California .
The two men had met in prison and there discovered a common interest — raping and killing teenage girls .
The following is a list of their victims and dates of death :
24 June 1979 — Cindy Schaeffer ( 16 years old )
8 July 1979 — Andrea Joy Hall ( 18 years old )
3 September 1979 — Jackie Gilliam ( 15 years old )
3 September 1979 — Leah Lamp ( 13 years old )
31 October 1979 — Shirley Ledford ( 16 years old )
All were picked up while hitchhiking .
The van ( “ Murder Mac , ” as christened by Bittaker ) was used to transport the first four girls to a remote area of the San Gabriel mountains where the rapes and murders took place .
Their final victim , Shirley Ledford , was raped , sodomized , tortured , and killed in the van during a two - hour drive through the San Fernando Valley .
It is the audio recording made during that ride that is the closest thing in existence to a snuff film — though the tape is only 18 minutes long and ends well before the girl is killed , it ’s definitely from that brief and fatal encounter .
In return for his cooperation and testimony against Bittaker , the prosecution agreed not to seek the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole for Norris .
He was sentenced to 45 years to life and is eligible for parole in 2010 .
Bittaker was tried by jury , and on 17 February 1981 convicted on 26 charges of rape , torture , kidnapping , and murder .
He was sentenced to die and now sits on death row in a California prison .
In 1996 Bittaker sued the state , claiming he ’d been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment because he ’d been served broken cookies and soggy sandwiches while in the care of its penal system .
Conclusion :
When it comes to snuff films , it ’s easy to be romanced by what appears in the news into believing verifiable examples of the genre are out there .
Time and again , however , what was ballyhooed as the seizure of a cache of snuff films turns out to be the netting of fakes like the Flower of Flesh and Blood tape or compilation films of the Faces of Death ilk .
These are n’t snuff films . . . but you rarely see members of the press taking pains to make this point clear , thus leaving the general public with the idea that tapes of such murders abound .
Likewise , anyone who claims to have participated in the making or distribution of a snuff film gets his day in the papers .
That the videos fail to turn up might net a tiny followup on a far distant date , but even then not on anything approaching the scale on which the original “ Suspect Claims He Was Part of a Snuff Film Ring ! ” articles were emblazoned across the front page .
The world being full of depraved individuals is used as justification for believing in the snuff film fallacy .
That it could happen is translated in the minds of many to it must have happened .
Somewhere .
At some time .
We just have n’t found the film yet .
The rumor about snuff films has been with us since the early 1970s .
In close to 30 years , not one of those films has surfaced .
When tempted to believe this rumor , keep that fact close to your heart .
Remind yourself — again and again , if you have to — that nothing ever comes of these investigations .
It ’s possible the unthinkable did come close to happening at one time .
In 1989 , two Virginia men were arrested by the FBI after broadcasting on a computer bulletin board their plans to kidnap a randomly - selected boy , molest , then kill him for a pornographic snuff film .
Daniel Depew and Dean Lambey were picked up , tried , and thrown in jail for hatching this plot , with Depew sentenced to 33 years behind bars , and Lambey to 30 .
Would they have carried out the scheme ?
It ’s hard to say now — their defense maintained all their chatter was nothing but a sick fantasy the men aired , not something they would have acted on .
The judge ( needless to say in light of those sentences ) thought different .
The only snuff films proven to exist involve animals .
In 1998 , nine “ squish ” videos were seized by Scottish police and their distributor arrested .
These videos showed scantily - clad women crushing under their high heels an assortment of small animals , including frogs , mice , insects , and a snail .
Authorities say the same items have been available in Britain since 1996 .
Driving to the heart of the matter and pushing aside for the moment all the fakes and movies about movies , it ’s the activities of serial killers which come closest to mimicking the snuff film bogeyman .
In some instances , videotape does exist of murderers torturing victims they would later kill off - camera .
Some day it ’s possible all of a murder will turn up on such a tape .
Even so , purists will tend to dismiss this footage because it does not conform to an overly - strict definition involving the necessity for a profit motive .
If these snippets of film are to be dismissed , it should be for an entirely different reason .
Fear of a thriving snuff film industry is what drives this popular myth .
As a society , we ’re not all that concerned with the concept of serial killers walking among us , killing here and there , because no one thinks of himself or his loved ones as potential serial murder victims .
In our naivete , we still equate being selected as a sicko’s prey with the victim either having done something to bring it on or not being bright enough to tell something was wrong with the guy .
( We hang onto the comforting yet nutty idea we ’d be able to recognize such a monster a mile away . )
Being beyond reproach ourselves ( we ’d never do anything to rile such a maniac ) and quite brilliant about recognizing serial killers , we do n’t live in fear of the sex - crazed or hears - voices - in - his - head crazy — clearly , he wo n’t come after us .
However , we do fear the notion of a “ murder as a business ” set - up because that takes the slavering maniac right out of the picture and in his place substitutes the Reasonable Man Out To Make a Buck .
Victims of such a scheme could be undeserving ( innocent ) — this could happen to us !
And it is on the back of this fear belief in the myth rides in on .
We fear not the killers among us , but the businessmen .

Veiled in black from head to toe , the young women wield bamboo staves and speak in hushed but defiant tones of fighting to the death should Pakistani police seek to evict them .
Several hundred female students from an Islamic seminary in the center of Islamabad have been holed up for the last month inside a public library , in an unprecedented protest that poses a dilemma for President Pervez Musharraf ’s government .
The young women ’s ostensible demand is the rebuilding of half a dozen mosques in the capital that the government tore down because they were constructed on illegally seized land .
Dozens more are under demolition orders .
But the dissident Muslim cleric who appears to have masterminded the protest has parlayed it into a broader challenge to Musharraf ’s authority , at a time when the president is under growing Western pressure to act against Islamic militants who find sanctuary in Pakistan .
Advertisement
“ People are angry that Musharraf is a puppet of America , ” said Abdul Rashid Ghazi , who together with his cleric brother , Abdul Aziz , runs the Lal Masjid , or Red Mosque , which adjoins the girls ’ seminary and the library .
“ That is the heart of the matter . ”
Pakistani authorities view the mosque as a hotbed of radicalism , and orders are out for the arrest of both clerics .
The confrontation is playing out against the backdrop of some of the most stringent state precautions in years against suicide bombings by Islamic militants in Pakistan , which have claimed scores of lives since the start of the year .
Attackers have targeted the capital ’s international airport , a luxury hotel , a courtroom and various security installations .
On Saturday , three men in central Pakistan accidentally blew themselves up while reportedly on their way to attack a slain policeman ’s memorial service .
Authorities said their motorbike hit a bump , prematurely detonating their bomb belts .

The mosque protest appears to be an explicit warning to Musharraf against bowing to Western demands that he reform the country ’s network of more than 13,000 madrasas , or religious schools .
Many are known to have direct links to militant groups that have been staging attacks both in Pakistan and abroad , and have sent fighters to battle North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops across the border in Afghanistan .
In tightly policed Pakistan , it is almost unheard of for a protest on public property to continue for as long as this one has .
The police ’s hands - off approach contrasts sharply with the rough treatment of demonstrators who in recent months have protested the detention of terrorism suspects without trial , charges or notification of relatives .
At those protests , relatives of the detainees were beaten and arrested , and on some occasions , police pulled down protesters ’ trousers to shame them .
The Pakistani government ’s inaction against the female students stems in part from religious and cultural taboos against physical contact between unrelated men and women .
Authorities have said they do not have enough female officers to carry out arrests .

But it also is likely that a police move on the mosque complex would trigger a violent clash with masked , club - wielding men who are on round - the - clock guard atop its walls , and perhaps set off a larger fight with followers of Aziz from other mosques and madrasas in the capital and nearby Rawalpindi .
The government has tried , without success , to placate the protesters .
Earlier this month , demolition orders against 81 mosques were rescinded , and work began on reconstruction of one of the mosques that was knocked down .
But instead of dispersing , the protesters expanded their demands .
The young women now say they will not abandon their protest until Sharia , or Islamic law , is imposed throughout Pakistan .
“ That is the only way that this will end , ” said Amna Adeem , a 20 - year - old protester wearing a black veil that left only her flashing brown eyes uncovered .
Like many of the seminary students taking part in the sit-in , she is from Pakistan ’s North - West Frontier Province , which is far more religiously conservative than Islamabad , the relatively cosmopolitan seat of government .

The protesters appear ready for a long confrontation .
Supporters arrive every few hours with large , steaming pots of food .
Mattresses and quilts are spread out on the upper floors of the library .
The young women said that they spend their days in Koranic studies and that they sleep in shifts so a large contingent is always awake and standing guard in the library ’s main room .
The government says it will move at some point to rein in the protesters , but has not said how .
Security personnel have several times cordoned off the area , but quickly got into scuffles with neighborhood residents , many of whom also are followers of Aziz .
“ This can not go on indefinitely , ” said the country ’s religious affairs minister , Ijaz ul - Haq , who accused Aziz of using the young women as “ human shields . ”
Advertisement
“ This is n’t what Islam teaches , ” Haq said .
Negotiations have proved fruitless , he said .
Ghazi , Aziz ’s brother , denied reports that militants had stockpiled weapons on the mosque grounds .
Earlier this month , one of the young women was photographed by a Pakistani newspaper holding what appeared to be an AK - 47 assault rifle , but Ghazi later said it was only a toy .
He insisted that he and his brother had not orchestrated the protest , but warned that efforts to quell it by force would be met with resistance .

“ We will do whatever we have to do for the protection of Islam , ” said Adeem , the female student .
“ The government can bring in its weapons , whatever it likes , but we will never give in . ”

‘ They do n’t want to work for you ’
The Block
One of the contestants is framed as a tyrant after being told his plasterers do n’t like working for him , which forces him to do some serious self - reflection .
WASHINGTON , July 31 — Leading Congressional Democrats , after months of division over Iraq , have called on President Bush to begin a phased redeployment of troops by the end of this year , a unified statement signaling they have concluded that the war could hurt Republicans in the midterm elections .
The letter called on American forces in Iraq to make a transition to a “ more limited mission ” dealing with counterterrorism and training and logistical support of Iraq security forces .
“ In the interests of American national security , our troops , and our taxpayers , the open - ended commitment in Iraq that you have embraced cannot and should not be sustained , ” said the letter , dated July 30 and released Monday .
It was signed by a dozen Democratic leaders , including Harry Reid of Nevada , the Senate minority leader , and Nancy Pelosi , the House Democratic leader .
“ Mr. President , simply staying the course in Iraq is not working , ” the Democrats wrote .
“ We need to take a new direction .
We believe these recommendations comprise an effective alternative to the current open - ended commitment , which is not producing the progress in Iraq we would all like to see . ”
Some animal researchers do n't even tell their own families about their work for fear of attack by extremists .
But at last , some are beginning to speak out
Susan ( not her real name ) is not just ex-directory .
The name she is known by at work cannot be found on the electoral roll , and she has done her best to delete it from mailing lists of all kinds .
As an animal researcher , you can't be too careful , she says .
Most of her family do not know exactly how she has spent the past 17 years in the lab .
" I wish I could be more open about it .
I wish I had the courage to be , " she says .
" I would love to tell people the fascinating things I have found out through my research .
But some people will never understand my work , however much I might justify it as ultimately helping humans . "
Now that Susan is a mother of two , she is even more careful to ensure animal rights activists do not get their hands on her contact details .
Jackie ( also not her real name ) will not read any scientific paper on animal research on the tube , or talk about her rodent experiments outside her home .
" You do n't know who might be sitting at the next table .
I do n't want to put those I am close to in a potentially dangerous position , " she says .
" I have been doing animal - based pharmacology research for 30 years , and have always been advised to be cautious about whom I talk to . "
Nervous colleagues
Then there is Julian ( again , not his real name ) , whose colleagues are nervous about sixth - formers on work experience in his university lab .
" They want to know as much about the school the teenagers come from as possible .
They say they are worried that their personal details , and information about our experiments with mice , will be passed on to potentially dangerous sources . "
Life as an animal researcher can be lonely and punctuated with paranoia .
The Research Defence Society ( RDS ) is a non-governmental organisation representing UK medical researchers in the public debate about the use of animals in medical research and testing .
It advises those concerned about attacks by animal rights activists on how they can make sure their phone numbers are ex-directory , and suggests that they check their credit report has not been looked at by suspicious organisations .
The society also tells scientists how they can remove their names from the electoral roll and marketing lists .
In 2004 , an animal rights website listed the home addresses and phone numbers of Oxford University staff , to protest against an animal - testing laboratory the university is building .
A year later , animal rights activists claimed responsibility for an arson attack aimed at intimidating those behind the plans for the lab .
John Stein , an Oxford physiology professor whose research has involved recording the brain activity of monkeys , has received death threats and threatening letters from activists .
Letter bombs
When Colin Blakemore , chief executive officer of the Medical Research Council , was an Oxford University professor , he had missiles thrown through the windows of his home and was sent letter bombs .
One , containing explosives wrapped with needles , was opened by one of his children .
Professor Sir Nicholas
Wright , the warden of Queen Mary 's School of Medicine and Dentistry , who has been at the forefront of medical research for more than 30 years , has also received death threats .
His car and home have had to be protected .
Cambridge University scientists had their cars vandalised and received abusive emails from animal rights activists five years ago over plans that were later shelved to build a primate laboratory .
Just three years ago , according to the RDS , only a handful of animal researchers were willing to talk openly about their work .
But the tide is changing and today , at least 100 are ready to speak and be named .
A previously unpublished RDS survey reveals that just two out of 60 individuals who spoke about their work in national newspapers in 2004 and 2005 attracted threats or abuse .
Both worked at an institution well known to activists .
Four others received cranky emails , or a mention on a website .
Dr Simon Festing , the executive director of the RDS , says this shows that " contrary to researchers ' common perceptions , it is clear that the vast majority of people have nothing to fear from speaking out " .
An amendment to the Serious Organised Crime Act , which came into force in July 2005 , meant animal rights activists could face up to seven years in jail for attacks such as burning down labs or supporting terrorism .
The Department for Trade and Industry and the Home Office have said that " animal research has helped save hundreds of millions of lives and is carried out only when absolutely necessary and under stringent controls " .
Such government backing has seeped through to researchers , as has the shift towards a more positive view of animal research from the population at large .
And Festing says the pharmaceutical industry , the government , research funders and charities are pumping billions of pounds into building laboratories where research on animals will take place .
Last year , 16 - year - old Laurie Pycroft , frustrated with the way that those opposed to vivisection were dominating the public debate on animal research , founded Pro-Test .
His high - profile campaign supports the construction of the animal research laboratory at Oxford , which has been beset by problems , including intimidating letters to shareholders and delays due to threats of violence .
His group has been endorsed by hundreds of Oxford residents , students and scientists .
Dr Sarah Bailey , a pharmacology lecturer at the University of Bath , says animal researchers began to be much more open about their work after the coverage given to Pro -Test .
" It was one of the reasons why , last summer , I felt able to speak out about my research , " she says .
Bailey 's finding - that a popular treatment for severe acne produced depressive behaviour in mice - was widely reported .
" I thought the climate was right to be open about what I do .
I was nervous , though .
A lot of colleagues said , are you sure you are doing the right thing ?
" But I thought if a group of teenagers could stand up and say animal research is the right thing to do , then should n't we as medical researchers be able to , too ?
Our work is publicly funded , after all .
We need to justify it .
The more people speak out , the more we can portray the reality of animal research , which is that we can only answer questions about certain diseases by using animals in our research . "
Active engagement
A spokeswoman for Oxford University says : " We certainly understand that for many individuals the impulse to speak publicly can often be overwhelmed by concerns .
However , the number of people at Oxford actively engaging with the media and the public has risen quite dramatically over the past few years .
More people are seeking out opportunities to talk about their research and its benefits , and about animal welfare issues , in documentaries , radio programmes , debates , newspapers and online forums .
And people are creating opportunities , as well as responding to offers to participate in debate . "
Bailey , however , admits that she is considering going ex-directory and still skirts around the topic of what she does with strangers .
" I have been known to tell white lies when asked whether I do animal research .
You develop strategies to deflect those who ask what you do .
Certainly my PhD students are wary of speaking out . "
The RDS publishes advice to animal researchers this week on how to communicate their work to the public without attracting the attention of animal rights activists .
Festing , its author , is critical of universities ' tactics up until now .
Bad publicity
He writes : " Committed anti-vivisectionists will never be persuaded of the need for animal research .
These campaigning groups have been able to generate significant opposition to animal research and bad publicity for universities .
" In response , most research institutions have taken a largely reactive approach to the issue of animal experimentation , with little or no preparation or planning .
However , better communication and greater transparency are the best ways to engender trust and public support .
Experience has shown that when universities communicate openly , they attract the greatest interest from those who are most supportive , such as medical students , animal technicians and lecturers in biomedical subjects . "
But , Wright says , universities cannot be expected to do a great deal to protect their researchers .
" They have a limited budget .
They do their best already .
People are just vulnerable , " he says .
Last week , police said the recent letter - bomb attacks may have had an animal rights connection .
But Festing believes animal rights extremism has plummeted now that the law has changed .
" I predict that animal researchers will soon come out into the open on a massive scale , " he says .
It is something Jackie is thinking about .
" If you do n't put the counter - arguments , it looks as though you have something to hide , " she says .
" I can see that it is very important to discuss with young people how drugs are discovered , and how we can improve human and animal welfare , because we form our ideas fairly early on in life .
I 'm chewing over whether I 'll speak up or not . "
The news coming out of England this morning is depressing , and the reactions to it scary .
I am glad that Parris returned home from Ireland on Monday , else she might be caught up in the madness at Heathrow .
I am of course pleased that the British caught a bunch of terrorists , and look forward to seeing them tried , and the evidence of their plots ( these liquid explosives and electronic triggers ) brought forward in a court of law , but I am aghast at the " security " measures that are now being taken in the wake of those arrests .
I have always hated airline " security . "
Step by step , year by year , the TSA and its predecessors have taken away more and more of our freedoms , subjecting millions of perfectly innocent travellers to searches and interrogations and other hassles in the vague hopes of catching hijackers ( in the old days ) and terrorists ( these days ) .
Even if it worked , the price would be too high , but of course it does not work .
It has never worked .
All of the 9/11 killers strolled through airport " security " without a problem , yet little old ladies in wheelchairs are pulled from line and patted down , people who have never committeed a crime in their life are being forced to remove their shoes and belts and empty their pockets , and cigarette lighters and toy guns and Swiss army knives are being confiscated and sold ( yes , that 's what they do with those lighters they take from people , they SELL them and keep the bucks ) .
And now , in the wake of the arrests in England , a new wave of rules and prohibitions are about to be foisted on us by TSA -- no liquids or gels in carry on , no electronic devices of any kind , no ipods , no cell - phones , no cameras ( some reports are even claiming that books are being banned , though that makes no sense whatsoever to me ) .
You are supposed to put your electronics in your checked baggage , they say .
Your UNLOCKED checked baggage , another infuriating rule foisted on us by the TSA .
And of course what happens if your electronics are damaged and stolen en route ?
Why , nothing ... the airlines take no responsibility , and TSA wo n't either .
Will TSA start confiscating iPods and cellphones and laptops at the security gates now ?
Hey , those will certainly bring in a lot more dosh than lighters when they 're sold .
I wonder how long this prohibition on electronics will last , and how far it will extend ?
If this truly includes ALL electronics , it will effectively end my own ability to travel by air .
Forget about book tours in the future , forget about seeing me at any con that I cannot drive to .
Right now , I am even worried about how I am going to get to worldcon ... though LA is close enough so that , if worse comes to worst , I will be able to drive .
Obviously , that wo n't apply next year for Yokahama , if these new rules become permanent .
What 's next , I wonder ?
Anal probes , x-rays , body cavity searches ?
Have we become such a nation of sheep that we will line up and swallow all this meekly ?
If so , let 's change the words in our national anthem .
Instead of " land of the free and home of the brave , " maybe " land of the safe and home of the scared " would do .
About Gup Shup
Welcome to this space .
Let me briefly introduce myself .
My name is Raj Singh .
I was born and raised in Toronto , ON , Canada , and am currently a graduate student in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , in Cambridge , MA , USA .
My research at M.I.T. is devoted to understanding gup shup , an idea to which this space is dedicated .
It actually was n’t until I spent about a year and a half in Amsterdam that I realized I wanted to devote my research ( and other ) efforts to understanding and contributing to this idea , to gup shup .
“ Gup shup ” is a Punjabi term meaning something like the English “ chit chat . ”
It conveys the idea of conversation among people in a very relaxed and open atmosphere .
The term is formed by a linguistic process called “ reduplication , ” something like the way in English we ’d say “ coffee shmoffee . ”
The point of this space is to enable gup shup to occur freely , without any artifical restrictions imposed by outside influences , the way we find in other “ public ” forums , such as the corporate media .
My research on gup shup explores the formal mechanisms that allow it to occur so efficiently .
It uses tools from linguistics , theoretical computer science , probability theory , game theory , and mathematical logic .
Thus , to study gup shup , I must be able to engage in gup shup with many different scientific disciplines .
However , at another level , it is a well - establiished fact that gup shup is crucial for the existence of democracy .
I will use this space to both relay information about the formal mechanisms governing gup shup , as well as to provide a space in which the free - flowing activity of gup shup may occur .
As such , I hope that this site will contribute to what Jurgen Habermas has called “ the public sphere , ” a place where citizens can debate , question , argue , share , and perhaps agree on issues that occupy their thoughts , their hearts , or any other aspect of their being .
Over drinks one night , I remarked to a good friend of mine , Daniel Loreto , that the internet allows for the empowerment of the public in ways that did n’t quite exist before .
Since he ’s much smarter than me , he corrected me , arguing that it actually makes democracy feasible for perhaps the first time in human history .
I agree .
Perhaps you do n’t .
Let us discuss .
All that is necessary to create lift is to turn a flow of air .
We are familiar with the lift generated by an airplane wing or a curving baseball .
But a simple rotating cylinder will also create lift .
In fact , because the flow field associated with a rotating cylinder is two dimensional , it is much easier to understand the basic physics of this problem than the more complex three dimensional aspects of a curveball .
However , the details of how a rotating cylinder creates lift are still pretty complex .
Next to any surface , the molecules of the air will stick to the surface as discussed in the properties of air slide .
This thin layer of molecules will entrain or pull the surrounding flow in the direction that the surface moves .
If we put a cylinder that is rotating about the longitudinal axis ( a line perpendicular to the circular cross section ) into a fluid , it would eventually create a spinning , vortex - like flow around the cylinder .
If we then set the fluid in motion , the uniform velocity flow field can be added to the vortex flow .
The right part of the slide shows a view of the flow as if we were moving with the cylinder looking down the longitudinal axis .
The cylinder appears stationary and the flow moves from left to right .
The cylinder rotates clockwise .
So the free stream flow over the top of the cylinder is assisted by the induced flow ; the free stream flow below the cylinder is opposed by the induced flow .
The streamlines around the cylinder are distorted because of the spinning .
If the cylinder were not spinning , the streamlines would be symmetric top and bottom .
The net turning of the flow has produced an upward force .
Because of the change to the velocity field , the pressure field will also be altered around the cylinder .
The magnitude of the force can be computed by integrating the surface pressure times the area around the cylinder .
The direction of the force is perpendicular to the flow direction .
The magnitude of the force was determined by two early aerodynamicists , Kutta in Germany and Joukowski in Russia .
The lift equation for a rotating cylinder bears their names .
The equation states that the lift L per unit length along the cylinder is directly proportional to the velocity V of the flow , the density r of the flow , and the strength of the vortex G that is established by the rotation .
L = r * V * G
The equation gives lift - per - unit length because the flow is two dimensional .
( Obviously , the longer the cylinder the greater the lift . )
Determining the vortex strength G takes a little more math .
The vortex strength equals the rotational speed Vr times the circumference of the cylinder .
If b is the radius of the cylinder , G = 2.0 * pi * b * Vr where pi = 3.14159 .
The rotational speed Vr is equal to the circumference of the cylinder times the spin s of the cylinder .
Vr = 2.0 * pi * b * s Let 's investigate the lift of a rotating cylinder by using a Java simulator .
Due to IT security concerns , many users are currently experiencing problems running NASA Glenn educational applets .
The applets are slowly being updated , but it is a lengthy process .
If you are familiar with Java Runtime Environments ( JRE ) , you may want to try downloading the applet and running it on an Integrated Development Environment ( IDE ) such as Netbeans or Eclipse .
The following are tutorials for running Java applets on either IDE :
Netbeans
Eclipse
This page shows an interactive Java applet with flow past a cylinder .
There is a plotter and the calculated lift is displayed .
The left window shows an edge view of a cylinder placed in a flow of air .
The cylinder is two feet in diameter and 20 feet long and the air is flowing past this cylinder at 100 miles per hour .
You can rotate the cylinder by using the slider below the view window or by backspacing over the input box , typing in your new value and hitting the Enter key on the keyboard .
On the right is a graph of the lift versus spin .
The red dot shows your conditions .
Below the graph is the numerical value of the lift .
You can display either the lift value ( in English or Metric units ) or the lift coefficient by using the choice buttons surrounding the output box .
Click on the choice button and select from the drop - menu .
As an experiment , set the spin to 100 rpm ( revolutions per minute ) and note the amount of lift .
Now increase the spin to 200 rpm .
Did the lift increase or decrease ?
Set the spin to - 100 rpm .
What is the value of lift ?
Which way would this cylinder move ?

WARNING : Be particularly aware of the simplifying assumptions that have gone into this analysis .
This type of flow field is called an ideal flow field .
It is produced by superimposing the flow field from an ideal vortex centered in the cylinder with a uniform free stream flow .
There is no viscosity in this model ( no boundary layer on the cylinder ) even though this is the real origin of the circulating flow !
In reality , the flow around a rotating cylinder is very complex .
Depending on the ratio of rotational speed , free stream speed , viscosity of the fluid , and size of the cylinder , the flow off the rear of the cylinder can separate and become unsteady .
BUT , the simplified model does give the first order effects ; it gives an initial good prediction of the force on the cylinder when compared to experiments .
HISTORICAL NOTE :
In the early 1920 's the force from a rotating cylinder was used to power a sailing ship .
The idea , proposed by Anton Flettner of Germany , was to replace the mast and cloth sails with a large cylinder rotated by an engine below deck .
The idea worked , but the propulsion force generated was less than the motor would have generated if it had been connected to a standard marine propeller !
Here 's a picture of the ship provided by Brian Adkins , BAE , Georgia Tech , 1993 .
Jaques Cousteau and the Cousteau Society proposed a similar ship , named Calypso II , to explore this and other oceanographic technologies in the 1990's .

The White House Made it fairly clear yesterday that it opposes the latest effort to give the District of Columbia a vote on the house floor :
The White House declared its opposition yesterday to a bill that would give the District its first full seat in the House of Representatives , saying it is unconstitutional , and a key Senate supporter said such concerns could kill the measure .
“ The Constitution specifies that only ‘ the people of the several states ’ elect representatives to the House , ” said White House spokesman Alex Conant .
“ And D.C. is not a state . ”
He declined to say whether President Bush would veto the bill , but the White House appeared to be sending a message to Congress just as momentum for the measure was building .
It cleared two House committees this week , and the Democratic leadership has vowed to pass it on the House floor next week .
The bill seeks to increase the House permanently to 437 seats , from 435 .
In a bipartisan compromise , one seat would go to the overwhelmingly Democratic District , which has a nonvoting delegate in the House .
The other would go to the next state in line to pick up a seat based on the 2000 Census : Utah , which leans Republican .
Several Republican
House members assailed the bill this week , noting that the Constitution reserves representation for residents of states , not districts .
Supporters countered with a section of the Constitution known as the “ District Clause , ” which gives Congress sweeping powers over the city .
Legal scholars have disagreed over who is right .
The bill ’s advocates knew that the White House had constitutional concerns .
But Conant said the White House had n’t formally opposed the bill until it had cleared the Judiciary Committee on Thursday and was headed for the House floor .
“ We had not taken a position until after the committee vote , ” he said .
The White House ’s position , of course , is , as I wrote earlier this week , completely correct .
Furthermore , the idea that the District Clause somehow supersedes the Constitution ’s clear requirement that only state ’s have the right to have a vote in Congress is just absurd .
Despite the clear Constitutional problems with this bill , it made it through the House Judiciary Committee and will clearly succeed in a full vote on the House floor .
It ’s fate in the Senate , however , is far from certain :
Supporters of the measure have anticipated a difficult fight in the Senate , where few Republicans have embraced it .
The bill ’s sponsors , Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton ( D - D.C. ) and Rep. Thomas M. Davis III ( R - Va. ) , have pinned their hopes on the Republican senators from Utah , believing they could persuade colleagues to pass it .
But both Utah senators indicated yesterday that the bill could be in trouble .
A spokeswoman for Sen. Robert F. Bennett ( R ) said he continues to support it .
However , “ based on the constitutional concerns raised by the White House and others in Congress , it may be difficult to get the 60 votes to move this bill , ” said the spokeswoman , Emily Christensen , referring to the threshold necessary to avoid a filibuster .
If it does , though , the last test will be what the President does .
Hopefully , he will have the sense and courage to veto this unconstitutional mess .

" Der Hype um einen Nano - Krieg hat weltweit schon angefangen " , warnt Jürgen Altmann .
Mit seiner Studie " Military Nanotechnology : Potential Applications and Preventive Arms Control " legt er die weltweit erste Bestandsaufnahme zur dunklen Seite der Nanotechnik vor .
" Sie zeigt , dass wir uns nach dem Ende der atomaren Hochrüstung nicht von Selbstzufriedenheit einlullen lassen dürfen " , sagt Volker Rittberger von der Deutschen Stiftung Friedensforschung , die die Studie finanziert hat .
Altmann drängt zur Eile : " Es ist wichtig , dass die internationale Gemeinschaft jetzt über die Gefahren redet , dann bleibt noch Zeit , etwas dagegen tun zu können . "
Schon in fünf Jahren könnte es zu spät sein .
Denn längst geht es bei den Nanoanwendungen nicht mehr nur um schmutzabweisende Oberflächen , hauchdünne Solarzellen oder gezielte Krebstherapien .
" Zu den mehr als 20 militärischen Anwendungsfeldern zählen neue Werkstoffe für zerstörerischere Geschosse oder leichtere Kampfjets , Manipulationen an den Körpern von Soldaten oder neuartige Biowaffen " , sagt Altmann .
Vor allem in den USA werde bereits daran gearbeitet , Nanotechnologien daraufhin abzuklopfen , ob sie in den Waffensystemen der Zukunft eingesetzt werden könnten .
Etwa ein Viertel der Nanoforschungsförderung der US - Regierung wurde im vergangenen Jahr allein vom Pentagon bestritten .
Aber auch Schwellenländer wie Indien hätten inzwischen das Potenzial militärische Nanoforschung entdeckt , sagt Altmann .
Ein Beispiel für die Verbesserung konventioneller Waffensysteme durch Nanotechnik sieht er in unbemannten , autonomen Kampfjets .
Ohne Pilotensysteme und dank leichterer und härterer Werkstoffe könnten diese viel kleiner gebaut werden , bis zu Spannweiten von nur noch zwei Metern .
Temperaturbeständige Materialien ermöglichen wiederum Triebwerke mit höherem Wirkungsgrad , die auch die Minijets schneller und wendiger machen .
Fortschritte bei Lenkung und Zielgenauigkeit von Geschossen und Flugkörpern dank Nanoelektronik würden dazu führen , dass kleinere Geschosse dieselbe Zerstörungswirkung entfalten wie ihre größeren Gegenstücke heute .
Die größten Gefahren sieht Altmann jedoch in der Manipulation der molekularen Maschinerie von Zellen heraufziehen .
So sei es längst nicht mehr Sciencefiction , Verfahren aus einer künftigen Nanomedizin – etwa die Verabreichung von Medikamenten , die auf das Genom eines Menschen zugeschnitten sind – als Blaupause für genetisch maßgeschneiderte Erreger zu nehmen .
Das ist keine Schwarzmalerei : Bereits jetzt halten es Biologen für denkbar , dass künstliche Bakterien so programmiert werden , dass sie im Körper eines Opfers Zellvorgänge wie die Proteinfaltung verändern – mit tödlichen Folgen .
" Die Nanotechnik wird die Entwicklung neuer B - Waffen beschleunigen .
Irgendwann haben wir womöglich mit Viren zu tun , die Biohacker in einem Kellerlabor hergestellt haben " , sagt Altmann .
DNA - Synthesizer für die Herstellung künstlicher Virengenome seien inzwischen für 40.000 Euro zu haben .
Bereits 2002 gelang es Forschern um Eckard Wimmer von der State University New York in Stony Brook , ein künstliches Polio - Virus zu synthetisieren .
Ob bereits militärische Forschungseinrichtungen gezielt an solchen Nano - B - Waffen arbeiten , kann Altmann zwar nicht nachweisen .
Aber angesichts der Tatsache , dass gut zehn Prozent der Ausgaben der DARPA , der Forschungsagentur des US - Verteidigungsministeriums , als " geheim " eingestuft sind , " könnte man vermuten , dass auch an derartigen Waffen geforscht wird , mindestens , um zu wissen , was ein Gegner machen könnte . "
Unter den acht Empfehlungen , die er in seiner Studie ausspricht , fordert Altmann deshalb , die Konventionen über B- sowie über C - Waffen der neuen Entwicklung anzupassen .
" Mikroskopische Systeme , die in den Körper eindringen können und teilweise oder ganz künstlich hergestellt sind , sollen in die B - Waffen - Konvention einbezogen werden " , rät Altmann .
Auch sollte für Agenzien , " die kleiner als Zellen sind , und Lebensprozesse innerhalb von Zellen schädigen " , die C - Waffen - Konvention gelten .
Zudem schlägt er vor , das Verifikationsprotokoll für die B - Waffen - Konvention zügig zu vereinbaren , das künftigen UN - Inspekteuren die Untersuchung bislang verschlossener Labors auch auf eine Nano - B - Waffen - Entwicklung hin erlauben würde .
" Mit Altmanns Vorschlägen wird eine notwendige Debatte in Gang gesetzt " , ist Wolf - Dieter Catenhusen , ehemaliger Staatssekretär im Bundesforschungsministerium , zuversichtlich .
" Es ist gut , dass das Buch zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt erschienen ist . "
Denn die nächste Überprüfungskonferenz der B - Waffen - Konvention wird im Dezember 2006 in Genf stattfinden .
Altmann hofft , dass sich dort einige Delegationen für seine Vorschläge stark machen – " beispielsweise die deutsche " .

From the article : “ The bathroom by ~cuatrod is a wonderful blend of life - like lighting , subtle texture work and sharp modelling .
Obviously , this deviant ’s studies in light and materials are really paying off . ”
Back in February ,
Ars reported on the decision by the BBC to give its viewers download access to what they term " catch up " programming .
At the time , a set of rules governing the programs and access rights had been proposed and were open to public and industry comment .
Final rules have now been announced by the BBC Trust , although the impact of some decisions will be evaluated on a regular basis .
As our earlier coverage indicated , providing download access to BBC content is dizzyingly complex .
The BBC is supported by license fees assessed on everyone in the country that owns a TV , making it akin to a public service .
But the BBC itself relies on private media companies to provide much of its material .
Many BBC broadcasts are licensed to other countries and are sold on DVD .
Balancing all of the commercial and private concerns is the BBC Trust , which also considers the general media market in order to ensure that the public programming does not preclude competitive private broadcasters from entering the market .
The plan under debate was designed to allow a TiVo - less equivalent to time shifting : viewers that missed a program could , for up to a week after its broadcast , download the episode they missed for free .
Downloads would be subject to DRM to prevent copying and would self - destruct after a set period of time .
In addition , when a program came to a close , series " stacks " would be provided that included all of the episodes .
Other rules would be applied to radio broadcasts .
Over 10,000 comments later , the proposed rules largely remain intact .
For audio - only content , industry came out pretty well : book readings would not be made available in order to avoid competition with the audible book market , and classical music would be excluded in part because it was considered to be in a " precarious state . "
Classical programs would continue to be made available as catch - up listening via streaming audio .
When it came to video content , the situation was far more complex .
Although no specific question addressed it , the Trust came away with the impression that , while industry considered DRM a given , the vast majority of the public was opposed to it .
Despite pleas by the industry , the Trust refused to reduce the 30 - day window for viewing downloads ( which had been reduced from an initially - proposed 13 weeks ) .
The trust also resisted industry calls to completely eliminate downloads of series stacks in light of overwhelming public support for this feature .
But the feature was limited to 15 percent of total broadcast content , and conditions were defined for inclusion : " Stackable series are those with a distinct run , with a beginning and end , and a narrative arc or those with exceptionally high impact . "
Given the potential ambiguity in this definition , they promised to revisit the topic in two years to see how this feature was working .
The other issue of contention was in the DRM being used : Windows Media , which necessarily creates a platform restriction .
That restriction remains , despite being overwhelmingly unpopular : nearly 90 percent of respondents favored neutrality .
" Such was the strength of feeling that respondents did not appreciate , or did not consider it relevant , that the Trust was proposing that the BBC achieves platform neutrality within a specified period , " read the report .
" Any period of excluding other operating systems was apparently considered unacceptable by our public respondents . "
The Trust considered arguments that it was possible to provide an open license for content while retaining its commercial value but decided that they " regard the business models for this approach to be unclear at present . "
Initially , they planned to set a twoyear deadline for platform - neutral DRM but have backed off in response to BBC management , which suggested a limit would poison their ongoing negotiations with Adobe , Apple , and Real .
Instead , audits of progress towards platform neutrality will occur every six months going forward .
It 's not clear whether the negotiations will ultimately result in a single , cross - platform DRM , or whether the BBC will ultimately offer downloads in multiple formats .
But for now , DRMed WMV stays .
One interesting tidbit from the report was the lack of interest in parental controls .
Only about a quarter of respondents rated a content control system important .
Whether this truly reflects disinterest or the age of those taking the survey is n't clear .
Overall , the final report is mostly notable for being fairly reasonable .
It tries to balance commercial and public concerns , and it emphasizes that the importance of providing the viewers with this service overrides lingering concerns about several of its features .
The continued evaluations planned for some of the features suggest that fine - tuning of the service should occur rapidly , leaving the BBC with what might be a model system for other nations that have a combination of public and private broadcasting .
An outstanding question in the evolution of aging is whether telomerase activity ( which preserves the ends of linear chromosomes and lengthens the replicative lifespan of cells ) is related to lifespan per se .
On on hand , it seems likely that it would be related positively :
The longer one lives , the longer one ’s cells need to continue regenerating .
On the other hand , the longer one lives , the more likely one is to accumulate cells with oncogenic lesions .
Since telomere maintenance is essential for tumor cell viability , one might not want these damaged cells to have ready access to telomerase expression … and this logic might lead us to the opposite conclusion .
A further confounding factor is body mass :
In order to get a larger body , one needs more cell divisions , so one might expect larger organisms to exhibit higher telomerase activity .
Then again … more cells means more risk of cancer …
It ’s almost like one ca n’t derive biology from pure logic .
Coming down firmly on one side of the argument , Seluanov et al . show that among rodents , telomerase activity has co-evolved with body mass , but not lifespan .
Furthermore , the correlation is negative : telomerase activity is more restricted in larger animals , perhaps as a defense against the increased cancer risk that comes from having more cells :
In multicellular organisms , telomerase is required to maintain telomere length in the germline but is dispensable in the soma .
Mice , for example , express telomerase in somatic and germline tissues , while humans express telomerase almost exclusively in the germline .
As a result , when telomeres of human somatic cells reach a critical length the cells enter irreversible growth arrest called replicative senescence .
Replicative senescence is believed to be an anticancer mechanism that limits cell proliferation .
The difference between mice and humans led to the hypothesis that repression of telomerase in somatic cells has evolved as a tumor - suppressor adaptation in large , long - lived organisms .
We tested whether regulation of telomerase activity coevolves with lifespan and body mass using comparative analysis of 15 rodent species with highly diverse lifespans and body masses .
Here we show that telomerase activity does not coevolve with lifespan but instead coevolves with body mass : larger rodents repress telomerase activity in somatic cells .
These results suggest that large body mass presents a greater risk of cancer than long lifespan , and large animals evolve repression of telomerase activity to mitigate that risk .

The list of new additions starts with Jane Austen 's Sense and Sensibility ( full zip file - individual mp3 files ) and Herman Melville 's Moby Dick ( full zip file - individual mp3 files ) , but it also extends to other time - tested classics .

hat were they thinking ?
How did they eat this bilge ?
Good questions , but you wo n't find them answered here .
This is a simple introduction to poorly photographed foodstuffs and horrid recipes .
It 's a wonder anyone in the 40s , 50s and 60s gained any weight ; it 's a miracle that people did n't put down their issue of Life magazine with a slight queasy list to their gut , and decide to sup on a nice bowl of shredded wheat and nothing else .
It was n't that the food was inedible ; it was merely dull .
Everything was geared for a timid palate fearful of spice .
It was n't non- nutritious - no , between the limp boiled vegetables , fat - choked meat cylinders and pink - whipped - jello dessert , you were bound to find a few calories that would drag you into the next day .
It 's that the pictures are so hideously unappealing .
here have all these images slumbered , lo these many decades ?
In small faded books , shoved in the back of some Mom 's pantry .
They 're collector 's items now - but of course , eventually , everything is a collector item .
I find them in antique stores , stacked carelessly , forgotten and overpriced , or carefully stowed in plastic envelopes , pristine , awaiting the collector 's discerning eye .
There 's a market for these books .
But why ?
It 's possible that many of the people who buy these books regard them as prime sourcebooks , texts from the Golden Age of Butter .
Maybe some appreciate the camp value , but whatever snickering amusement you get from the pictures and text passes quickly .
I can't see anyone pulling out their collection on a winter 's night and amusing themselves with 50 year old cookie recipes .
Perhaps the main reason people buy these books is the Mom factor .
At least that 's my excuse .
They 're everyday relics of another time , my parents ' time , and this gives them a poignancy they do not deserve , and do nothing to earn .
But I love them anyway .
They 're not really recipe books .
They 're ads for food companies , with every recipe using the company 's products , often in unexpected ways .
( Hot day ?
Kids love a frosty Bacon Milkshake ! )
There 's not a single edible dish in the entire collection .
The pictures in the books are ghastly - the Italian dishes look like a surgeon got a sneezing fit during an operation , and the queasy casseroles look like something on which the janitor dumps sawdust .
But you have to enjoy the spirit behind the books - cheerful postwar perfect housewifery is taught in every book .
Sure , you 'll fall short of the ideal .
But what 's an ideal for if not to show up your shortcomings ?
Enjoy .

The average American college graduate 's literacy in English declined significantly over the past decade , according to results of a nationwide test released yesterday .
The National Assessment of Adult Literacy , given in 2003 by the Department of Education , is the nation 's most important test of how well adult Americans can read .
The test also found steep declines in the English literacy of Hispanics in the United States , and significant increases among blacks and Asians .
When the test was last administered , in 1992 , 40 percent of the nation 's college graduates scored at the proficient level , meaning that they were able to read lengthy , complex English texts and draw complicated inferences .
But on the 2003 test , only 31 percent of the graduates demonstrated those high - level skills .
There were 26.4 million college graduates .

Great Hacker !=
Great Hire
I thoroughly enjoyed reading Paul Graham 's recent essay Great Hackers .
His sermon is well - written , and I assume it played very well when he preached it to the choir at OSCON .
Graham describes the notion of a " great hacker " , which he seems to roughly define as a programmer who is several times more productive than average .
( Please note that some people use the word " hacker " to describe programmers who engage in illegal activity .
That connotation is not applicable here or in Graham 's essay . )
He then asks the following questions :
How do you recognize [ great hackers ] ?
How do you get them to come and work for you ? "
Note carefully : Graham proceeds from the assumption that we do in fact want to hire these great hackers , but he never explains why .
I concede that this assumption is intuitive .
After all , does n't every company want the most productive employees they can hire ?
But this assumption deserves to be examined and challenged .
For the love of the code
Graham begins his description of great hackers by explaining the intrinsic motivation and passion they have for writing code :
Their defining quality is probably that they really love to program .
Ordinary programmers write code to pay the bills .
Great hackers think of it as something they do for fun , and which they 're delighted to find people will pay them for .
On this point , we agree .
The best developers simply love to create software .
They get paid , and their compensation is important , but it is n't really the primary reason why they write code .
They wrote code before they were getting paid for it .
They would continue to write code even after winning the lottery .
When I hire developers , I am looking for this quality .
However , the remainder of Graham 's essay does a pretty good job of explaining why many small ISVs might not want to hire a " great hacker " .
In a nutshell , great hackers are often very fussy people .
Fussy about tools and platforms
Graham explains the well - known fact that great hackers are extremely picky about the tools , platforms and technologies they use :
Good hackers find it unbearable to use bad tools .
They 'll simply refuse to work on projects with the wrong infrastructure .
Bad tools ?
Wrong infrastructure ?
Graham sounds like he is right on the money .
Nobody could object to the idea that great hackers care deeply about these kinds of choices , right ?
Unfortunately , Graham goes on to explain what great hackers mean by " bad tools " and " wrong infrastructure " .
Painting with a very wide brush , he observes that great hackers do n't use technologies like Windows and Java .
They prefer languages like Python and Perl .
They prefer to use open source technologies whenever possible .
I 'm not saying I am a great hacker , but I do sympathize with this fussiness .
I have similar religious preferences about technologies .
I really do like Python .
My personal server runs Debian .
The first things I install when I repave my Windows machine are emacs and cygwin .
However , I work at an ISV .
I love building software , but SourceGear is not my hobby -- it is my profession .
We sell products to users .
We have learned to value the needs of the users over our own preferences .
Graham seems to suggest that if we choose to build our products on the technologies that great hackers prefer , then it is more likely that we will be able to hire them .
This opinion may be true , but it ignores the fact that technology choices have marketing implications .
I 've written about this topic several times now :
Law # 21 : " These may not seem like marketing decisions , but they are .
Technology choices have big marketing implications .
When you choose a platform , you define the maximum size of your market . "
Geek Gauntlets : " We need to talk about what customers want , but our own preferences get in the way .
We bring our technology prejudices and biases to the discussion , often without ever being aware of the problems they can cause . "
Be Careful
Where you Build : " As developers in a small ISV , our productivity is important , but it must be secondary to the comfort and preferences of our users . "
The higher productivity of a great hacker is a big advantage , but probably not big enough to overcome our attempts to sell something that users do n't want .
If Graham is right , a great hacker is someone who believes that his own preferences are more important than doing what is best for the users .
Small ISVs do n't need people like that .
Fussy about doing interesting projects
Graham goes on to explain how important it is for great hackers to be doing interesting projects :
Along with good tools , hackers want interesting projects .
It 's pretty easy to say what kinds of problems are not interesting : those where instead of solving a few big , clear , problems , you have to solve a lot of nasty little ones .
One of the worst kinds of projects is writing an interface to a piece of software that 's full of bugs .
Here again , I am sympathetic .
I like interesting stuff too .
My To- Do list tells me that I am supposed to be working on some enhancements to our online store website .
Frankly , that programming task does n't interest me very much .
I 'll confess that I 'm procrastinating on that particular task .
However , I work at an ISV .
I love building software , but SourceGear is not my hobby -- it is my profession .
We sell products to users .
The reality is that lots of highly profitable software development tasks are just not very interesting .
Graham strikes particularly close to home when he says , " One of the worst kinds of projects is writing an interface to a piece of software that 's full of bugs . "
Our SourceOffSite product provides an Internet - based interface to a piece of software that 's full of bugs ( SourceSafe ) .
That same product supports integration with IDEs by means of a piece of software that 's full of bugs ( the MSSCCI API ) .
If we had been great hackers and refused to do this work because it is not interesting , we would have missed out on millions of dollars of revenue .
If Graham is right , a great hacker is someone who is not willing to do any of the un -fun things that need to be done .
Small ISVs do n't need people like that .
Fussy about interacting with users
Graham characterizes great hackers as people do n't want to be involved with users :
Bigger companies solve the problem by partitioning the company .
They get smart people to work for them by establishing a separate R&D department where employees do n't have to work directly on customers ' nasty little problems .
You may not have to go to this extreme .
Bottom - up programming suggests another way to partition the company : have the smart people work as toolmakers .
...
This way you might be able to get smart people to write 99 % of your code , but still keep them almost as insulated from users as they would be in a traditional research department .
This kind of attitude is a big problem in a small ISV .
I concede that it is frustrating to be interrupted when I 'm working on a coding problem .
I concede that users sometimes ask dumb questions .
I concede that writing a great piece of code is more fun than figuring out how somebody screwed up their Web.config file .
However , I work at an ISV .
I love building software , but SourceGear is not my hobby -- it is my profession .
We sell products to users .
Nothing here is more important than our users .
Nothing .
Last year I wrote an article in which I claim that small ISVs should only hire " developers " , which I define as " programmers who also contribute in non-coding ways " .
The thesis statement of this article said :
" For the purpose of this article , a " programmer " is someone who does nothing but code new features and [ if you 're lucky ] fix bugs .
They do n't write specs .
They do n't write automated test cases .
They do n't help keep the automated build system up to date .
They do n't help customers work out tough problems .
They do n't help write documentation .
They do n't help with testing .
They do n't even read code .
All they do is write new code .
In a small ISV , you do n't want any of these people in your company . "
If Graham is right , a great hacker is someone who is not willing to help the people who use the software he creates .
Small ISVs do n't need people like that .
Bottom Line
Like I said , I enjoyed Graham 's essay very much .
He describes great hackers by enumerating all of their worst qualities , and yet , the essay still makes us want to admire these super - productive people .
That 's good writing .
But the essay causes concern .
I worry that lots of small ISVs will read his article and believe that they need to hire great hackers .
When great hackers are as fussy as Graham says they are , they 're not worth the trouble .
We want the super - productivity , and we want the innate love of software development , but we do n't want all the extra baggage .
Instead :
Hire people who care about users .
Hire people who understand the difference between a job and a hobby .
Hire people who want to contribute in lots of different ways to the success of the product .
It 's okay to be in awe of these great hackers .
But as a practical matter , small ISVs would be much better off hiring professionals .

Intel 's latest quad - core CPU , the Core 2 Extreme QX6700 , consists of 582 million transistors .
That 's a lot .
But it pales in comparison to the 680 million transistors of nVidia 's latest video card , the 8800 GTX .
Here 's a small chart of transistor counts for recent CPUs and GPUs :
AMD Athlon 64 X2 CPU 154 m Intel Core 2 Duo CPU 291 m Intel Pentium D 900 CPU 376 m ATI X1950 XTX GPU 384 m Intel Core 2 Quad CPU 582 m NVIDIA G8800 GTX GPU 680 m
ATI wo n't release a new video card until next year .
But their current X1950 XTX is n't exactly chopped liver : 384 million transistors is more than any current dual - core CPU .
Of course , comparing GPUs to CPUs is n't an apples - to - apples comparison .
The clock rates are lower , the architectures are radically different , and the problems they 're trying to solve are almost completely unrelated .
But GPUs now exceed the complexity of modern CPUs in terms of absolute transistor count .
And like CPUs , they 're becoming programmable -- it 's possible to harness all that graphics power to do something other than graphics .
There 's a nice overview on AnandTech which provides some background on this architectural sea change in video cards :
So far , the only types of programs that have effectively tapped GPU power -- other than the obvious applications and games requiring 3D rendering -- have also been video related : video decoders , encoders , video effect processors , and so forth .
But there are many non-video tasks that are floating - point intensive , and these programs have been unable to harness the power of the GPU .
Meanwhile , the academic world has designed and utilized custom - built floating - point research hardware for years .
These devices are known as stream processors .
Stream processors are extremely powerful floating - point processors able to process whole blocks of data at once , whereas CPUs carry out only a handful of numerical operations at a time .
We 've seen CPUs implement some stream processing with instruction sets like SSE and 3DNow ! , but these efforts pale in comparison to what custom hardware has been able to do .
3D rendering is also a streaming task .
Modern GPUs have evolved into stream processors , sharing much in common with the customized hardware of researchers .
GPU designers have cut corners where they do n't need certain functionality for 3D rendering , but they have ultimately developed extremely fast and flexible stream processors .
Modern GPUs are just as fast as custom hardware , but due to economies of scale are many , many times cheaper than custom hardware .
Dedicated , task - specific hardware is orders of magnitude faster than what you can achieve with a general purpose CPU .
If you need proof of this , just look at the chess benchmarks .
IBM's Deep Blue was capable of evaluating 200 million chess moves per second in 1997 .
Ten years later , the fastest quad - core desktop system can only evaluate 8 million chess moves per second .
Ten year old custom hardware is still 25 times faster than the best general purpose CPUs .
Amazing .
The most high profile application for all this GPU power at the moment is Stanford 's Folding@Home .
There 's no shortage of exciting PR on this topic :
The processing power of just 5,000 ATI processors is also enough to rival that of the existing 200,000 computers currently involved in the Folding@home project ; and it is estimated that if a mere 10,000 computers were to each use an ATI processor to conduct folding research , that the Folding@home program would effectively perform faster than the fastest supercomputer in existence today , surpassing the 1 petaFLOP level .
Stanford recently introduced a high performance folding client which runs on ATI 's X1800 and X1900 series video cards .
TechReport tested the new high performance folding client and came away a little disappointed :
Over five days , our Radeon X1900 XTX crunched eight work units for a total or 2,640 points .
During the same period , our single Opteron 180 core chewed its way through six smaller work units for a score of 899 -- just about one third the point production of the Radeon .
However , had we been running the CPU client on both of our system 's cores , the point output should have been closer to 1800 , putting the Radeon ahead by less than 50 % .
The GPU may be doing 20 to 40 times more work , but the scores are calibrated to a baseline system , not the absolute amount of work that 's done .
It 's a little anticlimactic .
Stanford 's advanced folding client exploits the Brook Language , an extension to ANSI C that allows them to compile C - like code that runs on the GPU .
It leverages ATI 's Stream API to communicate with the GPU .
NVIDIA offers something similar to Brook in their CUDA technology :
GPU computing with CUDA technology is an innovative combination of computing features in next generation NVIDIA GPUs that are accessed through a standard C language .
Where previous generation GPUs were based on " streaming shader programs " , CUDA programmers use C to create programs called threads that are similar to multi- threading programs on traditional CPUs .
In contrast to multi-core CPUs , where only a few threads execute at the same time , NVIDIA GPUs featuring CUDA technology process thousands of threads simultaneously enabling a higher capacity of information flow .
Of course , CUDA only works on the latest G80 series of cards , just like the ATI 's Stream technology is really only useful on their latest X1900 series .
All this potential programmability is a very recent development .
I expect the relationship between CPU and GPU to largely be a symbiotic one : they 're good at different things .
But I also expect quite a few computing problems to make the jump from CPU to GPU in the next 5 years .
The potential order - of - magnitude performance improvements are just too large to ignore .

India and China will be the main Asian greenhouse offenders
The report provides detailed analysis of the link between transport and climate change in Asia .
It says that its estimate of future levels of greenhouse gas could even be an optimistic assessment .
Air pollution and congestion will seriously hamper the ability to move people and goods effectively , it warns .
' Partnerships required '
The report , Energy Efficiency and Climate Change : Considerations for On - Road Transport in Asia , says that Asia currently has low levels of personal motorized transport , which in many cases are motorcycles .
But it says that these levels are likely to increase significantly as incomes in these countries grows and the urban population becomes bigger .
The report points out that China is already the world 's fourth largest economy , and the number of cars and utility vehicles could increase by 15 times more than present levels to more than 190 million vehicles over the next 30 years .
People in Asia are moving from four wheels to two
In India , traffic growth is likely to increase by similar levels over the same time period , the report says .
Carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles could rise 3.4 times for China and 5.8 times for India .
" Progress toward reducing the growth of greenhouse gases from the transport sector will require partnerships and involvement of a wide range of stakeholders , " Bindu Lohani , director - general of the ADB 's sustainable development department , wrote in the foreword to the report .
He said that addressing these problems would mean " changing existing travel behaviour patterns and modifying urban development patterns to minimize the type , length , and frequency of trips that people need to take " .
Last month , the British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett urged India to help in efforts to tackle climate change .
She made the call ahead of a report commissioned by the British government which said that rich nations must act now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
' Costing cities '
Meanwhile a conference in Indonesia has heard that while some Asian governments should be praised for toughening vehicle emissions standards , with many phasing out leaded gasoline , much work still needs to be done .
Experts say there should be more emphasis on buses and trains
" Transport is growing faster in most cities so transport emissions are a big part of the problem , " Lew Fulton , a transport expert with the UN Environmental Programme , told the three - day Better Air Quality Conference 2006 in the city of Yogyakarta .
" We 're not only seeing increases in pollutant emissions .
We 're seeing huge increases in fuel consumption which is coupled tightly with ( carbon dioxide ) emissions , " he said .
" It 's costing cities and countries ever increasing amounts of foreign exchange with the high oil prices that we 've got . "
The World Health Organization said increased pollution in Asia is estimated to cause as many as 537,000 premature deaths each year , as well as a rise in cardiopulmonary and respiratory illnesses .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The identity of the blogosphere 's " secret senator " has been revealed .
CNN has confirmed that Sen .
Ted Stevens , R - Alaska , has placed a hold on a bill that would require the government to publish online a database of federal spending .
" He does have a hold on the bill , " Stevens ' spokesperson Aaron Saunders told CNN .
" At the time he placed the hold he notified Sen . [ Tom ] Coburn and his staff and identified several questions we had with the bill .
Two weeks ago Sen. Coburn named Stevens as having a hold on the bill , so we do n't consider it a secret . "
Senate tradition allows any senator to keep a piece of legislation from reaching the Senate floor by placing a hold on the bill .
Coburn 's office confirmed that Coburn had revealed Stevens ' hold during a town hall meeting in Oklahoma two weeks ago .
The bill has become a cause célèbre for both liberal and conservative bloggers as they tried to uncover the " secret senator " who had blocked passage of the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act ( S. 2590 ) .
The bill was introduced earlier this year by Sens.
Barack Obama , D - Illinois , and Coburn , R - Oklahoma .
The conservative - leaning , anti-government waste site Porkbusters urged readers to call their senators and ask them to go on the record denying that they placed the hold .
TPMmuckraker , under the banner " blogosphere unites in pursuit of masked senator " also got in on the act , posting updates from readers around the country .
The effort prompted Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist to weigh in online : Blogging at his political action committee Web site , Sen .
Frist , R - Tennessee , called on " all members , when asked by the blog community , to instruct their staff to answer whether or not they have a hold . "
Saunders said Stevens did not attempt to keep his hold anonymous .
" Sen . Stevens has a series of concerns and questions about the bill .
He wants a cost benefit analysis to make sure it does n't create an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy and not meet its purpose , " Saunders said .
" He prefers to handle things at the member to member level or at the staff level , " Saunders said .
" That 's the way Sen .
Stevens has always operated . "
" This was n't in any way secretive , " Saunders said .
" We 're baffled as to why it 's been called a secret hold . "
But a spokesperson for Coburn 's office disputed the idea that Stevens had been open about the hold .
" This hold was a secret , " Coburn spokesman John Hart said .
" His office has ignored media and bloggers ' calls about this issue for weeks .
We had to ask Stevens if he was the hold .
His staff has still not met with us . "
" Senator Stevens sits on the committee where this bill was considered and never raised any objections because he skipped the hearings , " Hart said .
" His specific concerns were addressed at the hearings he skipped , and his office has yet to meet with us to discuss his concerns despite repeated requests . "
Last year a proposed $ 223 million for a " bridge to nowhere " connecting Alaska 's Gravina Island -- population 50 -- to the mainland caused a nationwide furor .
The allocation was backed by Stevens and fellow Republican Rep. Don Young of Alaska , the powerful chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure .
The earmarked funding for the bridge was later rescinded by Congress .
However , Alaska 's overall allocation of federal transportation funds was not decreased , and the state is free to spend the federal dollars to build the bridge if it wishes .
When Coburn tried to block funds for the bridge , he was heavily denounced by Stevens on the Senate floor .
Been to Moscow lately ?
If you have , it ’s impossible not to notice how commercial the city has become .
New automobiles clog the wide boulevards and the air reeks with exhaust .
Conspicuous consumption is now an ingrained part of life .
Despite the staggering rift between rich and poor in Russia as a whole , Moscow has more billionaires than any other city in the world .
Although still an emerging economy , Russia has been sailing along on profits made in the oil and gas industries , inspiring Russia ’s leaders to reassert to the world that their nation is still a nuclear superpower .
Times are better in Russia than in the 1990s , when the ruble collapsed , and violent crime ran wild .
President Putin is leading his country towards joining the global economy in an autocratic — but effective – fashion .
Putin has wisely courted Western industry , and has secured Russia ’s place as head of the G8 .
He also agreed to reduce Russia ’s overall nuclear warhead count , but has at the same time stabilized the budgets for ROSATOM ’s nuclear weapons programs .
While not flaunting Moscow - style material wealth , Russia ’s nuclear designers at the closed cities are now at least receiving their paychecks .
And they ’ve been busy building a new generation of warheads :
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11179135/site/newsweek/from/ET/
The new maneuverable warheads are designed to zigzag in flight when approaching targets .
This maneuverability would counter current U.S. anti-missile technology by not falling to earth on a predictable trajectory .
They may be fitted to new land - based Topol - M missiles and the prospective Bulava missiles .
The maneuverable warheads are still several years from production , but Russia ’s weapons scientists have more than the required talent to build these devices .
And they are very smart , patriotic people .
As a technology , the maneuverable warhead could be quite remarkable , although President Putin would view it more as a Russian political trump card .
It is such trump cards and their possible long term political reverberations that Russia and other nuclear - capable nations need to be attuned to .
Especially considering what they could mean for the future of arms control and the Non-Proliferation Treaty .
Many critical questions need to be asked :
What of other nations developing new warheads ?
How effective is the Moscow Treaty ?
Will any nations observe the NPT in five to ten years from now ?
And how many non-nuclear states will produce their own weapons in that time period ?
Their efforts to become part of the nuclear club appear to be speeding up .
The Soviet Union ’s breakup – without a doubt the best thing that could have happened to that nation ’s people – continues to have critical unintended consequences on a global scale .
The 30 km taxi ride from Sheremetyevo airport to downtown Moscow can take over two hours prostoyal na dorogye – sitting in the traffic congestion .
But the breakdown of the Cold War ’s system of arms control may be moving relatively faster .
In the Nov. 18 issue of Cell , researchers report the discovery of a gene that controls the ability to react with appropriate fear to impending danger .
As a result , mice lacking the gene stathmin become daredevils of a sort , the researchers report .
The basic findings may have general implications for the study of anxiety disorders and potential anti-anxiety drugs , according to researchers .
The researchers found that the gene stathmin - - normally present in high levels in a part of the brain called the amygdala -- controls both innate and learned fear .
Mice without the gene show abnormally low levels of anxiety in situations that should instinctively inspire fear .
Stathmin - deficient animals also show less reaction to conditions that have previously proven unpleasant , an indication that the mice lack a normal memory for fear .
" While one of the best understood memory - related neural circuitries within the mammalian brain is that which controls fear conditioning , little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying fear reactions , " said lead author of the study by Gleb Shumyatsky of Rutgers University .
" We have now found that stathmin plays a critical role in both learned and innate fear .
Knockout mice , which lack the gene , show a decreased memory for fear and fail to recognize danger in innately aversive environments . "
By contrast , he added , the mice depleted of stathmin perform normally in a test of spatial learning .
Fear reactions represent a spectrum of behaviors that vary from those that are inborn to those instilled through experience , said the researchers .
Instinctive fears -- such as fear of heights or predators -- are often species specific toward actual or potential threats .
In contrast , learned fear results from particular uncomfortable or life - threatening events in the past .
Because fear plays an essential role in survival , memory for fear is easily established , very resistant to extinction , and normally lasts a lifetime , Shumyatsky said .
In the laboratory , fear can be conditioned by linking a neutral stimulus , such as a light or sound , to something unpleasant or painful , such as an electric shock , he explained .
That process of learned association occurs in a portion of the amygdala called the lateral nucleus .
advertisement
As a first step to unravel the molecular events underlying fear learning , Shumyatsky 's group recently identified several genes present at particularly high levels in the lateral nucleus and in the structures that relay information about learned and instinctive fear to the amygdala .
One such gene was stathmin .
In the current study , the researchers found that the brains of mice lacking stathmin showed an unusual number of microtubules , which are structural components of the cytoskeleton .
Stathmin normally controls the assembly and breakdown of the cellular scaffolds , Shumyatsky explained .
" For memory , the brain needs to quickly disassemble and rebuild microtubules to form connections where they are needed , " Shumyatsky said .
" It appears that loss of stathmin might interfere with this ability in the amygdala , leading to the overproduction of microtubules in certain areas .
In essence , the cells lose their flexibility . "
Indeed , the researchers found impairments in the ability of key inputs in the animals ' brains to form connections between neurons .
Such connections form the cellular basis for learning and memory .
To relate these brain abnormalities to behavior , the team then exposed normal and stathmin - deficient mice to a neutral tone while delivering a mild electric shock .
While both groups displayed some fear response by freezing immediately after a shock and later after hearing the tone , knockout mice reacted less strongly , they found , suggesting that they had an impaired ability to learn fear .
In other tests , the mutant mice also showed less instinctive fear of open spaces , venturing out into environments they would usually avoid naturally , Shumyatsky said .
Mice lacking stathmin continued to perform normally on a water maze test , an indication that spatial learning and memory -- controlled outside of the amygdala -- were unaltered .
advertisement
" The findings provide genetic evidence that amygdala - enriched stathmin is required for the expression of innate fear and the formation of memory for learned fear , " Shumyatsky said .
" This evidence suggests that stathmin knockout mice can be used as a model of anxiety states of mental disorders with innate and learned fear components , " he added .
" As a corollary , these animal models could be used to develop new anti-anxiety agents . "
Together with the team 's earlier findings that the amygdala - enriched gene gastrin - releasing peptide selectively affects learned fear , the new findings support the clinical data suggesting that anxiety is a spectrum of disorders with multiple subclasses , each of which may have a unique molecular signature requiring distinctive approaches to therapy , the researchers said .

A 2004 Journal of System and Software paper by Magne Jorgensen and Karl Halvor Teigen and Kjetil Molokken examined the preferences of bosses for accurate versus overconfident project leaders :
A total of 37 software professionals in a Norwegian organization developing financial and e-commerce applications .. all of them had some experience in project … management .
… were presented with two scenarios .
…
Assume that you are the manager of a software development project and have asked two developers ( D1 and D2 ) to estimate the most likely effort , minimum effort and maximum effort for the same 5 development tasks .
D1 and D2 have been instructed to be 90 % confident ( certain ) that the actual effort they use is between the minimum and maximum effort .
In Scenario 1 , [ managers ] D1 and D2 have the same actual effort … and make the same estimates of most likely effort .
The only difference is that … D1 has a hit rate of only 3 out of 5 ( 60 % ) , while D2 ’s hit rate is 4 our of 5 ( 80 % ) .
Manager D1 was chosen 35 to 2 as the " preferred developer " , and 29 to 1 as the one with more " knowledge of task , " even though D2 was chosen 17 to 11 as the one with the most " knowledge of uncertainty . "
In Scenario 2 , D1 and D2 had the same effort and estimates , but D2 said accurately that he was 60 % confident , while D1 said inaccurately that he was 90 % confident .
Though D2 was chosen 23 to 3 as having more knowledge of uncertainty , D1 was chosen 15 to 11 as the one with the most knowledge of task .
As one developer explained :
I feel that if I estimate very wide effort [ prediction intervals ] , this will be interpreted as a total lack of competence and has no informative value to the project manager .
I ’d rather have fewer actual values inside the minimum - maximum interval , than providing meaningless , wide [ prediction intervals ] .
Thus bosses of software managers take accurate estimates to be a signal of a lack of competence .

It ’s the ultimate irony .
For the past three decades , the organic food movement has extolled the virtues of pesticide - free produce , grass - fed beef , free - range chicken , and a host of other alternatives to the industrial food complex .
Now that Americans have finally caught on and are actually buying organic food in numbers that nobody — not even Wal - Mart — can ignore , the very people who were preaching organic have gotten downright whiny lately .
“ As organics become more mainstream , the standards are at risk , ” says Ronnie Cummins , a national director for the Organic Consumer Organization .
“ Mass market and organics are n’t always compatible , ” he adds .
But was n’t going mainstream the whole point ?
When the modern organic - food movement began in earnest more than 30 years ago , did n’t the founders dream of healthier , sustainably grown fare gracing every American dinner table ?
Now , to hear some industry leaders , you ’d think that only people who live near a farmer ’s market or those who are willing to pay fat premiums at the health - food store are deserving of hormone - free milk .
To be fair , there ’s certainly more at work here than a bad attitude .
Unprecedented growth is causing real turmoil .
Sales of organic food are estimated to have reached $ 15.7 billion in 2006 , up from $ 13.8 billion in 2005 , according to the Organic Trade Association ( OTA ) .
Even though organic accounts for less than 3 % of overall food sales , that ’s riotous growth in an otherwise glacial industry .
And it ’s bound to continue as giant retailers scramble to fill shelves with alternative products .
Double - digit growth rates mean there are simply not enough organic farms , organic feed , and organically raised animals in the United States to meet demand .
The result is enormous pressure to increase supply , which , in some cases , is leading to questionable practices .
Horizon and Aurora , two of the nation ’s largest suppliers of organic milk , have come under fire for keeping thousands of cows on feedlots with very little or no access to pasture .
The huge demand for organics has been a boon for investors , though .
The handful of publicly traded organic - related stocks have surged in the last year .
Whole Foods , for instance , saw its stock climb to a high of $ 73 last summer .
( The stock came back to earth last November when the company announced that new store expansion would slow significantly . )

Trivia Tidbit Of The Day : Part 355 -- Best & Worst States For Taxes .
Policies Matter -
If there 's one thing you should take from reading this blog , it 's that ideas matter .
In domestic public policy , the fundamental difference between Democrats and Republicans is found on the issue of taxes .
Democrats almost unanimously want higher taxes .
Republicans , by and large , want lower taxes .
These are idea differences that manifest themselves in public policy , and these manifestations can then be observed at the state - by - state level .
Indeed , state tax policy is not arbitrary , and it 's not created equal .
The ten best states in the Tax Foundation ’s 2007 State Business Tax Climate Index are as follows :
1. Wyoming
2. South Dakota
3. Alaska
4. Nevada
5. Florida
6. Texas
7. New Hampshire
8. Montana
9. Delaware
10 . Oregon
The ten worst states in the Tax Foundation ’s 2007 State Business Tax Climate Index are :
41 . Minnesota
42 . Maine
43 . Iowa
44 . Nebraska
45 . California
46 . Vermont
47 . New York
48 . New Jersey
49 . Ohio
50 . Rhode Island
The red / blue dichotomy ( based on 2004 Bush / Kerry ) is pretty clear , without a lot of explanation .
To quibble with the color system , New Hampshire and Iowa are more purple than anything ( NH went for Bush in 2000 ; Iowa went for Gore in 2000 ) , while Nebraska 's legislature is non-partisan and unicameral .
One could probably examine state legislatures and governorships to create a better red / blue / purple dynamic , but that 's for another post .
Ultimately , though , it 's the ideas and policies -- and the differences between and among the states -- that matter .
These differences have produced very real outcomes :
... between 2000 and 2005 , income in the top 10 states in the 2007 Index grew 44 percent faster than in the bottom 10 states .
Employment in the top 10 states grew 115 percent faster , output 52 percent faster and population 164 percent faster .
Think about that .
States with lower taxes performed better than states with higher taxes .
People and businesses wanted to move to low tax states from high tax states .
More jobs -- and more higher paying ones -- were created in the low tax states than in the high tax states .
How " duh " is all of that ?
What we 're seeing here is fifty economic laboratories competing against one another .
Policies , not surprisingly for those of us who favor good policies , make a difference in economic outcomes .
Good polices = good outcomes .
Poor policies = poor outcomes .
Tax competition is good .
Low taxes are the way to " win " that competition .
Why more states -- especially struggling ones -- do n't already grasp this , given the growing profusion of empirical evidence , is increasingly mindboggling .

Why more states -- especially struggling ones -- do n't already grasp this , given the growing profusion of empirical evidence , is increasingly mindboggling .
Tell me about it .
I live in Ohio , and we 're all prepared to elect a Democratic governor who will do nothing to make the state more tax - friendly , despite the fact that he pledges to " keep jobs in Ohio . "
Granted , the Republicans before him were no better , but I 'm not sure the solution to Republicans who act like Democrats is to vote in Democrats .
But that 's what 's going to happen .
I 'm guessing I wo n't be an Ohioan too much longer .
It all seems so obvious , and yet for some reason , neither party in Ohio gets it .
Nor do the people for that matter .
Frustrating .

Simplifying XML Manipulation
by Bruce Eckel
June 7 , 2006
Summary
Every time someone creates a new XML - based language , God ( performs some unspeakable act ) .
Advertisement
My initial strategy for XML was to recognize it for what it is -- a platform independent way to move data from one place to another -- and then , as much as possible , to ignore it and assume that I would only have to actually look at XML when I was debugging something .
Occasionally , XML is actually treated this way .
For example , in XML - RPC , you make an ordinary function call , the mechanism converts it into XML and uses HTTP to transport the call across the network , the return value comes back as XML and the mechanism converts the XML back into useful data .
It 's the wet - dream of remote procedure calls that we 've been trying , and failing , to achieve all these years ( someone starts with an idea , then committees descend and you end up with things like CORBA and SOAP ) .
Alas , I have n't seen XML - RPC used yet in web - servicey things .
I hope that it is used somewhere , but if you read my previous entry you 'll see that the first two services I tried to use -- Fedex and the Post Office ( and UPS apparently also works this way ) -- uses something that 's almost XML - RPC , but it 's not , and you 're expected to assemble your XML by hand and then use HTTP to send it to the server , then unbundle the XML that comes back .
It 's the worst of both worlds : an ordinary RESTful call , but instead of just handing the server plain HTTP arguments , you have to build and dissect the XML .
I 'm sure there 's some reason they decided not to use XML - RPC in these cases , but I can't imagine what it is .
The point being that here 's a case where the XML should have been invisible , but you have to mess with it by hand .
Another example is Ant .
The creator of this tool has since apologized for using XML , but it's what we 're stuck with .
And it was too late , anyway , since Maven also appears to use XML .
So again , you 're stuck creating XML by hand .
For Thinking in Java , I wanted to automatically create the Ant build files for all the chapters , so I created a tool in Python that I call AntBuilder ( it 's not a general - purpose tool ; it 's designed specifically for the code in Thinking in Java ) .
In the process I used xml.dom. minidom from the standard Python library .
I 'm not exactly sure what the genesis of this library is , but the resulting code is terribly verbose and obtuse , and thus difficult to modify and maintain .
Indeed , others have created libraries that are simpler in comparison to xml.dom.
minidom ; elementree is probably the most notable , but I still found it a bit more verbose than I want , and I prefer something more like py.xml ( also look at the simplicity of py.test in the same package ) .
It 's worth noting , though , that elementree is n't all that bad and if it had been the original XML library in Python I probably would n't have gone to this trouble .
And more importantly , a subset of elementree will be in Python 2.5 .
At the time I was creating AntBuilder , the messiness of xml.dom.
minidom made the creation of the build.xml files far too difficult to manage , so I began creating a simplified approach for building XML trees .
And when I tried to make some modifications to the code from http://opensource.pseudocode.net/files/shipping.tgz which also used xml.dom.minidom , I ran into the same over - complexity problem .
So yesterday I began rewriting the XML code from the AntBuilder project to create a general purpose XML manipulation library called xmlnode .
My goal was to make the resulting code as minimal and ( to my standards ) readable as possible .
To me , XML is a hierarchy of nodes , and each node has a tag , potentially some attributes , and either a value or subnodes .
As it turns out , the whole of XML can be encapsulated into a single class which I call Node .
The operator += has been overloaded to insert subnodes into a node , and the operator + has been overloaded to string together a group of subnodes .
You create a new Node using its constructor , and you give it a tag name , an optional value , and optionally one or more attributes .
Thus , building an XML tree is about as simple as thinking about it -- the syntax does n't get in the way ( IMO ) .
With XML web - servicey things , the results also come back in XML , so the Node class has a static method ( available in Python 2.4 ) that will take a dom and produce a hierarchy of Node objects .
You can select a Node that has a particular tag name by using the " [ ] " operator ( examples below ) .
This only returns the first node with that tag name ; if there are more then you must write the code to iterate through the nodes and select the appropriate one (s ) .
But that 's not very hard since each node just contains a Python list of other nodes .
You can download the code here ( right - click to download ) .
As I get feedback I will make changes .
If you import the file , you 'll get the single class that uses xml.dom.minidom , and if you run it as a standalone program it will execute all the test / demonstration code which provides examples so you can see how to use it .
Update : ( 6/19/06 )
By using and testing this code , I 've significantly redesigned it to make it clearer and easier to use .
Also note that the design of the class allows it to be easily retargeted to a different underly XML library implementation , if desired .

Everything is a Node , and each Node can either have a value or subnodes .
Subnodes can be appended to Nodes using '+=' , and a group of Nodes can be strung together using '+'.
Create a node containing a value by saying Node ( " tag " , " value " )
You can also give attributes to the node in the constructor : Node ( " tag " , " value " , attr1 = " attr1 " , attr2 = " attr2 " ) or without a value : Node ( " tag " , attr1 = " attr1 " , attr2 = " attr2 " )
To produce xml from a finished Node n , say n.xml ( ) ( for nicely formatted output ) or n.rawxml ( ) .
You can read and modify the attributes of an xml Node using getAttribute ( ) , setAttribute ( ) , or delAttribute ( ) .
You can find the value of the first subnode with tag == " tag " by saying n[ " tag " ] .
If there are multiple instances of n[ " tag " ] , this will only find the first one , so you should use node ( ) or nodeList ( ) to narrow your search down to a Node that only has one instance of n[ " tag " ] first .
You can replace the value of the first subnode with tag == " tag " by saying n[ " tag " ] = newValue .
The same issues exist as noted in the above paragraph .
You can find the first node with tag == " tag " by saying node ( " tag " ) .
If there are multiple nodes with the same tag at the same level , use nodeList ( " tag " ) .
The Node class is also designed to create a kind of " domain specific language " by subclassing Node to create Node types specific to your problem domain .
This implementation uses xml.dom.
minidom which is available in the standard Python 2.4 library .
However , it can be retargeted to use other XML libraries without much effort . " " " from xml.dom.minidom import getDOMImplementation , parseString import copy , re class Node ( object ) : " " " Everything is a Node .
The XML is maintained as ( very efficient ) Python objects until an XML representation is needed . " " " def __init__ ( self , tag , value = None , ** attributes ) : self.tag = tag.strip ( ) self.

" " " return self.attributes [ name ] def setAttribute ( self , name , item ) : " " " Modify XML attribute of this node . " " " self.attributes [name ] = item def delAttribute ( self , name ) : " " " Remove XML attribute with this name . " " " del self.attributes [ name ] def node ( self , tag ) : " " " Recursively find the first subnode with this tag . " " " if self .
tag == tag : return self for child in self .
children : result = child.node ( tag ) if result : return result return False def nodeList ( self , tag ) : " " " Produce a list of subnodes with the same tag .
Note :
It only makes sense to do this for the immediate children of a node .
If you went another level down , the results would be ambiguous , so the user must choose the node to iterate over . " " " return [ n for n in self .
children if n.tag == tag ] def __getitem__ ( self , tag ) : " " " Produce the value of a single subnode using operator [ ] .
Recursively find the first subnode with this tag .
If you want duplicate subnodes with this tag , use nodeList ( ) . " " " subnode = self . node ( tag ) if not subnode : raise KeyError return subnode.value def __setitem__( self , tag , newValue ) : " " " Replace the value of the first subnode containing " tag " with a new value , using operator [ ] . " " " assert isinstance ( newValue , str ) , " Value " + str( newValue ) + " must be a string " subnode = self . node ( tag ) if not subnode : raise KeyError subnode.value = newValue def __iadd__( self , other ) : " " " Add child nodes using operator += " " " assert isinstance ( other , Node ) , " Tried to += " + str( other ) self.children.append( other ) return self def __add__ ( self , other ) : " " " Allow operator + to combine children " " " return self.__iadd__( other ) def __str__( self ) : " " " Display this object ( for debugging ) " " " result = self.tag + "

Here is the test program for the class , which also demonstrates how to use the various features :

BERKELEY , CA  Through photosynthesis , green plants and cyanobacteria are able to transfer sunlight energy to molecular reaction centers for conversion into chemical energy with nearly 100 - percent efficiency .
Speed is the key – the transfer of the solar energy takes place almost instantaneously so little energy is wasted as heat .
How photosynthesis achieves this near instantaneous energy transfer is a long - standing mystery that may have finally been solved .
Sunlight absorbed by bacteriochlorophyll ( green ) within the FMO protein ( gray ) generates a wavelike motion of excitation energy whose quantum mechanical properties can be mapped through the use of two - dimensional electronic spectroscopy .
( Image courtesy of Greg Engel , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , Physical Biociences Division ) A study led by researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( Berkeley Lab ) and the University of California ( UC ) at Berkeley reports that the answer lies in quantum mechanical effects .
Results of the study are presented in the April 12 , 2007 issue of the journal Nature .
“ We have obtained the first direct evidence that remarkably long - lived wavelike electronic quantum coherence plays an important part in energy transfer processes during photosynthesis , ” said Graham Fleming , the principal investigator for the study .
“ This wavelike characteristic can explain the extreme efficiency of the energy transfer because it enables the system to simultaneously sample all the potential energy pathways and choose the most efficient one . ”
Fleming is the Deputy Director of Berkeley Lab , a professor of chemistry at UC Berkeley , and an internationally acclaimed leader in spectroscopic studies of the photosynthetic process .
In a paper entitled , Evidence for wavelike energy transfer through quantum coherence in photosynthetic systems , he and his collaborators report the detection of “ quantum beating ” signals , coherent electronic oscillations in both donor and acceptor molecules , generated by light - induced energy excitations , like the ripples formed when stones are tossed into a pond .
Electronic spectroscopy measurements made on a femtosecond ( millionths of a billionth of a second ) time - scale showed these oscillations meeting and interfering constructively , forming wavelike motions of energy ( superposition states ) that can explore all potential energy pathways simultaneously and reversibly , meaning they can retreat from wrong pathways with no penalty .
This finding contradicts the classical description of the photosynthetic energy transfer process as one in which excitation energy hops from light - capturing pigment molecules to reaction center molecules step - by - step down the molecular energy ladder .
“ The classical hopping description of the energy transfer process is both inadequate and inaccurate , ” said Fleming .
“ It gives the wrong picture of how the process actually works , and misses a crucial aspect of the reason for the wonderful efficiency . ”
2 - D electronic spectroscopy developed in the research group of Berkeley Lab ’s Graham Fleming enables scientists to follow the flow of light - induced excitation energy through molecular complexes with femtosecond temporal resolution .
In this 2 - D electronic spectrum , the amplitude of the quantum beating signal for exciton 1 is plotted against population time .
The black line covers the exciton 1 peak amplitude .
The experimental data 's agreement with theory is shown on the right .
Co-authoring the Nature paper with Fleming were Gregory Engel , who was first author , Tessa Calhoun , Elizabeth Read , Tae - Kyu Ahn , Tomáš Mančal and Yuan - Chung Cheng , all of whom held joint appointments with Berkeley Lab ’s Physical Biosciences Division and the UC Berkeley Chemistry Department at the time of the study , plus Robert Blankenship , from the Washington University in St. Louis .
The photosynthetic technique for transferring energy from one molecular system to another should make any short - list of Mother Nature ’s spectacular accomplishments .
If we can learn enough to emulate this process , we might be able to create artificial versions of photosynthesis that would help us effectively tap into the sun as a clean , efficient , sustainable and carbon - neutral source of energy .
Towards this end , Fleming and his research group have developed a technique called two - dimensional electronic spectroscopy that enables them to follow the flow of light - induced excitation energy through molecular complexes with femtosecond temporal resolution .
The technique involves sequentially flashing a sample with femtosecond pulses of light from three laser beams .
A fourth beam is used as a local oscillator to amplify and detect the resulting spectroscopic signals as the excitation energy from the laser lights is transferred from one molecule to the next .
( The excitation energy changes the way each molecule absorbs and emits light . )

Fleming has compared 2 - D electronic spectroscopy to the technique used in the early super - heterodyne radios , where an incoming high frequency radio signal was converted by an oscillator to a lower frequency for more controllable amplification and better reception .
In the case of 2 - D electronic spectroscopy , scientists can track the transfer of energy between molecules that are coupled ( connected ) through their electronic and vibrational states in any photoactive system , macromolecular assembly or nanostructure .
Fleming and his group first described 2 - D electronic spectroscopy in a 2005 Nature paper , when they used the technique to observe electronic couplings in the Fenna - Matthews - Olson ( FMO ) photosynthetic light - harvesting protein , a molecular complex in green sulphur bacteria .
Said Engel , “ The 2005 paper was the first biological application of this technique , now we have used 2 - D electronic spectroscopy to discover a new phenomenon in photosynthetic systems .
While the possibility that photosynthetic energy transfer might involve quantum oscillations was first suggested more than 70 years ago , the wavelike motion of excitation energy had never been observed until now . ”
As in the 2005 paper , the FMO protein was again the target .
FMO is considered a model system for studying photosynthetic energy transfer because it consists of only seven pigment molecules and its chemistry has been well characterized .
“ To observe the quantum beats , 2 - D spectra were taken at 33 population times , ranging from 0 to 660 femtoseconds , ” said Engel .
“ In these spectra , the lowest - energy exciton ( a bound electron - hole pair formed when an incoming photon boosts an electron out of the valence energy band into the conduction band ) gives rise to a diagonal peak near 825 nanometers that clearly oscillates .
The associated cross-peak amplitude also appears to oscillate .
Surprisingly , this quantum beating lasted the entire 660 femtoseconds . ”
Engel said the duration of the quantum beating signals was unexpected because the general scientific assumption had been that the electronic coherences responsible for such oscillations are rapidly destroyed .
Members of the Fleming research group who contributed to this study included ( from left ) Greg Engel ( first author on Nature paper ) , Tessa Calhoun , Tae - Kyu Ahn , Elizabeth Read and Yuan - Chung Cheng .

“ For this reason , the transfer of electronic coherence between excitons during relaxation has usually been ignored , ” Engel said .
“ By demonstrating that the energy transfer process does involve electronic coherence and that this coherence is much stronger than we would ever have expected , we have shown that the process can be much more efficient than the classical view could explain .
However , we still do n’t know to what degree photosynthesis benefits from these quantum effects . ”
Engel said one of the next steps for the Fleming group in this line of research will be to look at the effects of temperature changes on the photosynthetic energy transfer process .
The results for this latest paper in Nature were obtained from FMO complexes kept at 77 Kelvin .
The group will also be looking at broader bandwidths of energy using different colors of light pulses to map out everything that is going on , not just energy transfer .
Ultimately , the idea is to gain a much better understanding how Nature not only transfers energy from one molecular system to another , but is also able to convert it into useful forms .
“ Nature has had about 2.7 billion years to perfect photosynthesis , so there are huge lessons that remain for us to learn , ” Engel said .
“ The results we ’re reporting in this latest paper , however , at least give us a new way to think about the design of future artificial photosynthesis systems . ”

A Note to Survivors :
Research Credit :
Thisarticle is pretty good , but I feel the need to take you much deeper down the rabbit hole .
Try to get comfortable , it 's not going to be pleasant .
I used to work for one of the oldest and largest financial services companies in the world .
But you would n't have known it from looking at the sign on the outside of the building .
You see , the firm kept its name out of public view when it came to this : the sub prime mortgage lending racket .
Why ?
This Wall Street firm , spoken about in hushed tones around country clubs and cocktail parties , DOES NOT want to have its name associated with the financial services equivalent of a chop shop or a whore house .
Oh no .
It just wants the money associated with this despicable operation , and none of the press .
Questions in the media about the propriety of these activities might cause discomfort for investors .
Certain public appearances need to be maintained , after all .
This firm premeditated the exit from the crash unfolding before our eyes , both legally and in terms of public relations , years in advance .
Here 's what it did .
The firm 's strategy was to acquire fly - by - night companies who were dealing in these dodgy ( sub - prime ) loans and making impossible to imagine amounts of money at it .
The outward public appearances of these acquired companies did not change .
Some of the fly - by - night , fast - and - loose , make - it - up - as - you - go and illegal activities were transformed into probably - no - jail - time best - practices .
The CFO had a habit of putting me on hold without muting the headset .
He always seemed to be talking about " scratch and dent deals " with someone else in his office .
" Oh sh *t . not going to like this .
* rhetorical chuckle *
What 's a few million dollars between friends ... " Behind the scenes , however , executives who were n't decapitated on the spot as part of the acquisitions , started taking orders from , if you know what I mean .
Entirely new computer networks were built that linked the systems of these up - start , sub - prime lending corporations that --- if you 're fortunate --- you 've never heard of , to what we called " The Mother Ship " in New York , a firm that just about anyone with a net worth of a million dollars or more would probably recognize .
I was present at one of these 3 am infrastructure sessions ( getting paid double time ) , in a machine room with servers stacked floor to ceiling , cooling fans screaming , and black coffee going down by the pot full .
We were taking orders from the " global ops center " in New York .
The blinking lights on the " big-iron " Cisco routers indicated that roughly US $ 5 billion in funny money was going to move between the red - headed stepchild operation I worked for and the polished halls of The Mother Ship each month .
US$ 5 billion per month .
This was just one tiny , fly - fart aspect of just one division of this diabolical corporation .
And I was told it was chump change for them , and that it would be cut loose at the drop of a hat , if necessary , should any undue attention start coming their way .
A manager told me something like , " It 's not worth the bad PR for them .
They 'll rake it in for as long as things can be kept quiet .
But they wo n't tolerate any heat in the press .
" I noticed that the scam seemed very similar to the way the CIA runs cut outs .
Except with this , the firm was only concerned with its public image ; it 's no secret who owns whom in this game , if you know where to look , and everything had been done according to federal regulations that this firm probably wrote , so it 's not a question of legal or illegal .
When it comes time to shut down offices and roll up the operations , they want it to go smoothly .
And if Joe and Jane Six pack start to wonder who actually sold them their dodgy loan , it wo n't be immediately apparent .
And , if Joe and Jane Six pack read the fine print , they will find that they screwed themselves by signing on the dotted line anyway .
When the press interviews these people , they will talk about how " Bob 's - Dodgy - Loans - While - You - Wait " screwed them over , and how they did n't know , this , that and the other thing , etc ...
But to where do all the fiber paths lead ?
" Bob 's - Dodgy - Loans - While - You - Wait " was just being used by the firm as insulation from the inevitable bad press , that is now emerging .
" Bob 's - Dodgy - Loans - While - You - Wait " will be shut down and forgotten after a few days or weeks .
Joe and Jane Six Pack will get their clocks cleaned , as usual .
They wo n't even know who was really behind it all .
By this time , the Mother Ship will have found other front companies to hide behind and new victims to grind into cash .
The front company I worked for actually changed names twice over the course of a year .
Both of them were owned by the firm .
The old domain now forwards to some backwater page on the new company 's domain that displays a date that is off by a couple of years .
Of course , the parent firm is nowhere to be seen !
US$ 5 billion per month ...
You'd think they could get the webserver to display the right date .
Nope .
Too busy generating funny money .
I went through several rounds of layoffs at this place .
There would be moments of tension in the office and then these guys wearing black suits , diamond pinky rings and Bluetooth headsets would start walking around .
Their ties were cinched up so tightly that the rolls of lard in the necks spilled over onto their collars .
These were the goons sent by the Mother Ship to escort terminated employees out of the building .
" What the f*ck is this ? "
I asked my boss , " The set of Good Fellas 2 ?
" HAHAHA , he thought that was funny .
( None of this pissed me off , of course .
I 'd seen it all before .
I knew what I was getting myself into when I accepted this contract .
My wife and I needed land and we were going to get it .
If I had to crawl through a dark , slimy sewer pipe to get it , like the guy in Shawshank Redemption , that 's what had to be done .
If they axed me , I 'd just sell myself to some other piece of sh*t outfit until we had enough money to pay off our land .
" Play to win , " was my mantra though it all .
Somehow , though , the axe did n't fall .
Month in and month out , I kept showing up , and saving money .
But enough about me . )
The firm externalized the financial risks of being in this business by selling all of the paper they generated into the secondary mortgage market at the end of every month .
This is an institutional marketplace that trades in commoditized mortgages , " debt paper . "
In other words , at the end of each month , the firm had none of the impossible - to - payback - negative - amoritization - no - money - down loans on their books !
I handled some issues for the secondary marketing department , even , would you believe , for the person who pulled the trigger on these paper dumps at the end of the month .
" Who buys this stuff ? " I asked .
" Oh lots and lots of people .
Well , banks and insurance companies mostly .
[ Large European Bank name deleted ] buys a lot of it .
" I wonder if [ Large European Bank name deleted ] knew what I knew or cared about how those loans were generated .
( Of course , they knew and did n't care .
They 'll sell this toilet paper debt to some other sucker down the line . )
See , I also handled issues for the used - car - salesman - type ' account executives ' .
Just before I left , the company switched loan origination systems .
The people writing these loans were pissed because they were no longer able to get loans approved for people with fraudulent social security numbers .
They would actually complain because the system was telling them that the would - be borrower was using a false / fake / invalid SSN .
" The old system never gave me these problems .
How am I supposed to get any work done ?!
I hate this new system .
" But wait , there 's more .
As part of my daily duties , I had to take remote control of the systems that these donkeys were using .
Occasionally , ( a couple of times per day , at least ) I would see the credit summary screens for the loan applicants .
The highest credit score I ever saw was something like 615 .
The lowest was 520 .
Sprinkled with bankruptcies , unpaid credit cards , default this , late that .
Every once in a while , I 'd chuckle and ask the person on the phone , " And this guy can buy a $ 400,000 house with no money down !?
" Absolutely God damned right !
That 's what this company did .
All day .
Monday through Friday .
Things started to get interesting when
They sent a memo to all employees on what to say to anyone who presented themselves as auditors or investigators .
We were to refer them to some flunkie .
I thought , " Oh goodie , we 're going to get raided by a three - letter agency and guys wearing guns and blue wind - breakers are going to wheel the servers out on dollies !
PHB s are going to be handcuffed and frog marched into a waiting paddy wagon !
" Sadly , that did n't happen .
For me , the icing on the cake moment happened when the firm started offering these criminal loans to their own employees , and at deep discounts , to pad the numbers as business started to slow down !
The memo actually said that because we were such valued employees --- actually , I was n't an employee , my title was IT - Outsourced - On - Site --- we would n't be charged any " junk fees " associated with the origination of the loan .
WOW !
No junk fees !
Thank you , Master !
Thank you , Master !
" Just keep cool , " I told myself , " Just keep cool .
You 're almost out of here .
" I smiled , silently farted and answered the next phone call , " This is Kevin , how may I help you ?
" To those of you who are out , a tip - of - the - hat and a well - done to you .
Now , what are you going to do with the cash ?

e has always bothered me — not the letter , but the mathematical constant .
What does it really mean ?
Math books and even my beloved Wikipedia describe e using obtuse jargon :
The mathematical constant e is the base of the natural logarithm .
And when you look up the natural logarithm you get :
The natural logarithm , formerly known as the hyperbolic logarithm , is the logarithm to the base e , where e is an irrational constant approximately equal to 2.718281828459 .
Nice circular reference there .
It ’s like a dictionary that defines labyrinthine with Byzantine : it ’s correct but not helpful .
What ’s wrong with everyday words like “ complicated ” ?
I ’m not picking on Wikipedia — many math explanations are dry and formal in their quest for rigor .
But this does n’t help beginners trying to get a handle on a subject ( and we were all a beginner at one point ) .
No more !
Today I ’m sharing my intuitive , high - level insights about what e is and why it rocks .
Save your rigorous math book for another time .
Here ’s a quick video overview of the insights :
e is NOT Just a Number
Describing e as “ a constant approximately 2.71828 … ” is like calling pi “ an irrational number , approximately equal to 3.1415 … ” .
Sure , it ’s true , but you completely missed the point .
Pi is the ratio between circumference and diameter shared by all circles .
It is a fundamental ratio inherent in all circles and therefore impacts any calculation of circumference , area , volume , and surface area for circles , spheres , cylinders , and so on .
Pi is important and shows all circles are related , not to mention the trigonometric functions derived from circles ( sin , cos , tan ) .
e is the base rate of growth shared by all continually growing processes .
e lets you take a simple growth rate ( where all change happens at the end of the year ) and find the impact of compound , continuous growth , where every nanosecond ( or faster ) you are growing just a little bit .
e shows up whenever systems grow exponentially and continuously : population , radioactive decay , interest calculations , and more .
Even jagged systems that do n’t grow smoothly can be approximated by e .
Just like every number can be considered a scaled version of 1 ( the base unit ) , every circle can be considered a scaled version of the unit circle ( radius 1 ) , and every rate of growth can be considered a scaled version of e ( unit growth , perfectly compounded ) .
So e is not an obscure , seemingly random number .
e represents the idea that all continually growing systems are scaled versions of a common rate .
Understanding Exponential Growth
Let 's start by looking at a basic system that doubles after an amount of time .
For example ,
Bacteria can split and “ doubles ” every 24 hours
We get twice as many noodles when we fold them in half .
Your money doubles every year if you get 100 % return ( lucky ! )
And it looks like this :
Splitting in two or doubling is a very common progression .
Sure , we can triple or quadruple , but doubling is convenient , so hang with me here .
Mathematically , if we have x splits then we get $ 2 ^x $ times as much stuff than when we started .
With 1 split we have $ 2^1 $ or 2 times as much .
With 4 splits we have $ 2^4 = 16 $ times as much .
As a general formula :
Said another way , doubling is 100 % growth .
We can rewrite our formula like this :
It ’s the same equation , but we separate 2 into what it really is : the original value ( 1 ) plus 100 % .
Clever , eh ?
Of course , we can substitute any number ( 50 % , 25 % , 200 % ) for 100 % and get the growth formula for that new rate .
So the general formula for x periods of return is :
This just means we use our rate of return , ( 1 + return ) , “ x ” times .
A Closer Look
Our formula assumes growth happens in discrete steps .
Our bacteria are waiting , waiting , and then boom , they double at the very last minute .
Our interest earnings magically appear at the 1 year mark .
Based on the formula above , growth is punctuated and happens instantly .
The green dots suddenly appear .
The world is n’t always like this .
If we zoom in , we see that our bacterial friends split over time :
Mr. Green does n’t just show up : he slowly grows out of Mr. Blue .
After 1 unit of time ( 24 hours in our case ) , Mr. Green is complete .
He then becomes a mature blue cell and can create new green cells of his own .
Does this information change our equation ?
Nope .
In the bacteria case , the half - formed green cells still can’t do anything until they are fully grown and separated from their blue parents .
The equation still holds .
Money Changes Everything
But money is different .
As soon as we earn a penny of interest , that penny can start earning micro-pennies of its own .
We do n’t need to wait until we earn a complete dollar in interest — fresh money does n’t need to mature .
Based on our old formula , interest growth looks like this :
But again , this is n’t quite right : all the interest appears on the last day .
Let ’s zoom in and split the year into two chunks .
We earn 100 % interest every year , or 50 % every 6 months .
So , we earn 50 cents the first 6 months and another 50 cents in the last half of the year :
But this still is n’t right !
Sure , our original dollar ( Mr. Blue ) earns a dollar over the course of a year .
But after 6 months we had a 50 - cent piece , ready to go , that we neglected !
That 50 cents could have earned money on its own :
Because our rate is 50 % per half year , that 50 cents would have earned 25 cents ( 50 % times 50 cents ) .
At the end of 1 year we ’d have
Our original dollar ( Mr. Blue )
The dollar Mr. Blue made ( Mr. Green )
The 25 cents Mr. Green made ( Mr. Red )
Giving us a total of \ $ 2.25 .
We gained \$ 1.25 from our initial dollar , even better than doubling !
Let ’s turn our return into a formula .
The growth of two half - periods of 50 % is :
Diving into Compound Growth
It ’s time to step it up a notch .
Instead of splitting growth into two periods of 50 % increase , let ’s split it into 3 segments of 33 % growth .
Who says we have to wait for 6 months before we start getting interest ?
Let ’s get more granular in our counting .
Charting our growth for 3 compounded periods gives a funny picture :
Think of each color as shoveling money upwards towards the other colors ( its children ) , at 33 % per period :
Month 0 : We start with Mr. Blue at \ $1 .
We start with Mr. Blue at \ $ 1 .
Month 4 : Mr. Blue has earned 1/3 dollar on himself , and creates Mr. Green , shoveling along 33 cents .
Mr. Blue has earned 1/3 dollar on himself , and creates Mr. Green , shoveling along 33 cents .
Month 8 : Mr. Blue earns another 33 cents and gives it to Mr. Green , bringing Mr. Green up to 66 cents .
Mr. Green has actually earned 33 % on his previous value , creating 11 cents ( 33 % * 33 cents ) .
This 11 cents becomes Mr. Red .
Mr. Blue earns another 33 cents and gives it to Mr. Green , bringing Mr. Green up to 66 cents .
Mr. Green has actually earned 33 % on his previous value , creating 11 cents ( 33 % * 33 cents ) .
This 11 cents becomes Mr. Red. Month 12 : Things get a bit crazy .
Mr. Blue earns another 33 cents and shovels it to Mr. Green , bringing Mr. Green to a full dollar .
Mr. Green earns 33 % return on his Month 8 value ( 66 cents ) , earning 22 cents .
This 22 cents gets added to Mr. Red , who now totals 33 cents .
And Mr. Red , who started at 11 cents , has earned 4 cents ( 33 % * .11 ) on his own , creating Mr. Purple .
Phew !
The final value after 12 months is : 1 + 1 + .33 + .04 or about 2.37 .
Take some time to really understand what ’s happening with this growth :
Each color earns interest on itself and hands it off to another color .
The newly - created money can earn money of its own , and on the cycle goes .
I like to think of the original amount ( Mr. Blue ) as never changing .
Mr. Blue shovels money to create Mr. Green , a steady 33 every 4 months since Mr. Blue does not change .
In the diagram , Mr. Blue has a blue arrow showing how he feeds Mr. Green .
Mr. Green just happens to create and feed Mr. Red ( green arrow ) , but Mr. Blue is n’t aware of this .
As Mr. Green grows over time ( being constantly fed by Mr. Blue ) , he contributes more and more to Mr. Red .
Between months 4 - 8 Mr. Green gives 11 cents to Mr. Red. Between months 8 - 12 Mr. Green gives 22 cents to Mr. Red , since Mr. Green was at 66 cents during Month 8 .
If we expanded the chart , Mr. Green would give 33 cents to Mr. Red , since Mr. Green reached a full dollar by Month 12 .
Make sense ?
It ’s tough at first — I even confused myself a bit while putting the charts together .
But see that each dollar creates little helpers , who in turn create helpers , and so on .
We get a formula by using 3 periods in our growth equation :
We earned \ $ 1.37 , even better than the \ $ 1.25 we got last time !
Can We Get Infinite Money ?
Why not take even shorter time periods ?
How about every month , day , hour , or even nanosecond ?
Will our returns skyrocket ?
Our return gets better , but only to a point .
Try using different numbers of n in our magic formula to see our total return :
n ( 1 + 1/n) ^n
----------------------- 1 2 2 2.25 3 2.37 5 2.488 10 2.5937 100 2.7048 1,000 2.7169 10,000 2.71814 100,000 2.718268 1,000,000 2.7182804 ...
The numbers get bigger and converge around 2.718 .
Hey … wait a minute … that looks like e!
Yowza .
In geeky math terms , e is defined to be that rate of growth if we continually compound 100 % return on smaller and smaller time periods :
This limit appears to converge , and there are proofs to that effect .
But as you can see , as we take finer time periods the total return stays around 2.718 .
But what does it all mean ?
The number e ( 2.718 … ) is the maximum possible result when compounding 100 % growth for one time period .
Sure , you started out expecting to grow from 1 to 2 ( that ’s a 100 % increase , right ? ) .
But with each tiny step forward you create a little dividend that starts growing on its own .
When all is said and done , you end up with e ( 2.718 … ) at the end of 1 time period , not 2 .
e is the maximum , what happens when we compound 100 % as much as possible .
So , if we start with \$ 1.00 and compound continuously at 100 % return we get 1e .
If we start with \$ 2.00 , we get 2e .
If we start with \ $ 11.79 , we get 11.79e .
e is like a speed limit ( like c , the speed of light ) saying how fast you can possibly grow using a continuous process .
You might not always reach the speed limit , but it ’s a reference point : you can write every rate of growth in terms of this universal constant .
( Aside :
Be careful about separating the increase from the final result .
1 becoming e ( 2.718 … ) is an increase ( growth rate ) of 171.8 % .
e , by itself , is the final result you observe after all growth is taken into account ( original + increase ) ) .
What about different rates ?
Good question .
What if we grow at 50 % annually , instead of 100 % ?
Can we still use e ?
Let ’s see .
The rate of 50 % compound growth would look like this :
Hrm .
What can we do here ?
Remember , 50 % is the total return , and n is the number of periods to split the growth into for compounding .
If we pick n=50 , we can split our growth into 50 chunks of 1 % interest :
Sure , it ’s not infinity , but it ’s pretty granular .
Now imagine we also divided our regular rate of 100 % into chunks of 1 % :
Ah , something is emerging here .
In our regular case , we have 100 cumulative changes of 1 % each .
In the 50 % scenario , we have 50 cumulative changes of 1 % each .
What is the difference between the two numbers ?
Well , it ’s just half the number of changes :
This is pretty interesting .
50 / 100 = .5 , which is the exponent we raise e to .
This works in general : if we had a 300 % growth rate , we could break it into 300 chunks of 1 % growth .
This would be triple the normal amount for a net rate of $ e^3 $ .
Even though growth can look like addition ( +1 % ) , we need to remember that it ’s really a multiplication ( x 1.01 ) .
This is why we use exponents ( repeated multiplication ) and square roots ( $e^ { 1/2} $ means “ half ” the number of changes , i.e. half the number of multiplications ) .
Although we picked 1 % , we could have chosen any small unit of growth ( .1 % , .0001 % , or even an infinitely small amount ! ) .
The key is that for any rate we pick , it ’s just a new exponent on e :
What about different times ?
Suppose we have 300 % growth for 2 years .
We ’d multiply one year ’s growth ( $e ^3 $ ) by itself :
And in general :
Because of the magic of exponents , we can avoid having two powers and just multiply rate and time together in a single exponent .
The big secret : e merges rate and time .
This is wild !
$ e^x $ can mean two things :
x is the number of times we multiply a growth rate : 100 % growth for 3 years is $ e^3 $
x is the growth rate itself : 300 % growth for one year is $ e^3 $
Wo n’t this overlap confuse things ?
Will our formulas break and the world come to an end ?
It all works out .
When we write $ e^x $ , the variable $x $ is a combination of rate and time .
Let me explain .
When dealing with continuous compound growth , 10 years of 3 % growth has the same overall impact as 1 year of 30 % growth ( and no growth afterward ) .
10 years of 3 % growth means 30 changes of 1 % .
These changes happen over 10 years , so you are growing continuously at 3 % per year .
1 period of 30 % growth means 30 changes of 1 % , but happening in a single year .
So you grow for 30 % a year and stop .
The same “ 30 changes of 1 % ” happen in each case .
The faster your rate ( 30 % ) the less time you need to grow for the same effect ( 1 year ) .
The slower your rate ( 3 % ) the longer you need to grow ( 10 years ) .
But in both cases , the growth is $ e^{.30} = 1.35 $ in the end .
We ’re impatient and prefer large , fast growth to slow , long growth but e shows they have the same net effect .
So , our general formula becomes :
If we have a return of r for t time periods , our net compound growth is $ e^{rt} $ .
This even works for negative and fractional returns , by the way .
Example Time !
Examples make everything more fun .
A quick note :
We ’re so used to formulas like $ 2 ^x $ and regular , compound interest that it ’s easy to get confused ( myself included ) .
Read more about simple , compound and continuous growth .
These examples focus on smooth , continuous growth , not the jumpy growth that happens at yearly intervals .
There are ways to convert between them , but we ’ll save that for another article .
Example 1 : Growing crystals
Suppose I have 300 kg of magic crystals .
They ’re magic because they grow throughout the day : I watch a single crystal , and in the course of 24 hours it sheds off its own weight in crystals .
( The baby crystals start growing immediately at the same rate , but I ca n’t track that — I ’m watching how much the original sheds ) .
How much will I have after 10 days ?
Well , since the crystals start growing immediately , we want continuous growth .
Our rate is 100 % every 24 hours , so after 10 days we get : $ 300 \cdot e^{1 \cdot 10} = 6.6 \ text{million kg}$ of our magic gem .
This can be tricky : notice the difference between the input rate and the total output rate .
The “ input ” rate is how much a single crystal changes : 100 % in 24 hours .
The net output rate is e ( 2.718 x ) because the baby crystals grow on their own .
In this case we have the input rate ( how fast one crystal grows ) and want the total result after compounding ( how fast the entire group grows because of the baby crystals ) .
If we have the total growth rate and want the rate of a single crystal , we work backwards and use the natural log .
Example 2 : Maximum interest rates
Suppose I have \$ 120 in an account with 5 % interest .
My bank is generous and gives me the maximum possible compounding .
How much will I have after 10 years ?
Our rate is 5 % , and we ’re lucky enough to compound continuously .
After 10 years , we get $ 120 \cdot e^{.05 \cdot 10} = 197.85 $ .
Of course , most banks are n’t nice enough to give you the best possible rate .
The difference between your actual return and the continuous one is how much they do n’t like you .
Example 3 : Radioactive decay
I have 10kg of a radioactive material , which appears to continuously decay at a rate of 100 % per year .
How much will I have after 3 years ?
Zip ?
Zero ?
Nothing ?
Think again .
Decaying continuously at 100 % per year is the trajectory we start off with .
Yes , we do begin with 10kg and expect to “ lose it all ” by the end of the year , since we ’re decaying at 10 kg / year .
We go a few months and get to 5kg .
Half a year left ?
Nope !
Now we ’re losing at a rate of 5 kg / year , so we have another full year from this moment !
We wait a few more months , and get to 2kg .
And of course , now we ’re decaying at a rate of 2kg / year , so we have a full year ( from this moment ) .
We get 1 kg , have a full year , get to .5 kg , have a full year — see the pattern ?
As time goes on , we lose material , but our rate of decay slows down .
This constantly changing growth is the essence of continuous growth & decay .
After 3 years , we ’ll have $ 10 \cdot e^{ - 1 \cdot 3} = .498 \ text{ kg}$ .
We use a negative exponent for decay — we want a fraction ( $ 1/ e^{rt} $ ) vs a growth multiplier ( $e^{rt} $ ) .
[ Decay is commonly given in terms of " half life " -- we 'll talk about converting these rates in a future article . ]
More Examples
If you want fancier examples , try the Black - Scholes option formula ( notice e used for exponential decay in value ) or radioactive decay .
The goal is to see $ e^{rt} $ in a formula and understand why it ’s there : it ’s modeling a type of growth or decay .
And now you know why it ’s “ e ” , and not pi or some other number : e raised to “ r*t ” gives you the growth impact of rate r and time t .
There ’s More To Learn
My goal was to :
Explain why e is important :
It ’s a fundamental constant , like pi , that shows up in growth rates .
It ’s a fundamental constant , like pi , that shows up in growth rates .
Give an intuitive explanation : e lets you see the impact of any growth rate .
Every new “ piece ” ( Mr. Green , Mr. Red , etc. ) helps add to the total growth .

Sand grain - sized particles could ride on Martian winds
The devices would consist of a computer chip covered by a plastic sheath that can change shape when a voltage is applied , enabling it to be steered .
Details were presented at the National Astronomy Meeting in Preston .
Dr John Barker , from the University of Glasgow , said the particles could use wireless networking to form swarms .
We have a lot of obstacles to overcome before we are even ready to physically test our designs
John Barker , University of Glasgow Prof Barker interview
The professor at Glasgow 's Nanoelectronics Research Centre told delegates at the Royal Astronomical Society gathering that computer chips of the size and sophistication required to meet the challenge already existed .
Smart dust could be packed into the nose cones of planetary probes and then released into the atmospheres of planets , where they would be carried on the wind .
For a planet like Mars , smart dust particles would each have to be the size of a grain of sand .
By applying a voltage to alter the shape of the polymer sheath surrounding the chip , dust particle could be steered towards a target , even in high winds .
The swarm
The polymer sheath surrounding the computer chip could be made to wrinkle or flatten out .
Wrinkling the plastic sheath would increase the drag on the particle , lifting it higher on the wind .
Flattening out the sheath would cause the particle to plummet .
Wireless networking would allow these particles to form swarms , and Dr Barker 's team has carried out mathematical simulations to see how this would work .
" We envisage that most of the particles can only talk to their nearest neighbours but a few can communicate at much longer distances .
" In our simulations , we have shown that a swarm of 50 dust particles can organise themselves into a star formation , even in turbulent wind . "
The ability to fly in formation would allow the processing of data to be spread , or " distributed " between all the chips , and a collective signal to be beamed back to a " mothership " .
Small sensors
Scientists have already demonstrated smart dust that crams sensors , power sources , digital communications and processing circuitry into a volume of a few cubic centimetres .
If they were to be used for planetary exploration , smart dust particles would have to carry sensors .
But current chemical sensors would be too large to be carried on particles the size of sand grains .
The scientists hope the pace of miniaturisation will make smaller sensors available in coming decades .
" We are still at an early stage , working on simulations and components , " said Dr Barker .
" We have a lot of obstacles to overcome before we are even ready to physically test our designs . "
Many other applications have been proposed for smart dust .
One idea is to use particles to gather information on battlefields .
Another idea involves mixing the particles into concrete to internally monitor the health of buildings and bridges .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Wednesday April 11 2007
The estimated emissions from fires in degraded peatlands in Indonesia are 1,400 m tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum and not , as we stated in the article below , 1,400 tonnes .
This has been corrected .
The numbers are damning .
Within 15 years 98 % of the rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia will be gone , little more than a footnote in history .
With them will disappear some of the world 's most important wildlife species , victims of the rapacious destruction of their habitat in what conservationists see as a lost cause .
Yet this gloomy script was supposed to have included a small but significant glimmer of hope .
Oil palm for biofuel was to have been one of the best solutions in saving the planet from greenhouse gases and global warming .
Instead the forests are being torn down in the headlong rush to boost palm oil production .
More startling is that conservationists believe the move to clear land for this " green fuel " is often little more than a conspiracy , providing cover to strip out the last stands of timber not already lost to illegal loggers .
In one corner of Kalimantan , the Indonesian part of Borneo , a mere 250,000 hectares or 1,000 sq miles ...-... almost twice the size of Greater London ...-... of the 6 m hectares of forest allocated for palm oil by the government have actually been planted .
" When you look closely the areas where companies are getting permission for oil palm plantations are those of high - conservation forest , " said Willie Smits , who set up SarVision , a satellite mapping service that charts the rainforest 's decline .
" What they 're really doing is stealing the timber because they get to clear it before they plant .
But the timber 's all they want ; hit and run with no intention of ever planting .
It 's a conspiracy . "
The fear is that Indonesia 's aim of almost doubling the 6.5 m hectares under oil palm plantation in the next five to eight years - tripling it by 2020 - to meet rocketing worldwide demand will afford ever - greater opportunities for the timber thieves .
An estimated 2.8 m hectares of forest is already lost every year .
Until now palm oil - of which 83 % is produced in Indonesia and Malaysia - was produced for food .
But the European Union 's aim of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % by 2020 , partly by demanding that 10 % of vehicles be fuelled by biofuels , will see a fresh surge in palm oil demand that could doom the rainforests .
That is likely to kill off the " flagship species " of wildlife such as the Asian elephant , the Sumatran tiger and the orang - utan of Borneo which are already under enormous pressure from habitat loss .
Plantation owners regard the orang - utan as pests because it eats the young palm oil plants and hunt them down ruthlessly .
" In reality it 's over for the tiger , the elephant and the orang - utan , " said Mr Smits , who founded the Borneo Orang - utan Survival Foundation .
" Their entire lowland forest habitat is essentially gone already .
We find orang - utan burned , or their heads cut off .
Hunters are paid 150,000 rupiah [ £ 8.30 ] for the right hand of an orang - utan to prove they 've killed them . "
Two orang - utan rehabilitation centres run by the foundation on Indonesian Borneo are overflowing with more than 800 of the primates , most rescued from oil palm plantations .
But the east Kalimantan centre , where rescued babies are reared by hand , has been unable to release any rescued orang - utan into the wild for four years because suitable habitat has proved impossible to find .
In central Kalimantan the picture is worse : it has never staged a release in almost a decade .
A new UN report The Last Stand of the Orangutan : State of Emergency found that forests in Indonesia and Malaysia are being felled so quickly that 98 % could be gone by 2022 .
Yet the orang - utan 's lowland forest could disappear much sooner .
" We 're looking at the virtual extinction of the orang - utan in 15 years , or less , " said Raffaella Commitante , primatologist at the foundation 's east Kalimantan centre .
" There are between 50,000 and 60,000 on Borneo and 7,000 on Sumatra .
But 5,000 - 10,000 are killed each year . "
Yet palm oil , mixed with diesel to produce biofuel , was hailed as a potential saviour for the environment .
Put simply , the argument runs that the palm oil plants produce organic compounds that when burned in engines do not add to overall carbon dioxide levels .
The CO2 absorbed by the plant in its life - cycle should balance the amount it gives out when burned .
However , the more the ecological fairytale is scrutinised the more it begins to look like a bad dream .
Researchers from the Dutch pressure group Wetlands International found that as much as half the space created for new palm oil plantations was cleared by draining and burning peat - land , sending huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
The sodden peat of central Kalimantan acts as a vast organic sponge that stores huge amounts of carbon .
But as it dries while being drained for plantation , or by roads being cut through to remove timber , it releases the stored carbon .
In Indonesia alone , the peat releases 600 m tonnes of carbon a year .
Worse , it is often set alight to speed clearing , adding to the CO2 from the huge forest fires that blanket much of south - east Asia in haze .
Estimates say Indonesia 's fires generate 1,400 m tonnes of carbon dioxide each year , pushing it to the world 's third - largest producer of CO2 from 26th , if both factors are considered .
Conservationists also fear that placing all eggs in one basket could prompt an ecological disaster .
A palm oil monoculture would be unable to support the rich diversity of wildlife and leave the environment vulnerable to catastrophic disease , while local people dependent on the crop could be left high and dry if it fell out of favour .
" There are bad biofuels in the world and palm oil is often the very ' baddest ' , " said Ed Matthew , biofuel specialist at Friends of the Earth .
" Europe should n't be setting targets until it 's put a mechanism in place to block bad biofuels .
Palm oil is one of the cheapest biofuels in the field , but by setting targets it sends the wrong signal for businessmen . "
As the risks become more obvious there has been a growing clamour for eco-labelling of " sustainable " palm oil .
A " round table " of buyers , producers and environmentalists has established several key criteria that would prevent conversion of high - conservation rainforest to palm oil plantations , cut the use of fires to clear land , and mitigate the conflict of plantations with wildlife and rural communities , though it has yet to be ratified .
" It 's vital we find financial backing for this now , " said Fitrian Ardiansyah , a Worldwide Fund for Nature - Indonesia programme officer .
Jakarta is increasingly aware of the dangers , highlighted by its inability to prevent continuing illegal logging .
But it is keen to grab the chance and is pledging to put in place regulations to seize allocated palm oil land not planted within a time limit .
Yet as a developing country it also believes Europe must help out financially if it wants the safeguards against the downside of palm oil production that will assist in cutting greenhouse gas .
" The Indonesian government simply does n't have the capability or the capacity to do this alone without the support of the Europeans , the US , Japanese , or whoever , " said Alhilal Hamdi , chief executive of Indonesia 's biofuels development board .
" It 's no good other countries looking to us to help cut their CO2 emissions without helping to support us in that effort . "

It wo n’t take long to start hearing about sugar cane successfully planted and converted to ethanol closer to home than expected .
But before the cane hype gets installed , please take a dive into the fascinating history of a plant that shaped the World .
Sugar Cane is back in the news .
With oil prices resembling those of the early 1980s , it seems that all those efforts made by then in Brasil to step - up ethanol production make sense again .
With the promise of a high energy return and a renewable production cycle , the cane culture might be set for a return .
What is it ?

It is a plant from the gramineae family remarkable in harvesting the energy from the sun .
It grows with a stout and fibrous stalk formed by several joints that ’s highly rich in sucrose .
It produces small flowers forming pending spikes at the top .
Depending on the breed it can grow from 3 to 6 meters high , with a stalk 2 to 5 centimeters thick .
Although mechanized harvest has been evolving , sugar cane is still mostly cut by hand throughout the world .
The tool used by cutters is a steel blade 50 centimeters long widening to 15 centimeters at its tip .
Yielding is made by cutting down the cane , clearing the leaves ( sometimes with the help of a hook at the blade ’s end ) and giving a final cut on its top at the level of the last mature joint .
The stalks are then pilled and collected in beams by hand or mechanically .
The beams are then carried to a mill where they are triturated into a broth that is the base of the final products .
Brasil is by far the largest sugar cane producer in the world , although the culture is almost universal in Tropical regions , were it benefits from the alternating humid and dry seasons .
Although sugar is its most popular product , the cane juice is also used to produce syrup , molasses , rum , firewater ( called cachaça in Brasil ) and alcohol used as fuel .
Among the residues of the sugar cane crushing is the bagasse than can be used as a heat source , powering the mills or producing electricity .
A mix of cane yeast and bagasse is also used as feed stock , and another residue , in Brasil called cane wine , can be used as fertilizer .
In the southeast of Brasil sugar cane is planted from October to March and harvested from May to October ; in the north it is planted from July to November and harvested from December to May .
Circa 80 % of Brasil ’s harvest is done by hand , employing more than 1 million workers .
Varying with local environment conditions the annual harvest can go from 50 to 100 tones per hectare , the mean for Brasil is 60 tones per hectare .
From this mass the sugar content extracted can go from 9 % to 12 % , whereas the volume of ethanol obtained stays around 70 liters per tone .
Origins and first migrations

Although still a matter open to discussion , sugar cane is commonly referenced as originary from Papua New Guinea , appearing between 10000 and 12000 years ago .
Other possible origin is Western Polynesia , but due to the proximity of these territories and a high number of hybrid species , it is impossible to know exactly where sugar cane first germinated [ P01 ] .
By 3000 B.C. the plant had slowly traveled north through tropical Asia to the Malaysian Peninsula , Indochina and the Bay of Bengal .
At this time the plant ’s products were n’t yet subject to trade , its production was mainly as a subsistence culture [ P02 ] .
Sugar cane was first introduced into China circa 800 B.C. , at the time still used as syrup [ P03 ] .
It is only by 400 B.C. that the first raw sugar is made by crystallizing the syrup .
At this point the culture is widespread throughout East Asia , clearly testing the tropical limits .
By 500 B.C. emperor Darius I of Persia sends several expeditions to the East ( among them one exploring the Indus River ) cementing the economic fabric of his empire .
It is believed that in consequence of these expeditions sugar cane is eventually brought back to Persia .
There it would be cherished as a high luxury item and kept secret from the rest of the western world .
By this time the culture as clearly left the Tropics behind [ P04 ] .
The Arab Conquest
The word from which the name sugar originated is , probably , " grain " , " sarkar " , in Sanskrit .
In the eastern part of India , sugar was called " shekar " , while the Arab people knew it as " al zucar " , which was transformed into the Spanish " azucar " , and from there , to " açúcar " , in Portuguese .
In France , sugar is called " sucre " and , in Germany , " zucker " , and from there into English " sugar " .

By 610 Prophet Muhammad received his first revelation from God , originating a new monotheistic religion .
Under this new faith Prophet Muhammad united most of the Arabic Peninsula , especially after the conquest of his home city , Mecca .
From there the Arabs would swiftly gain control of the Middle East and its surroundings , consolidating and spreading the Muslim faith .
During the first half of the VII century , the Umayyad Caliphate ( an almost informal political setting that aroused from Prophet Muhammad ’s conquests ) spread to Syria in the north , Egypt in the east and Persia in the west .
In Persia the Arabs found the sugar cane , and understanding its potential , not only brought its culture to the west but also created the first large scale sugar trade [ P05 ] .
In 640 the culture had already reached the Mediterranean environment ; it would then enter North Africa were the superior Egyptian chemistry would propel its fast spreading [ P06 ] .
The trade brings sugar to Europe for the Caliphate profit ; sugar cane becomes itself a fuel of the Caliphate expansion .
In 711 the Arab lords conquered Gibraltar , finally entering Europe , bringing with them , among other novelties and innovations , the sugar cane culture .
The first plantations in the continent were in what is now the Algarve and Andalucía circa 750 , from there expanding to other parts of Europe [ P07 ] .

In Europe the plant showed again its appetence for the humid islander environment .
Especially in Sicily , were it arrived in 950 , and in Crete , sugar cane was a successful culture [ P08 ] .
By the XIV century the plant had spread entirely through out the European Mediterranean , now testing the forties .
But production was insufficient and sugar was still imported from the East , especially India .
Venice hold the refining monopoly , and the trade routs from India were mostly controlled by the successors of the Caliphate .
At the same time the Crusades are coming to an unsuccessful end , with the Ottoman Empire rising and moving west .
Sugar can cost the equivalent of today ’s 100 $ per kilogram in Europe ; the scene is set for the next step in expansion .
Atlantic Expansion

At beginning of the XV century Christian Europe is importing commodities ( sugar , pepper , cinnamon , etc ) from the Far East trough land routes controlled by the Muslim lords ; prices are very high , performing a significant wealth transfer from Europe to the Middle East and North Africa .
At the westernmost tip of the continent , Portugal is one of the most helpless states , and is the first to try to change the situation .
The strategy is set towards the sea , with the prospect of finding a maritime route to India , overriding the land routes controlled by the Arab lords .
At this time the Atlantic was almost completely unknown to the Europeans , apart from the African coast down to the Bojador cape , for high sea faring was outside their knowledge .
In this setting Prince Henry assembles a research center in Algarve , drawing together mathematicians , cartographers , engineers , etc , that would create the technology needed to face the open Atlantic .
The Atlantic exploration happens relatively fast ; based on maritime trade , the further it goes the larger the profits it generates , sponsoring further exploration .
The maritime route to India was finally established in 1498 ; at the time there was n’t much left to explore in the Atlantic .
As a way to make the newfound inhabited land profitable , Prince Henry sent for sugar cane specialists from Sicily to start its culture in Madeira in 1425 [ P09 ] .
At this time the maritime expansion was mainly sponsored by precious metals brought from Africa ’s coasts , but during the later part of the XV century sugar cane started to have a leading role .
Under King John
II ’s reign the plant would be brought to all inhabited archipelagos found by the Portuguese : Canary Islands in 1480 ( later offered to the Spanish Crown ) , Cape Verde in 1490 and from there to São Tomé [ P10 ] .
In 1493 Columbus brought the first sugar seedlings to the Caribbean , planted in the island of Hispaniola [ P11 ] , but trade from the West Indies would only begin some decades later .
In less than a century sugar cane was back to the Equator .
The Sugar Boom
Trade from the New World would start only in the XIV century with the building of the first sugar mill in Hispaniola in 1516 .
The culture would then start to spread throughout the Caribbean , by the 1530s it had been introduced to Cuba , Mexico , Colombia , Venezuela , Puerto Rico and Peru .
But the big industry explosion would happen in Brasil .
Following a Crown decree promoting the expansion of sugar trade , an expedition led by Martim Afonso de Sousa builds the first sugar mill in Brasil , near what is now São Paulo [ P12 ] .
The culture would head north from there , towards warmer climate arriving at Pernambuco - sugar land .
Circa 1550 a German traveler by the name of Hans Staden embarked on an expedition to the River Plate .
After some nautical incidents the explorers found themselves stuck at São Marco , from where Staden is captured by a party of Tupinamba Indians .
In spite of several efforts from the Portuguese to negotiate his release , Staden is kept captive for more than two years before managing to escape .
He returns to Germany on a French ship and writes a book on his experience ( “ Among the Wild Tribes of Eastern Brasil ” ) .
This book is a remarkable document of life in the New World at the epoch ; in it Staden reports that by 1540 , from Pernambuco to Surinam there were already 2000 sugar mills operating , and 800 more in the island of Santa Catarina . [ P13 ] .

Such number of mills included thousands of iron cast machinery components : gears , levers , axles , etc .
Demand for such parts fueled an explosion in mold making and iron casting in Europe , with many craftsmen and blacksmiths specializing in this type of machinery .
The sugar cane trade was the great rehearsal for the Industrial Revolution .
The Dutch expansion
In 1580 Portugal broke under the weight of Inquisition , which disbanded the human capital that made the expansion possible .
With a teenage king missing in action in Africa , the closer successor left was King Philip of Spain .
Both countries merged under King Philip ’s rule creating an immense empire .
At the time Spain was at war with the Dutch ; it was in Holland and Flanders that most refineries existed and it was here that most of the sugar from Brasil was refined .
The Dutch assuming control of most of the production in the Northeast coast of Brasil , up to the mid of the XVII century when Portugal and Spain parted ways .
They also expanded the sugar cane culture in the Caribbean , starting in Barbados and going all the way north trough the smaller isles up to the Virgin Islands [ P14 ] .
The Dutch expansion was possible for in their turn they proceeded with the technological progress .
They developed new larger ships more suitable for the trade and adopted the Mercator cartographic projection , which produced charts where for the first time a maritime route with constant compass would be a straight line .

In parallel with the Dutch the Spanish also stepped up production in the Caribbean , especially in its bigger island , Cuba .
In order to reduce their dependence on imported sugar , the French and the British would also set in for their share , first through piracy then by also settling .
The British would strive in Jamaica , the French in Saint - Domingue .
These were the wild days in the Caribbean .

The Sugar Triangle
[...] people all coloured of the same night , working vividly , and moaning all at the same time without moment of truce , nor rest ; he who sees the machine and the confuse and strident apparatus of that Babylon , can not doubt , even having seen Etnas and Vesuviuses , that such is a resemblance of Hell .
Father António Vieira , 1633 .

Sugar cane cutting was ( and still is ) a highly demanding hand labour task .
The European settlers could n’t possibly provide the numbers needed for that , they had to recur to slavery .
At first they tried to enslave the indigenous folk , which were still close to the Stone Age , but such would rapidly fall short of their needs .
In the beginning the Indians vastly outnumbered the settlers , which would be happy with a peaceful co-existence , avoiding conflicts .
Later , the alien diseases brought from Europe by the settlers would decimate the indigenous populations .
The Europeans resorted to slaves brought from Africa .
Strong built folk , resistant both to the diseases brought from Europe and local ones like malaria ; they were sacrificed to make the sugar boom possible in the West Indies .
The final pillar of the Sugar Industry was completed , creating what would become known as the Sugar Triangle .
This name refers to the route that traders would make to bring sugar to Europe .
Ships would sail out from the old continent bound to the African shores .
There they would buy all the slaves they could fit in the under deck without choking .
Slaves stacked they would sail towards Brasil or the Caribbean in a swift voyage .
At sugar land they ’d unload the slaves that had survived the trip , and would load up with raw sugar .
The next step would be the return to Europe ; once there the sugar would be unloaded for the final refinement and the ship would be refitted for another triangular commission [ P15 ] .

The Sugar Triangle was the stage of the largest migration phenomenon at the global scale .
Millions of Africans were thus forced to abandon their homeland just to die in a gruesome voyage to the New World or live for the rest of their lives as cane cutters .
In the XIX century , after the decline of the sugar cane industry ( see below ) the Sugar Triangle would be replaced by the Cotton Triangle that would prolong the migration up the slavery abolishment .
Facing the limits
Someone has already quite rightly said that the sugar cane culture is processed in an autophagic regime : the cane devours everything around it , engulfing more and more land , dissolving the topsoil , annihilating the smaller helpless cultures and the human capital itself , from which the culture drains all life .
Such is the pure truth …
Josué de Castro , Geografia da Fome , Rio de Janeiro , 1952 .

There was a problem with sugar cane , it was a very demanding culture , and to make it worse the milling process was very energy intensive .
The regime is simple : to start with the forest is chopped down or burnt to make way for the cane , and then the wood is burned in the mills to crystallize the cane juice into sugar .
By the XVIII century in Brasil every kilogram of sugar required 15 kilograms of wood .
The cane prefers the warmer and humid climates ; this is why most of the text so far has been focusing on islands .
It is in the islands that the destructive power of the cane is felt more rapidly .
Madeira ( the Portuguese word for wood ) was deforested in a century , also in the Canary Islands resource limits were faced still in the XVI century .
Apart from Cuba all the Caribbean islands would face severe resource constraints in the XVII century ; by 1700 sugar had become once more a highly expensive commodity .
In the main land the extensive Atlantic forest would disguise these limits .
This is why the cane would endure in Brasil were both the climate and the wood supply were favourable .
Still , in 1990 the Brasilian Atlantic forest was 8 % of what the Portuguese explorers found at the end of the XV century .

Back to the Caribbean
Steam powered Sugar Mill .

This constrained environment provided for some important developments .
The milling is a process where the cane juice is boiled into progressively heavier molecules , typically in three or four furnaces .
In 1650 it was invented in Jamaica the Jamaican Train , a process that would allow the several furnaces to be heated with a single fire [ P16 ] .
The wood requirements drop sharply , and this new process starts to spread through out the Caribbean .
By the middle of the XVIII century with high competition between the colonial powers and the spread of the refineries in Europe , the price of sugar drops until it becomes a basic food commodity .
With the industry in decline in Brasil ( where gold had become a major source of wealth ) the Caribbean emerges as the largest producer in the world ; Guadaloupe , Barbados , Saint - Domingue , Jamaica , had turn their economies almost entirely to the cane culture .
In this century Britain succeeds the Dutch as the major maritime power , and is successful in eradicating piracy from the Caribbean .
In 1751 sugar cane is introduced in Louisiana .
The final stage of developments on the milling process unfolds relieving further the burden on the forest .
The cane bagasse is used as a fuel , partially substituting lumber , animal manure is used to fertilize the soil , and in the second half of the XVIII century the steam powered mills starts to propagate .
It is in Louisiana that an important invention takes place , the vacuum boiler , created by Norbert Rillieux in the 1820s [ P17 ] .
The milling process becomes much more efficient , evolving towards full steam - powered mechanization , reducing the hand labour intensity .

By the turn of the XIX century the Napoleonic wars had already grown into a major conflict , stalemate unfolded with Britain maintaining naval supremacy and Napoleon controlling most of continental Europe .
The raw sugar can not reach the refineries in the continent , and in 1813 Napoleon simply bans sugar imports [ P18 ] .
It is this setting that the work of German researchers Andreas Marggraf and Franz Archard , who found sucrose in beet roots and built a sugar beet mill in previous decades , is put to service .
Fueled by the industrial revolution the sugar beet industry develops rapidly creating a serious competitor to the cane industry ; raw sugar does n’t have to travel from the New World to the refineries and the hand labour cost is lower .
The abolishment of slavery that put an end to the endless flow of man power , and the discovery of saccharin , an artificial sweetener , were in their turn two important elements in the decline of cane culture .
At the start of the XX century most territories in the Caribbean had become independent from the colonial powers , a fact not disconnected with the decline of the sugar trade .
Resurrection
Throughout the XX century many of the countries where sugar was traded in the colonial times kept producing , taking advantage of low wages , but sugar was by no means the main economic activity it was in the past .
Since being in a favourable environment the cane also kept growing wildly in the Caribbean and Basil .
In the 1970s the cane culture would come back to life as an answer to the oil crisis lived at the time .
In 1975 the brasilian government , with help of the World Bank , set on a programme to reduce the country ’s reliance on foreign oil .
Called Pro-Álcool , the programme staged a new expansion of the cane culture and a boom in distillery construction [ P19 ] .
Ethanol was first used as a fuel additive with 20 % and 22 % blends with regular gasoline .
From 1980 onwards it started to be used as a pure fuel on adapted cars .
These cars did n’t function properly and the automotive industry responded by shifting heavily to pure ethanol powered vehicles .
In 1984 almost 95 % of the cars produced in Brasil were ethanol powered .

In 1985 the oil price dropped and regular gasoline become affordable once again .
At the same time the country faced appalling internal inflation and subsidies to the cane industry were eased .
By the late 1980s an ethanol supply crisis unfolded .
In the 1990s , with the oil industry growing , the programme came near to halt ; less than 1 % of the cars produced then were ethanol powered .
Now in the dawn of the XXI century , Brasil is one of the few countries on Earth with prospects of growing its oil production , being on the brink of becoming a net oil exporter .
Still , the fossil fuel supply constraints elsewhere are breathing new life to the cane industry , whose history is far from over .

Lessons from History
Among the things to learn from sugar cane ’s history , the most positive one is probably its relative success outside the Tropics .
On a negative side is its destructive power and non sustainability when cultivated intensively ; although the industrial revolution would bring some ease to that .
The plant promises a high energy return on investment , and if successful at higher latitudes can be an important element of world energy stability .
But care must be taken , neither Europe nor North America offer the same kind of environment that allows natural cane growth in Brasil , the Caribbean or Indonesia .
At least irrigation is a factor reducing energy returns , to be considered at higher latitudes .
One other aspect not to oversee is the cane culture high reliance on hand labour .
Despite advances in mechanization , the cane harvest is still widely made by hand , hence its survival in low wage countries .
If sugar cane is set to come back to wealthier nations , this issue has to be addressed .
The End
The sugar cane industry that formed in the XVI century was , by its geographic , economic and social size , something unprecedented , which would only find parallel in the Whaling and Coal industries of the XIX century .
While during its migration from the Pacific to the Indic and the Mediterranean sugar cane kept a background role , in its migration to the Atlantic sugar cane assumed the dominant role in economy and society .
Sugar cane triggered an unprecedented environmental disruption and provoked the largest migratory phenomenon at the global scale , with the enslaving of millions of Africans .
For these reasons sugar cane can be regarded as one of the most important cultures in our Civilization .

So this is what the surge in Baghdad has wrought :
Angry victims of a bombing in Karbala turn on the government By Hussam Ali and Leila Fadel
McClatchy Newspapers KARBALA , Iraq -
Two months into the U.S. - led Baghdad Security Plan , at least 289 people were killed and injured across Iraq on Saturday , including 36 dead in a car bomb attack in the holy Shiite city of Karbala .
The carnage of a crowd teeming with women and children set off an angry mob of hundreds against the governor and police .
... Bodies littered the street and body parts were found as far as 160 yards from the site of the explosion .
Three buses of passengers were charred and storefronts lay in shambles .
... As police and ambulances approached to carry away victims , angry residents shot at them , witnesses said .
The police responded , firing bullets into the air to dissipate the angry crowd .
As the bullets rained down , a child and elderly man were killed , witnesses said .
A man screamed , " They added new victims and do n't care about our losses .
It 's enough . "
Damn right , it ’s enough .
It ’s way , way , way beyond enough .
And why is this happening now ?
Aqeel al - Khazaali , the governor of Karbala , blamed the Baghdad Security Plan for the attack inside the relatively safe southern city .
Karbala is about 50 miles south of Baghdad .
" The Baghdad crackdown and the tribes in Ramadi are forcing the terrorists to leave their cities , " he said .
" Now Karbala is under fire from terrorists , and the central government has to take the necessary steps to help us to protect the holy city . "
But things in Baghdad itself are not all chocolate and flowers either :
In Baghdad , the city was alive with mortar rounds , assassinations , gunfights and roadside bombs .
At least 20 corpses , telling of sectarian violence , were reported .
In the central city a car bomb detonated near Jadriyah bridge , a main thoroughfare , killing 8 and wounding 11 .
Also Saturday the Islamic State of Iraq , a Sunni insurgent umbrella group dominated by al - Qaida , claimed it had kidnapped 20 Ministry of Interior employees in northeast Baghdad .
A picture was posted with uniformed men in blindfolds .
There ’s more – regrettably much more , in this coverage from McClatchy – about standoffs between al - Sadr ’s group and the Iraqi Army , and about how elected Iraqi legislators are coming to question the parliament ’s legitimacy after last week ’s bombing of its headquarters in the Green Zone , and how parents are grieving and screaming and trying to find their children ’s body parts in the streets .
But there ’s nothing much to add beyond that Iraqi ’s stunned comment :
It ’s enough .
The World of Smartboards , Sympodiums is about to change
The Pentagon said Monday that to sustain the current buildup of troops in Baghdad through the summer , two Army units have been ordered to return to Iraq without the normal yearlong stay at their home bases .
The curtailed home stay for the two units , a combat brigade of about 3,500 soldiers and a division headquarters of 1,000 , will mark the second time the Pentagon has been forced to send major Army units to Iraq without a yearlong respite as part of the troop increase ordered in January by President Bush .
Earlier this year , an Army combat brigade was rushed into Iraq after only 10 1/2 months in the U.S. , a fact not previously disclosed by the Pentagon .
Until this year ’s troop increase , no Army brigade had ever had less than a year at home between deployments to Iraq , Pentagon officials say .
Gen . Peter J. Schoomaker , the Army ’s chief of staff , has fought to ensure that combat brigades get their full 12 months at home for training and re-equipping .
A senior Army official said the fact that the service has been forced to break such “ dwell time ” guidelines in spite of those efforts is a measure of how the Iraq buildup has stressed the service .
Officials have cautioned that other units may face such problems if the buildup is extended into next year .

“ Obviously , right now , the Army is stretched , ” said the senior official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss internal evaluations of Army readiness .
Pentagon officials would not comment on why they decided on early deployments rather than extending the tours of units already in Iraq , a common practice earlier in the war .
But one of the brigades that is expected to be replaced by the new troops is a Minnesota National Guard brigade that has already had its tour extended four months .
Air Force Gen. Lance L. Smith , head of the Pentagon ’s Joint Forces Command , told a group of military writers last week that as many as three combat brigades were likely to see their home stays shortened if the buildup was extended into next year .
Now that two brigades have confronted shortened dwell time before any decision on the duration of the surge , however , that number could go higher .
The Army also said Monday that the 2nd Brigade Combat Team of the 82nd Airborne Division , the first unit sent to Baghdad as part of the troop increase , would remain in Iraq for a full year , longer than the nine months it originally expected .
And the headquarters of the 25th Infantry Division , originally due to return to its Hawaiian base in July after a year in Iraq , is to stay until September .

The decisions announced Monday affect home stays for the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 10th Mountain Division , based at Ft. Drum , N.Y. , which will be home for 10 1 / 2 months before returning to Iraq in June , and the headquarters of the 4th Infantry Division , based at Ft. Hood , Texas , which will be returning to Iraq in August after less than 10 months at home .
This year , Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates changed Pentagon policy to make it easier for the military to call up National Guard brigades for second tours of duty in Iraq , a move widely viewed as an effort to take pressure off active - duty units facing short home stays .
Guard units were not called up as part of the latest troop assignments , but Pentagon officials said Guard brigades could be tapped for Iraq duty in the fall to keep the buildup going through the end of the year .
“ Stay tuned , ” Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said when asked whether Guard brigades would be headed back to Iraq soon .

Last month , the Pentagon called up 800 California National Guard soldiers to support the buildup , although they have yet to receive any formal orders to deploy to Iraq .

Why you do n't get published .
This past March , the Department of Homeland Security posted its Notice of Proposed Rule - Making ( NPRM ) for the implementation of the Real ID Act of 2005 .
The NPRM has been open to the public for comments , but that comments period is slated to end on May 8 .
If you 're concerned about the implications of a national ID card and a national database with tons of your sensitive data in it , and you 'd like to join the growing revolt against the Act by an ideologically diverse array of states and citizens ' groups , then you can find instructions and aids for submitting your comments to DHS at the following links :
At least one of the links provides a sample letter that you can modify and submit , but if you really want your voice heard then it's best to write some comments from scratch .
It took me less than five minutes to put together a quick , two - paragraph e-mail to Congress and DHS based on the talking points given at the above links , so I urge you to do the same .
Now , none of the links above make clear what this round of comments is about , and if you 've been following Real ID you may be thinking , " Did n't this already pass ... what 's this about ' stopping ' it ? "
To understand what the NPRM is about , and what you can do to stop Real ID , you need a bit of historical context .
Congress passed the Real ID
Act back in 2005 by burying it so deep within a " must - pass " military appropriations bill that it was n't discovered by privacy advocates until just a few days before the bill came up for a vote .
With such short notice , there was n't time to rally enough opposition to the Act to get it stripped from the bill — and that 's in spite of the fact that it contained an unprecedented and supremely odd " Trojan horse " type A3S2 provision that apparently guts judicial review for a really obscure reason .
The states have pushed back against Real ID , because many of them simply do n't have the money to comply with the Act 's requirements by the proposed deadlines .
Meanwhile , DHS has submitted a proposal for public comment that outlines how the agency plans to actually implement the Act 's legislative requirements .
The rules laid out in this NPRM document are designed to be followed by DHS and the states , in order to bring them into compliance with the Act .
This NPRM is what must be commented on by the public before May 8 .
In writing to oppose the Real ID Act , you 'll be joining a broad - based coalition that includes organizations from across the entire political spectrum ... except for the NRA , an organization of which I used to be a card - carrying member .
( Literally , I had one in my wallet , and in my first year at Harvard Divinity School I used to delight in freaking out the Unitarians with it . )
A look through the NRA 's site turned up a lengthy argument against the proposed inclusion of polar bears on the endangered species list — an issue that has to do with global warming but not guns or " freedom " — but no mention of Real ID anywhere .
Google could n't help either .
This is especially odd , given that Democratic minority at the time of the Act 's passage added language to the bill that would explicitly prevent Real ID 's provisions from being used to create a national database of gun owners , language that was then struck down by the majority in a party line vote .
I 'm totally compelled to point out this bizarre episode at every opportunity , because in the NRA mythology on which I was raised , a national gun database is the first horseman of the black - helicopter apocalypse .
First , they make us all register our guns ... then , they come and take them away .
See this quote by former NRA president Marion Hammer , for instance .
Actually , I did find a 2002 speech in which the NRA 's CEO , Wayne LaPierre , stated his opposition to a national ID card scheme that involves DNA sequences , ATM withdrawal histories , credit history , turnpike use , movie rentals , pharmacy prescriptions , phone records , etc. all encoded into a hologram .
This is super scary — especially the hologram part — but it 's not Real ID .
But all kookiness aside , it 's worth taking a closer look at the national ID and citizen database objections to Real ID , and at DHS ' attempts to evade criticism on this front .
DHS either does n't understand databases , or they think that we do n't
One of the most important criticisms of Real ID is that it will create a national ID card that 's backed by a national citizen database containing all sorts of info that identity thieves , some of whom may even manage to score a job at a DMV , would love to get their hands on .
But DHS explicitly denies that Real ID will be either a national ID card or that it will result in " a national database of driver information . "
Indeed , this denial is repeated multiple times in the NPRM document .
I want to zero in specifically on the " national database " portion of the problem , because DHS 's insistence that Real ID does n't create a national database hinges on a somewhat lawyerly definition of the term " database . "
In reading through the NPRM , especially section II.E.6 and following , it becomes clear that DHS has bent over backwards to avoid the creation of a single , federally maintained database of DMV data , while still providing all of the functionality of such a database ( with none of the potential security advantages that you 'd get from centralization ) .
In lieu of such a centralized , federally maintained database , they 've created a set of carefully crafted rules and standards that would have the effect of creating a national DMV database , but this database will be distributed , and it will be built and maintained by the states .
Different states will have different levels of security for who can access this distributed database , with DMV personnel screening requirements and actual technological implementations differing from state to state .
What do I mean by a " distributed database " ?
First , all the state DMV databases , which are implemented variously , will be linked together , so that they can talk both to each other and to the federal databases to which they already have some amount of access .
Then , DHS will support the development of a " federated query service " that each state DMV can use to pull data from all state DMVs and federal databases with a single query .
Now , notice the sleight of hand here : DHS wo n't be developing this federated query service itself — that 's the states ' job .
DHS also will not operate this service , nor will the agency require that states use it .
The states run the service in their DMVs , and one state can still query another state 's database directly , if it chooses .
The end result of the Real ID Act 's database connectivity requirements and the federated query service is that someone sitting in a DMV can use a single query to pull a citizen 's data from all state DMVs and federal databases .
This is functionally a national citizen database , even if citizens ' data is physically spread out over multiple records in multiple databases at multiple sites with multiple levels of access control , logging , and oversight .
So like I said above : all of the functionality of a centralized database , but with none of the attendant security , oversight , and auditing benefits of a single , locked - down implementation .
Ultimately , DHS 's objection that Real ID does not create a " national database " is only sustainable using a narrow definition of " database . "
But if by " database " you mean , " I can write one query to pull data from multiple records , " then the Act and DHS 's proposed interpretation of it will indeed create a " national database . "
With the NPRM , DHS has taken the already terrible idea of a national citizen database , and then made it infinitely worse in the name of appeasing privacy advocates .
People who use the Internet to read the news have a greater attention span than print readers , according to a U.S. study that refutes the idea that Web surfers jump around and do n't read much .
The EyeTrack07 survey by the Poynter Institute , a Florida - based journalism school , found online readers read 77 percent of what they chose to read while broadsheet newspaper readers read an average of 62 percent , and tabloid readers about 57 percent .
Sara Quinn , director of the Poynter EyeTrack07 project , said this was the first large public study internationally to compare the differences between how people read the news online and in newspapers .
She said they were surprised to find that such a large percentage of story text was read online as this exploded the myth that Web readers had a shorter attention span .
" Nearly two - thirds of online readers , once they chose a particular item to read , read all of text , " Quinn told Reuters on Thursday at the American Society of Newspaper Editors ' annual conference where the study was released .
" That speaks to the power of long - form journalism . "
The study also found that people paid more attention to items written in a question and answer format or as lists , and preferred documentary news photographs to staged or studio pictures .
The study involved testing nearly 600 readers in four U.S. markets - readers of the Rocky Mountain News in Denver , The St. Petersburg Times in Florida , the Star Tribune of Minneapolis , and the Philadelphia Daily News .
The test subjects , who were 49 percent women and 51 percent men aged between 18 and 60 , were asked to read that day 's edition in either print or online over 30 publication days .
Two small cameras were mounted above the subject 's right eye to monitor what they were reading .
They were allowed to read whatever they liked .
The study found about 75 percent of print readers were methodical compared to half of online readers .
Methodical readers tend to read from top to bottom without much scanning around the page , read in a two - page view when reading in print , and re-read some material .
But whether online readers were methodical or scanners , they read about the same volume of story text .
Quinn said a prototype test also found that people answered more questions about a news item correctly if the information had been presented in an alternative manner rather than traditional narrative .
This could have been a question and answer format , a timeline , short sidebar or a list .
" Subjects paid an average of 15 percent more attention to alternative story forms than to regular story text in print .
In broadsheet , this figure rose to 30 percent , " the study said .
Large headlines and photos in print were looked at first but online readers went for navigation bars and teasers .
Quinn said more findings from the study would be released at the Poynter conference in April .

About four years ago I sent a request to the State of Vermont asking for color imagery of downtown Montpelier .
At that time , Vermont was one of the last states that I had not made a map of and I was eager to complete the State Capitol project .
To my surprise , they sent me a DVD of the imagery around Montpelier , but sadly the DVD - Rom was a bad burn , and I was never able to extract the imagery and this map , and the entire project , was put on hold .
According to the meta - data supplied with the imagery , it appears that this aerial photography was taken by Aero - Metric , Inc. on April 24th , 2009 and released to the public in October of 2009 .
This means I ’m over a year late in making this map !

Australia is about to experience its own " dinorush " , beginning with today 's unveiling of a previously undiscovered 25 m - long dinosaur that roamed central - western Queensland about 100 million years ago .
Now on display at the Queensland Museum , the largest dinosaur bones found in Australia came from the remains of two giants uncovered in the Winton Formation , west of Charleville , in 2005 and 2006 .
Nicknamed Cooper and George , the dinosaurs belong to the Titanosaur family .

There ’s an episode of “ I Dream of Jeannie ” from years ago when Jeannie blinks into existence tomorrow ’s newspaper .
Everyone is amazed and riveted by the implications of knowing tomorrow ’s headlines today .
Many possibilities here !
In the case of the war on terror , we could have known tomorrow ’s headlines five years ago .
In particular , this headline , which is supposed to be shocking and apparently has people in Washington going nuts , seemed positively ho hum : “ Spy Agencies Say Iraq War Worsens Terrorism Threat : U.S. Intelligence Assessment Is Said to Find a Rise in Global Islamic Radicalism . ”
Just so that we are clear on this , we should be reminded that the stated policy of the Bush administration , just before bombing Iraq ’s cities and overthrowing its Sunni government , was to bring freedom , democracy , and pluralistic happiness to the country .
Five years later , the puppet government in Baghdad is still in a bunker , tanks patrol streets , there are curfews and speech controls , major parts of the country have effectively seceded , the water is dirty and disease ridden , electricity is still off , migration out increases exponentially , tribal war is routine , American soldiers ’ heads are blown off if they so much as poke them out of the foxhole , and religious and ethnic hatreds grow .
We keep hearing that Iraq is “ on the brink ” of civil war , but how will we know when we move from brink to reality ?
The Sunnis hate the ruling Shiites , the Kurds hate them both , and everyone hates the Christians and Jews .
It ’s all about a struggle for power : who gets to twist the thumbscrews , and whose thumbs are screwed .
If this is the brink , the reality will be unbearable .
Can you imagine that anyone in the US believed that the answer to these problems was to put George Bush in charge ?
But it was indeed Bush ’s idea that he would quell Islamic radicalism by smashing the world that the relative moderates had created , and acting precisely as the fundamentalists always claimed he would act .
It ’s as if the fundies themselves had written the script , and George played the leading role in a play they were directing .
Hence , even by the Bush administration ’s own standards , the war on terror has increased the problem rather than diminished it .
Students of government can hardly be surprised that a government program ends up creating the very opposite of what it purported to accomplish .
Welfare increases poverty , the minimum wage boosts unemployment , prohibition promotes the banned behavior , and , just as we would expect once we understand the logic , the war on terror has created and encouraged the rise of more terrorism and the ideology that backs it .
We hardly need a National Intelligence Estimate to demonstrate it to us .
What this intelligence estimate really shows is that the reality has become too obvious for even the government to deny .
The report cites gobs of secret data that ca n’t be divulged to the public .
Oh sure .
Anyone with a modicum of knowledge of the effects of all government policy , along with a bit of understanding of human nature , would have predicted this very thing .
After all , Iraq was never a hotbed of terror .
The Bush administration just pretended that it was because Bush wanted to get Saddam .
It was n’t even a campaign theme .
But it was first on the agenda when he came into office .
9 -11 helped by whipping up the public for war , even though there was no relationship between 9 - 11 and Iraq .
But it does appear that Bush got more than he bargained for .
He ca n’t win this war , no matter how many Americans and Iraqis he sends to their deaths .
But who precisely benefits in the end ?
Fundamentalists , to be sure , but also the federal government , which gets more power and control .
There is also a critical financial factor .
The tens of billions that have been shoveled out by the public sector to the private sector in this war have gone mainly to Bush - connected corporations and elites .
They are the ones who have benefited from the “ privatization ” of the war , in the name of efficiency .
But what is really puzzling here is the intellectual failure of the conservatives and libertarians who have cheered for this war from the beginning .
Why do these people , who otherwise understand the failure of government in all aspects of domestic politics , believe that the government has a Midas touch in dealing with foreign affairs ?
Here we have a serious and dramatic example of cognitive dissonance .
It ’s as if a person who is terrified of drinking poison in the morning mistakes it for an aperitif in the evening .
What a poor example these people set for the left !
If conservatives and libertarians are not willing to apply their anti-government logic consistently against war , how can they be surprised that the left is not willing to apply its antiwar logic domestically ?
Combine the two schools of inconsistency and you have the makings of the ever - growing welfare - warfare state .
So you want to know the future ?
It ’s not as hard as it seems .
Expect every government program to fail to achieve its stated aims — domestic and foreign — and you will hit the mark every time .

The Murder of Amy Boyer by Robert Douglas Senate Hearings April 13 , 2005
Far too often as we grapple with the issue of balancing the privacy of Americans with the necessary and legitimate uses of Americans ’ personal information the debate centers on discussions of “ data ” , but not the lives behind the “ data ” .
Amy Boyer
In order to illustrate what I ’ve learned over the course of more than twenty years using and investigating the good and harm of database information , I ’d like to begin by focusing on one life behind one set of data .
The untimely and violent end to that life encapsulates all the issues that surround securing personal information while balancing privacy with legitimate uses of information .
Further , investigating this one act of violence led me to a more complete understanding of how personal information is being used and abused in the United States today .
This case also demonstrates that the problem is much larger than the recent ChoicePoint breach and other instances that have recently been in the headlines .
The problems of securing personal information and balancing privacy with legitimate use are intertwined and impact every business and government sector .
On a quiet fall afternoon in October of 1999 Amy Boyer , a young Nashua , New Hampshire woman , was leaving work with two co-workers .
The small group was discussing plans for that weekend as they walked to their cars parked on a side street less than a block from the office .
Liam Youens
As Amy said good - bye and closed her door , a car driven by Liam Youens sped up the street and stopped driver ’s door to driver ’s door with Amy ’s car .
Youens yelled out Amy ’s name as he fired 11 bullets into the head and upper body of his unsuspecting 20 year - old victim .
Youens then fired one last shot into his head , instantly killing himself as Amy lay just feet away mortally wounded .
Liam Youens was a demented young man .
He glorified the Columbine killers and toyed with the idea of doing the same at Nashua High School .
He openly planned Amy ’s murder and the intended murder of others for more than a year .
The reason we know so much about Youens is that he documented his plans to murder Amy on a web site he created to publish his sick desires .
But that web site contained far more than just the perversity of Liam Youens .
It contained the starting point for a trail of evidence that proves how personal information of all Americans stored with good intent in myriad databases across this country can be easily obtained and used for incalculable harm .
The trail that began on a quiet Nashua street led to the shadowy world where a small but persistent number of illegitimate information brokers and private investigators , in addition to a growing number of identity thieves and other criminals , access databases holding our most important personal information and use that data for criminal purposes .
In Amy ’s murder the evidence showed that Youens decided to ambush Amy as she left work .
But Youens had a problem .
He did n’t know where Amy worked .
So he started using information brokers and private investigators that run Internet based operations that specialize in obtaining and selling personal information on Americans .
In separate Internet transactions Youens purchased Amy ’s date of birth , social security number , home address , and finally her place of employment .
Youens himself was struck by how easily he was able to purchase Amy ’s personal information while concealing his evil intent .
Here is a small sampling of Youens own words from his web site where he was documenting his step - by - step activities to locate and kill Amy :
From Youen 's Web site
When I finished finding [ street name redacted ] residents in the phone book I thought my best bet was apt .
number 7 so I entered the information .
It was n't 7 , but who cares I got a HIT !
I fell to the floor and let the endorphines fly .
Her address was [ residential address redacted ] she did n't move from home yet , no other information was provided in the Instant Background Check .
I found an internet site to do that , and to my surprize everything else under the Sun .
Most importantly : her current employment .
It 's accually obsene what you can find out about a person on the internet .
I 'm waiting for the results .
[ typos from original -- redaction and emphasis added by R. Douglas ]
The Internet site Youens found to get Amy ’s “ current employment ” and “ everything else under the Sun ” was Docusearch.com .
To obtain Amy ’s “ current employment ” Docusearch provided Amy ’s social security number , date of birth , and home address to Michele Gambino , another private investigator / information broker operating as Gambino Information Services out of New York City .
Gambino has at times described her specialty as “ proper pretext ” , “ subterfuge phone calls ” , or “ informative telephone conversations ” .
Those are nice titles for deceit , fraud , and lying .
In short , Gambino uses lies to deceive people out of personal information .
At the time of Amy ’s murder , Gambino and others who worked as subcontractors for Docusearch specialized in defeating the information security systems of financial institutions ( including many of the nation ’s largest banks and brokerage houses ) , telecommunications companies ( obtaining non-published phone numbers and records of phone numbers dialed from any phone in the country ) , utility companies ( power / cable / gas / water / satellite firms all maintain databases of personal information ) , and unsuspecting private citizens with information about loved ones .
In this case , Gambino conducted a “ pretext ” to obtain Amy ’s work address by impersonating an insurance company representative and falsely stating that she had a refund for Amy .
By having Amy ’s social security number , date of birth , and home address , Gambino was able to sound authoritative as most Americans wrongly believe that only someone with legitimate access and authority would have their social security number and other personal information .
Gambino was able to deceive Amy and / or Amy ’s mother out of Amy ’s work address on the pretext that the work address was needed to process the insurance refund .
The reality is , as far as Docusearch and Gambino were concerned , obtaining Amy ’s work address by fraud was just another transaction to put money in their pockets .
And a lucrative business it is .
With just two employees and a handful of independent contractors like Gambino , Docusearch was grossed over $ 1 Million per year selling and re-selling Americans ’ personal information .
Outrageously , while Docusearch was in the business of accessing and stealing Americans ’ personal information and continues to this day to brag about how they can find anything about anybody , neither Gambino nor Docusearch took any constructive steps to determine who Youens was , much less why he needed the employment address of Amy .
Had Docusearch or Gambino simply typed
Amy ’s name into any free search engine they would have found Youens ’ web site documenting his intent to kill Amy .
Docusearch was on notice that their Internet site was being used by potential stalkers with intent to do harm .
Just days before Gambino used a “ pretext ” to obtain Amy ’s work address , Docusearch learned that another “ client ” was attempting to obtain an address on a young woman in Texas for potential harm .
In the Texas case , Docusearch was once again using a pretext to learn the address of the young woman from the woman ’s mother .
Fortunately , the mother was savvy enough to realize they were trying to deceive her out of her daughter ’s address and told the Docusearch “ investigator ” that her daughter had a restraining order against Docusearch ’s client .
While Docusearch , Gambino , and others in the information brokerage and investigative fields often argue that they should n’t be held responsible for the unforeseen consequences of selling “ data ” , those defenses ring hollow .
Not only is there ample evidence in the files of Docusearch and Gambino of potential harm caused by the personal information they are selling on demand , the information brokerage / private investigative industries have been aware since at least the early 1980s of criminals using their services to carry out violent and non-violent crimes .

CEO , PrivacyToday.com United State Senate Committee on the Judiciary Hearing on Securing Electronic Personal Data : Striking a Balance Between Privacy and Commercial and Governmental Use April 13 , 2005
A Pakistani national who U.S. officials believe scouted potential American targets for Al Qaeda attacks has told a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , that he had no ties to the terrorist group and insisted he was tortured by American interrogators after being captured by Pakistani authorities in 2003 .
U.S. officials contend that Majid Khan -- one of 14 “ high - value ” detainees who was moved to Guantanamo from a secret CIA prison in September -- was sent by Al Qaeda mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to research plots to blow up gas stations or to poison reservoirs in the U.S .
Khan , who is in his mid-20s , lived in the Baltimore area after his family moved there in 1996 .
U.S. officials say Mohammed selected him in part because of his English language skills and “ extensive knowledge ” of the U.S .
But during a hearing at Guantanamo last month , Khan said he had never worked for Al Qaeda , and accused U.S. authorities of either making up evidence against him or coercing witnesses to make false claims .

“ After watching too much Fox News , I learned that to become Al Qaeda , a person needs to go to Afghanistan for training , and take an oath in front of Osama bin Laden for their cause , ” Khan told the three - officer tribunal , according to a transcript released Tuesday by the Pentagon .
“ I ’ve never been to Afghanistan or met UBL ; to prove it , I can take a lie detector test . ”
The tribunals are used by military authorities to formally determine whether detainees are enemy combatants who can be held indefinitely .
Khan is not the first of the high - value detainees to deny Al Qaeda membership or to accuse the U.S. of using torture .
But the transcript of Khan ’s hearing provides some of the most detailed testimony yet about the detainees ’ lives at Guantanamo , and painstakingly describes his allegations of mistreatment by U.S. and Pakistani authorities in the months after his capture in Karachi .
According to a statement read by Khan ’s personal representative , an Air Force major whose name was withheld , Khan twice has tried to kill himself by chewing his arteries , and on two occasions has had his beard forcibly shaved , a move he claimed was intended to humiliate him , since long beards are a sign of piety in Islam .

“ They just came in with eight guards and took me to main rec [ the main recreation area ] and forcibly shaved my beard to humiliate me and offend my religion , ” Khan said in the statement .
“ While they were shaving my beard , [ a female psychiatric official ] was watching the whole thing . ”
Khan ’s list of alleged abuses at the hands of U.S. authorities ranges from the serious , such as forcible feedings during a hunger strike , to the more mundane , like complaints that detainees must use “ cheap - branded , unscented deodorant soap ” to wash .
He also alleged authorities had routinely taken away personal items as a form of punishment .
The Red Cross “ gave me my only daughter pictures , which was born after my abduction , ” Khan said in his written statement .
“ When I took this picture and came back to my camp building , the guard forcibly took it from me .
Then I went crazy and yelled for one hour and they ignored me . ”
Navy Cmdr. Jeffrey D. Gordon , a Pentagon spokesman , denied that Khan was mistreated .
Advertisement
Significant portions of the hearing transcript were blocked out by U.S. censors , including sections in which Khan appears to detail his treatment at the hands of CIA agents before he was sent to Guantanamo .
Khan ’s lawyers said that he had described abuses at the hands of his CIA captors , allegations agency officials have denied .
“ Majid ’s mistreatment is appalling given that the U.S. has neither offered reliable evidence nor brought any charges against him after four years of secret detention , ” said Gitanjali Gutierrez , an attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights , which is representing Khan .
In court filings , the CIA has insisted its interrogation techniques must remain classified because they are sensitive national security secrets .
Khan testified , however , that he thought his treatment at Guantanamo was worse than his detention by the CIA .
Advertisement
“ I swear to God , this place in some sense [ is worse ] than CIA jails , ” Khan said in his statement , according to the transcript .
“ I am being mentally tortured here . ”
The hearing for Khan , formally called a Combatant Status Review Tribunal , has come under legal challenge by attorneys representing detainees .
At a federal appeals court hearing Tuesday in Washington , Bush administration lawyers were grilled by judges considering a case that challenges the tribunal process .
Justice Department lawyers insisted that legislation establishing the tribunals only intended a narrow review by federal appeals courts .

Frank Phiscator Found a Big Fortune in the Klondike .
HORRORS OF ALASKAN WEATHER .
Young Prospector Makes Five Millions of Dollars in Fifteen Months -- Perils of the Trip -- Death Strews the Way With Skeletons and Menaces the Traveler at Every Step -- A Thrilling Story Fresh From the Frozen Northwest .
( Special from the Chicago Times - Herald )
Frank Phiscator of Baroda , Mich. , is back from the Klondike , with his pockets full of nuggets , his purse full of drafts and five times a millionaire , and his experiences in the frozen goldfields form the most thrilling and engrossing story that has yet come down from the Yukon country .
Phiscator became a gold king in 15 months .
He went west with money he earned sawing wood .
He was backed by two strong arms , a brave heart and a constitution as tough as a knot .
He ran a race with death over glaciers , crags and passes , through raging rivers , canyons and rapids , into frozen lakes , killing storms , murderous insects and pests , past starvation , along yawning chasms and under avalanches .
It is his verdict that a man who stands the venture earns all he gets .
He pities the men who have dared to try the trip .
He will be surprised if one - quarter of the crowd that has started gets through alive .
He expects to find the trail from Dyea to Dawson strewn with dead when he goes again in March .
This man ’s story sounds like the tales from books of adventure where fact has no place .
He told it the other night to some men who were preparing to start for the goldfield .
They went home converted .
Built For the Journey .
Phiscator looks like the sort of a man built for this journey .
He is short , stocky , and weighs 280 pounds .
He has a sharp , clear , eye -- an eye of a man that would shoot rather than be shot .
His upper lip curls up in an expression of recklessness .
His hair is jet black .
His neck is short .
He walks with a swagger , shakes hand with a hard tug , takes his bracers straight , wears the big , white hat of the west .
When he talks , he looks squarely at one , and his talk has the ring of rough honesty .
Here is the way he tells his story :
“ It was the Klondike or die a year ago in February .
The chances were ten to one I would never come home , and in view of the cheerful outlook I came to Baroda and Chicago to say goodby to my friends and relatives .
It seemed a big risk , but I had come to the conclusion to risk all I had as well as my life in one last try for a gold mine .
You see , I had had years of roughing it and knew exactly what I wanted to take along .
There did n’t seem to be any other man who wanted to go with me , so one cold day I stood alone on the Seattle wharf , about the only white man bound to Juneau .
“ It is easy to Juneau .
The business of the journey begins right at this point , or it did at least with me .
I picked up a fellow on the boat who was pretty brave , and we joined forces .
There was but little accurate and detailed information about the country , but what little there was I had .
It was all a blind chance , so far as I was concerned , barring the fact that some of the books said there was gold in Alaska for the mere finding .
It did not take long for me to conclude that the books were all wrong .
It looked for about six months that it would be great luck if we got out with only so much as our lives .
“ The trip from Juneau to Dyea was made in a small boat .
The weather was bad .
The waves ran over the little thing , filling it with water almost as fast as all hands could bail it out .
This was a mighty hard hundred miles , but it was a patch of roses in comparison with what came a few days later .
The Start for the Goldfields .
“ Dyea was nothing but a dock and a few Indian huts .
Charles Fifer , a wanderer from Wisconsin , was in the settlement , and when I told him what I was going to do he concluded to take a hand in the game .
My baggage contained enough food for two years , tools which would be needed in case we wanted a boat , and a miner ’s outfit .
There was but little traffic over the mountains at that time , and the Indians were secured at a reasonable rate to do the packing .
We started .
“ It went alright for the first two days , the only danger being in crossing ravines and crevices filled with snow .
The third day , it snowed -- snowed as it snows no other place but in Alaska .
No one can tell or imagine its terribleness .
It is not possible to see your hand at arm ’s length .
There is nothing to do but to get on the lee side of a drift , roll up in blankets and rest on the sleds until the tempest passes .
A tent is whipped into shreds in a minute or sent tearing into the canyons .
A fire was out of the question , and we ate canned meats that were frozen solid .
“ The sides of the mountains and glaciers are so steep that in many places all a stout man can handle is 100 pounds .
Their days in which five miles is a good record .
The way they do is to take part of the supplies about five miles ahead and leave them on the side of the trail while they go back for the rest .
There is not a minute from Dyea to Lake Lindeman when a man is not more likely to die or be killed than he is to get along .
Death on Either Hand .
“ We were caught in another snowstorm in the middle of Crater lake .
The ice was beginning to break up .
It was full of air holes .
There was constant danger that we would plunge into one of these if we went ahead , and as great danger that we would be snowed under if we camped .
It was almost a face to face proposition with death , and no one , not even an Indian , slept during that night .
The next morning the ice began breaking up , and we were constantly dodging big cracks and heaving our sled over heaps .
“ Slowly we worked along , not able to use the compass and trusting only to the general information we had from the Indians that we were on the road to reach the Yukon .
They did not know anything about the gold mines , and all they did know was that in 30 or 40 days , we might possibly get to our destination .
It was no glittering prospect , I can tell you , and just as we were pretty well tuckered out and beginning to wonder if it was worth while we came across the bodies of two men who had died by the wayside .
“ We met some prospectors as we got near Lake Bennett .
They were out of food and were living off the meat they had made of their dogs .
We did not have any more than we would need , but what can you do when men come to you with a plea that they are starving ?
Flour in that country was worth $ 60 for 50 pounds , but it had no price with me when I saw the poor wretches who were thinned down to skeletons .
They were going back .
I never heard whether they got out or not .
Builds a Ship for the Trip .
“ Lake Bennett was where we built our boat .
The Indians brought down the logs , while I sawed them into boards and then built our ship .
A man named Van Wagner joined us here and went through the game .
He was a lawyer in Seattle , but he was made of the right stuff .
Our ship was about 30 feet long and 6 feet wide , and it was put together to stay .
It was n’t very pretty to look at , but I guess it would have held its own against anything this side of a glacier .
“ It was beginning to break up in the spring , and it was much easier sailing than it had been sledding .
This lake is about 30 miles long .
We got over it in three days without accident .
It was , however , only the calm before the storm , since when we drifted into Lake Tagus all the furies on earth and under it were let loose .
It blew so hard I really thought the earth would be blown to pieces .
The snow fell almost a foot at a time , coming down in great sheets and emptying itself into the boat .
We only went three miles in two days and were glad of that .
The snow covered up the holes in the ice , and time and again we sank into the ice water up to our necks .
It was part sledding and part sailing , and every minute liable to be the last .
Miners heading up the Chilkoot Pass circa 1898 .
Some 1,500 steps were carved into the ice .
“ The Tagus Indians have a post at the bottom of this lake , and we stopped a day with them , eating large quantities of frozen caribou , which was sickening in its filth , but nourishing after one got it down .
It seemed as if we were eating twice as much as we did at home .
I tell you I pity the men who have started to the Klondike this year when I read the supplies they have taken .
They will run short before they get half way .
There is no hope for them .
It is likely those who go next spring will find rows of white boards on both sides of the trail .
They are gone .
Frightful Dangers .
“ If there was danger up to this point , then Lewis river is fire and brimstone .
It was like making a trip over Niagara Falls .
In the places where it is smooth , the current is at least seven miles an hour , and in the places where it is rough it runs 40 miles an hour if an inch .
It is filled with big rocks , some of which stick up in sight , others of which stay just below the surface .
“ A scow ahead of us had seven men in it .
All hands were at work with the oars , trying to keep it headed clear .
We were coming along faster than steam launches .
There was a cry from the company in front .
In a minute the boat was cut squarely in two .
A rock had torn through it like an ax .
The men floundered around in the ice water .
Part of them got out .
The others went down .
All the provisions were lost .
“ This was more encouragement .
We ran into the shore and did all we could for the poor wretches , and the last we saw them they were sitting disconsolately on the bank , wondering whether to try to get out or to press on .
I have never heard of them since .
“ There is no man who can figure how many men are lost each year in trying to make this trip .
Bodies are found all along the way .
They are tangled in the driftwood of the eddies or thrown up on the ice .
The miners usually dig a little grave for them .
Many of them do not have any papers on them , and I suppose they go down in the list of the missing .
I predict there will be plenty of missing next spring when navigation opens up and the people begin to come out .
Cold Water That Kills .
“ It seems almost impossible for a man to do anything in the water up there .
It is so cold that it seems to kill in a very few minutes after they get into it .
It makes no difference how expert swimmer the man may be .
I never saw one in any of the rivers who could get out alive .
It took us 56 days to get to the Yukon , and we danced a set with death every day .
The river was about a quarter of a mile wide where we entered it and flows in such a torrent that we had to keep near the shore .
It is lined with rocks and trees that threaten to swamp you , but with the greatest caution we finally pulled up at Forty Mile Post on Forty Mile creek .
“ There was great excitement at Forty Mile when we returned .
A prospector had come in from the Klondike district with the information that he had struck it rich .
There was a wild scramble to Bonanza creek , the location of his discovery .
I started the same night , poling 55 miles up the Yukon before noon the next day .
An hour in time on that trip might have meant a million in money , and it is wonderful how a man will work when an hour ’s extra labor may settle things for him for the balance of his life .
“ We did not want to be handicapped in the race with our provisions , so we left them on the shore of the Klondike with some Indians .
This left us free handed , and we scudded over the mountains , carrying only our mining outfit , about 100 pounds to the man .
We were among the very first to reach Bonanza , staking four claims in the richest part .
They did not seem to pay as much as we expected , and so we concluded to go back and try some place else , holding our claims in case of emergency .
The First Find .
“ We were creeping down from Bonanza when we came to a camping place a little below the mouth of El Dorado .
I think the men with me were ready to throw up their hands .
They were glad to act as cooks on an offer that if they would cut the wood and get the meals I would take a run up to El Dorado and see what I could find .
It was about all I could do to get my 100 pounds on my shoulder and get started .
It was apparently the last chance , as the grub was out , and there was none to buy and no money to buy with .
Panned Out a Quarter .
“ I confess I was feeling a good deal like a man just waking up from a good dream .
It was a hard mile and a rough mile to the creek , and with a discouraged heart the tools were unpacked and the old pick again whacked into the ground .
You ca n’t tell there is gold in the ground by the way it looks , and I do n’t think I expected to find a bit of the yellow metal within 40 miles of where I was working .
There was a little
excitement and watching the first pan , and I tell you I handled that shovel full of Alaska gravel with great care .
The sand gradually ran out , and with close searching I was able to get together about 25 cents ’ worth of yellow dust .
It was a big come down from the stake set when we left Montana , but it was the only stake in sight at the time .
It was that or nothing .
“ It was a joyful night in Phiscator camp that night , if it was not very hot .
The boys were happy even in their hunger , and could hardly wait for morning to get into the field and locate .
My claim was No. 1 , and the others took claims on both sides .
“ We actually danced up the El Dorado about 8 o’clock next morning .
I think each of us could have carried a ton .
We forgot hunger and weakness , with only very poor wages in sight .
It was our only hope , and we made the most of it .
“ I went to work on the spot where I had earned the 25 cents the next day .
It was good I was of a stout and rugged disposition .
I shoveled one scoop into the pan and began to sift .
I got a nugget worth $ 7 .
It was enough to cause heart disease .
The other men did as well , and there was no doubt we had made our pile .
“ We three were the only ones on the creek .
We saw there was no danger that our claims were not clearly marked , and then prospected all the way up the stream , about 30 miles .
We found it good in spots and bad in others -- finding at least 30 locations where one was as good as the other .
Riches Going to Waste .
“ We sat in our tent at night and almost wept that we could not get word back to our friends .
We saw millions , with no one to claim them .
I do not think a claim of the 30 is worth today a cent less than $ 1,000,000 each .
The law allowed us only three -- one each .
“ This much for the way we found it and the time we had in finding it .
This is the way the gold runs after you have a good claim .
“ It is possible to work the claims about 2 Â ½ months a year .
You ca n’t get water any of the balance of the time .
I put in this amount of time on my claim and took out exactly $ 96,072 .
It was done by myself and two men , who earned $ 15 a day as laborers .
“ It is beyond comprehension to imagine the richness of the soil .
During the summer we worked over a space 86 feet long by 35 feet wide to the depth of 4 feet .
The find was $ 49,084 .
“ The biggest pan ever turned out on the claim held $ 52 .
Berry , who has a claim near by , beat this by picking his dirt .
He got $ 595 at one sifting .
The nuggets run from $ 15 to $ 40 .
“ It sounds big and comfortable and pleasant , but I want to tell you that it costs all it is worth .
Horrors of the Climate .
“ There are troubles in the air and on the ground and everywhere .
It gets down to 73 degrees below zero and sticks there for ten days at a stretch , and it is all bosh about the cold being so dry that it is not felt .
It is the coldest cold out of doors .
It will run along at 60 degrees below zero for three weeks or a month at a time .
“ It is so cold that the ground is frozen to a depth of 30 feet .
It does not thaw out in the summer time , even under the redhot sun .
The cold from the frost comes up through the moss , and in the middle of August the cold oozing out of the ground freezes the low places .
“ The winter days are horrors .
The sun gets up at 9:30 in the morning and disappears at 2:30 in the afternoon .
It snows all the time , and there is nothing to do but keep from freezing to death .
“ In the summer , the sun hardly ever gets out of sight .
It is daylight at midnight .
The sun gets to a point which looks about 15 feet above the horizon and then starts back .
It never sets .
“ If one likes this sort of a thing , he can get rich at the Klondike .
“ My advice is , all tenderfeet had better stay home and live than try to get rich in the Klondike .
It has more kinds of death than any place on Earth . ”

Teachers know that students learn in different ways : some by words spoken and written , some by mathematics , and some by visual means .
Statist economists tell illustrated stories about economics .
Words comprise the stories .
Mathematics and graphs provide the illustrations .
With reinforcement via problem sets , exams , and grades , students take away beliefs that externalities are important market failures that pervade economies , that free markets do n’t work , and that government is the remedy .
These beliefs are as false as they are unfortunate .
Those who never study economics formally pick up these ideas secondhand from those who have studied them .
But even those who have studied economics typically have either highly distorted views of the subject ’s contents or only a smattering of conceptual understanding .
I can say this because I ’ve been through this mill myself and I know how hard it is to find real knowledge of economics .
I ’ve taken somewhere around 10 economics courses , most at the graduate level , besides putting in a great deal of self - study which continues up to this moment .
I am the proverbial tortoise .
One of the brighter moments was a three - day workshop on Austrian economics ( in 1984 in St. Louis ) at which Don Armentano and others spoke .
However , I ’d be remiss in not mentioning that the Rochester contingent of ex-Chicago - ites and Virginia - ites ( Don Gordon , Harry Gilman , Walter Oi , Bill Meckling , Mike Jensen , and Jim Ferguson ) plus exposure to Armen Alchian , Milton Friedman , and others helped forge the multi- year path between a year - long 1961 benighted course using Samuelson ’s text to Murray Rothbard and Ludwig von Mises .
While at Rochester in 1973 , I had by then learned enough to buy Human Action , Road to Serfdom , Spencer ’s The Man Versus The State and Molinari ’s Society of Tomorrow at a garage sale .
But my opinion is also based on having for years observed graduate students who have been indoctrinated by economics professors .
They ( the students ) come out of these courses knowing very little and having confused and often wrong ideas .
Having had the opportunity to converse at length with many economics professors ( I am in finance not economics ) , it appears that the professors accurately convey their misunderstandings to their students combined with the usual and often substantial noise factor that all teaching exhibits .
Some of the statist words
The words statist economists use load the dice against free markets .
There is a straw man called a " perfect " market , also known as atomistic competition or perfect competition .
This is easy for economists to set up as an ideal .
In the perfect market , no consumer or business has excessive power .
No one affects price .
Every firm is a price - taker for both inputs and outputs .
What could be more fair ?
The perfect market is deemed to embody fair competition .
In the beautiful ( and non-existent ) world of perfect markets , all firms are equal .
No one competes " unfairly . "
Prices are never above long - run costs and profits are driven to zero .
There is no waste .
The economy is in a Pareto optimal condition .
The perfect market ideal is then easy for economists to knock down because by definition it cannot be attained .
Students readily realize that markets are " imperfect " because it is accessible to everyone ’s observation that the perfect markets description is not the world we live in .
The perfect market is an unreachable heaven , an ideal to strive for .
But this is a heaven that free exchanges and free markets cannot and do not reach , according to the economist ’s bible .
By definition , free markets are imperfect and therefore to be shunned or viewed as problems .
This is how words subvert thought .
What stands in the way ?
There is a litany of obstacles including externalities , product differentiation , advertising , worker exploitation , and businessmen who strive to undermine the market .
The invisible hand is viewed with a wistful longing as a desirable process but one that has little or no basis in reality .
Cannot any dunce see that the conditions of perfect markets are not met ?
And if they are not met , must n’t the result be an economy far from its potential of perfection ?
But wait .
There is hope .
There is salvation .
An impartial government armed with knock - down powers to intervene can overcome this unhappy state of affairs .
It can remedy the " problems " of the free economy , its market failures , its business cycles , its unemployment , and its extremes of wealth and poverty .
Such a government can tax and subsidize , it can insure uncertainties , and it can redistribute income unfairly obtained by the rats who are cornering and monopolizing every market they can .
To the statist economist , perfect markets ( atomistic or perfectly competitive ) exist as desirable impossibilities under freedom .
Only under government intervention and authority can these ideals be approached .
People simply cannot make themselves happy without the government intervening in their exchanges .
Rhetorically , the concept of perfect markets in the hands of statist economists is a device to persuade the novice that government is good .
The graphs
The graphs that economists are fond of tell the perfect market story in a different and visually appealing way .
There is definiteness here , the appearance of truth and clarity , and beauty .
There are lines and angles .
There are labels .
There are identifiable areas that are supposed to convey meanings .
Without the words and hidden assumptions that preface these graphs , they take on a life of their own .
They impress the reader .
They present their own independent reality .
Here is a marginal cost curve and there are long - run average costs .
Here is an Edgeworth box and there are contract curves .
Here are deadweight losses and there is the monopoly price .
Here is an IS curve and there an LM curve .
They intersect .
Voilá !
The economy is in full - employment or perhaps underemployment equilibrium .
Surely this great graphical handiwork of so many brains built over so many years cannot possess flaws that mislead the apt student , can it ?
Each picture looks like something out of a Euclidean geometry book , and we know geometry to be true and a thing of beauty .
The graphs beguile .
They tantalize .
If graphs accurately portray the daily temperature at the top of the Empire State Building and if they accurately show the intersections of a cubic equation with the x-axis , do they not also show that increasing the money supply will increase employment ?
Graphs per se are not bad .
Even Murray Rothbard ’s work uses them , and so does mine .
What is bad is that to the uninitiated , to the unquestioning , they gloss over the assumptions that go into their appearance .
They seem more definite than what they are .
They leave out more than they contain , including variables not considered and variables held constant .
In economics , graphs are summaries , not final truths .
In the hands of statist economists , graphs can be turned into outright falsehoods .
The mathematics
The third means of persuasion is mathematics .
Equations are truth if ever truth could be identified .
Let us be careful about our symbols and definitions .
Let us manipulate them carefully so as not to violate the laws of algebra , calculus , and real analysis .
Then we are sure to have truth and no falsehoods before our eyes .
If this is so in physics , must it not also be so in economics ?
Can equations model economic behavior or an entire economy in the way that they model an electro - magnetic force field ?
They cannot , because they cannot accurately connect to or mirror the human " forces , " which are those of subjective valuation , cost , and choice .
This does not mean that mathematics is useless in economics .
It is far from being so .
It means that the usefulness is of an altogether different sort than in mathematics itself or physics .
Mathematics can be very useful in economics in trying to pin down and understand one ’s verbal concepts , especially when they interact .
It can lead one to deeper understanding or to ideas one might not have had by staying solely in the verbal or graphical realm .
But mathematics is also treacherous in economics .
It gives the appearance of stability , definiteness , specificity , and constancy where they are frequently absent .
The physical constants of electricity and magnetism are stable , definite , specific , and constant .
They do not change with the human will , with time , with other events , or with human invention .
They are measurable up to small errors .
By contrast , most of economics has no such description .
As Pigou put it : " Even if the constants which economists wish to determine were less numerous , and the method of experiment more accessible , we should still be faced with the fact that the constants themselves are different at different times .
The gravitation constant is the same always .
But the economic constants — these elasticities of demand and supply — depending , as they do , upon human consciousness , are liable to vary . "
The average student , asked to solve specific problems with numbers that are fictitious , unobtainable , or meaningless , develops a faith in the veracity of the mathematical formulations .
The students asked to input data and run regressions using Excel will believe in the results , unless they are heavily precautioned in the uses and misuses of statistics .
The average student who sees that GDP = C + I + G + NX will not remember the many provisos and reservations that go into such an equation that render it devoid of meaning .
They will come away with a vague feeling that GDP ( gross domestic product ) is good and that C ( consumption ) is good because it contributes to GDP , as are investment ( I ) , government spending ( G ) , and net exports ( NX ) .
The government
What is this government that statist economists refer to as the savior of efficiency ?
They prefer not to say .
They prefer not to analyze it .
This will raise questions in the minds of the students .
This will interfere with the indoctrination .
Take a political science course , the student is told , although that will typically not awaken the student either .
Government is simply taken for granted .
Where does this government get the lawful power or legitimate authority to do its taxing , subsidizing , and regulating ?
Does everyone have to agree to it ?
What if one person does not agree ?
Why must this government rule over a territory ?
Can people opt out if they want to ?
Do n’t the supposed welfare benefits occur only if everyone is compelled to participate ?
Economists do n’t like to face these questions .
There are implicit and unspoken answers .
Traditionally , authority comes from might or from God.
Democracies look askance at might , and God is dead in a secular age and country for purposes of being the source of authority .
Authority now stems from " we the people " as Gary North has pointed out .
Economists do n’t raise the issues of government because they and their students largely accept it as the God-replacement .
It is n’t .
It replaces might .
The statist economist story
Freedom , among other things , means freedom of choice .
Freedom cannot mean the imposition of government taxes or regulatory measures , no matter what form of government produces them .
Freedom cannot mean centralized or collectivized controls backed up by the force of the State .
Cadres of statist economists support such centralized controls on the grounds that free markets fail .
These economists teach armies of students that market failures are endemic .
Freedom , they say , does not work and ca n’t work .
They teach the imposition of authoritarian solutions for the purported failures of freedom to solve imagined problems in which there are untraded items that affect utility .
Although free people have decided not to address these " problems , " economists wish to substitute force for freedom .
They justify this illegitimate wish ( amply fulfilled by many States over the past and whose results we now live with ) by the idea that we will find ourselves happier as a consequence .
Students are told that with State intervention we will have more products that we want .
They are taught that we will have lower unemployment , greater income in our old age , better medical care , and better and less expensive education .
They are persuaded that there will be more clean air and water , greater safety at home , when we travel , and in the workplace , and more security from foreign enemies .
These messages radiate in all directions .
Many Americans are lured or lulled into acceptance of less freedom by promises of more of what they want and less of what they do n’t want .
The general promise of more goods and fewer bads in exchange for less freedom sells .
Many Americans endorse the despotism inherent in our democracy .
Unable to measure the depredation brought into their lives by government , unable to attribute the harms wrought by the State to its source , constantly fed misinformation and propaganda that extols the State and blames other enemies , they think they are better off with less freedom .
They are living in a fool ’s paradise .
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
While I was doing some http logs analysis on the number of downloads of ViEmu , my commercial vi/vim emulator for Visual Studio , some interesting information turned up .
Given that I think it may be useful to other entrepreneurs using adwords to promote their business , and that I have also received several requests for my experience with adwords , I ’ll be sharing that information in this post .
Hopefully it will save a few bucks for other fellow developers .
Some warnings are due before I delve into the details .
First , I do n’t really have any evidence of clickfraud – there simply are some things in my logs which look , hm , weird , and they may be a signal of something else .
But it could all be due to my more - than - limited understanding of adwords .
Given that I ’m not spending much , I have n’t spent too much time investigating it .
It would be wasting that time which is better spent in other areas .
As well , I have n’t taken the time to read all the information available on the net on these issues , so please feel free to point out the possible flaws in my reasoning .
As to the applicability of my case to other people , I guess my case is not the most common one , as I think I ’m the only advertiser working on many of my keywords .
Given this , there is hardly any bidding at all , and click prices are very cheap ( 5 euro cents / click ) .
It must work very differently if you are advertising on keywords with a tough competition ( I guess I will be able to comment on that once I release the NGEDIT text editor ) .
Anyway .
I set up my google adwords campaing at the end of July , as I released ViEmu 1.0 .
It took a few hours or days for advertisements to appear for relevant searches , but it ’s been working almost unattended since .
I changed a minor detail in the ad text , and I added other keyword combinations as google searches reached my site and taught me what terms people actually use to search for in case they ’re interested in vi/vim integration with Visual Studio .
Given I had hardly researched at all , I learnt stuff as things happened .
When I set up the campaign , I saw I had to pay about 4 euro cents per click .
But afterwards , I had to raise the bid to 5 cents / click , as google warned me and turned off advertising for some key phrases because of a price that was too low .
This is pretty simple to see at your adwords .
google.com account .
I also started getting hits from those clicks .
I found them as hits referred from “ pagead2.googlesyndication.com /… ” where the “ … ” is a really long and complex reference .
It actually took me a while to realize thouse clicks were from google adwords .
There have also been other weird hits , which had a referer address of “ searchportal.information.com ” followed by some kind of encoded ID ( such as “ UVsPWVALXVUMVV8LWQgQRggaCFIXE1Y_CFEIDA0BAQ ” ) .
These addresses took me to a search page which has the nasty habit of becoming a “ frame parasite ” to your web surfing , and used to encode URLs to those ID strings and route everything through their site .
I had severe doubts that someone educated enough to use vi/vim would surf with such a bugger .
Anyway , back to my http log review , I started doing an analysis on my November data .
I usually keep track of how many downloads of my product there are a month , and try to study the correlation with monthly sales ( given the 30 day trial period , tracking is a bit difficult , but I think general trends are still there ) .
I decided to classify all hits to www.ngedit.com in November to be able to tell how many of those came from IP addresses that ended up downloading the trial version of product .
I used vim on the log files to do this process .
vi/vim is pretty good for this kind of text processing and I had the desired list in a short while , although it did involve some of that vi black magic .
Anyway , it turned out that , out of the ~20,000 hits of the month , over 6,000 belonged to IP addresses that downloaded ViEmu .
As an aside , it was higher than I expected .
But now that I could focus better on less information , I could start seeing some new information .
I removed all lines not containing “ pagead2 ” in this reduced hit log ( ad - vi-tisement : “ : v/pagead2 / d ” ) , and got myself down to just 11 lines – and to my amazement , there were only 3 IP addresses !
One IP appeared only once , but the other two appeared 5 times each .
In the full log , there were 24 hits from pagead2 , and the repetition of IPs was kind of “ hidden ” ( I had n’t done a :! sort on them to see the unique addresses ) .
I nslookup ’ed both addresses , which actually only differed in the last byte of the IP address , and only ‘ localhost ’ was returned from the reverse DNS lookup .
I went back to the full hit log , removed everything but IPs belonging to the same subnetwork ( n.n.n. * ) , and I also found out that some of the “ searchportal.information.com ” links belonged to them .
Things started to make some sense .
Let me show you one of the googlesydication referers at this point ( broken up in lines for nice display ) :

That ’s a URL !
I started trying to decipher these URLs .
Watching other pages that implement adsense , and how they appear on google ’s cache , I deduced the referer for this click ( for which I was being charged ) , came from a google cache page ( “ url=http://72.14.203.104/search…”).
It was a cached page from www.lyrics007.com, which is a repository of song lyrics .
The google cache had been accessed from a search at google Vietnam ( a trip to www.google.com.vn showed that ) .
The search seemed to include part of the lyrics and “ vi ” with some weird unicode characters in between ( I ’m as of yet unsure of whether those % 25 BB are geometric signs or diacritic marks ) .
Who gets payed for that click ?
I think the owner of www.lyrics007.com does .
A whois look up showed that the hosting provider is located in Houston , Texas , and that it is registered by someone in Hong Kong .
If I visit any of the lyrics pages , sure , the Google ads are relevant to the content of the page .
But it seemed that the ad for ViEmu appeared when looking at a google - cached copy of the page .
It ’s weird but it may happen .
I think the “ vi ” with weird characters in between may have tricked the adsense engine into showing my ad .
The visits coming from ‘ lyrics007 ’ showed different types of activity .
Sometimes just a hit to the ‘ html ’ file , other times regular page viewing involving hits for the graphics on the page , and even downloading the product !
I even found other hits from the same IP addresses coming from ‘ searchportal.information.com ’.
So what may have happened ?
I have two possible explanations .
One is that a developer in Vietnam was looking for the lyrics to some song , using www.google.com.vn.
Developers also listen to music and check lyrics once in a while .
He clicked on the google cache , in order to access the page , and Google picked my ad ( as , obviously , adsense technology is imperfect and the relevance of the ad is just an heuristic ) .
While humming to the tune of the song , the guy in question saw the ad to my product , and was excited to finally see vi emulation in Visual Studio .
He clicked on the ad and came to my site .
He even downloaded it .
This would mean that I payed google and lyrics007.com for reaching a potential customer of mine – someone who I would n’t have reached easily in another way .
Fair enough .
The weird thing is that this same guy has some other friends using the computer ( or sharing the IP address ) who went through exactly the same process several other times during the month .
With different song lyrics , of course .
And some of the times , their browser crashed before even hitting the ‘ css ’ file or the page graphics ( or maybe they surf with images deactivated ? ) .
They even downloaded ViEmu several times during the month – they must have a messy download directory .
This also happenend from other domains , not only lyrics007 .
I have n’t researched them much , but they seem to come from nearby areas .
If all of the cases have similar explanations , then the domain holders / adsense publishers are not to blame at all .
And then I have a second possible explanation .
Some guy in Hong Kong has set up several domains with song lyrics and other easily accessible content downloaded from other sites .
As those guys are damn smart , they have figured a way to force a google cache access to their page into showing any adsense ad .
I ’ve been trying to do it myself , and have n’t been able to , but the cache does show weird adsense results .
Then , they have some kind of bot which accesses those pages and simulates clicks on the ads .
They probably click on many “ cheap ” advertisers & keywords like mine , but every once in a while they might click on a 50 cent or even a $ 1 ad .
I guess they can make quite some cash that way , apart from the legitimate traffic that their site drives .
They even use another method based on ‘ searchportal.information.com ’
URL hijacking , which hides even more information from advertisers .
And they have even improved the bot to fake normal access to web sites .
I ca n’t know which one is the right explanation .
But , I talked to Andy Brice of PerfectTablePlan , and followed his suggestion of turning off advertising on the “ content ” network ( adsense ) .
I ’m only advertising on google ’s own search results , for which only google gets paid , and which removes the clickfraud incentive for 3rd party publishers .
I ’ve also limited ads to specific countries .
Mainly , I ’ve limited the countries to those on which I already have customers :
USA
Canada
Russia
UK
Australia
Netherlands
Germany
Finland
Norway
I ’ve also added other countries which I think are as likely as those to get me customers : Sweden , France , New Zealand , etc … but that ’s about it .
Given that I have been spending less than € 10 a month , the scam has n’t been problematic for me .
That ’s the main reason it took me several months to investigate and optimize the issue – does n’t make sense to optimize expenses when they are among the lowest ones .
I expect my adwords costs to go down to one tenth of what they have been – which I think amounts to pretty much the legitimate / interesting traffic that I was getting anyway .
I ’m pretty happy for the result of google ads – one customer did tell me that they had found about ViEmu through an ad in google search .
That single sale makes up for the rest , which I like to understand as the cost of my training with google adwords .
I hope this post does n’t upset google – I believe it helps other people make a better use of adwords , and thus also helps google have more happy customers !
From InfoWorld :
She said about half the hotels use shared network media ( i.e. , a hub versus an Ethernet switch ) , so any plain text password you transmit is sniffable by any like - minded person in the hotel .
Most wireless access points are shared media as well ; even networks requiring a WEP key often allow the common users to sniff each other ’s passwords .
She said the average number of passwords collected in an overnight hotel stay was 118 , if you throw out the 50 percent of connections that used an Ethernet switch and did not broadcast passwords .
The vast majority , 41 percent , were HTTP - based passwords , followed by e-mail ( SMTP , POP2 , IMAP ) at 40 percent .
The last 19 percent were composed of FTP , ICQ , SNMP , SIP , Telnet , and a few other types .
As a security professional , my friend often attends security conferences and teaches security classes .
She noted that the number of passwords she collected in these venues was higher on average than in non-security locations .
The very people who are supposed to know more about security than anyone appeared to have a higher - than - normal level of remote access back to their companies , but were n’t using any type of password protection .
At one conference , she listened to one of the world ’s foremost Cisco security experts as his laptop broadcast 12 different log - in types and passwords during the presentation .

9 - 20 Thomas Kean , Jr. NJ Republican candidate for U.S. Senate accused of sock puppet attack against Dem opponent U.S. Senator Robert Menendez .
Kean workers posted negative comments on liberal website ..[ Article linked below . ]

As the Democratic presidential candidates were preparing for their first prime time debate , Republican John McCain made it official , announcing his candidacy in the traditional venue of New Hampshire ’s Prescott Park , rather than on the David Letterman show .
While he continues to lag behind Rudy Giuliani in the polls , McCain ’s presence in primary debates would at least seem to promise a place on the agenda for an issue that undermines the image of the United States , both in the eyes of the world and in the nation ’s sense of itself : torture .
As recently as the fall of 2005 , McCain , an ex-Navy pilot who endured torture in a North Vietnamese prison , was standing up to a Bush Administration eager to preserve America ’s “ flexibility ” in war - on - terror interrogations that had allowed such practices as painful shackling and “ long standing , ” induced hypothermia , mock executions , threats against families , and the infamous waterboarding , or simulated drowning .
The “ McCain Torture Amendment , ” attached to a defense appropriations bill after numerous rounds of negotiations between McCain and the White House , was lauded as a ban on the kind of torture and abuse that had already taken place in Iraq , Afghanistan , Guantanamo Bay , and secret prisons in Eastern Europe and elsewhere ; it was also offered as proof of McCain ’s independence and moral fiber .
McCain himself went on the “ Today ” Show to say : “ We got what we wanted , and that is the preservation of the Geneva Conventions .
There will be no more torture .
There will be no more mistreatment of prisoners that would violate standards of conduct we would expect of people who work for the United States of America . ”
In fact , as my colleague Michael Roston and I wrote at the time in the Village Voice , the Arizona senator ’s so - called torture ban left an enormous loophole :
In its final form , the bill legislated a distinction between the rules to which interrogators from the U.S. military would be subjected , and those to be followed by the intelligence community .
The CIA , FBI , and other intelligence agencies would , in particular , not face legal consequences if they suborned torture by a foreign military or spy service .
The torture “ ban ” was further weakened by an amendment introduced by South Carolina Republican Lindsay Graham , which provided certain exemptions for Guantanamo and removed mechanisms for legal enforcement , and by a barely noticed presidential signing statement in which Bush re-asserted his right to interpret the law as he wished , and do what he deemed necessary to defend the United States .
Intelligence historian Alfred McCoy has written that the Graham Amendment clears the road for “ twisting this congressional ban on inhumane interrogation in ways that could ultimately legalize such acts . ”
Some of the fruits of this policy were revealed earlier this month in a report by the Associated Press , detailing how “ CIA and FBI agents hunting for al Qaeda militants in the Horn of Africa have been interrogating terrorism suspects from 19 countries held at secret prisons in Ethiopia , which is notorious for torture and abuse . ”
While denying that Americans had abused any detainees , the FBI ’s Richard Kolko was quick to insist that , “ The prisoners were never in American custody . ”
A Human Rights
Watch researcher described the conditions to which the detainees were subjected as comparable to a “ decentralized , outsourced Guantanamo . ”
As noted in a March 30 report from Human Rights Watch , many of the detainees were fleeing the fighting in Somalia , and Somalia ’s Transitional Federal Government , along with Ethiopia , Kenya , and the United States cooperated in the secret detention program .
“ Each of these governments has played a shameful role in mistreating people fleeing a war zone , ” said HRW ’s Africa Director .
“ Kenya has secretly expelled people , the Ethiopians have caused dozens to ‘ disappear , ’ and US security agents have routinely interrogated people held incommunicado . ”
A story in last Sunday ’s New York Times provided another , probably common , scenario when it described a scene at one of the new joint American - Iraqi security stations in Baghdad , set up as part of the new “ surge ” plan where a U.S.
Army captain praised Iraqi soldiers after three suspects were captured and provided valuable information .
According to the article , “ What the Iraqis had not told them was that before handing over the detainees to the Americans , the Iraqi soldiers had beaten one of them in front of the other two , the Iraqis said .
The stripes on the detainee ’s back , which appeared to be the product of a whipping with electrical cables , were later shown briefly to a photographer , who was not allowed to take a picture . ”
An Iraqi captain told Times reporter Alissa J. Rubin , “ I prepared him for the Americans and let them take his confession . ”
With such scenarios undoubtedly playing out every day , unobserved by the media , how much of an issue will the United States ’ new tolerance for torture be in the upcoming presidential elections ?
With even McCain showing his willingness to compromise for the sake of a political deal , do n’t expect much from the rest of the Republican field .
GOP frontrunner Rudy Giuliani , at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire earlier this week , faced a questioner asking whether the Bush Administration had gone too far in its resistance to the Geneva Convention in the war on terror .
According to an account on the New York Times ’ Caucus blog , Giuliani said : “ There are people in this world that are organized , and they are organizing around the notion of coming here to attack us and kill us .
The only way you ’re going to stop this , the only way you are going to find out about it in advance , the only way you are going to prevent another September 11 from happening is by being aggressive . ”
According to the Times , “ The only caveat he offered was that he is against torture and that wiretapping should be done within the law . ”
Speaking to voters in South Carolina earlier this month , Giuliani said that the only “ timetable ” in the war on terror depended on “ when they stop planning to come here and kill us , ” and expressed support for the Patriot Act and “ intense interrogation of suspects , though not torture . ”
But long before 9/11 , while he was mayor of New York , Giuliani was widely accused of helping to create an atmosphere that permitted police brutality , including abuse of prisoners .
What could you call the assault on Abner Louima , who was beaten and sodomized with a plunger in a Brooklyn precinct house , if not torture ?
Other Republican candidates seem anxious to prove that they are just as tough as Giuliani .
On a trip to Guantanamo last year , both Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee said they thought the prisoners were well treated .
Romney expressed sympathy for the rough conditions the troops lived under at the base .
In a book , Huckabee later said , “ These are not people who have any respect whatsoever for our laws , our culture , or our very lives .
Most of them truly hate the United States of America and express their gladness when Americans are killed and their hope of more to follow . ”
The still - undeclared Senator Sam Brownback supported the Graham amendment that undermined McCain ’s torture ban last year .
Democrats are somewhat more willing to declare a firm opposition to torture , though they have yet to make it a central issue in their campaigns .
On April 13 and 14 , all of the candidates were invited to meet with a group of retired admirals and generals to discuss U.S. detention and interrogation practices , in an event sponsored by Human Rights First and the Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord , New Hampshire .
Only Joe Biden , Hillary Clinton , and Dennis Kucinich met with the military leaders .
( John Edwards accepted the invitation , but canceled due to the weather . )
The local Concord Monitor spoke with candidates following the little - reported , closed - door meetings .
“ I do not want to live in a country where I train the young women and men who defend this country on principles that I abhor , ” Biden was quoted as saying .
“ Because they will come back to the United States of America , and I do n’t want that to be the core of my country .
I do n’t want that to be who we are . ”
Hillary Clinton is on record against torture :
She said , in the Senate debate on torture last year , that “ in the process of accomplishing what I believe is essential for our security , we must hold on to our values and set an example that we can point to with pride , not shame . ”
Barack Obama ’s New Hampshire press secretary , Reid Cherlin , told the Monitor in an email that Obama believes torture is not effective , “ because those being tortured may lie to stop pain , ” and that it causes hostility against Americans and puts U.S. troops at risk if captured .
“ Senator Obama believes this is not about them ; it ’s about us , ” Cherlin went on .
“ Torture is just un-American .
It ’s not who we are . ”
Dennis Kucinich , in November 2006 wrote , “ Torture degrades us as a people …
Torture breeds torture and brutality .
Torture is a slope no American should step onto . ’’
And trial lawyer John Edwards , in a recent entry on his blog , noted that “ there is a principle in our system of justice that states it is better to let nine guilty men go free , than to punish one innocent man .
We do not always live up to that ideal , but it is that goal that separates us from those who choose to attack us .
The system of secret prisons , torture , and state sponsored kidnappings must end . ’’
And finally , New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson has not directly addressed the subject , though he has said that “ the United States once was –and again must be–a human rights example to which others aspire . ”
Still , it would be surprising to hear any of the Dems consider the torture issue enough of a priority to raise it in their first debate .
Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee passed up a prime opportunity to grill Attorney General Alberto Gonzales — the architect of the Bush take on torture — on the subject during their recent hearings on the prosecutor - firing scandal .
For details on one of the practices that Gonzales — and Dick Cheney — think it is “ quaint ” to ban , and that most of the other candidates do n’t yet deem worth mentioning , take a look at Wikipedia ’s description of waterboarding .
Then take a deep breath , and cast your vote .
The quest for better sleep is said to be behind the trend
A survey by the National Association of Home Builders has predicted that by 2015 , 60 % of custom - built homes will have two master bedroom suites .
The quest for better rest is behind the trend as experts say the lack of decent sleep can cause marital tension .
The option of having separate rooms has often improved marriages , they say .
Gopal Ahluwalia , of the National Association of Home Builders , said the trend was a " market - driven demand that 's going to continue " .
' Flex suite '
Separate bedrooms have often been taken as a sign of a failing relationship , but for many people they appear to be becoming a practical necessity .
Snoring , night - time visits to the bathroom , child - care requirements and shift - working can deprive couples of the recommended seven to eight hours of sleep per night .
The situation has reportedly become more acute as gender roles have changed - with both men and women juggling work and childcare duties .
Families expert , Stephanie Coontz , told the New York Times there were many couples " confident enough that they have a nice marriage , but they do n't particularly like sleeping in the same room " .
" I do n't think it says anything about their sex lives , " she said .
Nevertheless , some builders call the extra room a " flex suite " to avoid any embarrassment .
The trend is not restricted to the upper end of the market , the newspaper says .
Lana Pepper of St Louis said she had switched things around in her new apartment to cope with a restless husband .
" My husband is still alive .
I would have killed him , " she said .
The Police Federation says ' target culture ' stops officers doing their job
The Police Federation of England and Wales says government targets lead to " ludicrous " decisions such as arresting a child for throwing a cucumber slice .
Detectives are being diverted away from serious cases , it also warns .
The Home Office said it was discussing future targets to give more prominence to serious crime .
The federation is due to discuss the issue at its annual conference in Blackpool .
Delegates will debate whether judging officers purely on numbers of arrests , cautions or on - the - spot fines is the best way to assess success .
Dossier published
The federation , which represents 130,000 rank - and - file officers , has published a dossier of " ludicrous " cases it claims are the result of Home Office targets .
The cases include :
A man from Cheshire who was cautioned for being " found in possession of an egg with intent to throw "
A child in Kent who was arrested after removing a slice of cucumber from a sandwich and throwing it at another youngster
A West Midlands woman arrested on her wedding day for criminal damage after her foot slipped on her accelerator pedal and her vehicle damaged a car park barrier
Understandably , when the public hears about this they ask ' What the hell is going on ? '
Police Federation spokesman
' Threat to general coppering '
A child from Kent who was arrested for throwing cream buns at a bus
A 70 - year - old Cheshire pensioner who was arrested for criminal damage after cutting back a neighbour 's conifer trees
An officer in the West Midlands who was told to caution a man for throwing a glass of water over his girlfriend
Two children from Manchester who were arrested for being in possession of a plastic toy pistol
A spokesman for the federation said such cases were a result of officers being " so busy chasing targets and securing ticks in boxes " .
As a result , he said , officers were distancing themselves from " middle England " .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Officers do not know what there are going to face as they go on shift

The list of compiled cases showed incidents where officers had been " under such pressure to deliver it has resulted in an arrest or caution when even the officer themselves thinks it is ludicrous " , he said .
" Understandably , when the public hears about this they ask ' What the hell is going on ? ' . "
' Talking to '
Federation chairman Jan Berry said some officers were considering leaving the service over the issue because it was " not the job they signed up to do " .
She added : " Just talking to people and giving them a few words of advice cannot be counted as easily as a ticket can be .
" But sometimes it is just as effective as taking someone to court . "
Mrs Berry added that the issue would be raised with Home Secretary John Reid later in the week when he attends the conference .
The Chair of the Commons Home Affairs Committee , John Denham , told the BBC questions need to be directed at senior figures in the police service .
" Over the last few years we 've seen a massive investment in police resources and yet we have n't seen the scale of increases in cases brought to court for things like burglary and car thieves , and robbers and child pornographers that we would want , " he said .
" Clearly the government is right to say on behalf of taxpayers - we want to see value for money for that investment .
Officers should not pursue detection numbers for numbers ' sake if that means chasing minor misdemeanours at the expense of serious offenders
Home Office spokeswoman
" Now , if between that message and Jan Berry 's members it is being distorted into crude number chasing by senior police officers , that 's where we 've got to tackle the problem . "
A spokeswoman for the Home Office said : " Bringing criminals to justice is a core job for the police , but officers should not pursue detection numbers for numbers ' sake if that means chasing minor misdemeanours at the expense of serious offenders .
" This amounts to hitting the target , but missing the point .
" We are currently discussing future targets in this area so that both our crime reduction and detections targets give much more prominence to more serious crime , particularly the most serious violent crime . "
Paul Cavadino , Chief Executive of Nacro , the crime reduction charity , said : " Law enforcement agencies should not be judged by how many offenders they arrest but on how much they reduce crime . "
Shadow home secretary David Davis said Whitehall targets were " stopping the police from doing what the public want them to do " .
He added : " Conservatives would free the police from Labour 's red tape so they can be deployed onto our streets - where the public want them . "
Number of Evangelical Law Schools Growing
This is about the scariest article I have read in a while .
It begins with Jerry Falwell and his Liberty University dream of " training a new generation of lawyers , judges , educators , policymakers and world leaders in law from the perspective of an explicitly Christian worldview . "
Then it lists the other law schools in the mold .
The number is growing .
Check out the quotes from the students .
Matthew Krause , among Liberty 's first law graduates , is one of them .
" I think we 've complained too long about the destruction of our culture without taking any affirmative steps to remedy it , " said the lanky , 26 - year - old Texan .
" We do n't want abortion , but what are we doing about it ?
Let 's get into the courts and find a way to combat that .
Same - sex marriage we do n't feel is right or a good thing for the culture .
How are we going to stop that ?
You have to do that through the legal processes .
Then , at the same time , vote in politicians who share those ideas and beliefs . "
These schools exist to teach the students how to circumvent the constitution , eliminate the separation of church and state and deprive all of us of constitutional rights .
Another student says :
In early February , the lead story on CNN.com – " the most trusted name in news " – was about tattooed fish .
Emblazoned on the website was a large picture of a fish with some kind of design on its belly .
I do n't have fish but if I ever wanted any , I 'd probably get that fish .
It looked pretty cool .
Here 's the problem , though : Surely there were more important things happening in the world .
I think there is a war going on somewhere .
Is Social Security fixed yet ?
Do n't get me wrong .
I like oddball news as much as anyone .
In fact , I make a decent living showcasing a daily collection of silly news , offbeat items , and real news with amusing headlines on my website , Fark.com , which attracts 3.5 million unique visitors each month .
What 's scary , though , is that the ratio of filler news to real news is now so high that the content of Fark and major news websites is often nearly identical .
That should never happen because , in theory , mass media outlets are staffed by full - time , serious journalists who have better things to do .
So what 's going on ?
Part of the blame lies with the 24 - hour news cycle .
Sometimes there just is n't anything substantial going on .
But the mass media , like nature , abhor a vacuum .
Journalists have developed proven techniques to fill it .
Consider the recent announcement – almost certainly bogus – by movie director James Cameron that he discovered boxes that once contained the bones of Jesus , his alleged wife , Mary , and their alleged boy , Elroy , or whatever his name was .
This news item is a combination of two common " not - news " stories slammed together .
1. Headline Contradicted by Actual Article .
Headlines of most of the articles about this subject stated that Mr. Cameron had found a box with Jesus ' bones in it .
However , the actual articles tell us that there were no bones inside after all , and we do n't have samples of Jesus ' DNA .
Headline Contradicted by Actual Article is either an editorial oversight or an intentional misleading of the public to draw attention to an otherwise lame article .
In this case , however , the article was n't just lame , it was inflammatory because of its close relation to our next type of bogus media article .
2. Ad Masquerading as Actual Article .
Several hundred publications ran this article , so it 's not likely that anyone was paid off for placement .
But this is n't a news article – it's a commercial .
Most articles tell us that the " startling " claim about Jesus will be examined in - depth in a documentary Cameron produced .
And they helpfully remind us what channel it's on and what time to watch .
That 's an ad in my book .
Figuratively and literally .
( Sharp readers will see what I just did there . )
There are several other techniques media use to stir reader interest .
They 're transparent and simplistic , but they work .
The good news is that every journalist I 've talked to agrees this is a problem that 's getting worse and they 're not happy about it .
They did n't go to graduate school to spend their time researching and writing about nuts who think Noah 's
Ark is visible from space on a mountain in Iran or what Brad Pitt thinks about stem - cell research .
Mass media are n't intentionally trying to dumb down the news , but there 's no getting around the fact that nonnews types of articles are what drive ad revenue on the Internet .
It 's a subtle difference but an important one , because it removes intent as a motivation .
Sadly , we still end up with the same result : bunk being passed off as news .
Sometimes , the revenue incentive in media produces hilarious results .
Remember the girl who could n't stop hiccuping this winter ?
ABC's " Good Morning America " representatives called her home 57 times in one day in a bid to book her for the show .
Occasionally , though , you get horrific results , such as this past January when nearly every news outlet ran video of Saddam Hussein 's execution ad nauseum for days .
Apparently , snuff films are now OK for mainstream news .
Now all that 's left is a live on - air killing passing as news , maybe in a high - speed car chase .
Wait , that 's already happened .
That leaves just pornography , and that 's not far behind .
So whose fault is all this , the media 's or the public's ?
Both .
Real news is simply not a ratings leader .
Evening network news shows are n't shown during prime time because they can't hack it .
This is also why prime - time news shows consist almost entirely of celebrity interviews and pedophile arrests .
Note which type of " news " gets the better time slot .
It 's looking more and more as though the age of impartial journalism was a temporary blip in history whose reign ended a few years ago when the Internet turned news consumption from all - inclusive ( per newspaper ) to a la carte ( per story ) .
My forthcoming book offers some solutions .
Here 's one : Split 24 - hour news channels in two – one carries all the " Fark , " the other carries all the real news .
Revenues funnel into the same bank account ; everyone wins .
Until that happens , news consumers will have to adjust to a world in which journalistic principles are being thrown out the window in a frantic quest for ratings .
And mass media outlets need to make a call : Either report serious news or give up all pretenses .

E-mails being sought from Karl Rove 's computers , and recent revelations about critical electronic conflicts of interest , may be the smoking guns of Ohio 's stolen 2004 election .
A thorough recount of ballots and electronic files .
preserved by a federal lawsuit , could tell the tale .
The major media has come to focus on a large batch of electronic communications which have disappeared from the server of the Republican National Committee , and from White House advisor Rove 's computers .
The attention stems from the controversial firing of eight federal prosecutors by Attorney - General Alberto Gonzales .
But the time frame from which these e-mails are missing also includes a critical late night period after the presidential election of 2004 .
In these crucial hours , computerized vote tallies may have been shifted to move the Ohio vote count from John Kerry to George W. Bush , giving Bush the presidency .
Earlier that day , Rove and Bush flew into Columbus .
Local election officials say they met with Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell in Columbus .
Also apparently in attendance was Matt Damschroder , executive director of the Franklin County ( Columbus ) Board of Elections .
These four men , along with Ohio GOP chair Bob Bennett , were at the core of a multi- pronged strategy that gave Bush Ohio 's twenty Electoral College votes , and thus the presidency .
Bennett and Damschroder held key positions on election boards in the state 's two most populous counties , with the biggest inner city concentrations of Democratic voters .
There were four key phases to the GOP 's election theft strategy : 1. Prior to the election , the GOP focused on massive voter disenfranchisement , with a selective reduction of voter turnout in urban Democratic strongholds .
Blackwell issued confusing and contradictory edits on voter eligibility , registration requirements , and provisional ballots ; on shifting precinct locations ; on denial and misprinting of absentee ballots , and more .
Among other things , election officials , including Bennett , stripped nearly 300,000 voters from registration rolls in heavily Democratic areas in Cleveland , Cincinnati and Toledo , with no notice given those being disenfranchised .
2 .
On election day , the GOP focussed on voter intimidation , denial of voting rights to legally eligible ex-felons , denial of voting machines to inner city precincts , malfunctioning of those machines , destruction of provisional ballots and more .
In Franklin , Cuyahoga and other urban counties , huge lines left mostly African - American voters waiting in the rain for three hours and more .
A Democratic Party survey shows more than 100,000 voters failed to vote due to these lines , which plagued heavily Democratic inner city precincts ( but not Republican suburban ones ) throughout the state .
The survey shows another 50,000 ballots may have been discarded at the polling stations .
In addition , to this day , more than 100,000 machine - rejected and provisional ballots remain uncounted .
The official Bush margin of victory was less than 119,000 votes .
3 .
After the final tabulation of the votes , and the announcement that Bush had won , the GOP strategy focused on subverting a statewide recount .
A filing by the Green and Libertarian Parties required Ohio's 88 county boards of election to conduct random precinct samplings , to be followed by recounts where necessary .
A lawsuit was filed to delay the seating of Ohio's Electoral College delegation until after the recount was completed .
Among other things , the plaintiffs sued to get access to Rove 's laptop .
But Blackwell rushed to certify the delegation before a recount could be completed .
The issue became moot , and the suit was dropped .
In retaliation , Blackwell tried to impose legal sanctions on the attorneys who filed it .
But two felony convictions have thus far resulted from what prosecutors have called the " rigging " of the recount in Cuyahoga County ( where Bennett has been forced to resign his chairmanship of the board of elections ) .
More are likely to follow .
The practices that led to these convictions were apparently repeated in many of Ohio's 88 counties .
The order to violate the law --- or at least tacit approval to do so --- is almost certain to have come from Blackwell .
4 .
Ultimately , however , it is the GOP 's computerized control of the vote count that may have been decisive .
And here is where Rove 's e-mails , and the wee hours of the morning after the election , are crucial .
Despite the massive disenfranchisement of Ohio Democrats , there is every indication John Kerry won Ohio 2004 .
Exit polls shown on national television at 12:20 am gave Kerry a clear lead in Ohio , Iowa , Nevada and New Mexico .
These " purple states " were Democratic blue late in the night , but , against virtually impossible odds , all turned Bush red by morning .
Along the way , Gahanna , Ohio's " loaves & fishes " vote count , showed 4,258 ballots for Bush in a precinct where just 638 people voted .
Voting machines in Youngstown and Columbus lit up for Bush when Kerry 's name was pushed .
Rural Republican precincts registered more than 100 % turnouts , while inner city Democratic ones went as low as 7 % .
Warren County declared a " Homeland Security " alert , removed the ballot count from public scrutiny , then recorded a huge , unlikely margin for Bush .
These and many more instances of irregularities and theft were reported at www.freepress.org and then confirmed by U.S. Representative John Conyers and others who researched the election .
But the most critical reversals may have come as exit polls indicated that despite massive Democratic disenfranchisement , and even with preliminary vote count manipulations , Kerry would win Ohio by 4.2 % , a margin well in excess of 200,000 votes .
The key to that reversal may be electronic .
It has now become widely known that the same web - hosting firm that served a range of GOP websites , including the one for the Republican National Committee , also hosted the official site that Blackwell used to report the Ohio vote count .
This astonishing conflict of interest has been reported at the epluribusmedia.org on - line investigative service .
Cross-postings have come from luaptifer at Dailykos and blogger Joseph Cannon's Cannonfire.blogspot.com .
They all confirm that the RNC tech network 's hosting firm is smartechcorp.com , based in Chattanooga , Tennessee .
SMARTech hosts georgewbush.com , mc.org , ohiogop.org and gop.com among other Republican web domains , in a bank basement .
Furthermore , the same hosting site that handled redirections from Blackwell 's " official " site also handled the White House e-mail accounts that have become central to investigations of the Gonzales purge of eight federal prosecutors , some of whom were themselves involved in vote fraud investigations .
Conflicts of interest in programming services and remote - access capability appear throughout the RNC 's computer networks , Rove 's secret White House e-mail , and the electronic vehicles used by Blackwell to finally reveal his " official " presidential vote counts for Ohio 2004 .
One factor may be Ohio 's electronic touch - screen voting systems , on which were cast more than 800,000 votes in an election decided by about one - seventh that total .
Such vulnerabilities , among other things , have been confirmed in exhaustive reports by Conyers 's Committee , by the Government Accountability Office , by the Carter - Baker Commission , by Princeton University , by the Brennan Center , and by others .
But overall , the electronic record of every vote in Ohio was transmitted to the Secretary of State 's office , and hosted in real time in Chattanooga .
Under such circumstances , the joint hosting of the White House e-mail system and accessibility by Blackwell and Rove to the same computer networks linked to the Ohio vote count , takes on an added dimension .
Mike Connell , a Republican computer expert , helped create the software for both Ohio 's official 2004 election web site , and for the Bush campaign 's partisan web site during the 2000 election .
The success of Connell 's GovTech Solutions has been attributed by Connell to his being " loyal to my network , " including the Bush family .
Blackwell shared those loyalties .
Like Connell , he worked for the Bush - Cheney campaign , serving as its Ohio co-chair .
He was also in control of the vote count that was being reported on software Bush loyalist Connell helped design .
It was in a crucial period after midnight on election night 2004 that these paired conflicts of interest may have decided the election .
As exit polls showed a decisive Kerry victory , there was an unexplained 90 - minute void in official reporting of results .
By this time , most of the vote counts were coming in from rural areas , which are traditionally Republican , and which , ironically , usually report their results earlier than the Democratic urban areas .
In this time span , Kerry 's lead morphed into a GOP triumph .
To explain this " miraculous " shift , Rove invented a myth of the greatest last - second voting surge in US history , allegedly coming from late - voting fundamentalist Republicans .
No significant evidence exists to substantiate this claim .
In fact , local news reports indicate the heaviest turnouts in most rural areas came early on election day , rather than later .
According to a January 13 , 2005 , release from Cedarville University , a small Ohio - based Christian academy , Connell 's GovTech Solutions helped make the shared server system run " like a champ … through the early morning hours as users from around the world looked to Ohio for their election results .
" After 2 am , despite exit polls showing very much the opposite outcome , those results put Bush back in the White House .
In January , 2005 , the U.S. Congress hosted the first challenge to a state 's Electoral College delegation in our nation 's history .
At the time , the compromised security of the official Ohio electronic reporting systems was not public knowledge .
But the first attempt to subpoena Karl Rove 's computer files had already failed .
Now a second attempt to gain such access is being mounted as the Gonzales scandal deepens .
Congressman Henry A. Waxman ( D - CA ) has raised " particular concerns about Karl Rove " and his electronic communications about the Gonzales firings .
Rove claims both his own computer records and the RNC 's servers have been purged of e-mails through the time the Ohio vote was being reversed .
Rove 's attorney , Robert Luskin , has told a Congressional inquiry that Rove mistakenly believed his messages to the RNC " were being archived " there .
But the RNC says it has no e-mail records for Rove before 2005 .
Rob Kelner , an RNC lawyer says efforts to recreate the lost records have had some success .
But it 's not yet known whether communications from the 2004 election can be retrieved .
Nor is it known whether the joint access allowed to top GOP operatives Rove and Blackwell was responsible for the election - night reversal that put Bush back in the White House .
But there remains another avenue by which the real outcome of Ohio 2004 could be discovered .
Longstanding federal law protected Ohio's ballots and other election documentation prior to September 3 , 2006 .
Blackwell gave clear orders that these crucial records were to be destroyed on that date .
Prior to the expiration of the federal statutory protection , a civil rights lawsuit was filed in the federal court of Judge Algernon Marbley , asking that the remaining records be preserved .
The request was granted in what has become known as the King - Lincoln Bronzeville suit ( co-author Bob Fitrakis is an attorney in the case , and Harvey Wasserman is a plaintiff ) .
Thus , by federal law , the actual ballots and electronic records should be available for the kind of exhaustive recount that was illegally denied --- or " rigged , " as prosecutors in Cleveland have put it --- by Blackwell , Bennett and their cohorts the first time around .
Ohio's newly - elected Secretary of State , Jennifer Brunner , has agreed to take custody of these materials , and to bring them to a central repository , probably in Columbus .
This means that an exhaustive recount could show who really did win the presidential election of 2004 .
It may also be possible to learn what roles --- electronic or otherwise --- Karl Rove and J. Kenneth Blackwell really did play during those crucial 90 minutes in the deep night , when the presidency somehow slipped from John Kerry to George W. Bush .-- Bob Fitrakis & Harvey Wasserman are co-authors of HOW THE GOP STOLE AMERICA'S 2004 ELECTION & IS RIGGING 2008 , available at www.freepress.org and , with Steve Rosenfeld , of WHAT HAPPENED IN OHIO ? , from the New Press .

A waiter entreats you to enjoy your meal and you respond with " you too . "
This error is not confined solely to waiters ; you may say " you too " when an usher tells you to enjoy the film , when an airline employee tells you to enjoy your trip , or even when a friend says " happy birthday . "
The " you too " is one of the most common errors in human discourse .
Your best bet is to simply ignore your mistake , since every waiter in the world has heard " you too " fifty times a day for the entire tenure in the food service industry .
In fact , many of them probably take perverse delight in telling diners to enjoy their meals , knowing that the " you too " response is inevitable .
Just let the waiter get away with it , because it is one of the few pleasures that life affords him .
In extreme situations , such as when you 're on a power - lunch with your business colleagues or when you 're trying to impress a date , you may mitigate the situation by actually taking yourself at your word and inviting the waiter to join you as you dine .
You lean back too far in your chair and almost fall over .
In a moment of idleness , you decide to create the mildly euphoric sensation of leaning back on two legs of your chair .
You lean too far , and nearly fall over backward ; you catch your balance after some amount of flailing , and the front legs of your chair land on the ground with a loud thud .
We 're hesitant to recommend faking a seizure to avoid awkwardness , mostly because its overuse is dangerous .
If everyone became aware of the possibilities of the fake seizure , not a single social event could occur without at least a dozen fake seizures ; they would become so commonplace that real seizures would go untreated , and thousands of epileptics would die every year from swallowing their tongues .
However , in this case , we recommend falling out of your chair and faking a seizure .
Out of habit , you end a phone conversation with " I love you " when not talking to your significant other .
When ending a phone conversation with a friend or colleague , you say " I love you , " a habitual flourish which has been drilled into your phone etiquette by years of conversations with your spouse or significant other .
Have no fear : your friend or colleague will probably assume that they heard you wrong , that you were joking , or that you simply misspoke .
Calling back and insisting that you did n't mean to tell them you loved them will only make you seem desperate , creepy and cowardly , and the other party will assume that you really are secretly in love with them .
If you 're concerned that your colleague took the comment wrong and believes that you 're in love with them , you can easily cover your tracks by ending every telephone conversation with " I love you " for the rest of your life .
Who knows : you might even get an " I love you " or two back !
You accidentally call your mom by a term of endearment generally reserved for your significant other .
You have become so accustomed to calling your spouse or significant other " sweetie " that , when visiting your mother , you accidentally use the term on her .
Is it the emergence of some oedipal fantasy , or merely an indication that you 've become too accustomed to your significant other ?
Either way , your embarrassment will be tempered only by the fact that your mother must love you unconditionally and has a long history of putting up with your stupid mistakes .
In this scenario , apologize to your mother ( goodness knows you do n't do that often enough ) .
If your significant other is present during this fiasco , glare at her menacingly until she " gets the message . "
When talking to a disabled person , you make reference to a faculty which they do not posses .
While it may seem rude to walk on eggshells around the disabled , it still makes the blood rush to your cheeks when you realize that you 're telling a blind person about a movie you saw , or saying " see you later , I gotta run " to a paraplegic .
Many times , they wo n't notice ( especially if they 're deaf ) , but the steely gaze of an offended cripple is something that nobody wants to experience .
If , god forbid , you do wind up offending a disabled person by mentioning the ability that they struggle every day to live without , no apology can possibly compensate for their feelings of shame and inadequacy .
Your only hope is to try to reason with them ; gently explain that you meant no harm , but you 're merely enjoying one of the basic abilities given to almost all members of the human race .
Tell them that you have no shame when it comes to exercising one of the basic faculties with which God blessed you , and you that can only express your deepest regret and sympathy that the almighty did not see fit to honor them with the same privilege .
You become bewildered when faced with an " ethnic " handshake .
It is the fear of all suburbanites : when presented with a fist , an open palm , or any other nonstandard handshake , we freeze up , unable to react .
We know that we must act quickly to avoid looking hopelessly square , or worse yet , racist .
What do we do ?
The most important factor when faced with an " academic " handshake is reaction time .
No matter what your response is , slapping a fist or tickling a palm is infinitely better than just tentatively extending your trembling hand and hoping the other party takes the initiative to guide you through the process .
All handshakes are , at their core , tests to measure the machismo and charisma of an opponent ; a nonstandard handshake goes above all that , and becomes a test of confidence and will .
The slightest hesitation values your opponent 's hand above your own .
When faced with an unfamiliar handshake , take action , any action , as quickly as possible .
Do n't think , just shoot out your hand and slap whatever 's in front of you .
You end up with droplets of water on your crotch after using the restroom .
We 're not here to pass judgment .
We do n't know if you were sprayed by an overzealous bathroom faucet , or if you failed to adequately shake Lil ' Odysseus before you returned him to Ithaca .
Either way , you are confronted with one of the most difficult social situations imaginable : you appear to have peed yourself .
Do n't panic !
Although all may seem lost , the secret to disguising a pee-spot or a wet patch is perfectly simple .
Secure the bathroom door against any intruders , remove your pants , and run them under the tap until they are uniformly saturated with water .
When you emerge from the bathroom , you 'll look as good as new !
Your pants may be a shade or two darker and there will be some significant dripping , but you can probably play it off as a simple case of extreme sweating .
You laugh at a completely inappropriate time .
During a situation that demands complete silence , such as a funeral , a church service or a business meeting , you remember something that was n't actually very funny , but it somehow strikes you as the most hilarious thing in history .
Perhaps it 's an old Wizard of Id comic , or the time in the Cosby Show when a mean kid called Rudy Huxtable " Rudy Huckleberry . "
Anyone who has experienced this situation knows that attempting to stifle your giggles will only make them worse .
Never attempt to hold your laughter in , or it will come out in undesirable ways .
Your face will buckle and contort , and before you know if you 'll be fizzing and snorting and squealing like a baby pig being deep - fried alive .
Instead of holding your laughter in , try to release it as quickly and unobtrusively as possible .
Allow yourself one solid , loud " HA ! " through the diaphragm , and then sink into your seat with a scowl on your face , like Ally Sheedy in the Breakfast Club did when Molly Ringwald was being a jerk and describing her stupid imaginary problems .
With any luck , those around you will recall the scene and go " yeah , fuck Molly Ringwald . "
You call your teacher " mom . "
When addressing a teacher or professor , you mistakenly refer to him or her as " mom . "
Among awkwardness survival experts , this is known as " The Doomsday Scenario . "
If the room has fallen silent , enjoy the momentary reprieve ; your peers are merely gauging exactly how hard to laugh at you , which may take several seconds .
Soon , they will decide to laugh very , very hard .
Calling your teacher " mom " leaves you with very few effective tactics .
DO NOT attempt to play it off as a joke ; your classmates are n't stupid , and they all saw you pause three - quarters of the way into the word as a look of panic and bewilderment slowly crept onto your face .
DO NOT attempt to turn the word " mom " into another word halfway through , as in , " hey mom ... tana is a beautiful state .
They call it ' Big Sky Country . ' "
Your best hope is to face the situation with dignity .
Acknowledge your error and do your best to laugh along with your peers .
The main alternative is to literally crawl into a hole and die .

The New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) is migrating off a 1,600 millions of instructions per second ( MIPS ) mainframe to IBM System p servers running AIX and x86 Hewlett - Packard Co. ( HP ) servers running Linux , with the first part of the move going live today .
More on mainframe migrations : Korean insurer retires 7,000 MIPS mainframes
Mainframe migration decisions overview
Fast guide to mainframe migration
Francis Feldman , the vice president of the shared data center for Securities Industry Automation Corp. ( SIAC ) , the NYSE 's technology arm , said the bottom line for the migration was the bottom line .
He estimates the move will halve the cost of transactions , and though he would n't detail how much that would mean on a yearly basis , he said it is " serious financial savings , very serious . "
Trades executed on the floor of the NYSE are matched and sent by the mainframe to The Depository Trust and Clearing Corp. , which clears and settles the trades .
At night the mainframe handles batch processing and supports regulatory requirements .
But Feldman and SIAC found that the costs of running Big Iron , which includes the manpower , software licensing and services , were prohibitive as long as they were under a 2,500 MIPS mainframe .
" The mainframe simply did not make sense , " Feldman said .
" For the type of work we run , we found price points that were more attractive on different platforms . "
Mainframe migration prompts more questions
SIAC could have continued on the mainframe , outsourced to another vendor or tried to rewrite the code to run cleaner , but the group felt that moving to another platform was the most feasible solution .
Then came the hard part : finding out who could help them get its JCL and COBOL logic to a distributed platform .
Feldman said there are plenty of good mainframe migration companies out there , but some of them had difficulty grasping the difference between a smaller migration of 250 MIPS and one the likes of the NYSE's .
Some mainframe migration firms , for example , are primarily emulator software companies that Feldman said would incur performance delays after a certain number of MIPS .
On the NYSE , even a split - second delay is costly .
" You have to provide us with an end run , and it has to deliver to the table the same or better performance as we see on the mainframe , " Feldman said .
" Not only on the CPU but on the I/ O as well .
That 's asking for a lot if you 're doing emulation . "
Clerity , Tidal step in on mainframe migration
In came Oakbrook Terrace , Ill. - based Clerity Solutions Inc. , which focuses on legacy migrations .
To test Clerity , Feldman and his team collected some batch and CICS application code , sent it to Clerity and said he would be at Clerity 's development center in 24 hours to see the results .
Clerity passed .
Clerity uses its UniKix software to ingest the mainframe code and compile it to run on a distributed platform .
The recompilation is then tested in the company before it goes live .
The AIX platform executes the application of the recompiled code while the Linux boxes handles FTP transfers on the front end .
Feldman would n't disclose what Linux distribution was running on the HP servers .
Meanwhile , the NYSE is also using Tidal Software 's job scheduling applications to replace IBM's Tivoli Operations Planning and Control job scheduler on the mainframe .
The company already had Tidal Software scheduling jobs on existing distributed systems , so now all the job scheduling will be under one platform .
" Now we have the entire data flow in the scheduler , " said Steve Hirsch , vice president of technology at the NYSE .
" We 'll be able to manage the entire job flow with one scheduler without having to hack it and make the job schedulers speak to one another .
So it 's a huge advantage to have one job scheduler . "
First mainframe migration applications go live
Of course , the migration has not gone live yet .
SIAC divided the move into a handful of application groups .
Feldman would only describe the first application group migration , which will go into production today , as running internal business applications .
Down the road , the NYSE will migrate applications supporting online transaction processing and different lines of the NYSE business .
The migration is expected to be fully complete by the end of the year .
" It 's working according to my expectations .
So far , so good , " Feldman said .
" We still have a long road to go . "

McCain goes for a leisurely stroll in Baghdad
Sen. [ tag ]
John McCain [ / tag ] ( R - Ariz . ) obviously thinks Americans are idiots .
There ’s no other explanation for his recent foolishness on Iraq , topped off yesterday by a fascinating [ tag ] shopping [ / tag ] trip to a [ tag ] Baghdad [ / tag ] market .
As you probably recall , a week ago McCain appeared on Bill Bennett ’s radio program , toeing the right - wing line on “ progress ” in Iraq .
“ There are neighborhoods in Baghdad where you and I could walk through those neighborhoods today , ” McCain told Bennett .
“ The U.S. is beginning to succeed in Iraq . ”
The next day , McCain went even further , claiming that General Petraeus travels in Baghdad “ almost every day in a non-armed Humvee . ”
The claims were n’t just false , they were demonstrably ridiculous .
But a funny thing happens to a liar when he ’s caught — he has to keep scrambling to keep the lie alive .
At a press conference in the heavily - guarded Green Zone yesterday , McCain bragged about having just strolled through a Baghdad market for an hour .
It was proof he said , that an American could “ walk freely ” in some areas of the city , just as he said last week .
TP has a clip from NBC News of exactly what “ walking freely ” means in Baghdad right now .
NBC ’s Nightly News provided further details about McCain ’s one - hour guided tour .
He was accompanied by “ 100 American soldiers , with three Blackhawk helicopters , and two Apache gunships overhead . ”
Still photographs provided by the military to NBC News seemed to show McCain wearing a bulletproof vest during his visit .
Funny , McCain did n’t mention the 100 American soldiers , three Blackhawk helicopters , and two Apache gunships when he talked about how safe it was .
It must have slipped his mind .
Of course , as any reasonable person could see , McCain set out to prove a point and ultimately proved the opposite .
If the only way for an American to walk around Baghdad safely is to wear a bullet - proof vest , surrounded a massive military support network , then it still is n’t safe .
McCain ’s stupid stunt only served to prove how right his critics are .
And for McCain to argue , with a straight face , that his little shopping excursion proves his point about safety suggests he ’s clearly gone over the credibility cliff .
He apparently plans to lie shamelessly from now on .
His opinion of Americans , and his respect for our intelligence , is just that low .
For that matter , as Newsweek noted , “ It did n’t take the insurgents long to send their reply .
Less then 30 minutes after McCain wrapped up , a barrage of half a dozen mortars peppered the boundaries of the Green Zone , where the senators held their press conference . ”
Worse , around the same time as McCain ’s heavily - guarded shopping spree , a market northeast of Baghdad was bombed , killing two .
And one last random thought : exactly how much did McCain ’s stroll cost ?
How many resources had to be spent in order to provide support for the senator to foolishly try and prove some point ?
Was there , perhaps , a better use of 100 American soldiers , three Blackhawk helicopters , and two Apache gunships at that time , or are political photo - ops now part of the military ’s mission ?
When Karl Rove and his top deputies arrived at the White House in 2001 , the Republican National Committee provided them with laptop computers and other communication devices to be used alongside their government - issued equipment .
The back - channel e-mail and paging system , paid for and maintained by the RNC , was designed to avoid charges that had vexed the Clinton White House -- that federal resources were being used inappropriately for political campaign purposes .
FOR THE RECORD
White House e-mail :
An article in Monday ’s Section A on WhiteHouse use of a private e-mail system incorrectly attributed to ScottJennings , a deputy to senior advisor Karl Rove , an e-mail on thatsystem saying , “ We ’re a go for the U.S. atty plan .
WH leg , politicaland communications have signed off and acknowledged that we have tobe committed to following through once the pressure comes . ”
Thee - mail was written by Deputy White House Counsel William Kelley usinga White House e-mail account .
Now , that dual computer system is creating new embarrassment and legal headaches for the White House , the Republican Party and Rove ’s once - vaunted White House operation .
Democrats say evidence suggests the RNC e-mail system was used for political and government policy matters in violation of federal record preservation and disclosure rules .
In addition , Democrats point to a handful of e-mails obtained through ongoing inquiries suggesting the system may have been used to conceal such activities as contacts with lobbyist Jack Abramoff , who was convicted on bribery charges and is now in prison for fraud .
Democratic congressional investigators are beginning to demand access to this RNC - White House communications system , which was used not only by Rove ’s office but by several top officials elsewhere in the White House .
The prospect that such communication might become public has further jangled the nerves of an already rattled Bush White House .
Some Republicans believe that the huge number of e-mails -- many written hastily , with no thought that they might become public -- may contain more detailed and unguarded inside information about the administration ’s far - flung political activities than has previously been available .
“ There is concern about what may be in these e-mails , ” said one GOP activist who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject .
“ The system was created with the best intentions , ” said former Assistant White House Press Secretary Adam Levine , who was assigned an RNC laptop and BlackBerry when he worked at the White House in 2002 .
But , he added , “ the road to hell is paved with good intentions . ”
Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D - Los Angeles ) , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , last week formally requested access to broad categories of RNC - White House e-mails .
Waxman told the Los Angeles Times in a statement that a separate “ e- mail system for high - ranking White House officials would raise serious questions about violations of the Presidential Records Act , ” which requires the preservation and ultimate disclosure of e-mails about official government business .
Waxman ’s initial request to the RNC seeks e-mails relating to the presentation of campaign polling and strategy information to Cabinet agency appointees .
He is also expected to ask for e-mails relating to Abramoff ’s activities , which Waxman is also investigating .
The Senate and House Judiciary Committees are also expected to formally request e-mail records from the RNC that relate to last year ’s firing of eight U.S. attorneys .
The private e-mail system came to light in the U.S. attorney controversy because one of Rove ’s deputies used an RNC - maintained e-mail domain -- gwb43.com -- to communicate with the Justice Department about replacing one of those prosecutors .
White House officials said the system had been used appropriately and was modeled after one used by the Clinton White House political office in the late 1990s .
“ The regular staffers who interface with political organizations have a separate e-mail account , and that ’s entirely appropriate , ” said White House spokesman Scott M. Stanzel .
“ The practice is followed to avoid inadvertent violations of the law . ”
Stanzel said he did not know how many officials used the separate system .
Another White House official called it “ a handful . ”
Some Republican activists say the e-mail request will not create great difficulty for the White House because nothing nefarious happened and because the RNC automatically purges some e-mails after 30 days .
RNC officials are expected to meet with House Government Reform and Judiciary Committee lawyers as early as this week to discuss the first document request .
“ We ’d like to cooperate to whatever level is appropriate , ” Republican Party spokeswoman Lisa Camooso Miller said Friday .
Waxman focused on the e-mails after a hearing last month examining a presentation of campaign forecasts and polling data made by a Rove deputy to top appointed officials of the Government Services Administration , some of whom believed they were being instructed to help GOP candidates .
White House staff arranging for the GSA briefing by a Rove deputy , Scott Jennings , used the gwb43.com e-mail domain name .
That caught the attention of Waxman ’s investigators , who had previously examined e-mails from Abramoff to Rove ’s executive assistant , Susan B. Ralston , to object to an impending Interior Department decision .
The decision , he wrote , was “ anathema to all our supporters it ’s important if possible to get some quiet message from the WH [ White House ] that this is absurd . ”
Ralston used outside accounts -- including at rnchq.org -- to communicate with Abramoff and his partners .
One e-mail from an Abramoff associate said that White House personnel had warned “ it is better to not put this stuff in writing in [ the White House ] ... e-mail system because it might actually limit what they can do to help us , especially since there could be lawsuits , etc . ”
Abramoff ’s response , according to a copy of his e-mail released by Waxman ’s committee , was : “ Dammit .
It was sent to Susan on her rnc pager and was not supposed to go into the WH system . ”
Ralston later resigned in connection with the lobbying scandal .
Waxman told RNC Chairman Mike Duncan in a letter that such exchanges “ indicated that in some instances White House officials were using nongovernment accounts specifically to avoid creating a record of communications ” that could be reviewed by congressional committees or released under the Presidential Records Act .
Lawyers for the committees say that use of campaign - connected e-mail addresses may make it easier to gather information because it would be harder for the White House to make a broad claim of executive privilege .
Lawyers for congressional Democrats have anticipated that the White House will invoke executive privilege in an effort to block requests for information about its role in the firing of U.S. attorneys , Abramoff and other matters .
In the U.S. attorney case , Rove deputy Jennings used the RNC e-mail system to write to D. Kyle Sampson , then Atty .
Gen. Alberto Gonzales ’ chief of staff , in August 2006 about replacing Arkansas U.S. Atty .
H.E. “ Bud ” Cummins III with former Rove protege Tim Griffin .
“ We ’re a go for the U.S. atty plan .
WH leg , political and communications have signed off and acknowledged that we have to be committed to following through once the pressure comes , ” Jennings wrote in an e-mail from the gwb43.com domain name .
Sampson noted in a related e-mail that “ getting him appointed was important to ” Rove , then - White House Counsel Harriet E. Miers and other officials .
The gwb43.com account , and others like it , have been traced to the Republican National Committee computer servers , Waxman ’s staff said .
Doug Sosnik , White House political director under Clinton , says that his office had a small number of separate computers and cellphones for campaign - related matters but that the scope of the political operation was smaller than that in the Bush White House .
For both administrations , the separate system was an acknowledgment that certain White House jobs necessarily mixed policy and politics .
Though campaign - related activity is prohibited for federal workers on the job , White House appointees typically work extraordinarily long hours and are required to be available around the clock .
Sosnik said only a handful of people used the political computers in the Clinton White House , which were purchased with campaign funds .
However , he said , the political messaging from the Bush team appears to have been broader than that of Clinton ’s .
He could recall no instance , for example , in which campaign computers or cellphones were used to communicate with the Justice Department .
Levine , the former Bush press aide , said he saw senior White House colleagues , including Rove and his top staff , moving fluidly between the two computer systems , which often sat on officials ’ desks along with their government computers .
But Levine said he found the two computers with their separate purposes and log - in procedures confusing and inefficient .
So he quietly slid his RNC laptop into a desk drawer , deciding to use the telephone rather than e-mail to communicate anything that was not considered official government business .
“ In retrospect , ” he said last week , “ I was lucky . ”

" The Addams Family " started out as a cartoon in The New Yorker in 1938 .
Back then , the family was still nameless .
The first cartoon depicted a vacuum cleaner salesman trying to sell his goods to a woman in an old run down Mansion .
Inside the house were the first glimpses of some of the mainstay characters .
Every year the creepy , kooky , mysterious and spooky family grew a little more and became a popular attraction in the magazine .
The timeline of the family is here : with a television show launching in 1964 , a 1973 cartoon show by Hanna Barbera , a 1977 Halloween special , 1991 and 1993 feature films ( a third that went straight to video ) , another animated series in 1992 and finally in 1998 The New Addams Family tv series .
With all of this , it 's hard to believe that the only time the fam really succeeded was in syndication and ( for the most part ) at the box office .
You'd think after all this The Addams Family would finally be able to rest in peace , but it 's just been announced they 'll be hitting Broadway , in a musical : " the producers said ' The Addams Family ' musical was scheduled for the 2009 - 10 Broadway season .
The libretto will be written by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice , writers of the 2006 Tony Award - winning musical ' Jersey Boys . ' "
According to Playbill , this was announced yesterday by the new Broadway development and production company , Elephant Eye Theatrical - after rights were granted by the Tee and Charles Addams Foundation .
This will be the Addams first time on stage .

It took Microsoft six years to move Internet Explorer versions from 6 to 7 .
IE8 should be along a little quicker - it is slated for release within two years , less than three years after IE7's October 2006 debut .
But Microsoft has a big , big task on its hands : how to improve support for web standards in IE , without breaking millions of websites .
Full standards compliance and backward compatibility do not go hand - in - hand for this web browser , alas .
So , Microsoft is preparing to invite community feedback via a blog on how best to square this circle .
Chris Wilson , IE group program manager , today told MIX07 that Microsoft may " need authors to opt into standards " , suggesting a " compatible with IE 8.0 " scheme .
In an interview with The Register , Wilson said he did n't want to take such a heavy - handed approach , but Microsoft does n't want to break websites either .
He said Microsoft could n't make the necessary changes to IE through the standards process .
With the clock ticking on IE 8.0 and a long list of fixes , and new and updated features already in the product pipeline , Microsoft seems desperate to avoid a repeat of the engineering and PR nightmare that was standards compatibility in IE 7.0 .
Some IE 8.0 features stem from problems that Microsoft encountered in IE 7.0 .
These were considered too big to tackle and attributable to Microsoft 's use of its own technologies rather than industry standards .
According to Wilson , Microsoft has " lots more to do " in CSS - with bugs persisting in floating point elements and hasLayout - scripting and COM , and events and APIs not matching the DOM specification .
A key problem , though , is Microsoft 's core layout engine , Trident , introduced 10 years ago .
This has been updated but remains less compliant with official standards than competing browsers .
Prior to shipment of IE 7.0 , Microsoft admitted its new browser would fail the Web Standards Project 's ACID2 browser compatibility test .
" It 's challenging for us to support standards , " Wilson said .
The " core of Trident is great code " .
While consulting the community on IE 8.0 should be commended , one goal could be to outsource responsibility on which standards Microsoft should support and for any resulting site breakages .
" By asking authors to say ' I want standards behaviors ' means we do n't have to worry about standards compatibility .
That means we can break our compatibility with layout and CSS .
We can change DOM APIs without breaking any current pages , " Wilson said . ®
One day you 're gonna wake up , America .
And , like every other one since last you can remember , it 's gonna be an ugly morning .
One day you 're gonna wake up and go to your lousy job with its lousy salary and non-existent benefits .
You might even remember the good job you once had .
Or that the government you once supported gave tax breaks to companies like the one that exported that good job of yours to the Third World ( which is what they 're now starting to call your country ) .
Or that that same government undermined the labor unions which fought to get you your good wages and benefits .
One day you 're gonna wake up and be furious at the monstrous tax burden you are carrying , a tab which accounts for fifty of the seventy hours you must work each week just to eke by .
You might even figure out why your tax bill is so high .
You might remember that the government you once supported shifted the tax burden from the rich onto people like you , and from the taxpayers of the time onto those of today .
And that they borrowed money in astonishing quantities to fund their sleight - of - hand , so that you work thirty hours a week just to pay the interest on a mountain of money borrowed decades ago .
One day you 're gonna wake up in anger at the absurdly poor education your children are receiving .
You 're gonna remember that it was n't always that way , that even after the military 's voracious appetite was temporarily sated , your country still managed to find a few bucks to at least educate a workforce .
No more .
And you 're gonna remember how you applauded when your educational system was twisted in to a test taking industry that is careful , above all , not to teach children how to think .
One day you 're gonna wake up literally sick and tired .
You 're gonna want treatment for your maladies but you wo n't be able to touch the cost .
You 're gonna wonder what you were thinking when believed your country had the best healthcare system in the world , even though it was the only advanced democracy in the world that did n't provide universal care , even though it devoted fifty percent more of its economy than those other countries to pay for a system that left fifty million people uninsured , and even though there were massive layers of unnecessary and harmful private sector bureaucracy skimming hundreds of billions of dollars of profits out of the system in the name of free enterprise .
One day you 're gonna wake up too tired to go to work anymore .
You 're gonna want to retire in dignity but will be left instead to laugh bitterly at the cruelty of that joke .
And you 're gonna wonder what in the world you had been thinking voting for a president who 's primary goal was to allow Wall Street to raid Social Security , destroying what had once been considered the most successful domestic program in human history .
One day you 're gonna wake up and wish that it was n't so bloody hot , and that there were n't so many diseases and species eradications and violent storms lashing the planet .
And maybe you 'll even remember that you once supported a government that lied about the very existence of global warming - back when it might have been curtailed - a government that scuttled the barest remedy for the problem in order to protect oil company profits .
One day you 're gonna wake up and wish you had a government that could simply and competently do the basic things it was designed for .
A government that could protect you from foreign attack , that could come to your rescue after a devastating hurricane , that could properly manage a new program or other people 's security .
An administration that did n't pervert the purpose of every agency within the government to its opposite , using civil rights lawyers to fight civil rights , for example , or the EPA to protect polluters .
One day you 're gonna wake up and cry out for simple justice , blindly applied without bias .
And perhaps you 'll remember when that principle died .
When your country stood by and watched the politicization of its judicial system for purposes of partisanship , and said nothing .
When it stood by and watched its highest law enforcement officials in the land lie about their failing memory of events and pretended to believe that was acceptable .
One day you 're gonna wake up and wish that you were n't being drafted to go fight wars you do n't believe in .
You 'll remember how soldiers were sent to their deaths for lies .
You 'll remember how badly they were treated when they came home maimed and twisted .
You 'll remember how real , patriotic , former soldiers were mocked and humiliated by dress - up , unpatriotic , former non-soldiers .
And suddenly you 'll understand why no one would volunteer for the military anymore , and why people like you had to be drafted .
One day you 're gonna wake up and want very badly to run outside and scream in anger about a government that long ago stopped serving your interests in favor of the narrow interests of a tiny oligarchy .
But instead you 'll stay inside and keep your scream tucked safely in your belly .
Because you 'll know that in your country dissent has long since been outlawed , on pain of torture and death .
You 'll remember concepts like due process , limitations on government search , seizure and wiretapping , habeas corpus , trial by peers , legal representation and prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment as historical artifacts no longer even taught in schools .
On day you 're gonna wake up and want so badly to change governments .
You 're gonna treasure the concept of democracy like no Soviet dissident ever did .
You 're gonna crave the opportunity to own your own government , to make your own societal choices , to make a change of direction never before so desperately necessary .
And you 're gonna wonder why you did n't speak up as you watched first - hand the dismantling of the democracy you had been handed by previous generations of patriots .
You 're gonna wish you had been patriotic enough yourself to demand , above all else , free and fair elections , and you 're gonna shake your head in puzzlement at how you stood by watching in silence those that patently were not .
One day you 're gonna wake up and want to get the hell out of your rotting , repressive country .
You 're gonna remember a time when that was n't true .
But , oddly enough , you 'll find that other countries remember too .
They 'll remember your country 's arrogance , its unilateralism , its walls , its racism , and its politicized abuse of immigrants .
And they 'll remember how your government undermined and violently replaced theirs whenever corporations from your country had their profits threatened .
You 're gonna want to leave , but there will be nowhere you 'll be welcome .
You 're gonna find out that walls can face both directions .
One day you 're gonna wake up in a hostile world where your country no longer has any friends .
There will be governments of other countries - former long - standing allies - that cannot afford to have anything to do with you , lest their publics angrily remove them from office for collaborating with a country as hated as yours .
Nor will those governments trust yours anyway .
They will perhaps possess intelligence that could save your life , but they will not share it .
They will possess forces that could help you survive real security threats , but they will not provide them .
Your country will have become an international pariah , the South Africa of the twenty - first century .
And because no one will assist you , one day you 're gonna wake up fearing for your life as your country is brutally attacked by angry militants deploying weapons of mass destruction against your cities .
Long dormant connections in your brain will resurface , and you will dimly understand why .
On this day - perhaps March 20 , 2023 - you might be assisted in your comprehension by the message of one of the attackers , someone whose family your country callously destroyed in its mission accomplished in Iraq , and who spent the next twenty years plotting this day 's revenge .
And you will wonder again why you stood by as your country attacked Iraq on a completely bogus pretext .
You 'll remember applauding when this mailed fist was long ago sent .
And , just as it comes hurling back in your direction at a lethal velocity , stamped " Return to Sender " , you 'll wonder what you were thinking .
And you 'll realize just how much you were n't .
One day you 're gonna wake up , America , and you 're gonna find out what was happening while you were sprawled on the couch watching endless mind - numbing loops of CSI , Desperate Housewives or Dancing with the Stars .
One day you 're gonna wake up and realize that catching all the action during week seven of the 2011 NFL season really was n't so critical in the greater scheme of things after all .
One day you 're gonna wake up and wished you 'd invested a little more energy into monitoring and choosing the people who made monumental decisions on your behalf .
One day , with a flash of remorse greater than you thought it possible that one human vessel could contain , you 'll remember the ignored warning shots across your bow .
Moments later , you 'll discover the human capacity for searing remorse is actually even greater still , as you contemplate your inattention even to the shots that were fired right through the bow .
With a fury you would yesterday have thought yourself incapable of , you 'll hurriedly attempt to affix Band - Aids to the tattered splinters remaining from your country 's once sturdy hull .
But you 'll learn quickly the toll of those years spent wasted in a civic coma .
You 'll find that no amount of patchwork can any longer save this sinking ship from its appointment with the dustbin of history .
In shame , you 'll regret the callous arrogance with which you laughingly dismissed those who sounded the early clarion call .
" We are destroying ourselves " , they tried to tell you .
But even on the rare occasion when you roused yourself from your stupor long enough to learn the slightest bit about the very threats that jeopardized your life and that of your species , still you found it more reassuring to follow the blustering worst amongst us , with their patently absurd pretended confidence , and their ever constant resort to the cheapest of false solutions , and the rudest of demeanors .
One day , you 'll desperately search for hope of any sort , but none will remain .
Nothing will be left to save you .
One day you 'll realize that once there were solutions , but that that day is now long past .
You 'll see that human technological capacity ran its evolutionary race with wisdom , and the latter came in second .
You 'll sadly realize that you stood by while your country led the once great tool - making species to its own destruction .
One day you 're gonna wake up , America , and realize how far it 's all gone .
But if that day is n't very soon , it wo n't matter .
Because one day you 're gonna wake up , and it will be far , far too late .

Trademark Bill Would Severely Limit Speech of Artists , Small Business Owners , Others ; Groups Urge Against Passage
Judiciary Committee to Consider Trademark Dilution Revision Act on Feb. 16
WASHINGTON , D.C. – Several consumer , arts and public interest groups today jointly sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee condemning provisions in the Trademark Dilution Revision Act ( H.R. 683 ) that weaken protections for individuals and small businesses that refer to companies by their trademarks .
The groups – the American Library Association , Public Citizen , the Electronic Frontier Foundation , Public Knowledge , Professional Photographers of America , the Society of Children ’s Book Writers & Illustrators , and National Video Resources – also suggested minor changes to the bill that would maintain protection against big companies when people cite their trademarks .
The committee is scheduled to consider the bill on Feb. 16 .
Consumers and artists are currently protected from being sued for trademark infringement by companies if the use of the trademark is for “ fair use ” – a use that must meet a complex legal test – for news reporting / commentary , or for non-commercial use , but the recently House - passed bill ( HR 683 ) eliminates the current non-commercial protection that the public receives .
For instance , when Don McLean sang about driving his Chevy to the levee and finding the levee dry , the songwriter could have been sued for trademark dilution under the current language of the bill .
Or when Walter Mondale criticized Gary Hart during the 1984 primaries by using Wendy ’s slogan , “ Where ’s the beef , ” the remarks could be considered a trademark violation under the bill as passed by the House .
According to the groups , this measure would severely limit small business owners , artists , photographers , illustrators and consumers from mentioning or using references to companies ’ trademarks .
The result would force individuals who are being sued by companies to use a defense that is more difficult to prove .
“ Unfortunately , some trademark owners are not content with using trademarks to inform consumers of their sponsorship , but would like to expand the trademark laws to interfere with robust commentary , ” the letter from the groups said .

All aboard in Budapest
A tank clattered across the cobbles of Budapest this week in a bizarre throwback to the 1956 Hungarian Uprising .
Anti-government protesters hijacked a Soviet - era tank - removed from a museum display - and drove it around before being arrested .
It made me wonder how easy these metal monsters are to drive .
You can't just walk up to one , turn an ignition key , and off you go - or can you ?
Several surplus tanks now lurk in fields dotted around the Home Counties where those in search of a day 's corporate bonding can give them a whirl .
Most are ex-British Army Chieftains , but some are T - 34s , the type " borrowed " from the exhibition in Budapest .
Top gear
Whereas most tanks have a separate crew hatch for the driver , the T - 34 requires me to climb over the wheels and tracks and haul myself up onto the turret top to access the driver 's controls .
These tanks are quite tall and the 2.7 m tests my muscles - most crewmen were 18 - year old agile striplings .
It 's very loud and I catch pungent lungfuls of its generous exhaust fumes
As everything is manually operated , the clutch pedal is surprisingly light .
I press the start button and feel the foot pedal vibrate as the 500 horsepower engine kick in .
I lean forward uncomfortably with my right hand to reach the gear stick ( five forward , one reverse ) and rev the engine almost to screaming pitch before selecting the gears , then the 32 tons of metal monster lurches forward .
I hit my head .
There are two steering sticks , a right and a left , to which the T - 34 responds sluggishly .
A sharp pull back on the left one and the left brake engages , slewing the beast in that direction .
It 's surprisingly manoeuvrable , but very loud and I catch pungent lungfuls of its generous exhaust fumes as I pirouette the monster about .

The 1956 uprising in Hungary
But I do n't know how so many young soldiers managed to cope in such an environment .
Being cheap and mass - produced , T - 34s were decidedly chilly in winter and stiflingly hot in summer ; if the main gun was fired , the tank would lurch with the recoil , then the inside filled up with fumes as the gun breach was opened on reloading .
Anyone could drive a basic tank , especially the T - 34 , though tank novices may find it stalls easily .
No surprise then that tanks have often been hijacked by civilians in uprisings , whether Paris in 1944 , Budapest in 1956 or Prague in 1968 .
But in 2006 , shouting " fill her up " to the service station attendant would lighten your pocket instantly : a T - 34 takes 545 litres of diesel and uses two litres for every kilometre .
Open source software allows users to read and alter code
George Osborne said the savings would cut 5 % off Whitehall 's annual IT bill .
He called for a more " level playing field " for all software companies , and urged " cultural change " in government .
Open source software allows users to read , alter and improve its code - in contrast to proprietary software where a company controls the source code .
In a speech on Thursday , Mr Osborne said that despite a government report in 2004 saying there would be " significant savings " in hardware and software if open source software was used , many government departments had not implemented it .
All too often a government IT system is incompatible with other types of software , which stifles competition and hampers innovation

" The problem is that the cultural change has not taken place in government , " he said .
He listed various countries which have successfully used open source software for government projects , including Japan switching its entire payroll system over with an expected halving of costs .
In the UK some public bodies had used open source software , such as Bristol City Council and Carmathenshire County Council , with savings .
The Department for Education and Skills found that on average primary schools using open source software cut IT costs per PC by 50 % , he said .
Transforming politics
Using open source software was about " better and more effective government " .
He criticised government IT procurement for lacking " open standards " and making it difficult for small companies to get the contracts .
" All too often a government IT system is incompatible with other types of software , which stifles competition and hampers innovation .
" Looking at the litany of IT projects that have collapsed or spiralled over budget , it 's clear too that this has meant billions of pounds wasted and public service reform being hampered , " Mr Osborne said .
" The government 's approach needs to be overhauled . "
As technology changes , with more people able to access more information , Mr Osborne said : " The internet age is transforming politics and has the capacity to transform government . "

Partying on down , in both senses of the word Cocaine is an addictive Class A drug , its use widely deplored .
Yet , as recent events perhaps show , its sphere of influence is wider than we might think .
So , do we have a paradoxical attitude to the drug ?
Everyone enjoys a party now and again , so who could begrudge those celebrities who populate the pages of the tabloid press with tales of their " partying " antics ?
Yet all is not what it might seem with such stories .
One interesting aspect to emerge from the deluge of coverage following last month 's allegations that Kate Moss had snorted cocaine was the use of the word " partying " .
Frequently it is a euphemism for doing drugs .
" Celebrities are forever saying in interviews : ' X was partying a lot at that time ' , " wrote author and journalist Anna Blundy .
" What they mean is that they were addicted to drugs . "
This revelation will come as no surprise to many insiders .
From LA to London , cocaine has long been known as a social lubricant .
It is a stimulant , helping users feel alert and socially confident .
It dulls the inhibitions that most of us have , to a greater or lesser extent , when mixing with a bunch of people we do n't know very well .
Robbie Williams claims to have taken coke with journalists
In some parts of some industries - fashion , public relations , the media , city trading , pop music , to name just a few - socialising into the small hours is part of the job .
And coke is part of the scene .
Robbie Williams last weekend highlighted what he saw as hypocritical views towards the drug in the media , saying he had personally taken cocaine with journalists who had criticised Kate Moss for doing the same .
For all its associations of glamour , cocaine use is not condoned by modern mainstream society - though things were different in the 19th Century , when it could be found in dozens of medicines on sale in High Street chemists .
While legalisation of cannabis , a so - called soft drug , is a perennial debate , heroin and crack occupy the other end of the spectrum .
Hard and highly addictive , they draw in the desperate , and turn them into junkies .
But despite having the same Class A status , cocaine occupies a more paradoxical place .
While the media overtly abhors it , in the very same breath it laps up the glamorised celebrity culture that cocaine helps perpetuate .
What 's more , sections of society have increasingly come to imitate these values , as individuals become accustomed to spending more on going out and enjoying themselves .
The falling cost of cocaine has also made it more accessible .
Mark is 33 , owns his own flat , rides a scooter around London and knows how to apply himself in his skilled job of website development .
He also enjoys cocaine .
' Socially acceptable '
He is just the sort of person Sir Ian Blair , the Metropolitan Police commissioner , had in his sights when last year he vowed to target middle class cocaine users who think it is " socially acceptable " .
COCAINE FACTS
Street price has fallen to about £ 40 per gram Bought as a ' wrap ' , can be padded out with sugar , starch etc Effects are short - lived , can result in a flu - like ' hangover '
Cocaine use has risen sharply in the past nine years , albeit from a low base .
Latest figures show 2.4 % of 16 - 59 - year - olds in England and Wales had used cocaine in the past 12 months - up from 0.6 % in 1996 .
In the mid-90s ecstasy and hallucinogenic drugs were more popular than cocaine .
Today , coke is the second most popular illegal drug , after cannabis .
The steepest rise has been within the 25 - 34 age group - which includes Mark - where almost 6 % took coke in the previous year .
Mark first tried cocaine when he was 19 and his usage now goes in fits and starts .
" I 'm waiting for a delivery now , for the weekend .
It 's a friend 's birthday .
But it 's been six weeks since I last took it , " he says .
Last year , though , there was a two - month stretch where he took cocaine every weekend .
He likes the drug 's ability to " perk you up " on a Friday night , at a bar with a drink after a tiring week , and how it oils the wheels in a social situation .
" There 's also the social aspect of going to the loos with a friend and giving them a line of coke .
It 's a friendly act , and it's also a bit naughty . "
Health issues
The drawbacks of snorting coke include damage to the lining of the nose , which leads to surges in blood pressure caused by the narrowing of coronary arteries .
Users can suffer chest pains which can lead to heart attacks or strokes , and some experience an itch , known as " cocaine bugs " .
Boy George has denied cocaine use over the weekend , but Frank Bruno admitted to it Aside from the physical problems , regular use can also lead to psychosis and severe depression , say experts .
And , as with all illegal drugs , it can create a divide between those friends and family who also use them , and those who do n't .
So far though , Mark has seen nothing of these effects - either in him , or his network of about 15 friends who also take coke .
" You might have a bad night , but you 'd have that on alcohol .
None of us has been hospitalised from coke . "
The alcohol point is an important one for Mark and those like him , who argue there is a moral equivalence between alcohol and drugs like cocaine .
Yet one is legal and one is banned .
" You go into the bars where I work and you know people are taking it .
It 's going on and everyone knows it .
Celebrities take coke all the time , but it 's just not reported .
It 's like [ comedian ]
Bill Hicks said - you 've got to have a war on something . "
Add your comments to this story using the form below : I 'm a 30 year old professional who uses coke from time to time .
I like to party every now and then , for special occasions .
Sometimes it 's very infrequent , with several months in between , other times you might have a more hectic month .
The media are hypocrites .
Cocaine use by the press , and by people in TV in general is rife .
However , I 'm glad it 's illegal because it would get out of hand - like drink is for wider society today .
But generally speaking , the addictiveness and social corruption that is portrayed as going hand - in - hand with cocaine is one of those urban myths .
Most users do it very casually , in modest amounts every now and then and it is not a problem .
Andy , London , UK
Although I do not condone drug use of any kind , cocaine is so over rated .
I have seen more deaths , violence and anti social behaviour from effects of alcohol .
But this is a nice taxable drug so nothing is ever done about it .
I would like to see figures comparing deaths from drug related abuse compared with deaths from alcohol related abuse , I think the figures speak for themselves .
Let 's face it , at around £ 60 a gram who can afford cocaine , apart from the rich and socialites .
You can get 24 cans of Carling for £ 10 ..
TC , UK I occasionally take cocaine , and so do most of my friends .
I know several people who have had problems with drink , but no one who has become addicted with cocaine , mainly because its to expensive to take regularly .
Neil , Birmingham Quite apart from the legal and health questions , what strikes me as odd is that the same metropolitan types who would only ever buy organic and fair - trade food see it as " socially acceptable " to perpetuate the world 's most immoral industry , which thinks nothing of participating in every crime from arms dealing to people trafficking , prostitution and murder .
How can they say it is just like alcohol ?
Seb , London
Would the person in the story be happy about taking those drugs if he was aware of the misery caused to get him his 15 minutes of happiness ?
Chris Wills , UK
Good to see a more honest , less knee - jerk report on cocaine use .
One thing that the article fails to mention is that people on coke generally become arrogant and obnoxious .
Will , UK I 'm not sure where this view of Cocaine being socially deplored comes from .
Certainly no - one in my group of friends has a particularly negative attitude towards it .
It seems the only people thinking cocaine is the worst thing since the invention of the gun are those enforcing its illegality .
Andy , Reading , UK Why is Cocaine socially unacceptable ?
It is used in every walk of life , from plumbers to policemen .
I do n't use it myself , but would never condemn someone else for it - it 's very small minded to portray it as a celebrity drug - or that people taking it are aping celebrities .
It 's been in every area of society for a long time and I 'm surprised it 's even a topic for discussion .
Magnus , Switzerland
You have totally missed one fundamental point about cocaine in your story .
And that is the effect on other people around you .
For several years I worked with a few people who had coke habits .
And the whole experience was a nightmare .
It makes people paranoid , utterly selfish and gives them a hugely inflated opinion of themselves and their abilities .
It was the hardest job I ever had , purely because of this horrible substance that they thought was " fashionable " to take .
John , UK
Thank you for publishing this interesting and thought - provoking article .
It 's great to see journalists moving beyond the far too simplistic " drugs are bad " mantra .
Although it 's for each to make up his / her own mind on this difficult issue , at least different sides of the debate are being aired .
Deepak Nambisan , London
Why waste your lives on addictive drugs ?
There is a lot more mature ways to enjoy yourself out there !
Take a drink or play a sport .
It 's healthier !
Dennis O Rourke , Ireland
One thing not mentioned in the article about regular consumers of cocaine is how obnoxious many people become when on the drug .
That 's what does the long - term damage .
Anna , UK
My friends got into cocaine , and after a few months of dabbling , they could n't go out without it .
The mix of alcohol and coke always turned them into violent , aggressive people , and they became more and more selfish and self - consumed , turning their backs on family and friends alike , just to get high .
I am no longer friends with these people , and personally I do n't think the drug should be treated as ' recreational ' .
It is almost more damaging to society than binge - drinking and turns even the nicest person into an angry , and needy being , sometimes even a criminal , just for the sake of a line .
Hazel Miller , England
A friend of mine takes an awful lot of coke which started off as a weekend thing and then he suddenly realised that he was doing it on a Monday ...
Tuesday and then my goodness , is it really Thursday ?
Almost the weekend again and time for more ' sniff ! '
When I pointed out that he will end up suffering from " Westbrooke nostril syndrome " he said , " Ah , well ... I will be able to fit more in that way ! "
Sean C , UK Quote : " Celebrities are forever saying in interviews : ' X was partying a lot at that time ' , " wrote author and journalist Anna Blundy .
" What they mean is that they were addicted to drugs .
" No what they mean is that they were TAKING drugs .
How can a supposedly bona - fide journalist twist the term ' partying ' into addiction .
Edd , UK
The collusion between the media and celebrities over the years has served to make cocaine usage seem very normal , fashionable , a bit naughty but ultimately safe .
On the one hand , says the press , it 's OK as long as you do n't get found out , but if you do get found out we will feign horror .
None of the coverage is at all helpful to ordinary people like me trying to raise children to aware of the dangers of drugs .
Lorraine , St Albans , UK Compare how many people die from class A substance use with the number killed by ' socially acceptable ' drugs such as alcohol , and the danger of illegal substances is shown to be negligible .
Politicians and journalists alike love a tipple of course , so no stigma is attached to G&Ts .
Some people would call that hypocrisy .
Chris Lockie , UK
Well done for showing a balanced view on this subject .
, The one thing that puts me off cocaine ahead of anything else is the sheer misery it causes in the countries where it 's produced , and the manipulation and intimidation of the " mules " - usually vulnerable women - who are used to bring it into the country .
Reading your recent story on here about Sonia who was forced to choke down cocaine or face threats to her children , I wonder that anyone can justify their weekend high when it costs such a high price to someone else .
Chandra , England
Take it - or do n't - but it 's unfair of the media and politicians to accept that the use of cocaine is rife when it suits them and to stigmatise people on a whim .
Cheryl ,
If anyone wants a moral reason not to do cocaine , it 's because it 's the worst cash crop in existence - there are many thousands of farmers in South America who are forced to grow it because it 's the only crop that will make them any money .
Developed countries dump subsidised surpluses on them , and local farmers can't compete with the prices .
This means they get locked into a cycle of poverty where they have to grow coke - they hardly see any profits , as most of the money is taken by the local cartels who then rule with an iron fist .
It 's ironic that celebrities and the middle class , who are so eager to support fair trade initiatives on one hand , should nonetheless effectively support such a corrupt system with the other .
Rob , UK I think there are some very pertinent questions raised in this article , especially about the hypocrisy of tabloid journalists .
They scream for the sacking of Kate Moss but one wonders how many of them would go straight from work and do much the same .

When an Iraqi wedding reception is attacked by American planes , killing some 45 civilians , that is called " collateral damage , " an accidental cost of war .
When an American Army Ranger is killed by another American soldier in a firefight in Afghanistan , that is called " friendly fire . "
And friendly fire can be so embarrassing to the top command that it may have to be kept secret from the family and from the world .
That is what happened in the case of Pat Tillman , an inspector general 's investigation fully confirmed nearly three years later .
Now we learn that accounts of the circumstances of Mr. Tillman 's death were altered as they went up the chain of command .
On whose orders ?
By the time the job was finished , four generals and five other officers had had some hand in concocting the elaborate lie .
What the Pentagon knew and what the White House knew remains to be disclosed .
But clearly there was concern at higher levels about how Americans would react to the loss of a famous football star such as Tillman to American guns .
So , on the basis of an invented story , Tillman was awarded a posthumous silver star for heroism and promoted to corporal .
Maybe this is all a product of the time we live in , when one alters reality when reality is too unpleasant to contemplate .
Another concocted story , but with a happier ending , was about Pfc. Jessica Lynch , who was the subject of an Army fiction about fighting off Iraqi soldiers in an ambush .
She said the story of the " little girl Rambo from the hills who went down fighting " was an entire invention .
Ms. Lynch has already been the subject of a television movie .
" I am still confused as to why they chose to lie , " she said in congressional testimony last week .
And Tillman 's brother , Kevin , speaks bitterly about how the Army , leaving the family in ignorance , used Pat to fashion an inspirational message .
Inspirational , but false .
When I think of these incidents , I think of the author Sissela Bok and her book , " Lying : Moral Choice in Public and Private Life . "
She writes , " Trust and integrity are precious resources , easily squandered , hard to regain . "

Are you just starting out as a runner , or is it something you ’d like to do ?
From experience , I know that a beginner runner has a million questions and never enough answers .
I wo n’t be able to answer every question here , but this should be a good starting point for anyone who wants to hit the roads .
Disclaimer : I am not a certified trainer , coach or running expert .
I consider myself an intermediate runner ( on the lower levels of intermediate ) , having spent all last year running , doing a marathon , some half marathons , 20Ks , 10Ks and 5 Ks .
But what I have to share is what I ’ve learned along the way .
Also , see a doctor before starting a new running program — I do n’t want to be responsible for any heart attacks !
Most Important Advice
Many people , when the begin running , shoot for the stars .
I was one of those .
Let me tell you right now : hold yourself back , and start out slowly .
Progress gradually .
It takes some patience , but this is the best advice I can give you , and I know that it ’s important because of experience .
It ’s best to start out very easy , at a slow jog , and focus not on intensity but on how long you ’re on the road .
Start out with a small amount of time — 10 minutes or 20 minutes , depending on where you are — and run or walk / run comfortably the entire time .
Do this for the entire first week , and even two weeks if you can stand it .
Gradually increase your time until you can run 30 minutes .
From there , you can stay at 30 minutes or increase the amount of time you run gradually , every two weeks .
But do not overdo it in the beginning !
Walk and Run Plan
If you are a true beginner , and cannot run for 10 minutes , you should start out with a walk / run plan .
Here ’s a good one to start with ( do each one three times a week ) :
Week 1 : Walk for 10 minutes .
Jog slowly for 1 minute , and then walk for 1 minute .
Repeat these 1/1 intervals for 10 minutes , or until you become uncomfortable .
Walk for 5 minutes to cool down .
Week 2 : Walk for 10 minutes .
Jog slowly for 2 minutes , and then walk for 2 minutes .
Repeat these 2/2 intervals for 10 minutes , or until you become uncomfortable .
Walk for 5 minutes to cool down .
Week 3 : Walk for 10 minutes .
Jog slowly for 3 minutes , and then walk for 2 minutes .
Repeat these 3/2 intervals for 15 minutes , or until you become uncomfortable .
Walk for 5 minutes to cool down .
Week 4 : Walk for 10 minutes .
Jog slowly for 5 minutes , and then walk for 2 minutes .
Repeat these 5 /2 intervals for 20 minutes , or until you become uncomfortable .
Walk for 5 minutes to cool down .
You get the picture .
The idea is to gradually increase your running time until you can do 10 minutes straight .
Then increase the 10 minutes to 12 , and so on , each week , until you can eventually run for 30 minutes .
Now you ’re a runner !
Online forums
In the beginning , you ’ll have a lot of questions and want to share your progress with others .
An online forum is perfect for that .
Join a forum or two , read as much as you can , introduce yourself , post your questions , post your weekly progress , and gain from the experience of others .
A few good forums to start with :
Make it a habit
If you struggle with making running a regular habit , try doing it every single day at the same time .
Habits are easiest to form if you do them consistently .
This may sound contradictory to some of the advice above about starting slowly , but the key is to go very easy in the beginning — nothing that will stress your body out or make you sore the next day .
Also , instead of running every day , you could swim or bike or do strength training , so that your running muscles are given a rest while you continue to form your exercise habit .
See How to Make Exercise a Daily Habit for more .
Most important advice : just lace up your shoes , and get out the door .
After that , it ’s cake .
The importance of rest
Some runners try to go hard every single day .
They are ignoring the truth about muscles — your muscles grow by giving them stress , and allowing them to rest after the stress so that they can grow .
If you run hard every day , you will just continually break your muscles down , and improvement will be slow and difficult — and it could lead to burnout or injury .
It ’s best to rest the day after a tough run , to allow your body to recover .
Does this mean you should rest completely , with no running or exercise at all ?
Not necessarily .
The important thing is that you do n’t run hard two days in a row .
But you can do a very easy , short run ( or other type of easy exercise ) in between harder runs and still allow your muscles to recover .
First 5K
One of the most motivating things in running is an upcoming race .
I suggest you sign up for a 5 K after a month or two of running , even if you do n’t think you ’re ready .
Why ?
It will motivate you to keep running , so that you ’re prepared to do the 5K .
Now , some people have a nervousness about signing up for a running race , because the other runners are so much better than them .
Relax .
There are plenty of very good runners in every race , but there are also many beginners .
Do n’t worry about the other runners .
There ’s usually so many people at a 5 K that you wo n’t be noticed .
And do n’t be afraid to walk or run / walk .
Many , many other people do .
Just run your own race , and most importantly , have fun !
It ’s a blast .
On manners : do not start out a race in the front , unless you think you can win it .
Slower runners should start in the back , or they get in everyone ’s way .
Also , stay to the right , so people can pass you .
Try to be courteous , and not push or cut someone off .
Watch out when you spit — you might hit someone behind you .
Same thing with snotrockets .
And when you beat that little 11 - year - old girl at the finish line , it ’s best not to point at her and yell “ Loser ! ” repeatedly .
Trust me .
I speak from experience .
Once you do your first 5 K , you ’ll be hooked .
That ’s a warning .
Equipment
So what do you need to run ?
Well , running shorts , shirt and shoes , basically .
Women will need a sports bra ( get a good one , trust me ) .
Should you go out and buy the best running clothes and shoes possible , even before your first run ?
No , it ’s not really necessary .
You can get started running with any pair of comfortable sneakers and any shorts and T - shirt .
But once you really get into it , you ’ll want to buy some real running clothes — breathable fibers , with some comfortable underwear built in ( not cotton ! ) so you do n’t chafe .
A running shirt is also good .
If you live in cold weather , you ’ll need some breathable clothes to put over your shorts and shirt .
I live in the tropics , so I ca n’t advise you here .
Most important : good running shoes .
This is the most important running equipment , because it can not only make running more comfortable , but also prevent injury .
My advice is to go to an actual running store , where there will be knowledgeable people who can watch you run and tell you what kind of shoe you need ( overpronator , supinator , neutral , etc. ) .
If they do n’t watch you run , they do n’t know what they ’re doing .
Get out and find a better store .
Or do your own research online and learn all about it .
Other things that you might consider , but that are n’t completely necessary :
Reflectors and flashing lights if you run when it ’s still dark .
and flashing lights if you run when it ’s still dark .
Body glide , or Vaseline , applied in the crotch , underarms , and anywhere you might chafe — really only important for longer runs .

Heart Rate Monitor : Best ones are by Polar .
You can get fancy ones , with GPS built in , or just a simple one that tells you your heart rate .
This is useful if you do HR training , which is a way of optimizing your training .
Probably not necessary for beginners .

Mp3 player :
Also not necessary , but pretty cool and can add some inspiration to your running .
However , if you run on the road , headphones can be dangerous , as you might not hear traffic coming your way .

Fuel belt or Camelback : A way to keep yourself hydrated while you run .
Not necessary for short runs .
Also , for longer runs ( 60 mins or more ) , I just place water bottles along my route .
Mechanics
I can’t advise you here , as I ’m not a trainer .
But most of the time , you do n’t have to worry about this .
Just try not to fall down .
One thing to watch out for is how tense your upper body is — try to relax your shoulders , relax your hands , relax everything but the muscles needed to propel your body forward .
The reason is that you may be using extra energy ( and tire yourself out faster ) if you ’re running with your fists clenched , for example .
Later , after you get past the beginning stage , you can worry about stride length or turnover rate .
But for now , just worry about getting out there .
Pain
I also ca n’t advise you on injuries .
Unless you have sharp pains , or pain in the joints , you should be able to run through minor aches .
But if you have anything sharp , or your joints feel injured , stop running .
You could make it worse .
The runner ’s best friend is ice , and rest .
In fact , it ’s good to ice your muscles and joints down after every run , if you can .
It helps with the healing process .
Aspirin or Ibuprofen are also good tools , also to help stop inflammation .
Going beyond beginner
Once you ’ve gotten a few 5 Ks under your belt , and have been running for a few months , you ’ll want to start a real training plan and progress to the next level .
Training plans are available online for free ( see some of the sites below ) .

Professors R. Price and A. Nathan Copyright ( c ) 1997 THE COMPLETE THEORY OF SHEEP 1 .
THE CAUSE OF PRECIPITATION BY SHEEP
It is believed that sheep are responsible for the production of precipitation due to the rising to the heavens of a sheep 's soul after its death .
Upon reaching a certain altitude ( dependant on the current atmospheric sheep - soul density ) the sheep 's soul will form a cloud .
Precipitation is then caused when the sheep - soul density rises to such a high extent that the clouds ' burst ' and the sheep - souls fall to earth as rain or snow ( 1 ) .
The exact type of precipitation depends on the nature of the sheep that died , for example a good sheep 's soul will fall to earth as rain due to its warm heart but an evil sheep 's soul will fall to earth as hail or snow ( 2 ) .
A Liberal Democrat sheep 's soul being somewhere in the middle will fall as sleet .
2 . MIST AND FOG
Mist and fog are believed to occur following the death of a large number of sheep ( known as a sheep massacre ) ; this is due to a massive increase in the atmospheric sheep - soul density at a low altitude causing spontaneous low - level cloud creation .
3 . REINCARNATION AND COTTON WOOL
As explained in ( 1 ) above a sheep 's soul will at some time return to earth as a form of precipitation .
This precipitation can be considered to be reincarnation as it is used by the Cotton Wool Plant to create new sheep i.e. the sheep 's soul is re-born .
Cotton
Wool is similar to a bird 's egg - an unfertilised egg remains an egg whereas a fertilised egg grows into a bird , this is identical to the way sheep and cotton wool are formed as cotton wool is merely the unfertilised form of sheep .
4 . THE BIRTH OF CHICKENS
As is well known sheep may shed their wool at various stages of their life , this is in fact the shedding of parts of its body considered no longer suitable for continued life as part of the sheep , i.e. it is rejected .
These parts of rejected sheep will , when they become concentrated enough , form a small fluffy chick which will grow into a large chicken .
( 1 ) This shows that the reason that there is so much rain in Wales generally and specifically in Blaenau Ffestiniog is due to the large concentration of sheep i.e. there is a high sheep density .
Compare this with Australia where although there is a higher number of sheep they are spread out over a large geographic area , therefore the actual sheep density is very low .
It has been suggested that the rainfall in Wales could be reduced and increased in Australia by deporting a large number of sheep .
( 2 ) The solidity will depend upon the psychological strength of the sheep i.e. a weak sheep 's soul will fall as snow whereas a strong ( well ' ard ) sheep 's soul will fall as hail ( the harder the sheep - the bigger the hailstones ) .
From the comments in ( 1 ) above it is suggested that it would be more beneficial if evil sheep are deported as it may help reduce the higher average temperature .
THE SHEEP LIFE CYCLE
🔊 Listen to this
In contemplating the negative effects of the West Bank Jewish settlements on any land - for - peace settlement between Israelis and Palestinians , we have an obligation to look beyond what we consider just or support as legal to what is politically possible , at least in the foreseeable future .
Since , for a variety of reasons , I do n’t believe that the U.S. government will put really significant pressure on Israel in the foreseeable future , it is important to examine what a great majority of the Israeli public would agree to , without great difficulty , regarding the settlements .
Incidentally , in Israeli eyes “ really significant pressure ” means a delay or halt in the delivery of new American weapons , especially aircraft , to Israel .
All the rest is of secondary importance .
The last time any such pressure was employed was by then - Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in 1975 to force then - Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to a withdrawal of some 20 miles in the Sinai Peninsula .
The Israeli public may therefore be forgiven if , after 23 years , with Israel much richer and stronger now than it was in 1975 , it does not take a renewal of such steps seriously .
In those circumstances any positive change of Israeli policies on the settlements will have to be undertaken with the help of a strong section of the Israeli public .
For evaluation of the chances of such a development one has to ignore the very small groups on the left which strongly oppose the settlements ( for example “ Peace Now ” ) and the stronger but still - not - able - to - dictate - policy National Religious Party ( NRP ) , which is totally devoted to settlements .
What is most important are the views of the bulk of the public as represented in the Knesset by about 100 out of 120 Knesset members .
This majority includes Likud , Labor and other important parties whose basic views are by now quite similar .
In order to understand their common position , which I will refer to as “ the Israeli view ” for the sake of brevity , one has to comprehend that the settlements in occupied territories do not appear in the Israeli view as one entity .
Israelis draw sharp distinctions among them which usually are ignored outside Israel .
There is first the distinction between the settlements within “ Greater Jerusalem ” and elsewhere .
When speaking of “ Greater Jerusalem , ” I am using an Israeli urban and social term and I am ignoring the municipal borders of Jerusalem based on the 1967 annexation .
I refer , simply , to what ordinary Israelis regard as “ living in Jerusalem , ” which means living in a place which has good bus connections with West Jerusalem so that one can go by bus for shopping or evening entertainment there and return home by bus before midnight .
More than 250,000 Israelis , about 5 percent of the Israeli population , live in such areas beyond the “ Green Line ” ( the cease - fire line of June 1967 ) , while the population of all other West Bank and Gaza Strip settlements ( I exclude the Golan Heights from this discussion ) amounts to only about 80,000 .
The removal of small Jewish settlements can be done , especially by a right - wing government .
Those 80,000 , moreover , are not solidly packed in a small area closely connected with a big Israeli city as are the Israelis of “ Greater Jerusalem , ” but divided into many mostly small settlements .
( For example , Kiryat Arba , the religious militant settlement overlooking the West Bank city of Hebron , has fewer than 6,000 inhabitants . )
Even more important is the simple fact that for a long time the majority of Israelis have regarded living in “ Greater Jerusalem ” as being “ normal , ” while to live in any of the other settlements is regarded –even by those who regard settling as laudable–as abnormal .
Indeed , the small numbers of settlers in all the other settlements , in spite of the money and other forms of government support poured into them for so long , testify to the great unwillingness of the majority of Israeli Jews to settle in the occupied territories , except in the area of “ Greater Jerusalem . ”
It follows that while it can be predicted that the bulk of Israelis , and the parties representing them , will strongly oppose changes in the area of “ Greater Jerusalem , ” or concessions on the settlements of “ Greater Jerusalem , ” the opposition to removal of settlements ( especially small ones ) outside the area of “ Greater Jerusalem ” would be much weaker .
No More “ Sacred ” Grounds
Indeed , even the National Religious Party or the Gush Emunim settlers no longer dare to appeal to the Israeli public to preserve all the settlements on grounds that they are “ sacred . ”
Their appeals , as of December 1997 , are limited to their claim that the Palestinian Authority has contravened the agreements it signed with Israel , especially the Hebron agreement , and therefore it should not be granted “ concessions ” on any issue until it “ keeps ” those agreements .
The second important distinction which has to be considered is between the settlements themselves and land confiscated ( by various dishonest means which I will not discuss here ) by the State of Israel and “ attributed ” to the settlements .
It is true that among religious Jews ( about 20 percent of Israeli Jews ) and , to a lesser extent among traditional Jews ( about 60 percent of Israeli Jews ) , removal of Jewish settlers by Israeli soldiers from their homes will encounter strong emotional and political difficulties .
However , such removals have been carried out previously in 1982 in the settlements of northern Sinai by the government of Menachem Begin under the supervision of Ariel Sharon .
Therefore , although the removal of small Jewish settlements will cause great difficulties to whatever government carries it out , it can be done , especially by a right - wing government .
As is well known , at least in Israel , about 70 percent of the West Bank area has been confiscated by Israel .
It has become Israeli “ state land ” held , according to Israeli apartheid laws , solely for the benefit of Jews , whether citizens of Israel or of other countries , and because of that denied to Palestinians .
( Even the Palestinians who have collaborated with Israel are denied the right to live on this land or in settlements and so are Palestinian citizens of Israel , even those who have served in the Israeli army . )
However , only about 16 percent of confiscated West Bank areas have been settled , and 54 percent are empty , although formally “ attributed ” to individual settlements or settlement blocks .
For the great majority of Israeli Jews , there is a great difference between returning empty land to its Palestinian owners and dragging Jews out of their homes .
The ordinary Israeli Jew , in my view , will agree quite easily to the first act but can be persuaded to agree to an actual expulsion only with difficulty .
It is therefore quite possible , whatever any Israeli government maintains , to begin returning those uncultivated lands to their owners without too much resistance from a majority of Israeli Jews .
Such an act would , in my opinion , constitute a better “ confidence - building measure ” in the eyes of the majority of West Bank Palestinians than any act so far proposed or carried out .
The fact that such an act , relatively easy to carry out , has not been proposed should raise some doubts about the real intentions of all the parties to the Oslo process and its aftermath , but first of all about the real intentions of the Israeli establishment .
Let me conclude by pointing out that I am not discussing here principles or rights but acts which , in my view , are possible in the present situation .
Politics is the art of the possible , and although people should be true to their principles they can , at the same time , also try to do what is politically feasible to alleviate suffering and bring some , admittedly insufficient , modicum of justice to a very unjust situation .

Back to Top
At the very top , those making more than $ 1 million a year , the data showed that from 2004 to 2006 the number of audits rose 77 percent , from almost 9,600 to 17,000 .
But more than half of those audits were only letters asking for documentation .
The middle class was lightly audited in recent years because it relies mostly on wage income , which is reported by employers and from which taxes are withheld .
The I.R.S. has told Congress that it captures 99 percent of wage income , but only about 70 percent of income in which there is little or no independent verification of the figures that people report on their tax returns .
Middle - class Americans most likely to have their tax returns examined under the new strategy are those who own a business , even a side business , or are landlords or have investment income .
There is little or no independent reporting of such income ; the I.R.S. has proposed increased verification and some withholding of payments to independent contractors to reduce cheating , but Congress has not moved on any of those suggestions .
Middle - class taxpayers who file a Schedule C — freelancers , consultants and very small businesses — are three times as likely to be audited as those in the same income group with no such business income .
The I.R.S. is also increasing scrutiny of people whose returns show they have bought into any of the growing number of schemes sold by people who teach , falsely , that wages are not subject to tax .
Some customers of these schemes have received prison terms of more than 10 years , and the Justice Department is pursuing civil and criminal cases against scores of tax fraud promoters .
Blended families are also more likely to be audited .
The I.R.S. said that it is finding that families created after a divorce , or the death of a spouse , often have children who are claimed on more than one tax return .
The I.R.S. reduced audits in only one category — farms , especially those with income of more than $ 100,000 .
Audits of these larger farms fell by 28 percent from 2,150 audits in 2000 to 1,547 audits last year .
The I.RS . said it cut back because a growing number found no additional taxes were due .
Hyperinflation currently stands at more than 1000 %
The note will be worth about $ 1 at the official exchange rate , but only $ 0.30 on the informal market .
The 50,000 Zimbabwe dollar bill , introduced only four months ago , is not enough to buy a loaf of bread .
The government on Tuesday used its mineral exports to gain access to a $ 50 m loan from a European bank , to pay for essential fuel and drugs .
" It is not the first and last time to see us introducing bearer cheques and we will not hesitate to introduce higher denominations , " Reserve Bank governor Gideon Gono said , according to the state - run Herald newspaper .
The bills are known as bearer cheques since they are promissory notes rather than official legal tender , but are used in Zimbabwe in the same way as money .
Bundles of money
The issuing of bearer cheques began with a note worth 10,000 Zimbabwe dollars , to reduce the need to carry large bundles of paper money .
The government has announced a National Economic Development Priority Programme ( NEDPP ) in order to deal with the economic problems .
Zimbabwe is suffering from shortages of food , fuel and foreign currency .
In April , inflation passed 1,000 % per annum for the first time .
President Robert Mugabe blames domestic and foreign enemies for the problems , while his critics point to the collapse of agricultural exports following a controversial land reform programme .
The country is struggling to pay civil servants and is thought to owe money to neighbours such as South Africa and Mozambique from whom it has been importing electricity and fuel .

If done correctly , you can increase your market - size greatly .
If you do n't , someone else will do it correctly , and your existing business model will be in serious trouble
If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property , it is the action of the thinking power called an idea , which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself ; but the moment it is divulged , it forces itself into the possession of every one , and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it .
Its peculiar character , too , is that no one possesses the less , because every other possesses the whole of it .
He who receives an idea from me , receives instruction himself without lessening mine ; as he who lights his taper at mine , receives light without darkening me .
Redefine the market based on the benefits Break the benefits down into scarce and infinite components .
Set the infinite components free , syndicate them , make them easy to get -- all to increase the value of the scarce components Charge for the scarce components that are tied to infinite components
Redefine the market :
The benefit is musical enjoyment Break the benefits down ( not a complete list ... ) :
Infinite components : the music itself .
Scarce components : access to the musicians , concert tickets , merchandise , creation of new songs , CDs , private concerts , backstage passes , time , anyone 's attention , etc. etc. etc .
Set the infinite components free :
Put them on websites , file sharing networks , BitTorrent , social network sites wherever you can , while promoting the free songs and getting more publicity for the band itself -- all of which increases the value for the final step Charge for the scarce components : Concert tickets are more valuable .
Access to the band is more valuable .
Getting the band to write a special song ( sponsorship ? ) is more valuable .
Merchandise is more valuable .

Ok .
I 'll be the first to admit that I 've taken the long way around in going through my series of posts exploring the economics of goods when scarcity is removed .
What I had thought would be a series of 5 or 6 posts , turned into something much longer -- but each week people came up with new questions or discussions or objections , and so I tried to spend some time digging down on various pieces of the economics at hand .
However , what I have n't done is tie it all together in one single spot .
In the last couple of weeks there 's been tremendous confusion among people from Scott Adams to CNN to various others that have made it abundantly clear that the one thing I 've failed to do is put the whole concept together in a single place .
That 's resulted in people being confused about what I 'm actually saying -- where they only pick up a tiny piece of the argument or confuse it with the arguments made by others .
So , while I still think it was important to go through the details , now is as good a time as any to pull the whole theory together ( with some links back to the previous articles in the series ) .
First off , and this is key , none of what I put forth is about defending unauthorized downloads .
I do n't download unauthorized content ( never have ) and I certainly do n't suggest you do either .
You may very well end up in a lawsuit and you may very well end up having to pay a lot of money .
It 's just not a good idea .
This whole series is from the other perspective -- from that of the content creator and hopefully explaining why they shouldpeople to get their content for free .
That 's because of two important , but simple points :
If that first point is explained clearly , then hopefully the second point becomes self - evident .
However , many people immediately ask , how is it possible that giving away a product can guarantee that you 've increased your market size ?
The first thing to understand is that we 're never suggesting people just give away content and then hope and pray that some secondary market will grant them money .
Giving stuff away for free needs to be part of a complete business model that recognizes the economic realities .
We 'll get to more details on that in a second .
From a high - level perspective , though , the reason that giving non-scarce products away for free will increase your market size goes back to the same Thomas Jefferson quote that we kicked the series off with :
What Jefferson noted is the wonderful feature of a non-scarce , or infinite , good that it is effectively a free resource .
Once created , it costs nothing to give to someone else , and you still retain the original .
In fact , economists have finally realized that this is the very key to economic growth and progress .
The infinite resource known as an " idea " that improves what was already there is what increases the size of a market .
Or , putting it another way , that infinite resource of a new idea makes an existing scarce resource more valuable .
It 's easy to understand that when it's an idea applied to , say , a machine making it more productive -- but it also applies to any infinite resource appropriately bundled with any scarce resource .
The way it works is actually quite easy and fits in with the same basic economics that 's always been in place .
Knocking down the barriers of artificial scarcity opens up tremendous new opportunities -- just as knocking down the artificial scarcity known as " protectionism " helps to grow markets by creating new opportunities .
In this case , those new opportunities have only increased in number as we 've gone digital , making more content infinite in nature .
Where some people have trouble is that those new opportunities may be in different places than the existing opportunities -- and those new opportunities may not all be capturable by the creator of the content .
Indeed , there will be some externalities created by the free flow of an infinite resource .
However , the total amount that any content creator can capture is still much larger than it was before .
It 's one of those cases where getting 20 % of a huge pie is much better than getting 90 % of a tiny pie .
You just start by redefining the market based on the benefits of what you 're providing , rather than the specific product you 're selling .
If you 're focused on selling the benefits , then discovering a better way to sell those benefits is seen as a good thing , rather than a threat .
You then break down the different components that make up those benefits that you 're selling -- and you begin to recognize that every bundle of goods and services that make up the benefit you 're selling has components that are scare as well as components that are infinite .
In fact , if you look closely enough , you realize that any scarce product you buy actually has infinite components while any infinite good you see also tends to have scarce components
Once you 've broken out the components , however , recognizing that the infinite components are what make the scarce components more valuable at no extra cost , you set those free .
Not only do you set those free , you have every incentive to create more of them , and encourage more people to get them .
You break them into easily accessible bites .
You syndicate them .
You hand them out .
You make them easy to share and embed and distribute and promote .
And , yet , all the while , you know exactly what scarce resources those non-scarce goods are tied to , and you 're ready to sell those scarce resources , recognizing that the more people who are consuming the infinite goods , the more valuable your scarce resource is .
So , the simple bulletpoint version :
You can apply this to almost any market ( though , in some it 's more complex than others ) .
Since this post is already way too long , we 'll just take an easy example of the recording industry : What the band has done in this case is use the infinite good to increase the value of everything else they have to offer .
They 've increased their marketsize by recognizing how they can use the infinite goods as a free promotional resource and made the value of the overall ecosystem around them more valuable .
Rather than playing small shows in tiny clubs that do n't pay very well , they get to play large venues with bigger covers .
It 's certainly true that there are some externalities -- where some people will enjoy the music for free without ever taking part in paying for the scarce components .
But , when done right , you 've increased your market so much that it more than covers the difference .
Compare this solution to that of a band that sticks to the old way : they are then limited in the audience that will hear them -- especially as more and more bands give their music away for free .
Fewer people will be interested in going to their concerts or buying their merchandise or joining their fan clubs -- when the benefits are so much greater for following other artists that actually give their music away for free .
The end result really is a much bigger market with much greater benefit by expanding the market by using infinite goods to make the scarce goods more valuable .
So there you have it .
After many months , one single summary of the economics of " free " and how it can be used to anyone 's advantage .
It 's not about defending unauthorized downloads .
It 's not even about getting rid of copyright -- just recognizing that copyright holders can actually be better off ignoring their own copyrights .
It 's very much about showing the key trends that are impacting all infinite goods -- and pointing out a clear path to benefiting from it ( while making life more difficult on those who refuse to give up their old business models ) .
And we 're giving it to you all ... for free .
So , enjoy .
If you 're looking to catch up on the posts in the series , I 've listed them out below :

Being a man is brilliant .
You get to fight , drive cars through explosions , shag birds , drink beer , and be an asshole .
But what really make a man a man ?
Muscles ?
Sure .
Blood , guts , and fisticuffs ?
It helps .
A bit of nationalism ?
Of course .
Wildly improbable baddies , snakes , the Mafia , guns , lots of guns , boxing , and rude words ?
All are welcome .
But manly movies are the real cornerstone of our species - while women are reading Cosmo and buying shoes , us alpha males are out saving the universe with our shirts off .
If you 've started to realise that the music of Coldplay is beautiful and you 're thinking twice about buying that patchouli oil , then pin open your eyeballs and consume the movies on this list : it 'll guarantee any rogue homosomes in your DNA will be swiftly eradicated .
However , women should be warned : the films on this list could kill you stone dead if viewed in a single sitting .
20 . EDDIE MURPHY RAW ( 1987 )
Okay , so it 's 83 minutes of a man in an obscene purple outfit telling jokes .
No guns , no explosions , nothing like that .
Swearing , however , is big , clever and very , very manly : Eddie Murphy Raw held the record for the most ' fucks ' for three long years .
That 's 223 fucks , or a Fuck - Per-Minute Count or 2.48 FPM 's ( it was eventually dethroned by Goodfellas , a film that could only manage a paltry FPM of 1.6 ) .
Raw also contains , in no particular order ; fire - shooting dicks ; casual racism ; misogyny ; fighting ; a bitter , fucked - off Eddie Murphy ranting about gold - diggers ; Jamaicans with huge schlongs ; and , as Eddie 's Dad in a pre-credits sequence , the man 's motherfucking man , Samuel .
L. Jackson .
Dave Chappelle only wishes he was this manly .
Manliest moment : Taking off that awkward - looking purple vest to a chorus of female screams .
19 . HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER ( 1986 )
The bleakest entry in our catalogue of testosterone , Henry proves that being a man is n't all fun and games - sometimes it 's murder .
This aimless , formless , 90 - minute exposition on execution sees Michael Rooker ( you know the face but not the name ) dispense with absolutely everyone he 's ever met pointlessly and with great aplomb .
His best friend , his sisters , the guy who sold him a dodgy TV and random strangers are chopped to pieces , raped , strangled and are hacked up with a buzzsaw before being stuffed in bags and dropped by the side of the road .
It 's all in a days work for the monosyllabic personality - vacuum that is Henry .
This kind of utterly bleak , pointless , hopeless murder - as - masturbation is the existentialist man 's feast .
And Henry films it all with a stolen video camera .
Manliest moment : " Yeah .
I killed my mama .
I shot her .
I shot her dead . "
18 . DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE ( 1995 )
Like any man , sometimes you get a hangover .
It 's inevitable .
Naturally , when John McClane gets a hangover , it 's also the day he gets targeted by a European nutjob intent on blowing up New York City .
Before long , poor old John is Simple Simon 's puppet on a string , defusing bombs in litter bins and walking around Harlem with ' I hate niggers ' written on his sandwich board .
There 's a reason McClane is so brow - beaten , and it's not just the terrorist attack - he 's about to divorce his lady wife .
Does n't she know this guy is a hero ?
Die Hard With A Vengeance has all the mangredients needed for a filling meal : car chases , gold bullion , dead Germans , hangovers , bombs , quipping , and Samuel L Jackson shouting very loudly .
It 's 100 % a man 's movie .
Manliest moment : Bruce , sweaty and in a grubby vest , fights a henchman with a big chain .
17 . RAMBO : FIRST BLOOD II ( 1985 )
Stallone makes his second appearance in this list , this time cast as an oiled , stripped - to - the - waist human rocket launcher .
What most people call Hell , he calls home .
If Descartes had seen this film , he would have changed his ethos to " I blow things up , therefore I am . "
With the highest body count in cinema ( for at least a year ) , Rambo made front pages as the most violent film ever made , with faceless baddies dispatched in a manner of ways that rivalled Darwin and Da Vinci combined for their inventiveness .
If Death were a science , writer James Cameron would be awarded a Nobel Prize .
Stallone ventures behind enemy lines to blow up Russian whirlybirds , kill Steven Berkoff , dispense with ' gooks ' by explosive - tipped rocket , and bring the boys back home .
" Do We Get To Win ? "
Of course , Sly. Men NEVER Lose .
Manliest moment : Leaping through the jungle with a bow and arrow , blowing up ethnic people .
16 . THE THING ( 1982 )
How manly is a film that has no women in it ?
VERY .
This 1982 sci - fi classic , set on an isolated scientific outpost in the Antarctic , sees the cast of eight males slowly decimated one by one by an unknown alien creature .
Bleak , nihilist , awash with blood and guts and swimming in paranoia , The Thing is a hopeless battle against impossible odds that will , eventually , destroy the whole of mankind .
The violence that bubbles under every second of the film make The Thing decidedly male .
Despite being bafflingly short on deaths ( with just ten ) , explosions ( there are only two ) and a complete absence of double - handed gunfights and car chases , The Thing is extraordinarily manly .
Man is the warmest place to hide , not woman .
Manliest moment : " You gotta be fucking kidding ! "

A new vaccine that protects against cervical cancer has set up a clash between health advocates who want to use the shots aggressively to prevent thousands of malignancies and social conservatives who say immunizing teen - agers could encourage sexual activity .
. . .
Groups working to reduce the toll of the cancer are eagerly awaiting the vaccine and want it to become part of the standard roster of shots that children , especially girls , receive just before puberty .
Because the vaccine protects against a sexually transmitted virus , many conservatives oppose making it mandatory , citing fears that it could send a subtle message condoning sexual activity before marriage .
Several leading groups that promote abstinence are meeting this week to formulate official policies on the vaccine .
. . .
The vaccine appears to be virtually 100 percent effective against two of the most common cancer - causing HPV strains .
The jockeying reflects the growing influence social conservatives , who had long felt overlooked by Washington , have gained on a broad spectrum of policy issues under the Bush administration .
In this case , a former member of the conservative group Focus on the Family serves on the federal panel that is playing a pivotal role in deciding how the vaccine is used .
" What the Bush administration has done has taken this coterie of people and put them into very influential positions in Washington , " said James Morone Jr. , a professor of political science at Brown University .
" And it 's having an effect in debates like this . "
" Some people have raised the issue of whether this vaccine may be sending an overall message to teen - agers that , ' We expect you to be sexually active , ' " said Reginald Finger , a doctor trained in public health who served as a medical analyst for Focus on the Family before being appointed to the ACIP in 2003 .
In the US , for instance , religious groups are gearing up to oppose vaccination , despite a survey showing 80 per cent of parents favour vaccinating their daughters .
" Abstinence is the best way to prevent HPV , " says Bridget Maher of the Family Research Council , a leading Christian lobby group that has made much of the fact that , because it can spread by skin contact , condoms are not as effective against HPV as they are against other viruses such as HIV .
" Giving the HPV vaccine to young women could be potentially harmful , because they may see it as a licence to engage in premarital sex , " Maher claims , though it is arguable how many young women have even heard of the virus .

READER : The ball is in the Iraqis ' court .
We took away the obstacle to their freedom .
If they choose to embrace death , corruption , incompetence , lethal religious mania , and stone - age tribalism , then at least we 'll finally know the limitations of the people in that part of the world .
The experiment had to be made .
REYNOLDS : . . . it's also true that if democracy can't work in Iraq , then we should probably adopt a " more rubble , less trouble " approach to other countries in the region that threaten us .
If a comparatively wealthy and secular Arab country can't make it as a democratic republic , then what hope is there for places that are less wealthy , or less secular ?
UPDATE II
One important aspect of Westad ’s book is the complex connection he makes between the US and Soviet modernising projects and racism .
While both regimes insisted on their right to dictate values and solutions to the benighted peoples of the Third World , both also claimed that those peoples were capable of adopting them , doing so rapidly , and thereby joining the ‘ socialist community ’ or the ‘ free world ’ .
But because , in classic missionary style , both sides saw their truths as self - evident , their programmes as beneficial , and their own benevolence as beyond question , they often had no rational explanation to offer when their projects failed and their clients turned against them .
In these cases , there was often an astonishingly rapid swing towards racist explanations .
Currently , the neo-cons in America alternate between arguing that all Arab societies are capable of making rapid progress towards democracy ( and that anyone who denies this is racist ) and asserting that ‘ Arabs understand only force . ’ "
Glenn Reynolds points to this article fromwhich reports that a " leading Islamic doctor is urging British Muslims not to vaccinateagainst diseases such as measles , mumps , and rubella because they contain substances making them unlawful for Muslims to take . "
Reynolds ' response I do n't think there is any evolutionary theory that celebrates or finds purpose in the death ofas a result of stupid actions taken .
This just seems instead like a good excuse for pointing out how primitive Muslims are and how they deserve death ( what else does it mean to say " Just think of it as evolution in action " ? ) .
And it would be one thing if the people at risk of death were the adults who refused vaccines for themselves on religious grounds , but what kind of person has this reaction to reading a story about the livesbeing endangered as a result of a denialof necessary medical precautions ?
" Evolution in action " ?
That 's just deranged .
But beyond that , one does not need to go searching for isolated British Muslim doctors in order to find examples of the lives of children being endangered due to the religious beliefs of adults .
Merck , among other pharmaceutical companies , developed a highly effective vaccine against the human papilloma virus ( HPV ) -- by far the leading cause of cervical cancer in women -- but an entire American political movement called " social conservatism " has been desperately trying to prevent its widespread approval -- or at least persuade parents not to have their daughters vaccinated -- because HPV is a sexually transmitted disease and they therefore believe that a vaccine will be seen as an endorsement of premartal sex :
And those opposing these vaccines are not isolated or fringe groups .
Instead , they are the groups that lay at the core of the Republican Party , and have thus received high - level and influential appointments by President Bush , including positions that give them great power over health policy :
This is what one of James Dobson 's doctors said in explaining opposition to the vaccine :
And the Family Research Council had this to say : Though the FDA finally approved the vaccine , social conservative groups continue to lobby for the right of parents to refuse the vaccine for their daughters and to advocate against the HPV vaccine , insisting that abstinence is the preferred course .
So , when American Christian girls die of cervical cancer in their teens and early 20s because James Dobson and the rest of the " social conservative " movement convinced their parents that giving them the HPV vaccine would turn them into sex- crazed whores -- and that it 's therefore preferable to leave them vulnerable to a cancer - causing viral agent -- should we " just think of that as evolution in action " also ?
And that 's to say nothing of the unwanted pregnancies and cases of HIV transmission due to vigorous religious - based opposition to health programs designed to promote condom usage .
When teenagers of Christian parents in the U.S. with no access to condoms have premarital sex and end up with HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases , should we " just think of it as evolution in action " ?
What is really at play here is not hard to discern .
If the deaths of children of devout Muslims should be considered nothing more than " evolution in action " -- something that is warranted , even -- then we can start bombing them a lot more indiscriminately without much regret .
That 's just " evolution in action . "
Both the intensity and frequency of rhetoric like this directed towards Muslims -- whereby all sorts of theories are offered to justify their deaths -- are increasing rapidly . :
As always , the point here is not Reynolds himself ( who , like any specific blogger discussed here , is only illustrative ) .
The important point is that Muslim - dehumanizing rhetoric of this type is becoming much more commonplace ( that is the point , I believe , of the recent mini- controversy over Marty Peretz 's blog of bigotry ) , and what that rhetoric is intended to justify is obvious .
In that regard , one should compare Reynolds ' commentary on this story to his notorious post from November , when he cited a reader e-mail and then added his own comments ( emphasis added ) :
This is now an an emerging theme among war supporters looking for someone to blame for their disastrous war -- " we did everything we could for those people , but alas , they 're too primitive and savage to take advantage of it , so it 's time to start bombing them ( " more rubble " ) with a clear conscience , knowing they brought it on themselves . "
If we do that , just think of it as evolution in action .
Some commenters have pointed out that , strictly speaking , the actions of a parent that result in the death of a child are part of evolution .
Fair enough .
But the point is that there are all sorts of comparable acts by American Christians and other religionists ( including those above ) .
Reynolds would never link to a story reporting on the death of a 19 - year - old Christian girl who died of cervical cancer because James Dobson persuaded her parents to prohibit her from obtaining an HPV vaccine , and then say : " Just think of it as evolution in action . "
Reynolds ' post reveals a way of thinking and speaking about Muslims that is , in equal parts , despicable and dangerous . : Via Henry Farrell , this is about the most cogent explanation I have seen in awhile for what is going on with the anti-Muslim rhetoric arising out of the ash heap we created in Iraq .
From Anatol Lieven 's review in ( sub. req'd ) : That about sums up one of the most hopeless contradictions that lies at the heart of our neoconservative , warmongering missions -- the same people who want to convince us that they are doing nothing more than bringing peace , love , joy and freedom to the world with all of their bombings and invasions are also the first to insist that the people in the parts of the world we are invading are brute savages who get what they deserve .
That is how Reynolds went from piously accusing war opponents in 2003 of being " racist " for doubting whether we could export democracy to Iraq , to citing in 2006 the so - called " limitations of the people in that part of the world " as proof that the savages in Iraq are incapable of democracy and so it 's time instead to start bombing .
And when we do , we should just think of it as evolution in action .
I believe it was Robert Heinlein who first said , “ An armed society is a polite society . ”
He meant armed as in packing heat .
As in loaded and trained .
As in cocked and locked .
Heinlein did not mean , “ A society armed with information , dialogue , smarts , verbal - power - that - dispels - liberal notions , an Ayn Rand background , a memory for past LewRockwell.com articles , or an intense knowledge in Libertarian ideas . ”
There ’s a point where you must stop honing your argument about your rights and learn how to defend your rights .
And that point is always far sooner than you or I think it is .
It ’s Time for Gunpowder Residue
Until you can defend your own self , your rights mean nothing .
Sure , I wish our government was a good one .
I wish the liberals would stop lying , I wish the conservatives would be conservative and not liberals , I wish everybody there thought as Ron Paul thinks .
But they do n’t and they wo n’t .
You should not take up arms against the government .
That would be the stupidest thing you could do — and it would be the last thing you would do .
I am recommending that you learn to defend yourself and your family .
That means defend them from whatever threat is active .
By this I mean a physical threat .
You will always lose the fight if somebody attacks you physically and you respond by quoting Ayn Rand .
The first rule of a gunfight is : Always bring a gun .
( That happens to be a good rule to use in a knife fight too . )
The last line of defense you have is a gun .
( In some cases , such as mine , the last line of defense is the back - up gun you wear . )
Your wit is your first line of defense .
Do n’t depend on your wit to save your life because in a real bodily threat it will not .
Concealed Carry
Readers will write me and ( properly ) disagree with what I ’m about to suggest .
I understand their logic ; I used to argue the same point .
I ’ve changed my mind but if you choose to ignore the following advice , I completely trust your judgment as long as you do everything else .
If you live in a concealed - carry state ( and if you do n’t , why not ? ) , I recommend you get a concealed carry license .
Here is my reasoning : I love my family more than I fear the government so I ’d carry even if not allowed .
If I ’m not allowed to have a concealed weapon , I ’ll still arm myself .
But as long as I can carry legally I will do that .
Sure my name ’s then on their roles .
But I write for LewRockwell.com !
I wrote a book for WorldNetDaily.com .
I speak my mind so my name ’s already on their roles .
The concealed carry license is nothing but a bribe .
60 years ago , when you wanted the Mafia to leave you alone , you ’d pay them off with “ hush money . ”
The word “ license ” is code for “ hush money ” to the United States Government .
Pay them their hush money license fee and they ’ll leave you alone .
For now at least .
Right now , they care more about the vig than anything else .
Getting stopped without one ensures lots of trouble for you .
When you did n’t pay the Gambinos and Gottis , they broke your legs .
Pay the Gambinos , i.e. , get the license , and you ’ll be better off for the time being .
The Gambinos always wanted more money in time .
They know you pay and they ’ll squeeze you for more .
Some day , the Feds will not allow you to have a license .
Then you must make the decision to be legal or not .
But until that time , your freedom ( I use that term loosely ) is better assured if you ’re legal .
First Things First
I never knew how important training was … until I was properly trained .
Before I could spell gun ( I ’m a recovering public school graduate ) , I had some .
I did n’t know how to shoot most of them , I did n’t know how to load most of them , but I did know that the freedom to purchase them was dwindling .
My answer was to buy now and ask questions later .
I thought I was fine .
But I had a fear of them basically .
My wife really had a fear of them and of me having them .
I was afraid to shoot any of them so I never did .
We decided to take a gun class .
It lasted an entire afternoon .
It was a general introduction to pistols class .
We finished the class knowing so much more than we knew before !
We shot our first shots in that class .
We built confidence .
We learned safety rules .
We were ready to defend ourselves .
We thought .
That was 5 years ago .
Our weapons sat in storage ( we would n’t keep most of them where we live , that would be long - term foolish for many reasons ) .
Of the two we kept close by , we knew we could fire them when and if needed .
We never shot them .
We never practiced with them .
Not one time since that afternoon class .
We could not quote one safety rule and we could not remember one thing we learned in that afternoon class .
In a way , we were worse off than before because we were probably cockier than we would have been before that afternoon session .
Early this year , I read a newsletter by Dr. Arthur Robinson , a man I completely respect and admire , a man who perhaps furthers science more than any other scientist in the United States because he refuses all government money and the ties that go with it .
Dr. Robinson created the # 2 or # 3 best - selling homeschool curriculum in the country ( therefore the world ) .
In his monthly newsletter typically devoted to science but often the world in general and social issues too , Dr. Robinson recommended a 6 - day gun class designed by and taught in the manner of Colonel Jeff Cooper .
Col .
Cooper was the man responsible for changing our military and law enforcement officials shooting style ; instead of shooting from the hip the way Matt Dillon shoots , Col .
Cooper showed that accuracy was far better achieved at a time cost of only about 1/8th of a second , by shooting straight out with your eye aligned with your front sights aligned with your target .
One shot well - placed is infinitely better in a gun battle than 9 rounds that miss .
We did not want to spend the $ 1,000 each for the training which also needed for us to stay in a lodge on the property ( more expense ) to be there for everything .
Then , a month or so later , Dr. Gary North wrote a strong suggestion that anybody who cherished freedom needed to take an immersion course , 5 — 6 days , taught in the style of Col. Cooper .
I suppose we could make more excuses , but when Dr. Robinson and Dr. North prescribe the same medicine , it ’s in our best interest to swallow the pills .
We signed up .
The class met its goal of being full immersion for 6 - days .
It began with , “ This is a gun , ” and it always went all day and often into the evenings .
On the sixth day you learn to clear a house of bad guys single - handedly sprinkled with good guys and hostages all throughout .
It ’s intense and you are exhausted once it ’s over .
The class would have been a bargain at $ 10,000 .
Each .
After 6 days , as opposed to one afternoon , you have the proper safety procedures ingrained into your mind .
You have the proper stance , sight picture , and shooting methods ingrained into your mind .
You have gone through up to 1,000 rounds in those 6 days .
You know your weapon , how to carry it , how to clean it , and how to use it .
The only thing you do n’t have is muscle memory .
Your job once such a class is over is to practice , daily ( “ dry practice ” unloaded ) and 2 — 3 times a week with ammo at your range .
5 to 15 minutes daily is all you need .
The goal is to train your body , your “ muscle memory , ” to react when required ; in a situation that warrants such action your mind will not be focused on proper procedures to hit your target .
As long as you have properly practiced , your muscle memory takes over when needed to do the job you trained for .
Do Everything Needed — NOW
Once properly trained as I ’ve just described , then and only then will you be ready to carry .
Time is not on your side .
You must get a weapon , you must take the training , you must get the license if you decide that ’s right for you ( it took 81 days for the government to send us ours ! ) , and you must train your muscle memory once you ’ve gone through proper training of your mind .
Both Thunder Ranch and Gunsite teach the proper Col. Cooper methods .
If you ’ve heard bad rumors about Gunsite , they used to be true but things have changed .
Col. Cooper approves of the new owners .
Similar training exists elsewhere .
For a complete list , you need to purchase immediately Boston ’s Gun Bible .
Do n’t get Boston ’s book first , read it , and then work on the remaining items ( get a weapon , sign up for training , apply for concealed license… ) ; instead , get Boston ’s book WHILE you work on the other issues .
As I said earlier , time is against you .
Boston ’s Gun Bible answers every question a wanna - be gunfighter needs answering and it should be next to your other books of importance , read and re-read , then re-read again .
Ask yourself this question :
Is the world getting safer or more dangerous ?
Are public school graduates today less or more selfish and greedy and skill - less than ever before ?
Are illegal immigrants filling more or less jail space than ever before ?
Your answers will help convince you that time is against you every minute you wait .
If your spouse is hesitant , let me tell you about my beautiful bride of 15 years .
She ’s small .
She did n’t want to take the gun course .
She trusted Dr. Robinson ’s advice but did n’t like it .
She saw the recommended gun for the class ( semi- automatic .45 , 1911 style ) and it was too big for her to hold .
Yet , she knew she needed to carry given the world we live in .
At the end of the first day of class , she was wearing and shooting her full - size Colt .45 semi-automatic and cool as ice .
By the end of the 6th day , she took first place in 3 of the 4 shooting competitions in the class of men and women , both older and younger than we were .
I am more careful about ensuring my lady ’s happiness now that I ’ve seen her shoot .
Choice of Weapon ?
Books are filled with which is best .
The more concealable your gun is the less powerful it will be .
Your gun will never be small enough to conceal and big enough when you need to use it .
Guns were made to be comforting , not to be comfortable .
What caliber will stop a crackhead on meth trying to kill your wife ?
A .22 will if the shot is well - placed .
Good luck .
I need more stopping power .
A .40 - caliber is today ’s bare minimum self - defense round .
Most in the know shoot .45 as their primary self - defense semi-automatic weapon .
The .45 is slightly too small for me .
I like a .50 .
That ’s why I carry the best ( only ? ) .50 - caliber semi-auto on the planet , a Guncrafter Industries .50 .
These are handmade by craftsmen who believe a semi-automatic , when made and used correctly , offer 100 % reliability .
Yes , 100 % .
If you want first - class service , ask for Alex ( the owner who is readily available for any customer ) and tell him I sent you .
I get absolutely nothing from the recommendation except the pleasure in knowing I just sent you for the very best self - defense weapon on the planet .
This .50 caliber fits in a .45 holster , is the same approximate weight , and adds no discernable recoil over a .45 — unless you ’re the target .
Children and Guns
Boston ’s Gun Bible recommends that you gun-proof your child and not child - proof your gun .
Once you get your proper training , teach your children the same .
The NRA offers an Eddie Eagle program you can follow to develop your child ’s safe respect and accuracy with a gun as he or she gets older .
Yes , the NRA has problems with compromise but you ’ll still benefit from many of their programs .
The Klinton Administration ’s Surgeon General , Jocelyn Elders , said that toy guns are dangerous .
I tend to agree .
They teach children bad habits that can kill them ( or someone else ) later .
You need to respect her advice and keep the toy guns out of their hands !
Buy your children real guns instead .
Teach them how to handle their weapons safely and accurately .
They will know from the beginning that guns are not toys but are weapons to be respected and mastered .
Argument or Action
I come full circle back to the premise .
You need to train your mind to grasp the concept of freedom and the importance of self - defense .
There ’s a time and place for honing your debate skills .
Very early in life is the best time .
Once done , you need more than debate skills .
You can only hone those skills on the firing range .
Then you deserve to be called a freedom lover .
Not only did Heinlein say that an armed society is a polite society , he also made it clear that you can have freedom or you can have peace but you ’ll never have both .
Which is more important to you ?
It ’s very peaceful reading another book by Rothbard on your front lawn .
And I recommend that you do so .
Right after you clean your weapon from your practice drills .
What are you doing to ensure your family ’s future safety ?
Are you reading Atlas Shrugged a ninth time ?
Or are you loading .45 s or .50s into your gun ’s magazine ?

Which way do polls lean ?
Here is the trend in President Bush 's job performance rating since the beginning of his term in office , as reported by more than a dozen national polling firms :
Others have already commented on the striking pattern , but I am interested in a different question : do some polls " lean " in one direction ?
The answer is yes .
It appears that some polls consistently tend to favor one side of the trend line or the other ; for example , Zogby polls tend to fall below the trend line while Fox polls tend to fall above it .
Here is the same plot as above , with the Zogby and Fox polls highlighted :
House effects in presidential job performance polls
This type of lean by different polling houses is often referred to as a house effect .
Each of the following panels shows the net approval ( i.e. , the approval - disapproval spread ) for each of the main polling firms during the President 's term in office .
Superimposed on the net approval is an overall trend line .
As you may be able to see , some polls ( among them , Gallup , Fox , and ABC ) tend to run above the trend line while others ( among them , Zogby , Harris , and AP ) tend to run below .
The panels are listed in decreasing order of the number of polls — this is done to emphasize that patterns at the bottom of the graphic should be taken with larger grains of salt than those at the top .
An alternative presentation of the data that focuses on the difference between the polls and the trend line may make is easier to see the house effects .
That is called a residual plot , and you can see the accompanying residual plot here .
In each of those panels look at whether the mass of points generally lies above , below , or is centered directly on the dashed horizontal line .
President Clinton and the Fox and Zogby polls
Above I highlighted the difference in President Bush 's job performance as reported by the Fox and Zogby polls .
Below is a set of panels that show President Clinton 's job performance as reported by different polling firms .
Note that just as the Fox polls now appear to favor President Bush , they then favored President Clinton ; just as the Zogby polls now appear to disfavor President Bush , they then disfavored President Clinton .
It appears that the Fox and Zogby polls consistently tend to favor or disfavor the incumbent ( compared to other polls ) no matter what his political affiliation may be .
What causes house effects ?
These systematic house effects can be large — in fact , they can be larger than the nominal " margin of error " that is reported along with every poll .
What causes house effects ?
I look at some of the possible explanations here , which is a more detailed comparison of systematic lean in both Presidential approval and head - to - head election polls for the 2004 election .
In particular , note that the Zogby , Harris , and AP polls present their " job approval " questions differently than the other houses : they offer respondents a slightly wider choice of answers than a simple " approve " or " disapprove . "
There are also differences in the sample and the average amount of " undecideds " by polling house :
Fox polls survey registered voters ( most other polls survey " adults " ) and they tend to have slightly higher numbers of undecideds .
Gross vs. net approval
The plots above show net approval ( that is , approval minus disapproval ) but when the newspapers report the President 's approval ratings , they usually report only gross ( that is , just the approval rating without subtracting the disapproval ) .
What is the difference ?
A large part of the difference among polls is in the proportion of " undecided " or " do n't know " or " decline - to - state " .
For example , the Fox poll tends toward high proportions of undecideds while the Zogby poll tends toward low proportions .
When the proportion of undecideds varies greatly between two polls , the gross approval does n't tell the whole story .
For example , in the first few weeks of his administration , President Bush had an approval rating of 46 % on the Fox poll -- but 40 % of respondents were undecided and only 14 % reported disapproval .
Contrast this the Fox poll shortly before Hurricane Katrina , when his approval rating was 45 % , but he had only 5 % undecided and a disapproval rating of 50 % .
Gross approval was quite close in these two cases ( 46 % vs. 45 % ) but no one would say that they represented the public 's perception of the President equally well .
In the earlier poll , the President 's net approval was 46 % - 14 % = +32 % ; in the later poll , his net approval was 45 % - 50 % = - 5 % .
To see the difference between gross and net approval over the last 12 months place the mouse pointer over the image below ; then move the mouse pointer away to return to gross approval .
In each panel the black line shows what the trend would have been without that firm 's polls .
This gives a rough idea of how much each firm 's polls influences the overall trend , both in gross and net approval .

The Next Giant Leap
The next big thing is small : Nanotechnology could lead to radical improvements for space exploration .
When it comes to taking the next " giant leap " in space exploration , NASA is thinking small -- really small .
In laboratories around the country , NASA is supporting the burgeoning science of nanotechnology .
The basic idea is to learn to deal with matter at the atomic scale -- to be able to control individual atoms and molecules well enough to design molecule - size machines , advanced electronics and " smart " materials .
If visionaries are right , nanotechnology could lead to robots you can hold on your fingertip , self - healing spacesuits , space elevators and other fantastic devices .
Some of these things may take 20 + years to fully develop ; others are taking shape in the laboratory today .
Right : Nanotechnology could provide the very high - strength , low - weight fibers that would be needed to build the cable of a space elevator .

Thinking Small
Simply making things smaller has its advantages .
Imagine , for example , if the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity could have been made as small as a beetle , and could scurry over rocks and gravel as a beetle can , sampling minerals and searching for clues to the history of water on Mars .
Hundreds or thousands of these diminutive robots could have been sent in the same capsules that carried the two desk - size rovers , enabling scientists to explore much more of the planet 's surface -- and increasing the odds of stumbling across a fossilized Martian bacterium !
But nanotech is about more than just shrinking things .
When scientists can deliberately order and structure matter at the molecular level , amazing new properties sometimes emerge .
An excellent example is that darling of the nanotech world , the carbon nanotube .
Carbon occurs naturally as graphite -- the soft , black material often used in pencil leads -- and as diamond .
The only difference between the two is the arrangement of the carbon atoms .
When scientists arrange the same carbon atoms into a " chicken wire " pattern and roll them up into miniscule tubes only 10 atoms across , the resulting " nanotubes " acquire some rather extraordinary traits .
Nanotubes :
have 100 times the tensile strength of steel , but only 1/6 the weight ;
are 40 times stronger than graphite fibers ;
conduct electricity better than copper ;
can be either conductors or semiconductors ( like computer chips ) , depending on the arrangement of atoms ;
and are excellent conductors of heat .
Right : A carbon nanotube .

Much of current nanotechnology research worldwide focuses on these nanotubes .
Scientists have proposed using them for a wide range of applications : in the high - strength , low - weight cable needed for a space elevator ; as molecular wires for nano - scale electronics ; embedded in microprocessors to help siphon off heat ; and as tiny rods and gears in nano - scale machines , just to name a few .
Nanotubes figure prominently in research being done at the NASA Ames Center for Nanotechnology ( CNT ) .
The center was established in 1997 and now employs about 50 full - time researchers .
" [ We ] try to focus on technologies that could yield useable products within a few years to a decade , " says CNT director Meyya Meyyappan .
" For example , we 're looking at how nano - materials could be used for advanced life support , DNA sequencers , ultra-powerful computers , and tiny sensors for chemicals or even sensors for cancer . "
A chemical sensor they developed using nanotubes is scheduled to fly a demonstration mission into space aboard a Navy rocket next year .
This tiny sensor can detect as little as a few parts per billion of specific chemicals -- like toxic gases -- making it useful for both space exploration and homeland defense .
CNT has also developed a way to use nanotubes to cool the microprocessors in personal computers , a major challenge as CPUs get more and more powerful .
This cooling technology has been licensed to a Santa Clara , California , start - up called Nanoconduction , and Intel has even expressed interest , Meyyappan says .

Designing the future
If these near - term uses of nanotechnology seem impressive , the long - term possibilities are truly mind - boggling .
The NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts ( NIAC ) , an independent , NASA - funded organization located in Atlanta , Georgia , was created to promote forward - looking research on radical space technologies that will take 10 to 40 years to come to fruition .
For example , one recent NIAC grant funded a feasibility study of nanoscale manufacturing -- in other words , using vast numbers of microscopic molecular machines to produce any desired object by assembling it atom by atom !
That NIAC grant was awarded to Chris Phoenix of the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology .
In his 112 page report , Phoenix explains that such a " nanofactory " could produce , say , spacecraft parts with atomic precision , meaning that every atom within the object is placed exactly where it belongs .
The resulting part would be extremely strong , and its shape could be within a single atom's width of the ideal design .
Ultra - smooth surfaces would need no polishing or lubrication , and would suffer virtually no " wear and tear " over time .
Such high precision and reliability of spacecraft parts are paramount when the lives of astronauts are at stake .
Although Phoenix sketched out some design ideas for a desktop nanofactory in his report , he acknowledges that -- short of a big - budget " Nanhatten Project , " as he calls it -- a working nanofactory is at least a decade away , and possibly much longer .
Taking a cue from biology , Constantinos Mavroidis , director of the Computational Bionanorobotics Laboratory at Northeastern University in Boston , is exploring an alternative approach to nanotech :
Rather than starting from scratch , the concepts in Mavroidis 's NIAC - funded study employ pre-existing , functional molecular " machines " that can be found in all living cells : DNA molecules , proteins , enzymes , etc .
Right :
This bio-nanorobot envisioned by Constantinos Mavroidis and colleagues resembles a living cell .
[ More ] .
Shaped by evolution over millions of years , these biological molecules are already very adept at manipulating matter at the molecular scale -- which is why a plant can combine air , water , and dirt and produce a juicy red strawberry , and a person 's body can convert last night 's potato dinner into today 's new red blood cells .
The rearranging of atoms that makes these feats possible is performed by hundreds of specialized enzymes and proteins , and DNA stores the code for making them .
Making use of these " pre-made " molecular machines -- or using them as starting points for new designs -- is a popular approach to nanotechnology called " bio-nanotech . "
" Why reinvent the wheel ? " Mavroidis says .
" Nature has given us all this great , highly refined nanotechnology inside of living things , so why not use it -- and try to learn something from it ? "
The specific uses of bio-nanotech that Mavroidis proposes in his study are very futuristic .
One idea involves draping a kind of " spider 's web " of hair - thin tubes packed with bio - nanotech sensors across dozens of miles of terrain , as a way to map the environment of some alien planet in great detail .
Another concept he proposes is a " second skin " for astronauts to wear under their spacesuits that would use bio-nanotech to sense and respond to radiation penetrating the suit , and to quickly seal over any cuts or punctures .

The cross-section at the top - right shows biologically derived molecules ( yellow and red ) that would perform the sensing and signaling functions .

Futuristic ?
Certainly .
Possible ?
Maybe .
Mavroidis admits that such technologies are probably decades away , and that technology so far in the future will probably be very different from what we imagine now .
Still , he says he believes it 's important to start thinking now about what nanotechnology might make possible many years down the road .
Considering that life itself is , in a sense , the ultimate example of nanotech , the possibilities are exciting indeed .
Cambridge , MA ( 24 May ) -- Notorious war criminal Dan Halutz [ dossier ] completed his course in Harvard Business School 's two - month Advanced Management Program ( AMP ) yesterday .
Halutz , former head of the Israeli military , orchestrated the indiscriminate bombing of Lebanon last summer , killing up to 1,200 civilians .
Major human rights organizations condemned his policies as amounting to war crimes .
It is not clear if Halutz managed to wow faculty and students at HBS with his tips on cluster bombing and how - to pep talks on strafing ambulances .
The Harvard - based Alliance for Justice in the Middle East ( AJME ) launched a public safety campaign last week to alert the community to Halutz 's presence .
AJME circulated mock WANTED posters for Halutz on campus and printed his likeness on helium balloons to help boost awareness .
As Halutz is a " flight risk , " AJME has put up WANTED notices to warn travelers at Boston 's Logan international airport and notified authorities there to keep their eyes peeled for the suspect .
AJME 's efforts this past week were covered by international media and its website , http://harvardwarcriminals.blogspot.com, received over 12,000 unique visits in the first ten days .
The Halutz campaign is part of a broader effort by AJME to end Harvard 's pattern of hiring and training known war criminals and human rights abusers , regardless of nationality .
AJME 's research over the past 1.5 years has revealed at least six individuals who had public records of personal or command responsibility for specific war crimes and human rights abuses before coming to Harvard .
AJME welcomes any information about other Harvard - affiliated abusers who meet the same criteria .

On Monday morning March 12 , Dr. Ron Paul , member of the House of Representatives from Texas , and no stranger to readers of this website , announced on C - SPAN that he will seek the Republican nomination for President .
Now that he has moved from an " exploratory " candidacy to being a bona fide candidate , what are Rep .
Paul 's chances of winning the GOP nomination ?
I have known Ron for about 25 years .
The last time I saw him was in mid-2004 when he spoke at a fundraiser for Rep. Scott Garrett in New Jersey .
Scott was elected to Congress in 2002 and is a member of Ron 's Liberty Study Committee .
During the question and answer period I stated that a Paul - Garrett ticket in 2008 would energize conservative Republicans and libertarians .
Ron smiled and said , if I remember correctly , that a presidential run would be very unlikely .
Well , here we are in 2007 , and a Ron Paul presidential candidacy is a reality .
Ron and I first met at a 1982 monetary conference in Washington , DC .
Two years later he invited me with other newsletter writers to tour the Federal Reserve , the U.S. Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission .
In a Paul presidency , the downsizing of government would begin in earnest , two of the three institutions we toured nearly a quarter of century ago would be abolished , and the U.S. Treasury would probably be responsible for maintaining the integrity of a gold - backed dollar .
In short , in a Paul presidency , Washington , DC would be less populated , the budget would shrink substantially , taxes would decline markedly , the dollar would be stronger and no American troops would be policing the world .
Soon after Ron announced his candidacy on C - SPAN , Republican Senator Chuck Hagel held a new conference in his home state of Nebraska to inform the press that he will not be a candidate for president at this time .
In another development over the weekend , Fred Thompson , former U.S. senator from Tennessee and television actor , announced that he may seek the GOP nomination for president .
On Monday evening I had the opportunity to view some of the news programs , and the political segments were about the possible candidacies of both Hagel and Thompson , while Ron Paul 's candidacy was ignored .
Moreover , on Fox News Morton Kondracke commented on Senator Hagel 's announcement and said there is no anti-war candidate in the GOP field .
Clearly , the establishment media 's virtually blackout of Ron Paul 's candidacy is a magnificent case study in : media incompetence ?
bias ?
laziness ?
All of the above ?
No matter how the media treat Ron in the months ahead , by this time next year both the Republican and Democrat presidential nominees should be all but selected , because so many primaries will be held next February and March .
Thus , whoever raises substantial funds soon and has a message that resonates with voters for the next 12 months will be the overwhelming favorites to win their respective party 's nomination .
As of now , Dr. Paul has much in common with another ( physician ) presidential candidate , Howard Dean , who used the Internet so effectively in 2004 that the Democratic establishment sandbagged his campaign , because the Democrat bosses did not want to have , in their view , another McGovern ( anti- war ) candidacy .
Ironically , Dean is one of the country 's leading hawks , when it comes to Iran .
Currently , the Internet is abuzz about Ron Paul .
As the year unfolds , if more and more young Republicans people gravitate toward the Paul campaign just as young Democrats did for Dean in 2004 , the GOP establishment will be apoplectic .
For Ron to become one of the " top tier " GOP candidates he has to have one quality that he does not have now — a media - anointed celebrity status .
Currently , the top tier candidates are " celebrities " — Rudy , McCain , Romney , and Newt ( even though he has not announced his candidacy ) .
Ron can become a top tier candidate and a serious contender for the nomination if he can raise more funds than his own advisors , I suspect , think is possible by December 31 , 2007 .
According to many pundits , each of the leading candidates in both parties could raise as much as $ 100 million by the time the primaries are over .
So , for the media to characterize anyone a top tier candidate throughout the year , he or she should be on track to raise at least $ 50 million or more .
Could any of the presidential candidates that are currently in the back of the pack raise anywhere near that daunting amount ?
If $ 50 million is the minimum that a candidate will have to raise to be taken seriously by the media , then every lesser - known candidate needs 50,000 individuals to make an average contribution of $ 1,000 to give him a $ 50 million war chest .
( The maximum individual contribution is $ 2,300 per primary and general election . )
Ron 's political base is fiscal conservatives , anti-tax citizens , anti-war Republicans , Democrats and Independents , constitutionalists , hard - money advocates , small business owners , civil libertarians , anti-universal healthcare physicians , pro-lifers , parents who home school , and anyone else who considers himself a real patriot .
In other words , if Ron 's substantial base provides him with volunteers , contributions and votes , he would be a very competitive candidate .
In the final analysis , about 50,000 to 100.000 Americans could determine the next presidential nominees of both parties .
In the GOP presidential primary , if Ron Paul , Sam Brownback , Duncan Hunter , Tommy Thompson , or any other lesser known candidate excites GOP voters for the next 12 months , then Rudy , McCain and Romney will prove that in a marathon it is not who leads the pack that counts but who is the turtle in the race .

The Best of Murray Sabrin
I was reading my boss 's blog today , as he's a hard core GTD practitioner - more than I - and I 'm trying to get better at it .
He recently went on an automation rampage kick around his home IT and wrote a pile of scripts .
He also tends to email him self quick little reminders that are filed as todos , as do I , except he can just type
todo " Write a blog post on foo "
And it 'll be mailed to him with an appropriate subject and tagged in his Gmail account .
He 's using BLAT under Windows ( using sendEmail under Linux ) .
BLAT is a command - line util for sending email under Windows .
It 'll also post to USENET via NNTP if you like .
You can include all the settings on the command - line , or just " install " them in the registry , once , like this :
blat - install localhost whatever@yourdomain.com - - FromScott
Where " FromScott " is the name of a profile we 'll use later .
Then I can create a TODO .
BAT ( or TODO .
PS1 ) and put this in it :
@echo off
blat -p FromScott - to whatever@yourdomain.com - subject %1 - body %1 > NUL
I like running BLAT with - debug , because I 'm all about - verbose , do n't you know .
NOTE : I 'm using Vista and when I ran blat for the first time I was warned by the loader I did n't have MSVCR71.dll , so I ended up getting it and putting it in the same folder as BLAT then it was cool .
I ended up making todo.bat , worktodo. bat and hometodo .
bat and they look like this :
start " TODO - ING " / MIN c:\pathto\blat.exe -p FromScott - to me@noneofyourcheese.com - subject %1 - body %1 - debug
So now ,
c:> todo " Write a blog post about how my Home IT is automated "
Enjoy .
One of the more controversial of America 's exports has managed to unite factions from across France 's political spectrum , with the major parties in France 's hotly contested presidential election uniting to inform AFP that a " catastrophe " has taken place .
No , I 'm not talking about the opening of a new McDonald's .
The catastrophe in question is an electronic voting catastrophe of the kind that occurred in a number of counties in America during this past November 's mid-term elections .
In the few French cities that used the new electronic machines , the problems encountered were typical of what we 've seen here in the US : malfunctions and complications that resulted in long lines at the polls and , ultimately , in voters who had to leave without voting .
The technical glitches were compounded by some issues that appear to be specific to France .
I 'm talking about the elderly French 's confusion and general distrust of the machines ( as reported by the AFP ) , responses that are probably rooted in the country 's long and cherished tradition of paper ballots and ballot box transparency — literally , the ballot boxes are see - through , and anyone can monitor them during an election to ensure that there 's no funny business .
In contrast , the American elderly were among the groups that studies showed were the most pleased with touchscreen voting in the November mid-terms , due to its ease of use .
I suppose that senior citizens in America may place more trust in computers than their counterparts in France , a trait that appears to be a decidedly mixed blessing .
Two types of machines were certified for use in France 's election , both of which are of the paperless direct - recording electronic ( DRE ) variety now notorious ( and hopefuly soon - to - be outlawed ) in the States : an iVotronic model from American company ES&S , and another model from Dutch company Nedap .
Problems with ES&S ' line have been well - documented here and elsewhere , and apparently the Nedap units suffer from similar vulnerabilities .
The machines were banned in the Netherlands after a hacker compromised one of them in a public demonstration that aired live on Dutch TV .
If Dutch hacker Rop Gonggrijp 's comments to the International Herald Tribune are to be believed , the encryptionless Nedap machines are as poorly protected as the infamous Diebold AccuVote TS .
A Reuters report indicates that the Dutch models account for over 80 percent of the French e-voting machines , with the ES&S models making up the remainder .
This being the case , I suppose it 's not entirely fair to call e-voting an " American export , " and indeed this distinction may answer the question of why no French farmer has yet to demolish a polling place with a tractor in protest .

Mixed up English
The words loose and lose are mixed up in writing ; for some reason , many people write loose when they really mean lose .
But there ’s no reason to lose your mind worrying about this , just lose the extra o !
Loose
Loose is an adjective , the opposite of " tight " or " contained . "
I found some loose change under the couch .
My pants are loose .
I have a loose tooth .
There ’s a dog running loose in the street .
Lose
Lose is a verb that means " to suffer the loss of , to miss . "
You ’re going to lose that if you ’re not careful .
We need to lose some weight .
I hope I do n’t lose this tooth .
I never lose bets .
The Bottom Line
Simple carelessness leads people to write loose when they mean lose .
Just remember that lose has one o , and loose has two .
Start with loose , lose an o , and what do you get ?
Lose !

What ’s A Professional Firm ?
post # 257 — December 8 , 2006 — a General , Strategy post
I just received an email from Atta-ur Rehman in Pakistan , who writes :
Many times in your podcasts you refer to “ Professional Firms ” .
I ’ve not been able to understand what exactly you mean by the term .
Are n’t all businesses like professional firms ?
Could you please clarify it for me or refer to me some definition that you might already have on your website ?
Great question , Atta .
I had a stronger opinion twenty years ago what the term meant , but nowadays Iâ€™m not so sure .
Of course , many years ago , the term â€œprofessionâ€  or â€œprofessionalâ€ had a sociological , cultural or class meaning — there were only a certain number of â€˜learnedâ€™ professions ( medicine , the law , the religious ministry ) .
A lot of effort went into defending membership in this privileged group — doctors , lawyers and priests were special ( they claimed ) but everyone else was in BUSINESS ( Yuck ! ) or were a lesser breed ( nurses , for example ) .
Part of their claim was that they had a superior commitment to service instead of commerce , but very few people believe that any more .
Nevertheless , a great deal of time and money has been spent by other industries trying to get recognized as â€˜realâ€™ professions .
When I began my work in the early eighties , I used the term â€œprofessional service firmâ€ to mean businesses that ( mostly ) gave advice — not only law , medicine and priests , but including consulting , accounting , advertising , public relations , engineering , executive search , financial advisors of all kinds .
The central thing that these industries have in common is that ( in principle ) they do CUSTOMIZED work — they do not sell the result of standardized processes .
They hire â€œknowledge workersâ€ ( although not everybody thinks thatâ€™s synonymous with professional workers ) to apply education and training to create different outcomes for different clients .
However , even this definition gets â€œfuzzy .â€ 
What happens when so - called professional firms start taking a process - intensive approach and create customized outputs with a standard process ?
At the commodity end of many professions , it doesnâ€™t take an advanced degree to produce really valuable outputs — just some good systems , databases , training and a high - school degree .
Is that still a professional service ?
Then comes the challenge that you hint at , Atta .
Many of us think that being a professional has nothing to do with what degrees you have , what industry you are in , or what position you hold .
Maybe the REAL meaning of professionalism is close to what the priests , doctors and lawyers were SUPPOSED to have , except that it applies to ALL of us in all industries : a moral commitment to be of service and to run our organizations to high standards based on unwavering values .
Viewed this way , maybe Atta is right .
Arenâ€™t ALL industries like professional firms ?
Does the term professional business mean anything anymore ?
Does it mean anything to say some people are to be categorized as professionals and some as something else ?
What do the rest of you think ?
Have we outlived the usefulness of â€œprofessional service firmâ€  or â€œprofessional businessâ€ as a helpful categorization ?

In his 1850 novel The Black Tulip , French author Alexandre Dumas ( père ) describes a competition , initiated by the Dutch city of Haarlem in the 1670s , in which 100,000 florins ( 150 florins being the average yearly income at the time ) would be given to the first person who could grow a black tulip .
Although Dumas ’s story is fictional , it is based on a real phenomenon that took place in the Netherlands in the early 17th century .
Between 1634 and 1637 , the Netherlands ( then called the United Provinces ) saw the rise and fall of many fortunes due to an intense period of tulip trading .
Now described as tulipomania , or simply tulip mania , it involved the wild overvaluation of certain types of tulip , leading to the eventual crash of the inflated market .
In Rare Form
First cultivated in the East , tulips were brought to Europe from the Ottoman Empire during the 16th century ( the name tulip is derived from the Turkish word for turban ) .
Soon after their introduction , tulips became popular in various countries , but nowhere so much as in the Netherlands .
There are many theories as to why the Dutch developed such an avid interest in tulips ; in his book The Botany of Desire , Michael Pollan suggests that the bleakness of the Dutch landscape may be one reason colorful tulips were so quickly embraced .
He observes that “ what beauty there is in the Netherlands is largely the result of human effort … ” making the cultivation of beautiful blooms an attractive pastime .
Another reason for their popularity was their relative rarity .
While tulips can be grown simply from seed , there is no guarantee that the resulting flowers will resemble their parent plants at all .
The only way to obtain a particularly prized bloom is to grow one from an offset , which Pollan describes as “ the little , genetically identical bulblets ” found at the base of a tulip bulb .
The process of cultivating offsets was a lengthy one , adding to the scarcity of tulips .
In addition , the most valued tulips of the time were ones said to be “ broken , ” that is those tulips with bright flame or feather - like patterns on their petals .
The most famous of this type of tulip was the Semper Augustus , a white flower marked by brilliant red strokes .
These tulips produced fewer offsets , making them even rarer ; although it was not known at the time , the “ broken ” effect was caused by a virus that weakened the plant .
Gone to Seed
The genesis of tulipomania is usually ascribed to the 1593 arrival in Leiden of Carolus Clusius , a plant collector and gardener .
Bringing with him some tulip bulbs he had acquired while working as the director of the Imperial Botanical Garden in Vienna , Clusius proceeded to cultivate beautiful specimens from them , attracting attention from his new neighbors .
However , Clusius was reluctant to part with his bulbs , refusing to sell to eager buyers .
Frustrated by his refusal , thieves helped themselves to his garden , stealing many bulbs and selling the seeds they gained from them .
These seeds were eventually distributed throughout all the Dutch territories , leading to the increased propagation and variation of tulips .
Those lucky enough to grow a particularly beautiful bloom from seed could profit greatly from the sale of its offsets , making tulip cultivation an increasingly lucrative vocation .
As the taste for certain types of tulip became more focused , prices for the most valued bulbs rose dramatically among the upper classes .
At first limited to collectors and the wealthy , the large amounts of money to be made soon inspired people of more limited means to sell everything they had to cash in on the trade .
At the market ’s highest point , single bulbs sold for thousands of florins , the most famous being a Semper Augustus bulb that sold for 6,000 florins ( or 40 times the average yearly income ) .
As more people entered the trade , eventually the sale of real bulbs gave way to windhandel , or wind trade , meaning the future production of bulbs was bought and sold .
This increasingly risky venture could n’t last .
The tulip bubble burst in February 1637 when the fear of oversupply and dramatic price increases in early 1637 caused prices to drop precipitously .
Back Petal
While the story of tulip mania often gets told as a cautionary tale and as an analogue to more modern forms of market inflation and decline , such as the dotcom bubble , historian Anne Goldgar thinks this description is overblown .
In her book , Tulipmania : Money , Honor and Knowledge in the Dutch Golden Age , Goldgar finds that tulip speculation in reality was not as frenzied as the way it is commonly portrayed .
She blames the writer Charles Mackay , whose book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds from 1841 used satirical songs from 1637 as the basis for his depiction of the craze for tulips , which had a tendency to exaggerate the facts of the situation .
Far from being irrational , Goldgar argues that there were valid reasons for treating tulips as a valuable commodity , and that the subsequent rise and fall of the market was not as precipitous , and did not personally bankrupt , hordes of unlucky investors .
Dutch Treat
Although this volatility in the tulip market was unsettling at the time , out of that early trade came an enduring business for the Netherlands .
Now the tulip is a beloved symbol of the country , and plays an important role in economic and cultural activities .
It seems unlikely that anyone at the time the tulip came to the Netherlands could have predicted the enormous effect this flower would have over a nation ’s history and economy .
It is a vivid reminder that when human nature meets Mother Nature , interesting results are sure to follow .

This is an updated version of an article that originally appeared on Interesting Thing of the Day on April 6 , 2007 .
WASHINGTON , May 7 — President Bush welcomed Queen Elizabeth II to the White House today with remarks that celebrated the values that have bound the United States and Britain across the Atlantic and across the centuries .
“ Our two nations hold fundamental values in common , ” Mr. Bush said .
“ We honor our traditions and our shared history .
We recognize that the strongest societies respect the rights and dignity of the individual .
We understand and accept the burdens of global leadership , and we have built our special relationship on the surest foundations : our deep and abiding love of liberty . ”
“ Today our two nations are defending liberty against tyranny and terror , ” Mr. Bush said on the White House South Lawn amid Stars and Stripes and Union Jacks .
“ We ’re resisting those who murder the innocent to advance a hateful ideology , whether they kill in New York or London or Kabul or Baghdad .
American and British forces are staying on the offense against the extremists and terrorists . ”
Queen Elizabeth , nearing the end of her fifth visit to the former colonies , said she and her husband , Prince Philip , were happy to be at the White House again .

Sexy pictures and lacy underwear take men's minds off getting a good deal .
High - testosterone men tend to lose their drive for a good deal after perusing sexy pictures .
© Getty
It seems that the more macho a man is — at least according to his hormones — the more the sight of an attractive woman will affect his judgement .
Researchers at the University of Leuven in Belgium asked men to play an ultimatum game , in which they split a certain amount of money between them .
High - testosterone men drove the hardest bargain — unless they had previously viewed pictures of bikini - clad models , in which case they were more likely to accept a poorer deal .
The sight of flesh had less effect on the bargaining tactics of low - testosterone men .
The testosterone dose that interested the researchers was that encountered by their participants when developing in the womb .
This can be measured by comparing the lengths of the index and ring fingers — a relatively long ring finger is a sign of a high - testosterone man .
For these men , even handling a bra was enough to sap their resolve , report economists Bram Van den Bergh and Siegfried Dewitte , who publish their findings in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B1 .
Pictures of landscapes or elderly women , or handling a t - shirt , had no effect on the men 's steely bartering power .
Alluring ads
The discovery might help to explain advertisers ' reliance on sexy women to hawk their products , the researchers speculate .
" Commercials and advertisements are populated with beautiful and sexy women , but the consequences on cognitive processes of males had not been fully investigated , " Van den Bergh says .
This is not the first study to show the effect of a well - turned ankle on male behaviour .
For example , the sight of a beautiful woman makes men more likely to accept a small cash sum up front rather than a larger one later , perhaps so as to appear wealthy straight away ( see ' Women addle men 's maths ' ) .
But that does n't explain why sultry sirens can sell anything from computers to carving knives .
Perhaps men faced with an attractive woman just do n't strive so hard for a good deal , Van den Bergh suggests .
Fight for fairness
In the game , one player , the proposer , was given 10 euros and had to offer a cut to the other , the responder , who had already secretly declared the minimum he would accept .
If the offer is less than this minimum , both players get nothing .
As something is always better than nothing , one would expect the responder to set his sights low , leaving the proposer safe to make a paltry offer .
But the responder 's pride and an aggressive sense of fairness often leave both players out of pocket .
ADVERTISEMENT
High - testosterone men fight hardest for a large cut , the researchers found .
But the most testosterone - driven men were also the most likely to slacken their cash demands after viewing sexy women .
Perhaps they relaxed and began to care less about money .
Or perhaps , the researchers suggest , with a ' mate ' to impress the men were driven to have some wealth , however modest .
The sight of a potential mate might therefore actually make men more sensible , Van den Bergh says .
" Since a few coins is better than no coins at all , men thus become more economically rational after exposure to lingerie or sexy women , " he says .

Comet McNaught is lighting up the sky around dawn and dusk .
This image was captured over Edinburgh by Philippe Gautier .
This was the view that Simon Banton had in Figheldean , Wiltshire , of the brightest comet in 30 years .
Mark Edwards in Coventry asked why we did n't have comet pictures on the site - thanks for the reminder , and the image .
Comet McNaught was discovered last year by Australian Robert McNaught .
This was John Owen 's view from Aberdeen an hour after sunset .
Comet McNaught is passing close to the Sun . Solar radiation pressure and heat take material off the comet , giving it a big and visible ' debris field ' , seen in Leeds by Paul Willows .
Dan Escreet in Aldbrough , Yorkshire , captured this image .
The comet will be seen better in the coming days from the southern hemisphere .

The Joint Genome Institute , a federal genome sequencing center in Walnut Creek , Calif. , has ordered one of 454's $ 500,000 sequencing machines but has not yet installed it .
Paul Richardson , the institute 's head of technology development , said the new approach " looks very , very promising " and could reduce sequencing costs fourfold .
The machine 's limitation is that at present it can only read DNA fragments 100 units or so in length , compared with the 800 - unit read length now attained by the Sanger - based machines .
The shorter read length makes it harder to reassemble all the fragments into a complete genome , Dr. Richardson said , so although microbial genomes can be assembled with the new method , mammalian genomes may be beyond its reach at present .
Dr. Fraser , director of the Institute for Genomic Research in Rockville , Md. , also said that the new machine 's short read lengths " limit its overall utility at this point . "
Jonathan Rothberg , board chairman of 454 Life Sciences , said the company was already able to decode DNA 400 units at a time in test machines .
It was working toward sequencing a human genome for $ 100,000 , and if costs could be further reduced to $ 20,000 the sequencing of individual genomes would be medically worthwhile , Dr. Rothberg said .
There would be little advantage at present in sequencing a patient 's entire genome , but in the medicine of the future , complete documentation about an individual 's genetic makeup could well provide prognosis or indicate a preferred treatment .
The new technology avoids a pitfall of the Sanger method , which is that the fragments of DNA to be analyzed are first amplified by being cloned in bacteria .
But the bacteria cannot handle certain fragments , leaving gaps in the genome sequence .
In the new technique , each fragment of DNA is captured in an individual drop of liquid and amplified to 10 million copies with a well - established chemical method known as the polymerase chain reaction .
The 10 million copies from each droplet are then attached to an ultra-small bead , and the beads are dropped into a credit - card - sized grid of 1.6 million wells , where the pyrosequencing takes place .
Each time the correct base is added to the fragments of DNA on a specific bead , a flash of 10,000 photons is picked up through the bottom of the wells by the light - detecting chip that sits under the small grid of wells .
A computer can reconstruct the sequence of bases composing the fragments stuck to each bead , and from the overlaps between fragments can reassemble the entire genome from which they were derived .

Very importantly , these data included the programs the owner used to manipulate them .
The owner / user should be able to understand and write the programs , thus gaining ascendancy over the computer .
The MVC notes should be read on this background .
The user was the czar ; everything done at LRG was done to support him .
An earlier paper adds some background for MVC :
A note on DynaBook requirements
22 March 1979 ( Partial scan , 11 pp
http://folk.uio.no/trygver/1979/sysreq/SysReq.pdf
I have sometimes been given more credit than is my due , so I should stress that I am not one of the original inventors of Smalltalk .
I am only one of the very early and very enthusiastic users and contributors to this revolutionary innovation .
I made the first implementation and wrote the original MVC note at Xerox PARC in 1978 .
The note defines four terms ; Model , View , Controller and Editor .
The Editor is an ephemeral component that the View creates on demand as an interface between the View and the input devices such as mouse and keyboard .
Jim Althoff and others implemented a version of MVC for the Smalltalk - 80 class library after I had left Xerox P ARC ; I was in not involved in this work .
Jim Althoff uses the term Controller somewhat differently from me .
An important aspect of the original MVC was that its Controller was responsible for creating and coordinating its subordinate views .
Also , in my later MVC implementations , a view accepts and handles user input relevant to itself .
The Controller accepts and handles input relevant to the Controller / View assembly as a whole , now called the Tool .
The essential purpose of MVC is to bridge the gap between the human user 's mental model and the digital model that exists in the computer .
The ideal MVC solution supports the user illusion of seeing and manipulating the domain information directly .
The structure is useful if the user needs to see the same model element simultaneously in different contexts and / or from different viewpoints .
The figure below illustrates the idea .
MVC was conceived as a general solution to the problem of users controlling a large and complex data set .
The hardest part was to hit upon good names for the different architectural components .
Model - View - Editor was the first set :
Thing - Model - View - Editor

After long discussions , particularly with Adele Goldberg , we ended with the terms Model - View - Controller :
Models - Views - Controllers

(. PDF ( 2 pp , 9,696 bytes )
The two papers have been copied together here :
( PDF , 396 567 bytes )
The Controller was here what I now call a Tool .
The Smalltalk - 80 Controller is here a fourth element called Editor .
This was an ephemeral component that the View creates on demand as an interface between the View and the input devices such as mouse and keyboard .
The MVC problem has more facets than I realized in 1979 .
I started working on a pattern language to disentangle the different aspects , that last draft was dated August 20 , 2003 .
The plan was that it should be improved by a group of authors , not just the current single one .
Unfortunately , the projct died at his point .

Philips Electronics has done it again .
Flush with heady optimism after successful products such as the digital compact cassette ( DCC ) and the super audio CD ( SACD ) , the redoubtable European giant has developed a way to keep television free for the masses for the foreseeable future — a patent application for a device which prevents a user from changing the channel during commercials .
To put it bluntly , the television industry has been having some economic problems of late .
The classic model of running a commercial break every 10 or 15 minutes during a program is breaking down as consumers discover the joys of avoiding ads through channel surfing and outright skipping via digital video recorder .
It 's a given that the TV networks need to somehow generate revenue in order to produce content .
With commercials becoming less lucrative , TV has borrowed a dirty page from the movie industry and begun engaging in product placement within the programs themselves .
As a result , in the past few years , we 've seen sitcom plots involving competition for a role in an Herbal Essences TV ad , various characters discussing how much they enjoyed " Memoirs of a Geisha , " and a wife waxing philosophical about a Wal - Mart perfume as her husband lays dying a few feet away .
Enter Philips , a company prepared to put its foot down on that sort of artistic compromise .
The device Philips envisions would scan any broadcast or recording for digital signals labeled as commercial content .
Just as many new DVDs begin by displaying ads that the viewer cannot bypass , a channel running a commercial would be locked until that commercial was over .
Similarly , the fast - forward or skip controls on your digital video recorder would be disabled while a commercial is playing .
Now , I know that many regular readers are thinking that this is the part where I point out how such a device is n't feasible , could result in a huge migration away from commercial television , and at best , would create a healthy underground for hacks which would no doubt be subject to prosecution under the DMCA .
All of those things may be true , but that 's simply because I believe the device does n't go far enough .
The fundamental downside to merely forcing commercials to run unimpeded is that the viewer retains freedom of movement which would allow him or her to leave the room , cover the TV with a blanket , or eat or use a product in direct competition with an advertisement .
For the propaganda to be most effective , the device needs to work in concert with the couch to prevent any unauthorized activity or movement while a commercial is running .
Ideally , all phones in the vicinity would also be put on hold , and it would become impossible to deactivate the TV , even if unplugged .
Taking the idea to the next logical step , the overhead of producing programs could then be reduced or eliminated altogether , making commercial viewing far more efficient .
If the viewer is tethered to the couch during commercials , programs represent little more than an opportunity to escape , therefore , such extravagances must be eliminated .
To maximize return on investment , the phones would be reactivated , but could only be used to order products currently being advertised .
So far , there is only one problem left to solve : consumers need to earn money if they are to remain consumers , and " couch potato " is not a paying career unless you 're a writer .
So , in the spirit of practicality , for eight hours a day , one third of all TVs would automatically shut off .
During that period , the now - active phones would be used to collect product orders from the two thirds of the population whose TVs remain on .
Thus , the ultimate consumer becomes an integral part of the supply chain , and the perfect society is achieved .
Take that , Plato .
As to Philips ?
Yeah , keep up the good work guys .
We 're right there with ya .
WHATEVER THE future holds , the United States has not “ lost ” and cannot “ lose ” Iraq .
It was never ours in the first place .
And however history will judge the war , some key U.S. goals have been accomplished : Saddam Hussein has been ousted , tried and executed ; Iraqis have held three elections , adopted a constitution and established a rudimentary democracy .
But what now ?
After four years of war , more than $ 350 billion spent and 3,363 U.S. soldiers killed and 24,310 wounded , it seems increasingly obvious that an Iraqi political settlement cannot be achieved in the shadow of an indefinite foreign occupation .
The U.S. military presence -- opposed by more than three - quarters of Iraqis -- inflames terrorism and delays what should be the primary and most pressing goal : meaningful reconciliation among the Sunnis , Shiites and Kurds .
For the record : For The Record
Los Angeles Times Saturday May 19 , 2007 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 22 Editorial Pages Desk 0 inches ; 23 words Type of Material : Correction
Iraq surge : A May 6 editorial about the Iraq surge stated that it included “ five additional battalions . ”
The correct military unit is brigade .
This newspaper reluctantly endorsed the U.S. troop surge as the last , best hope for stabilizing conditions so that the elected Iraqi government could assume full responsibility for its affairs .
But we also warned that the troops should not be used to referee a civil war .
That , regrettably , is what has happened .
The mire deepens against a backdrop of domestic U.S. politics in which support for the ill - defined mission wanes by the week .
Better to begin planning a careful , strategic withdrawal from Iraq now , based on the strategies laid out by the Iraq Study Group , than allow for the 2008 campaign season to create a precipitous pullout .

With four out of five additional battalions now in place , there is no reason to believe that the surge will help bring about an end to what is , in fact , a multifaceted civil war .
The only bright spot is in Al Anbar province , where Sunni tribal leaders have joined U.S. forces in the fight against foreign Al Qaeda fighters .
They deserve our continuing support .
But as long as civil war rages in Iraq , even the post - surge force of 160,000 troops cannot achieve more than marginal progress .
As Gen. David H. Petraeus , the top U.S. war commander , has acknowledged , the solution to Iraq ’s problems cannot be military .
Yet political progress has been backsliding .
It was only frantic White House intervention last week that prevented the resignation of the last Sunni leaders in the Shiite - dominated Cabinet of Prime Minister Nouri Maliki .
The Sunnis say the Maliki government is sectarian , corrupt and incompetent ; and they ’re right .
The Bush administration should convene national peace and reconciliation talks as early as possible -- say June 1 .
All of Iraq ’s parties , tribes , ethnic and sectarian factions , except for Al Qaeda , should be invited to the table .
But an important element needs to be taken off the table : American blood .
The U.S. should immediately declare its intention to begin a gradual troop drawdown , starting no later than the fall .
The pace of the withdrawal must be flexible , to reflect progress or requests by the Iraqis and the military ’s commanders .
The precise date for completing the withdrawal need not be announced , but the assumption should be that combat troops would depart by the end of 2009 .
Iraqi political compromise is more likely to come when Washington is no longer backing the stronger ( Shiite ) party .
U.S. troops could then be repositioned to better wage the long - term struggle against Islamic extremism .
We are not naive .
U.S. withdrawal , whether concluded next year or five years from now , entails grave risks .
But so does U.S. occupation .
The question is how best to manage the risks .
Advertisement
First , there is the grim prospect of a bloodbath in Iraq .
But the best way to forestall slaughter is political reconciliation , not military occupation .
Second is the worry that Al Qaeda will establish a beachhead in Al Anbar .
Yet Iraqis have already turned against the foreign fighters .
Third , the neighbors may meddle .
Alarmists fear an Iranian proxy state in Baghdad ; southern Iraq is already allied with Tehran .
But Iraq ’s neighbors are more likely to be helpful once withdrawal is assured , and instability is not in their interests , especially without a U.S. occupier to bleed .
Having invested so much in Iraq , Americans are likely to find disengagement almost as painful as war .
But the longer we delay planning for the inevitable , the worse the outcome is likely to be .
The time has come to leave .
When Steve Ballmer yelled at a departing Microsoft employee that he would “ kill Google ” we had no idea just how direct a method he had in mind .
Buying all or part of AOL may be the first part of the master plan , as Google relies heavily on the advertising pages that come from Yahoo ! , since it now syndicates its search to Google .
One estimate suggested that Google would lose as much as $ 380 m of advertising revenue if AOL dropped its search engine and took on MSN's .
That would cut Google ’s profit by something like 25 per cent , potentially giving its huge share price something of a tumble .
No wonder Google is thought to be entering the bidding to partner with Time Warner on AOL instead of Microsoft .
However , the move by Microsoft could still potentially backfire , although with its cash mountain you would expect it to win the day .
Google only chance is to paint a sufficiently rosy future picture to Time Warner ’s management about what kind of outcome there would be for an AOL partnering Google , then perhaps a lot more than that $ 380 m could be saved .
For instance the new physical fiber network that Google is believed to be in the process of putting together , be used to transport more than just voice , advertising and wi-fi traffic .
This could also become a conduit for video services , providing another route to market for the remainder of Time Warner ’s content ?
Could the Google Video search capability index all of Time Warner ’s precious content and give it another lease of life ?
It ’s too late for the Google Talk VoIP service to go out to all the AOL customers because AOL has launched its own complete VoIP package service .
The AOL Time Warner merger had some original logic and perhaps a company as imaginative as Google could make that logic work .
On the other hand Microsoft in June 2003 paid Time Warner $ 750 m , mostly in settlement of legal disputes , from when AOL inherited the complaints of Netscape when it bought that company right in the middle of the Microsoft anti-trust trial .
But the deal also gave AOL rights to use certain Microsoft tools and the two said that they would collaborate on long - term digital media initiatives , some of which they are well into .
That agreement was certainly not a mere settlement of differences but included the Free use of Internet Explorer by AOL for seven years , collaboration on Windows Media player and DRM software and early access to Microsoft technology for AOL .
And since then the two companies , Time Warner and Microsoft , have become almost inextricably interlinked , working together on standards and buying into companies like ContentGuard together .
So Microsoft must be ahead on this deal as it comes to the table and has the money to tempt Time Warner .
The New York Post has been painting the deal as if it was a 50 - 50 partnership , with Microsoft buying half of AOL with other statements suggesting that the deal is nothing like that adventurous and is just a form of marketing co-operation .
Yahoo !
also has time to throw its hat in the ring , and discussion between it and Time Warner has also been reported .
AOL has been losing subscription customers rapidly , which is why it recently switched its business from purely subscription based to increasingly advertising - based .

In the mountain of commentary that has been published about the Kathy Sierra affair on blogs and in mainstream publications , one fact has so far remained obstinately unconfirmed :
Who was it that posted threatening messages and images on Sierra 's website and on two other blogs ?
Wired News interviewed many of the principals in the original affair , including Sierra ; Frank Paynter and Chris Locke , the creators of the meankids.org blog ; and other contributors to meankids.org .
Our goal was to find out who actually posted the threatening content .
The investigation so far has led to two people , a meankids.org contributor and a commenter , who have acknowledged to Sierra that they authored content she found threatening .
Sierra no longer considers these individuals as physical threats to her , and has agreed to keep the identity of one of them secret .
There are at least two other people whose identities remain uncertain , however .
Identifying these perpetrators has proven impossible because most of the evidence has been destroyed , including server logs , IP addresses and the threatening content itself .
Although others have identified a prime suspect , he has an alibi , which is impossible to confirm or debunk .
An account of the case can be gleaned from publicly available sources online , but it has so far been spread across dozens of blogs and thousands of comments .
One exception is Jim Turner at One By One Media has the only comprehensive factual account we have found .
What follows is a fairly full summary of the case , based on facts Wired News has been able to verify .
The controversy broke March 26 , when Sierra canceled an appearance at the ETech technology conference citing online threats against her against her life .
Sierra contacted the Boulder Sheriff 's Department , which advised her to take the threats seriously .
Sierra , who is the author of several Java programming books as well as a marketing blog called Creating Passionate Users , reported she 'd received death threats in the comments section of her own blog .
Additionally , Sierra said , threatening images and commentary had appeared on meankids.org , a group blog that is now offline .
It 's not clear what provoked such a vitriolic response to Sierra .
She attributes it to comments she made a year ago in support of bloggers ' rights to delete comments on their own blogs .
Reaction to Sierra 's announcement was swift and polarizing , with many people remarking on the viciousness of the commentary , and others defending the original posts on meankids.org as non-threatening satire .
" I think it touched a nerve , " Sierra said .
" People had so much pent - up fear , anger , frustration , hurt over their own experiences , and it just opened up the floodgates . "
Our investigation revealed a few facts that are not disputed by any of the parties we interviewed :
· A contributor using the moniker " Rev Ed " was responsible for two of the most controversial posts on meankids.org , including one with a doctored image of Maryam Scoble ( wife of tech blogger Robert Scoble ) and a second post with a doctored image of Sierra .
It is the second image that Sierra found particularly threatening ; she posted a copy of this to her own blog but the image has since been removed .
( It showed Sierra 's face covered by lacy red women 's underwear , and seems to have been based on this image posted on Flickr . )
· The nickname " Rev Ed " belonged to meankids.org contributor Alan Herrell , a Phoenix , Arizona - based computer and networking consultant , or someone posing as him .
In an e-mail published after the Sierra affair broke , Herrell claimed his computer had been hacked and his identity stolen – that whoever was posting to meankids.org under the nickname " Rev Ed " was not him .
The blog 's creator , Paynter , said he initially suspected Herrel , but the hacking story cast doubt on that suspicion .
" My impression that ( Rev Ed ) was Alan is now tempered by Alan 's statement that he was hacked , " Paynter said .
Herrell could not be reached for comment .
· Another post , which included an image of a noose , was made by a meankids.org contributor who later acknowledged authorship of that post to Sierra .
Sierra acknowledged this poster 's explanation and no longer considers the poster a physical threat .
The contributor , who has asked not to be identified , confirmed this version of events .
· Paynter provided the e-mail address and IP address of a meankids.org commenter called " Joey " to Sierra .
This person had added a comment to the noose post that said , " The only thing Kathy has to offer me is that noose in her neck size . "
Joey has contacted Sierra , and has offered his own account on another website .
· The most direct threats were posted to Sierra 's own blog .
Sierra published the e-mail address and IP address of a commenter , " siftee , " in her March 26 post , along with one of the commenter 's threats , which is patently violent and sexual .
The IP address indicates a user probably located in Spain , but attempts to contact this person by Wired News have so far been unsuccessful .
Getting to the bottom of the Sierra affair is complicated by the fact that meankids.org ( as well as a second blog with many of the same contributors , unclebobism.wordpress.org ) is now offline .
Paynter and Locke deleted the sites as soon as they felt the content was becoming unacceptable .
Paynter retained none of the data or server logs for meankids.org , which was hosted on his server .
Unclebobism.wordpress.org was hosted by Wordpress.com , and Automattic , which operates Wordpress.com , declined to share server logs or web pages from the deleted account with Wired News .
The content of both sites is no longer available in public repositories , such as the Internet Archive or Google 's cache .
As a result , it 's difficult to establish who posted what , and attempts to determine the threatening content of the posts is impossible because the posts themselves are unavailable for examination .
Additionally , Herrel 's claim that his computer was hacked means that server logs , even if available , would not be conclusive .
In the absence of public facts , such as server logs or even the blogs themselves , it is no surprise that public debate has been dominated by opinion and interpretation .
There is only one certainty :
For most commenters – whether mainstream media or bloggers – the absence of evidence has never been an obstacle to offering a strong opinion .
Comment on this story .
A Western drought that began in 1999 has continued after the respite of a couple of wet years that now feel like a cruel tease .
But this time people in the driest states are not just scanning the skies and hoping for rescue .
Some $ 2.5 billion in water projects are planned or under way in four states , the biggest expansion in the West ’s quest for water in decades .
Among them is a proposed 280 - mile pipeline that would direct water to Las Vegas from northern Nevada .
A proposed reservoir just north of the California - Mexico border would correct an inefficient water delivery system that allows excess water to pass to Mexico .
In Yuma , Ariz. , federal officials have restarted an idled desalination plant , long seen as a white elephant from a bygone era , partly in the hope of purifying salty underground water for neighboring towns .
The scramble for water is driven by the realities of population growth , political pressure and the hard truth that the Colorado River , a 1,400 - mile - long silver thread of snowmelt and a lifeline for more than 20 million people in seven states , is providing much less water than it had .
Introduction
If you think the answer to this question is obvious , think again .
The best minds of physics have studied this question for over a century , and the current answer may surprise you .
In 1826 , the astronomer Heinrich Olbers asked , " Why is the sky dark at night ? "
By his time , physicists had learned enough to realize that , in a stable , infinite universe ( one not expanding ) , with an even distribution of stars , the entire universe should gradually heat up .
Think about it — if there are stars emitting energy throughout the universe ( energy sources ) , and if there is no way ultimately to dispose of that energy ( energy sinks ) , then all the objects in the universe must rise in temperature , eventually reaching the temperature of the stars themselves .
Scientists and physicists had to learn quite a lot about the behavior of energy before they were even prepared to ask Olbers ' question .
In these pages you will learn the simple physics behind Olbers ' question , some of the answers that have been proposed , and the currently accepted answer .
You will also discover the connection between a rubber band , your refrigerator , and the universe .
Critics said Halliburton was favoured by the Bush administration
The company said it hoped the move to the United Arab Emirates would help it expand its business in the Middle East .
Halliburton won valuable contracts in Iraq following the US - led invasion of 2003 , some of which were awarded without competitive bidding .
The company also has extensive operations in Saudi Arabia .
The oil giant will keep an office in Houston but the posts of chairman , president and chief executive will be based in Dubai .
Chief Executive Dave Lesar , speaking at a conference in Bahrain , confirmed that he would be relocating .
" As the CEO , I 'm responsible for the global business of Halliburton in both hemispheres and I will continue to spend quite a bit of time in an airplane as I remain attentive to our customers , shareholders and employees around the world , " he said .
" Yes , I will spend the majority of my time in Dubai . "
In 2006 , Halliburton made profits of $ 2.3 bn on revenues of $ 22.6 bn .
Last month it announced a 40 % decline in fourth - quarter profit .
Whether people are making financial decisions in the stock market or worrying about terrorism , they are likely to be influenced by what others think .
And , according to a new study in this month 's Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , published by the American Psychological Association ( APA ) , repeated exposure to one person 's viewpoint can have almost as much influence as exposure to shared opinions from multiple people .
This finding shows that hearing an opinion multiple times increases the recipient 's sense of familiarity and in some cases gives a listener a false sense that an opinion is more widespread then it actually is .
In a series of six experiments that included 1044 students , from the University of Michigan , Princeton University , Rutgers University , University of Michigan -- Dearborn , University of Toledo and Harvard University , researchers sought to understand individuals ' accuracy in identifying group norms and opinions .
The experiments included dividing students into three groups , ( three person control group , single opinion group and repeated opinions group ) .
Participants in the three person control group read three opinion statements each made by a different group member .
The participants in the repeated opinion group read the same three statements but they were all attributed to one group member .
Those in the single opinion control group read one opinion statement from one group member .
The studies found that an opinion is more likely to be assumed to be the majority opinion when multiple group members express their opinion .
However , the study also showed that hearing one person express the same opinion multiple times had nearly the same effect on listener 's perception of the opinion being popular as hearing multiple people state his / her opinion .
Researchers examined the underlying processes that take place when individuals estimate the shared attitude of a group of people and how that estimation of collective opinion can be influenced by repetition from a single source .
Since gauging public opinion is such an essential component in guiding our social interactions , this research has implications in almost every facet of modern day life .
" This study conveys an important message about how people construct estimates of group opinion based on subjective experiences of familiarity , " states lead author Kimberlee Weaver , ( Ph.D ) , of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University .
" The repetition effect observed in this research can help us to understand how our own impressions are influenced by what we perceive to be the reality of others .
For example , a congressman may get multiple phone calls from a small number of constituents requesting a certain policy be implemented or changed , and from those requests must decide how voters in their state feel about the issue .
This study sheds light on the cognitive processes that take place that may influence such a decision . "

This was sent to me by a friend who works at an advertising agency .
They have a job opening in their research department , and they received this email cover letter along with a resume from someone applying for the job ( I have removed the names and email addresses of the people involved , everything else is word for word ) :
RE : Media Buyer Postion
Good Morning ,
I ’ve recently applied for the Junior Media Buyer / Researcher posted , and I feel it is a great opportunity for me to be employed .
Reading the job description , it became very clear to me that this was something I could do .
And do well .
I hope we can set up and interview because it ’s in the interview where I tend to shine .
So my aim is to impress your socks off , unless you do n’t ware socks , then I hope to impress your shoes off .
To be realistic , I do n’t feel I am very qualified for this position .
I understand a person with 2.5 years of sports management is n’t exactly what you ’re looking for , but I believe I have what it takes to be your media buyer .
I think the only qualification I have that really applies for this position is my extencive CD collection .
This shows I can research and purchase media , and media related products .
Media is something I have a strong passion for .
Music , movies and television are large parts of my life , as well as magazines , and newspapers .
It ’s with that knowledge that I can certainly apply to becoming your next media buyer .
I ’m sure working for a “ busy downtown ” office would require a lot of lifting , and moving of purchased media , which I ’m ok with as well .
I ’m able to use a computer ( sending this email is proof ) and I work well with others .
Another one of the benefits I bring to the table is I never have a problem with customer service .
I have returned many items with no to little questions asked .
I must have one of those faces people trust .
I do n’t cook , so most of the meals I eat are cold , and raw – so sushi is cool too .
I hope I have gone above and beyond any expectations you may have had , and proven without a doubt that I can do this job .
And as for my love for dogs , pictures of some of my ex-girl friends will be available upon request .
Thanks a lot ,

Nevermind
For up - to - date information on the new Futurama movies / episodes , please go to our article ' Bender 's big score ( +3 more ) ' .
Edit : ( Jon )
Lots and lots of things were said in this update , but all of them turned out to be wrong .
For archival purposes , I wont delete it .
But the conversation involving the topic is closed , and please take note to the two updates made at the bottom of this news piece .
Thanks , and sorry for any confusion .
Our friend Billy West has once again spilled the beans .
According to a post I 'm this close to selling my show --'' Billy Bastard -- Amateur Human Being , '' And the other good news is that they 're doing 26 new episodes of '' Futurama ' ' for TV and we 're hammering out the deal now .
The original plan was to have the DVD 's first but that 's no longer the case .
I 'm totaly jammed dude .
Greetings from the year 3000 !
It still sucks !
Billy Update : I 'm getting different bits of info that say this news may not be the case .
There IS something up Futurama project wise but but it might be the DVD 's still .
It 's hard to keep up with things -- but I 'll try to do better .
Sorry ,
Billy
So there you have it folks , the return of Futurama as a series may not be the case as of right now .
In related news that backs up the idea of Futurama coming to DVD rather than TV , Bill Morrison recently spoke to a fan about how the Futurama Movie script is almost finished at a convention in Germany .
Woot .
Update 2 : ( mArc )
Another well - informed source tells us that there was no basis in reality for the 26 episode rumor .
The plan to make direct - to - DVD movies is still existing .
Update 3 : ( Jon )
Bill Morrison was misquoted as to say that the Futurama script is almost finished , and rather was speaking about a Simpsons Movie script .
As of now , there 's no Futurama script .
Our friend Billy
West has once again spilled the beans .
According to a post he made on his message board , Futurama is going to be renewed for television with 26 episodes .
No word as to what station it will be on , who will rejoin the cast , or whether it 'll be two seasons that would consist of 13 episodes each or one HUGE season of 26 episodes .
Please keep in mind though , all this information is still very unofficial .
Nothing is down on paper .
No contracts signed .
Nada .
NOTHING .
But , it 's still pretty awesome .
So there you have it folks , the return of Futurama as a series may not be the case as of right now .
In related news that backs up the idea of Futurama coming to DVD rather than TV , Bill Morrison recently spoke to a fan about how the Futurama Movie script is almost finished at a convention in Germany .
Woot .

Republican Propaganda Is Not News
Over the past three weeks or so , the progressive movement – bloggers , Moveon.org , grassroots activists , filmmakers – pressured the Nevada Democratic Party to drop Fox News as the host of a presidential debate in August .
In pursuing this short campaign , we made two basic arguments that were eventually accepted by party leaders .
First , we argued that Fox News is not a news channel , but a propaganda outlet that regularly distorts , spins , and falsifies information .
Second , Fox News is heavily influenced or even controlled by the Republican Party itself .
As such , we believe that Fox News on the whole functions as a surrogate operation for the GOP .
Treating Fox as a legitimate news channel extends the Republican Party ’s ability to swift - boat and discredit our candidates .
In other words , Fox News is a direct pipeline of misinformation from the GOP leadership into the traditional press .

Thankfully , Fox News immediately proved our point with a press release after the debate cancellation that made the following remarkable claim : " News organizations will want to think twice before getting involved in the Nevada Democratic caucus which appears to be controlled by radical , fringe , out - of - state interest groups , not the Nevada Democratic Party . "
This statement has all the hallmarks of a Fox News - style Republican talking point .
First of all , it is falsified .
The pressure campaign included out - of - state Democrats , but it was anchored by local party members , including Nevada Democratic Party executive board member Mike Zahara .
And many Democratic activists in Nevada cheered at the decision to drop Fox .
After vigorous debate , the Nevada Democratic Party itself made the decision to cancel the debate , which directly contradicts Fox 's claims .
In addition , the release is partisan ; calling bloggers and Moveon.org “ radical ” and “ fringe ” is a recognized Republican strategy , certainly not what one would expect from a legitimate news source .
Falsifying information that is favorable to Republicans and problematic for Democrats is a regular tactic of Fox News .
Specific examples are breathtakingly dishonest , including the Obama Madrassa smear , Carl Cameron 's false claims that John Kerry referred to himself as a “ metrosexual ” and “ news anchor ” Brit Hume repeating the false canard that the public does not trust the Democratic Party on national defense .
But it 's the sweep of the disinformation campaign that suggests a genuine pattern of propagandistic manipulation of the public .
The Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland conducted a study in October 2003 of public knowledge and attitudes about current events , focusing on media consumption habits .
The study examined three generic misconceptions about the march to war in Iraq – alleged WMDs , purported Iraqi involvement in 9/11 , and supported international support for a U.S. invasion of Iraq .
While three - fifths of Americans held at least one of these misconceptions at the time , speaking to the poor quality of American punditry , Fox News viewers stood out – their viewers were " three times more likely than the next nearest network to hold all three misperceptions . "
Submit Your Editorials
More than 80 percent of Fox News viewers had a basic factual misconception about the war in Iraq , which were coincidentally used by the Bush administration to justify their policies at the time .
This should not be a surprise , as the leadership of Fox News is heavily tied into the Republican Party apparatus .
Let 's start with the top .
Roger Ailes learned his trade in 1968 at the feet of the granddaddy of GOP disinformation , Richard Nixon , continuing his career as a high level aide to Ronald Reagan 's 1984 campaign , and crafting George H.W. Bush 's media strategy in 1988 , including the infamous Willie Horton ads .
Ailes is n't the only high level Republican operative in a position of authority at the network .
Former “ Fox News Sunday ” host Tony Snow worked for President George H.W. Bush as a speechwriter , moved to the network , and then became White House press secretary for President George W. Bush .
Fox News , aside from its Republican leadership , supports the Republican Party overtly .
As Robert Greenwald of Foxattacks.com and OutFoxed discovered , Fox News executive John Moody hands down a memo with Republican messaging themes each day to guide editorial content .
Sometimes the support is more direct – just last month , Fox News personality Sean Hannity was the headline speaker at the South Carolina Republican Party 's Annual Silver Elephant Dinner .
Falsification of information is bad enough for an outlet channel that calls itself a news organization , but the overt ties to the Republican Party are deeply disturbing for our democracy as a whole .
This is not an ideological argument about diversity – Fox News is not really a conservative news channel , it is a Republican propaganda and surrogate operation , as Roger Ailes and Rupert Murdoch seem to have baked into their business model a wholesale allegiance to the Republican Party .
As one prominent activist wrote me , “ As liberal activists , we cannot stop FOX from operating , nor can we insist they provide fair programming .
But as the activists and rank and file of this party we can insist that our presidential primary candidates not legitimize them by debating on their airwaves . ”
I would add only that we can begin to force the debate that journalists , Democratic operatives , and elite newsmakers should have had a long time ago about the Republican propaganda outlet in their midst .
Matt Stoller is a blogger and thought leader in the internet wing of the progressive movement .
He writes at the well - respected liberal blog MyDD.com on progressive strategy , and is the president of the political action committee BlogPAC , which seeks to fund bloggers and progressive activists .
This is horrific .
You sad , sick people that masquerade as human beings in the name of America .
Watch this clip and then tell me how you feel about Pat Tilllman and the way the military treated him .
And do n't forget to dash in a perverted sense of Christianity to top it off .

ESPN :
Kauzlarich , now a battalion commanding officer at Fort Riley in Kansas , further suggested the Tillman family 's unhappiness with the findings of past investigations might be because of the absence of a Christian faith in their lives .
In an interview with ESPN.com , Kauzlarich said : " When you die , I mean , there is supposedly a better life , right ?
Well , if you are an atheist and you do n't believe in anything , if you die , what is there to go to ?
Nothing .
You are worm dirt .
So for their son to die for nothing , and now he is no more — that is pretty hard to get your head around that .
So I do n't know how an atheist thinks .
I can only imagine that that would be pretty tough . "
Asked by ESPN.com whether the Tillmans ' religious beliefs are a factor in the ongoing investigation , Kauzlarich said , " I think so .
There is not a whole lot of trust in the system or faith in the system [ by the Tillmans ] .
So that is my personal opinion , knowing what I know . "
10 . The U.S. military has absolutely no right , whether legal or moral , to be killing people who live in Iraq .
It has no right to even be in Iraq .
Why is this ?
Because neither the Iraqi government nor the Iraqi people ever attacked the United States .
This fact makes the war in Iraq an optional one , not a necessary one .
To reiterate what should be obvious , the fact that the U.S. was attacked in 2001 does not give this country the right to attack and kill people who had nothing to do with those crimes .
It is morally acceptable to go after criminals , but it is a crime to kill their families , their friends , their neighbors , or anyone else not criminally complicit .
9 . Both political parties have pursued a foreign policy of aggression for decades , and where has that gotten us ?
Our military is based in over 120 countries around the world .
The U.S. government has spent billions and billions of dollars of our tax money to prop up dictators and despotic regimes .
It has armed people such as Osama bin Laden and the " freedom fighters " in Afghanistan , Saddam Hussein , and Manuel Noriega , only to use military force to oust them later on .
This type of foreign policy has driven people all over the world to hate us .
Do n't we have enough enemies yet ?
Is n't it time to say enough is enough ?
8 . Since this war began back in 1991 , millions of people have been driven from their homes , injured , or killed .
Considering this fact , I can not be convinced that the Iraqi people are better off in any way .
7 . In a free country , aggressive war should never be used as a tool of foreign policy .
Using force to impose what American politicians consider to be a proper government for Iraq violates every principle of freedom which this country is supposed to stand for .
This is not freedom for Iraqis
6 . No one can convince me that kindness and charity are the primary motives in a war where hundreds of billions of dollars are forcibly redistributed from American citizens to the military - industrial complex ; especially the weapons - manufacturers .
Maybe something else motivates the war - makers .
Could it be greed ?
5 . Like virtually every war , this war is being funded through the coercive method of taxation .
The wealth of the American people is being forcibly transferred to the government and their corporate partners ; the merchants of death .
Just considering this one point , the war in Iraq is just as immoral and illegal as stealing from one person to give to another .
On top of this , taxation , deficit - spending , and the printing of money gives the government an almost unlimited source of funding .
Thus , there is no incentive for the government to spend the money wisely , because it can always get more - from us .
Conversely , the access to such vast wealth is actually an incentive to continue the war perpetually .
The ability to grow in wealth and power is something that not many politicians have had the strength to resist throughout history .
American politicians are no different .
4 . The Iraq War is the polar opposite of any proper concept of self - defense .
The United States is the aggressor and Iraq is the defender ; plain and simple .
This fact brings up some very difficult moral and legal issues for everyone involved .
Thomas Paine may have summed it up best :
" Not all the treasures of the world , so far as I believe , could have induced me to support an offensive war , for I think it murder . "
3 . We fought in Vietnam to stop the " domino effect " of communism , but when the communists took over , the world did n't come to an end .
We " saved " Kuwait from an evil dictator , but it 's still run by a family dynasty that has no interest in liberty for the people .
We waged war on Afghanistan to capture Osama bin Laden .
Oddly , rights violations are still rampant and Afghani opium production has soared since the invasion .
And then , of course , we have all the " good " done in Iraq .
This foreign policy of aggression and intervention , which we have seen grow in preeminence over the last century , just does n't work .
The politicians promise us peace ; they promise us security ; they promise us anything to get us to go along with their policies , but what happens ?
In virtually every situation , the intervention totally fails , or the " enemy " is replaced by another despotic regime .
The U.S. government has caused chaos in Iraq , and the time for that to come to an end is now .
2 . You do n't bring freedom to people by waging war on their cities and towns , and you do n't protect innocent people by killing innocent people .
It is a crime to aggressively take the life of another person .
There is no murder of innocent people that can be justified by claiming that it was necessary for the " greater good . "
If you consider that to be the right way of handling the problems in Iraq , you more closely resemble Joseph Stalin 's way of thinking than that of liberty - lovers like Patrick Henry and Thomas Paine .
And the No. 1 reason to get the U.S. out of Iraq ... now ...
1 . The warfare state is , hands down , the greatest threat to liberty .
In war , the government always claims the need for massive power , and it uses war as an excuse to expand its control over our lives in every way possible .
War , the politicians claim , " changes everything . "
They tap our phones , read our emails , monitor our bank accounts , and give us " free speech zones . "
They consider torture acceptable and imprison people indefinitely .
They take our property , waste our resources , and threaten to spend our economy into oblivion .
Throughout history , even kings and queens have often failed to survive such disastrous governance .
And , just in case that 's not enough , here 's one more " bonus " reason to get out Iraq now :
The Constitution does not give the president the power to wage war without first getting a declaration of war from Congress .
Although some try to claim that the 2002 Authorization to Use Military Force ( AUMF ) fulfilled this requirement , it did not .
All it did was transfer a Constitutional power - the power to declare war - from congress to the president .
This transfer of power is a violation of the Constitution in and of itself .
Thus , the president violated the Constitution by waging war on Iraq without a declaration of war from congress .
And , possibly even more important , everyone in congress who voted for the AUMF in 2002 violated the Constitution as well by illegally transferring their power to declare war to the president .
This is how the U.S. government has handled every war since World War II .
By allowing the government to wage undeclared wars , politicians from both political parties have violated their Constitutional oaths repeatedly .
Whether you like it or not , the Constitution is not just a set of loose guidelines , it 's the law .
Now is the time to demand that our representatives in government abide by the law .
We must stop allowing Presidents to drag us into wars , which they later claim we have to continue for years and years until the " job is done . "
NATIONAL DEFENSE , NOT OFFENSE
If government should be playing any role at all in foreign affairs , it should be only to keep us out of wars .
Their sole job is to ensure that this country will not be attacked so you and your family can live in peace .
I 'd actually like to see some national defense for once in this country ; all we have now is a national offense .
Such things as staging coups , backing dictators with billions in foreign aid , basing our military in over 120 nations , and attacking other countries does nothing to keep this country safe .
In fact , it does just the opposite , and almost guarantees more war in the future .
To make this country safer , we do n't need to increase the power of the politicians , and we definitely do n't need more national offense .
We do n't need more weapons , a larger military , or wars in more countries .
We need the exact opposite of this .
We need to focus on defending the country rather than aggressing against the rest of the world .
The only reason to have a military force at all is to deter and discourage potential invaders ; it 's not to be used as a pre-emptive strike force .
If the attackers come anyway , it 's the military 's job to repel them at our borders .
Nothing more , nothing less .
If they 're unable to do that job , maybe we should consider something different .
WHAT NOW ?
The path this country is on right now , the path of empire and militarism , will only guarantee us more violence , death , and loss of liberty .
This state of affairs is intolerable .
The right plan , in the short term , is the immediate withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Iraq .
Now .
Not when the violence " subsides . "
Not when Iraq has a stable government .
Not when more Iraqi forces are trained .
Not when the Democrats tell us the war is over , not when the Republicans tell us the war is over , and not when we have a new president .
The time to leave Iraq is now .
Not in the fall .
Not next year .
Not next month or next week .
Today , not tomorrow - right now .
Could the entire U.S. Military machine and its associated contractors leave Iraq this very moment ?
Obviously not .
But , we could easily announce an immediate cessation of aggressive hostilities , and start mobilizing all of our resources to transport the troops out right away .
It did n't take all that long to march into Iraq , and it wo n't take that long to march right on out .
FOR THE FUTURE
I hope that the painful lessons of the Iraq war will cause the American people to realize that the only solution to our foreign policy problems , including our nation 's security , is not just a withdrawal from Iraq .
These long - term measures should be taken :
Bring all U.S. troops home .
All of them .
Stop inciting violence against us by backing coups and despotic regimes .
Stop telling other countries what type of government they should have , who their leaders should be , and what their policies should be .
End all foreign aid ; both military and economic .
Allow the American people , with their own free will , to decide which charities and movements they want to support with their money and lives .

On top of these essential measures , we must clearly recognize that people in other countries do n't hate us for " being free . "
They attack us when our government continually interferes in their lives .
This long - term solution requires a return to our nation 's founding principles of individual liberty .
This is quite contrary to America 's current policies of militarism , endless foreign aid , massive standing armies , assassinations , coups , deadly sanctions , and wars .
As a nation , wesolve all the problems of the world .
We can not bring peace to the world .
And , as the historical record shows , we can not trust our politicians to do so either .
Such has been the arrogance of many of the most murderous tyrants in world history , and such has been the path to their destruction .
We may not be able to stop war and bloodshed in places like Darfur , and we may not be able to bring liberty to places like North Korea .
But , by standing up for what we believe in , our voices can make a real difference in what ouris allowed to do .
When a government that rules in our name engages in torture , killing , and war , the number one question that will be asked of us someday is this : did you rise in opposition to it ?
Did you speak out against it ?
Or , did you approve of it by remaining silent ?
I , for one , rise in opposition , and will continue to speak out .

After 10,000 years here , they
seem to have all but vanished from
the landscape in many areas .
But
now the red squirrel is fighting
back .
A pioneering project to protect its
last strongholds and halt the seemingly
unstoppable spread of the rival
grey squirrel has had surprisingly
quick results .
In three areas in Northumberland , greys
have been cleared , and in one of those
spots reds have returned and even started
breeding .
The success has also led to the sound of
birdsong returning because , while grey
squirrels eat young birds , reds do not .
Organisers of the scheme hope the
success could be repeated countrywide ,
although they insist they do not want to
eradicate the grey squirrel .
Scroll down for more
The project , funded by the Department
for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ,
works by laying down traps to catch squirrels .
Any greys caught are killed humanely
while reds are re-released .
Mike Bell , co-ordinator of the Red Squirrel
Protection Partnership , said : ' This is n't
about eradicating the grey squirrel .
It's
about having an area of the UK where
there are red squirrels left . '
He said the project had shown greys
were more prevalent than previously
thought .
His colleague Paul Parker said :
' People think grey squirrels are nice little
cuddly things .
They 're not .
They are no good whatsoever .
If we do n’t get rid
of them now , we 'll have greys right
across the country .'
Reds are believed to have come to
Britain from mainland Europe by
the end of the last Ice Age .
Over the last century they have
declined to the point where they are
extinct in much of southern England ,
Northern Ireland and Wales
and are an endangered species .
The main cause has been the
arrival of the grey squirrel from
America .
The first pair were released
in Henbury Park , Cheshire , in 1876 .
More were released until the 1930s
when it became illegal to introduce
any into the wild .
Currently there are only an estimated
120,000 red squirrels in
Britain but around three million
greys , which dominate most of
England and Wales .
The greys are a problem because
they are better than the reds at finding
food and shelter and spread the
squirrel - pox virus which they are
immune to , but which kills the reds .
They are also a pest for gardeners
because they steal bulbs .
The Northumberland scheme began late last year and will last two
years , though organisers hope it will
be extended .
They want to get rid of all greys
between the rivers Tyne and Tweed .
So far red squirrels have returned
and bred in Vindolanda , a Roman
fort on Hadrian ’s Wall .
Fifty greys
were removed in Stockfield , leading
to a rise in bird numbers , while in
Heddon 43 greys were snared .
The project was started by Lord
Redesdale , the LibDem agriculture
spokesman in the Lords .
He said : ' If
we had left it another five or ten
years there would n't be a red squirrel
left in Northumberland .'

An Open Challenge to David Maynor and Jon Ellch
When I play poker , I will occasionally place or call bets that I expect to lose .
Sometimes it ’s a simple matter of pot odds — a bet that ’s a mathematically sound long shot .
Occasionally , though , I ’ll throw away money on a bad bet simply because I want to see an opponent ’s cards .
( When you win a hand because everyone else has folded , which happens frequently , you do n’t have to show your cards . )
The idea is that knowledge I ’ll gain from seeing my opponent ’s cards is worth more than the bet I expect to lose .
Obviously , this is n’t something you want to do frequently .
With that in mind , I ’m issuing the following challenge to David Maynor and Jon Ellch :
If you can hijack a brand - new MacBook out of the box , it ’s yours to keep .
Stipulations :
We ’ll meet at an Apple store — or other reseller of Mac hardware — convenient to you .
If the location is not convenient for me , I may choose to be represented by one or more trusted readers of Daring Fireball .
I will purchase a new MacBook .
We ’ll proceed to an agreed - upon location for the hijacking to take place .
The hijacking will be videotaped , including the display of the MacBook .
The technical details of the hijacking itself , including the network traffic , will not be examined or recorded .
I.e. nothing will be revealed about how the hijacking is performed , only that it can be done .
( I offer this stipulation not because I would n’t want to know the details — I very much would — but because this sort of “ we do n’t want to reveal how it works ” thinking is clearly the only possible explanation for Maynor and Ellch ’s continued silence on the issue , if they in fact have discovered such an exploit . )
I will open the MacBook and proceed through the initial first - run configuration .
The initial administrator user account will be the only user account on the machine .
I believe AirPort is turned on by default , but if it is n’t , I ’ll turn it on using the system - wide AirPort menu .
I will not otherwise diddle with the default network and firewall settings of the MacBook .
If prompted to join an available Wi-Fi network , I will refuse .
I.e. AirPort will be turned on , but the attack ca n’t be based on the assumption that the user is willing to join an untrusted network created by the attacking machine , or that the MacBook ’s Wi-Fi settings have been changed from their defaults to allow joining new networks without asking .
No additional hardware or software will be installed on the machine .
At no point before the contest has been decided do you , the challengers , get to physically touch the machine .
I will create a file on the desktop of the MacBook .
This file will be created with the default ownership and file permissions — read and write access for the current user , read - only access for the group and world .
If you delete this file within one hour , you win the challenge , and the MacBook is yours to keep .
If you do n’t delete the file within one hour , you pay me the full retail price of the MacBook .
If you can crash the machine or crash the current login session , we ’ll call it a draw .
I keep the MacBook , and you do n’t have to pay for it .
If the offer is not accepted by September 8 , 2006 , it will be rescinded .
As for the earlier analogy to poker , I ’m no fool .
I do n’t expect to lose this particular bet — but I do n’t expect to win it , either .
I expect to be ignored .
I do n’t think Maynor and Ellch have discovered such a vulnerability in the default MacBook AirPort card and driver , and so , if I ’m right , they certainly wo n’t accept this challenge .
I think what they ’ve discovered — if they ’ve in fact discovered anything useful at all — is a class of potential Wi-Fi - based exploit , which they demonstrated on a rigged MacBook to generate publicity at the expense of the Mac ’s renowned reputation for security , but that they have not found an actual exploit based on this technique that works against the MacBook ’s built - in AirPort .
If I ’m wrong , and they have discovered such a vulnerability , they may or may not choose to accept this challenge .
But it ’s a bet that they ’ll only accept if they can win .
It comes down to this .
If I ’m wrong , it ’d be worth $ 1099 to know that MacBook users are in fact at risk .
And if I ’m right , someone needs to call Maynor and Ellch on their bullshit .
Conservative blog declares ' war ' on GOP ' perverts , louts , criminals '
Nick Juliano
Published : Monday May 14 , 2007 Print This Email

One of the most prominent conservative blogs has started a crusade against Republicans who it says continue to promote ethically questionable congressmen and ignore the will of their base .
" A group of men and women across this nation ... are tired of defending a party that continually puts into positions of power known perverts , louts , and corrupt common criminals , " RedState.com editor Erick Erickson wrote in a post Monday outlining his " battle plan " against Republican leaders .
" We must be willing to wage war upon them until they bend to common sense and decency . "
RedState is encouraging its readers to refuse to support Republican re-election efforts until Rep. Ken Calvert ( R - CA ) is booted from the House Appropriations Committee .
The site , which averages more than 25,000 visits per day , posted a " declaration of war " against Republican leaders Friday .
Calvert is replacing fellow California Republican Rep. John Doolittle , who has stepped down from the committee in the midst of an FBI investigation into his wife 's business association with convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
Erickson says Calvert is just as corrupt as Doolittle , citing press reports outlining a questionable land deal in which Calvert made more than $ 400,000 profit .
Calvert sold the property for nearly $ 1 million in 2006 after securing millions of dollars in federal earmarks to build a traffic interchange 15 miles away .
Calvert has said the deal was not a conflict of interest and insisted the , i> Los Angeles Times , which first reported the story in 2006 , twisted the facts to create an impression of ethical impropriety .
RedState is asking its readers to call the offices of more than two dozen Republican leaders and steering committee members to find out who voted for Calvert 's appointment to the Appropriations Committee .
RedState readers also are being asked to refuse any donations to Republican candidates or the National Republican Congressional Committee until Calvert is removed .
Calvert responded to the allegations in a comment posted to the blog Friday , saying the allegations of ethical problems were " completely false . "
" In my 14 years of service in the U.S. Congress , I have always held myself to the highest ethical standards and remain committed to upholding the faith placed in me by our Republican Leadership and all my Republican colleagues , " Calvert wrote .
The campaign against Calvert is not limited to his real estate history .
A post Monday suggested questions to ask members of Congress who supported Calvert , including , " Are you aware that Ken Calvert paid a heroin addicted prostitute for oral sex ? "
Calvert spokeswoman Rebecca Rudman said it was " unfortunate " that those charges were being rehashed now .
" That 's an incident that occurred 15 years ago , " Rudman told RAW STORY .
" Obviously the Congressman dealt with it then , so I do n't know what else there is to say about that . "
According to press reports , Calvert was detained by police in 1993 after an officer noticed him sitting with his pants unzipped in a parked car with a convicted prostitute .
Calvert and the woman said they just " pulled over to talk . "
In his battle cry , Erickson said RedState readers should be willing to see Republicans lose elections rather than continue to support corrupt lawmakers .
RedState is targeting Republican members of the House Steering Committee , which decides committee appointments , and asking them to support Calvert 's removal .
Also targeted is Rep. Tom Cole , chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee ; RedState readers are asked to " pledge not to give not one dime nor bit of energy to the NRCC " as long as Calvert remains on the Appropriations Committee .
And readers should deliver the same message to House Minority Leader Rep. John Boehner , R - Ohio .
An NRCC spokeswoman said the committee " believe (s ) the blogosphere plays an important role in political debate " and looks forward to working with bloggers in campaigns against Democrats this year .
Calls to Boehner 's office were not immediately returned Monday .
" If we must take on the vulnerable members of the House Steering Committee and contribute even to their electoral defeat , so be it , " Erickson writes .
" This party of ours must be pruned and it must be pruned by those of us who care about it before meeting the butchers ' shears in the hands of the voters again in 2008 . "
