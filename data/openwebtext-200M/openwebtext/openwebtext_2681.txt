Digital cameras have introduced us to a world of possibilities that were previously not available with shooting film .
The ability to instantly see what we 've captured , and to edit , share and print the images has changed how we take pictures .
It has also changed how many photographs we take , where they get stored and what we do with them .
We were limited to 36 images per roll of film , now an average digital camera can store hundreds if not thousands of photographs on memory cards , encouraging ( even taunting ) us to shoot more .
Shooting more photos means capturing more memories , always a great thing .
The downside is what to do with all of them , how to manage them , keep them backed up and share with friends and family .
Utilizing local , network and online storage for backing up is a great , easy idea , and allows sharing the memories without the need or pain of attaching large files to email .
Local and Online Solution
This is an amazing solution in that you get the best of both worlds .
Local storage , which is easily accessible , to an entire home or office , and online storage , accessible from any location with high - speed internet access .
This solution is called a network attached storage ( NAS ) device , an example of which is the WD My Book World Edition .
This device also takes the guesswork out of backup procedures with automatic and continuous backup software .
Utilizing the included MioNet software , you can also access your NAS from anywhere that has an Internet connection .
This is a big advantage over external hard drives directly attached to your computer and the reason that we advocate using a NAS .
As a photographer taking pictures anytime , anyplace , would n't it be nice to be able to upload all the day 's shots to the NAS device in your home or office ?
You can rest assured all is safe , and if you have a staff , they can begin working with photos while you are on to the next shoot .
Being cross platform and supported by both Windows and Mac means you can painlessly share and access all the photos and data you have on your home network , or anywhere in the world .

Teams :
Italy : Buffon ; Zambrotta , Cannavaro , Chiellini , Grosso ; Brighi , Pirlo , De Rossi ; Pepe , Pazzini , Iaquinta .
Ireland : Given ; McShane , Dunne .
O'Shea , Kilbane ; Keogh , Whelan , Andrews , Hunt ; Doyle , Keane .
Ref : Wolfgang Stark
Preamble :
" You 'll never beat the Irish " goes the celebrated chant and the unspoken flip - side of that has usually been " and the Irish probably wo n't beat you " .
At least when we 're playing away .
Decent draws have been earned , but not since February 1987 have Ireland toppled an above - average side on their own patch ( * note to younger readers : that was a 1 - 0 win over Scotland at Hampden .
** additional note to younger readers : yes , Scotland were an above - average side back then ) and there are , as a confused friend of mine put it this morning , " two chances of that run ending tonight : No chance and Bob Chance . "
Not that Giovanni Trapattoni will be particularly ambitious in his attempt to beat the world champions :
Trap , unlike fabled cockles - and - mussles pedlar Molly Malone , will surely only set his stall out for a draw .
And that would be a fine result .
Of course , for that feat to be achieved , and unseemly pining for Andy Reid to be avoided , Andy Keogh will probably have to have the game of his life .
As will Glenn Whelan .
And Stephen Hunt .
And even Keith Andrews , who is probably the most accomplished of the Irish midfielders in action tonight ( emerging , perhaps , as the new Mark Kinsella ) .
As will Richard Dunne , Shay Given , Paul McShane , John O'Shea etc and so forth .
But Italy are not perfect ; Fabio Cannavaro , for example , is clearly on the wane .
It can be done .
For us fans of small nations , international football is all about giddy optimism and , now and again , epoch - defining drinking binges .
Do not give up hope of an agonising Thursday morning hangover .
7:50 pm : A minute 's silence for the victims of Sunday 's stadium disaster in Ivory Coast .
1 min : Robbie Keane sets the game in motion , and within seconds Kilbane has walloped it up to ... Buffon .
Meanwhile , Darren McVeigh has poetry on his mind :
" O Trappatoni ,
Are you but a phoney ?
Where is big Andy Reid
In Our hour of need ?
And why is this Keogh fella starting ?
3 mins : O'Shea lies crumpled on the ground with blood seeping from his forehead following a clash with Pazzini .
The ref calls the Italian over and indicates viaarm gestures that he saw illicit use of the elbow ... and the shows only a red card !
The replay shows it was more than a trifle harsh .
Trapattoni's luck comes to the fore again - beautiful !
5 mins :
The question now is will that expulsion spur Ireland into attacking with gusto or will Trap keep things tight ?
The early signs are the players sense an upset is possible , and both Whelan and Keane have burst forward encouragingly in the last 60 seconds , though the ventures ultiamtely came to nothing as both players selected the wrong passes .
7 mins :
The tifosi are furious and the cameras - presumably manned by Italians - are continually focusing on the ref as if to say " remember this face " ...
8 mins : Italy have yet to threaten at all , and the bitter boos from the crowd show that O'Shea has returned to the fray , his wound having been stitched up .
GOAL !
Italy 1 - 0 Ireland ( Iaquinta 10 ' )
11 mins : That was diabolical defending by Ireland !
Grosso collected a pedestrian ball into the box and twisted past McShane far too easily before knocking the ball across the face of goal .
Iaquinta stole effortlessly between Dunne and O'Shea to tap it ito the net .
13 mins :
So now Italy can do what Ireland originally planned to do , no doubt : sit back and perhaps launch the occasional counter - attack .
Can Trap adapt ?
Ireland have reacted to the goal with plenty of energy , but no cohesion yet .
15 mins : Ireland are having plenty of possession but it's all in front of the home side , and with the referee seemingly intent on intoning for the red card he showed Pazzini by blowing up every time Ireland get near the Italian box , things are looking ominous .
17 mins :
Hunt scampers boldly into the box and attempts to dart past Chiellini , who leans into him .
Hunt collapses to the ground hopefully , but the ref , quite rightly , is n't going to give a penalty for that .
18 mins : As Italy try to play their way out of trouble , the ever - alert Andrews dispossess Pirlo - but the ref , inevitably , whistles for a foul .
" Jaysus Paul , what is beautiful about O'Shea bleeding , or some poor sod
geeting an unjust red card , " howls Kevin Mannerings .
" Oh hold on , I see what you mean . "
20 mins :
The play has become very bitty , and the Italians seems perfectly happy about that .
Ireland have shown lots of heart but not enough quality to truly ruffle the home side since falling behind .
Keane has been lively and influential but Doyle can't get into the game .
23 mins : Now here 's a thing : deeply uncharacteristically , Trap is preparing to make an early substitution .
What 's more , it seems to be an attacking one - Caleb Folan is coming on for Keogh , who does n't appear to be injured .
A switch to 4 - 3 - 3 seems to be the order .
24 mins : Crisp Italian passing culminates with Pepe receiving the ball on the right - hand corner of the Irish box .
Rather than shoot , .
he elected to curl a cross towards the far post , where there was no one .
A mercifully bonkers choice .
25 mins : Hunt swings in a dangerous corner but Iaquinta rises well to head it clear before Dunne could connect .
26 mins : Keane , who has dropped slightly deeper since the introduction of Folan - perhaps in order tomore effectively fullfil the fantasista role Trap envisages for him - , collects the ball 30 yards from goal , saunters forward and unleashes a reasonable shot that flies over the bar .
28 mins : Given has clearly been instructed by Trap never to roll the ball to his full - backs .
Packie Bonner - esque hoofs forward are what he's all about now , and Italy are coping with them handily .
Having said that , a loose ball by Chiellini is McShane 's cue to scurry forward and he sends in a useful cross from the right .
Cannavaro whacks it clear , however .
30 mins : Folan has shown some tidy touches since coming on , controllign the ball and releasing it wide before spinning and dashing forward in search of a return pass .
His neatness and pace offer renewed hope .
32 mins : McShane launches a cross into the box from the right touch - line ; Keane takes it down but the ball then runs away from him ... and into the path of Andrews , 15 yards from goal !
Arrrrrgh !
He completely mis-hit his shot and the ball trickled wide .
34 mins : Yikes !
Given could have been more shakey there if he 'd dressed in denim and sung Green Door .
He fumbled a Grosso cross straight into the path of Iaquinta , and was grateful to see Dunne turn up to tidy up the mess he 'd made .
35 mins : Trademark Italian defending thwarts Ireland , Chiellini and Cannavaro hurling themselves at a series of snapshots from the edge of the box , mainly from impressive Keane .
37 mins : Excellent defending by Dunne , who read Pirlo 's ball well enough to intercept it before Iaquinta even realised it had been attempted .
39 mins : France - based Grosso is coming across all Marquis de Sade on poor old McShane , torturing him for the sheer hell of it .
Fortunately for the full - back , Given has just hurtled from his box to help him out , smashing the ball clear with relish .
40 mins : Pirlo lifts a ball over the top towards the rightr - back area - which has rapidly emerged as Ireland 's weak spot - and Grosso sends a terrific volley just ver the bar .
But he was offside .
41 mins : Ohhhhhh !
A magnificent attempt by Hunt , who fired a swirling drive at goal from 25 yards only to be denied by an even more magnificent , one - handed save by Buffon .
43 mins : Throw - in to Ireland near the italian corner flag ( right , if you must know ) .
It 's hurled in by Kilbane ... and smashed out by Chiellini .
45 mins : Ireland end the half on the attack , a somewhat blunt attack , but the intention is at least there and , in fairness , Ireland have created a couple of half - chances in this period .
There is hope for the second half .
" Is it just me or does anyone else think that Hunt 's shot was just like that of Ray Houghton against Italy in USA ' 94 , " squawks Richard Leonard .
" Or have I got a touch of the Hamiltons ? " I would argue that it was a better shot - a truer strike - and , alas , that Buffon 's positioning and gility was infinitely superior to Pagluica 's on that glorious day .
Half - time : " I can't believe you described Pazzini 's red card as a " trifle harsh " , " thunders Tommer Spence .
" He elbowed the man in the face and drew a lot of blood !
In Serie A that would have earned a player ( though probably not an Italian one ) a massive ban .
Compare it to Iaquinta collapsing when Doyle moved his leg 30 cm away from him - 20 mins - which you failed to mention .
Shame ! "
Admittedly my picture is grainy , but I did n't see any aggressive thrust from Pazzini 's elbow , he seemed merely to be using his arm for leverage and the clash looked more unfortunate than hostile .
Intriguingly , the ref seemed to brandish a yellow before hastily putting it back in his pocket and opting for the red .
46 mins : Italy have made a change but I can't tell you waht it is .
Not because I 'm sworn to secrecy , rather because the picture quality has deteriorated drastically .
" Re : the sending off , I 've just seen the replay and I would agree with you , " booms Liam Rooney .
" It was a flailing arm rather than an elbow , and if O'Shea had n't come over all Henry Cooper , it would have been a free .
Oh - on RTE Dunphy also agrees with that , which probably means that in fact it was a vicious and pre-meditated assault .
Still , we should get something from this should n't we ?
We would have thumped Bulgaria if he had played 4 - 3 - 3 . "
48 mins : Italy tore into Ireland from the resumption but that little stsorm has passed and now the first - half pattern has returned , Ireland stroking the ball around purposefully but unable to summon any penetration .
" Even the RTE commentators are saying that Pazzini did n't deserve a red card , " wibbles Carissa Amash .
" Yes , we 're really multi- tasking over here in the US - Irish radio and the MBM ! "
A potent cocktail and no mistake .
50 mins : The Italian substitution , I can now reveal , involved replacing Pirlo with Palombo .
Showing his class , Pirlo sits down on the bench and immedaitely bewgins texting .
Meanwhile on the Irish side , McShane appears to have been shifted into the middle and O'Shea has been sent out wide to cope with Grosso .
It had to be done .
52 mins : Irish change : Darron Gibson on for Andrews .
Central creativity urgently required .
Meanwhile , Lippi withdraws Pepe for Liverpool 's Dossena .
55 mins : Doyle flicks the ball on for Hunt , who colides with Buffon in his eagerness to get to it .
Again he bays for a penalty , again the ref is right to deny it .
57 mins : Italy are camped on the edge of their own box and Ireland are probing vigorously , but still that elusive final ball is , um , eludes them .
59 mins : Physical contact = freekick to Italy on half - way .
He 's annoying , this ref .
61 mins :
Whelan dashes forward down the right and slips a nice ball through to Doyle , who pivots sharply and tries to pick out Keane on the penalty spot .
But Cannavaro read his intentions and budles the ball away .
63 mins : Seldom can an Irish side have had so much possession against reigning world champions .
True , Italy are not pressing , choosing to invite the Irish into their third of the pitch before putting up any resistance , but you can't escape the sense that sooner or later some Irishman is going to pick out a canny pass and present a team - mate with an opening ...
64 mins : Irish change : Doyle off , Noel Hunt on .
65 mins : Dossena throws himself at Whelan and knocks the ball out of play .
The increasingly irritating referee gives the bthrow - in to Italy .
66 mins : Same as before .
" Lovely photo ! " blurts Liam Rooney .
" O' Shea pouring blood and Pazzini holding his elbow !
I 've done a Dunphy and changed my mind on a whim , what more evidence do you need ?
Very funny and Pazzini looks seriously sheepish . "
He 's a wolf under that clothing though .
68 mins : " I can always escape the sense that Ireland are going to play a canny pass , " scoffs Hugh Collins .
" The sense that Keane will miss a header from three yards out , or that Gibson will give away possession in midfield - THOSE are the inescapables . "
Perhaps , but Ireland have played well tonight , within their limitations .
69 mins : Grosso booked for barging into S Hunt as he was about to cross from the right .
Gibson plays it short to S Hunt , whose cross is nodded behind for a corner .
But N Hunt 's delivery is wretched and Italy clear .
70 mins : N Hunt nicks a corner with widlly optimistic shot from 30 yards .
Then drifts said corner into Buffon 's arms .
72 mins : Vicious low Kilbane cross is bundled away by Cannavaro .
74 mins : McShane is booked protesting against a crazy refereeing decision .
Iaquinta elbowed him in the face - with much more force than Pazzini used earlier on - and Italy get the free - kick !
And they nearly scored from it , Chiellini narrowly failing to connect with the cleverly - flighted cross .
76 mins : After another absurd decision , Italy send another free - kick into the danger zone and this time it 's Iaquinta who has to look to the heavens and waves his hands in stereotypically Italian fashion after narrowly failing to connect .
77 mins : S Hunt creeps off side just as Ireland begin to re-exert pressure ...
79 mins : Rampaging run by Whelan , who is savagely hacked down by Chiellini on the edge of the box .
81 mins : N Hunt wins a corner for Ireland .
Gibson 's delivery is rubbish .
82 mins : A rare counter - attack from Italy almost leads to a goal , but Whelan scampered back to tip the ball away from Dossena just as he was poised to knock Iaquinta 's cross into the net .
84 mins : Yert another Irish corner after Buffon tips a Kilbane long - ranger over the bar .
Again , however , the delivery is poor .
85 mins : Cannavaro performs a reprise of the tackle that should have earned him a red card in Montenegro on Satuirday , this time Kilbane was the victim .
And the ref does n't even give a yellow .
And the free - kick is lofted into the box before being easily punted clear .
GOAL !
Italy 1 - 1 Ireland ( Keane 86 ' )
86 mins : Caleb Folan superstar !
He 's been tidy and speedy tonight , a splendid link in a strong IRish chain .
But neither his pace nor his poise were required there as he jumped with Niall Quinn - esque abandon in a bid to meet a hefty Given punt .
That was enough to destabilise the Italian defence and the ball broke to Keane , who slapped it into the net from right yards !
JUSTICE !
88 mins : Ireland are going for the winner , and both Whelan and N Hunt come within inches of prodding a bouncing ball into the net !
" Pitiful Irish side cannot beat 10 - men Italy ! " mocks Stanislav Pondev .
" You are laughable with your biased commentary . "
Stanislav adds , wholly unnecesarily , that he is Bulgarian .
90 mins : Corner after corner for Ireland , nervously defended by Italy , who suddenly fear that their first ever defeat in Bari could be close ...
90+2 mins : N Hunt gifts
Italy a chance to relieve the pressure by clumsily clattering into Zambrotta .
90+3 mins :
Ohhhhhhhhhh !
Folan again flicks on a long ball and Keane again met it , this time with a flying volley !
He was too eager , had he waited for the ball to drop just a few inches lower - and he had got the jump on the defence so could have done - his fierce shot would have been a few inches lower and therefore on target .
Full - time : A fine performance by Ireland and a fine result .
It was not a world - class display but the Irish were more than merely gutsy , they clearly played to the summit of their potential ( shoddy set - pieces aside ) and certainly deserved at least a point .
This should give them powerful confidence for the rest of the campaign , and leaves them in a pleasant position in the group , with their toughest assignment behind them .
Trap showed adventure and a willingness to make decisive substitutions that we never knew he had , and Caleb Folan may just have emerged as the target - man we 've been craving .
THE CSIRO has won a long legal battle with the some of the world 's leading technology companies in an outcome that will give a substantial financial windfall to Australia 's peak scientific body .
The case revolved around the CSIRO 's patented wireless local area network technology , a process invented in the 1990s that is being used in almost every wireless device - including mobile phones , computers , game consoles , networking equipment and internet - enabled TVs .
" We are very pleased with the outcome in financial terms , " said Mike Whelan , the deputy chief executive , operations .
" In aggregate , it will present the largest amount from IP [ intellectual property ] that this organisation has ever earned . "
Based on the outcome of recent technology patent cases , the settlement is likely to run into millions of dollars .
On Monday a judge in Texas finalised the settlement after the last of the 14 companies accused of infringing CSIRO 's patent agreed to negotiate .
Under the terms of the settlement CSIRO was prevented broadcasting news of the resolution , which is why it has only now filtered out .
British woman dives 314 feet below the Atlantic on a single breath
37 - year - old breath - holding expert Sara Campbell pushed the limits of human endurance to new levels as she dived 96 meters ( 314 feet ) below the surface of the Atlantic and back again on just one breath .
Last night , at Vertical Blue competition on Bahamas ’ Long Island , Campbell went deeper than any female diver has gone before without breathing apparatus or equipment to accelerate her plunge .
By holding her breath for 3 minutes and 36 seconds , Campbell broke the world record in freediving .
“ The dive felt great and I ’m just feeling fantastic , ” she told The Times .
“ At one point I started feeling negative thoughts — ‘ Do I really want to do this ? ’ — but then I told myself not to be ridiculous , just get it done , go for the bottom .
Dubbed as ‘ Mighty Mouse ’ because of her petite five foot frame , Campbell has been studied by doctors to try to understand her amazing physiology .
Her lungs are 25 percent bigger than an average person of her size and weight , allowing her to pack more air into her system before she descends .
Campbell will return to the water after four days in an attempt to conquer her record with a 100 - meter dive .
“ It ’s a big number , but I believe I have it in me , ” she said .
The world record for a person holding their breath under water while static is 10 minutes 12 seconds .
Unemployment in California shot to 11.2 % in March , the highest level since the state began keeping records .
What ’s more , the number of people out of work for almost a year rose by 9.4 % , and has now doubled in the last 12 months .
Carpenter Luiz Vasquez knows the frustration all too well .
In the last year , he said , he worked only two weeks .
“ I go through town , and I do not hear the sound of work , ” said Vasquez , 40 , who is seeking help through a Chrysalis job center in Santa Monica .
“ I do not hear a single hammer strike . ”
The state ’s economy has been particularly hard on construction workers like Vasquez .
The downturn started in housing and has spread to retailing , international trade , finance and nearly every other sector .

An average of 211,000 Californians have been unemployed for more than 47 weeks over the last year , the state reported .
These people now account for about 14 % of California ’s approximately 1.5 million jobless .
The plight of the long - term unemployed such as Vasquez is characteristic of the deepening recession that has gripped the global economy and the Golden State since at least December 2007 .
“ This recession has features of a depression , ” said Nelson Lichtenstein , a labor historian at UC Santa Barbara .
“ We get these very long - time people being out of work .
They sort of disappear to a never - never land . ”
California lost 62,100 jobs in March , state officials reported Friday .
In all , 637,400 jobs have disappeared in the last year and a total of 727,700 since the economy peaked in July 2007 .

Despite the gloom , last month ’s loss was much smaller than the 114,000 posted in February , said Howard Roth , chief economist at the California Department of Finance .
“ We ’re losing jobs at a slower rate .
That ’s sort of the first step ” toward recovery , he said .
The state has been scrambling to assist the unemployed with mixed success .
The California unemployment insurance fund is insolvent and being bailed out with billions of dollars in federal money .
The Employment Development Department ’s obsolete computer system and telephone call centers are swamped with hundreds of thousands of claims .
On Friday , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger issued an emergency proclamation designed to speed the hiring of 150 staffers to help ease the logjam .

California ’s unemployment rate remains stubbornly above the nationwide rate of 8.5 % for March .
Unemployment in much of Southern California is even higher .
Los Angeles County reported 11.4 % , Riverside 13.2 % , San Bernardino 12.5 % and Ventura 9.6 % .
Even Orange County , which historically has low unemployment , reached 8.5 % in March .
Economists expect unemployment rates to continue rising at least through the summer even if the state and national economies begin to turn around as a result of President Obama ’s stimulus program .
The aid from Washington includes more than $ 3 billion to provide the long - term unemployed with as much as 53 extra weeks of benefits or a total of up to 79 weeks of assistance .
The federal funds also will pay for computer and phone upgrades and the hiring of new claims handlers .
The money threw an immediate lifeline to 76,000 jobless , whose benefits were scheduled to run out this month .
By the end of the year , an estimated 394,000 would be eligible for the extra help .
Advertisement
But even with benefits , months and months of fruitlessly searching for a job takes its toll on a worker ’s sense of self worth and productivity , said Alex Gerwer , 53 , of San Diego .
The former strategic business planner said he had a worldwide network of contacts to tap in searching for a position like the one he lost in March 2008 .
“ My clinical and technical background should be very important , but it ’s almost like I ca n’t give it away , ” he said .
“ That has been very frustrating . ”
Gerwer said he had “ sent out well over 1,000 copies of my resume in a targeted and personalized fashion . ”
The dearth of jobs in all sectors of the economy , from Gerwer ’s high - tech consulting to Vasquez ’s low - tech drywall hanging is more severe in California than in most of the country because of the state ’s “ greater exposure to the housing downturn and related job losses in construction and finance , ” said Stephen Levy , chief economist at the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto .

In addition , California ’s population continues to grow , and that often worsens the job picture , he said .
Many of these new Californians arrive in search of jobs and become “ instantly unemployed ” when they can’t find work because employers are shedding jobs , not creating them , Levy said .
Writer Lawrence Kootinkoff , of West Los Angeles , who has been without a job since 2005 , said he still looks for work nearly every day , when he ’s not caring for two young children .
“ I wanted a job in news , but everyone I talked to was either laying people off or not hiring , ” said the 47 - year - old former foreign correspondent .
“ I was over - qualified .
I had too much experience .
I was too expensive .
If I was 20 years younger , I might have had a better shot . ”

Famous Dumb Deaths
How Not To Die : The Dumbest Deaths in Recorded HistoryAttila the Hun: One of the most notorious villains in history , Attila 's army had conquered all of Asia by 450 AD - - from Mongolia to the edge of the Russian Empire -- by destroying villages and pillaging the countryside .
How he died :
He got a nosebleed on his wedding night
In 453 AD , Attila married a young girl named Ildico .
Despite his reputation for ferocity on the battlefield , he tended to eat and drink lightly during large banquets .
On his wedding night , however , he really cut loose , gorging himself on food and drink .
Sometime during the night he suffered a nosebleed , but was too drunk to notice .
He drowned in his own blood and was found dead the next morning .
Tycho Brahe : An important Danish astronomer of the 16th century .
His ground breaking research allowed Sir Isaac Newton to come up with the theory of gravity .
How he died : Did n't get to the bathroom in time
In the 16th century , it was considered an insult to leave a banquet table before the meal was over .
Brahe , known to drink excessively , had a bladder condition -- but failed to relieve himself before the banquet started .
He made matters worse by drinking too much at dinner , and was too polite to ask to be excused .
His bladder finally burst , killing him slowly and painfully over the next 11 days .
Horace Wells : Pioneered the use of anaesthesia in the 1840s`How he died : Used anaesthetics to commit suicideWhile experimenting with various gases during his anaesthesia research , Wells became addicted to chloroform .
In 1848 he was arrested for spraying two women with sulphuric acid .
In a letter he wrote from jail , he blamed chloroform for his problems , claiming that he 'd gotten high before the attack .
Four days later he was found dead in his cell .
He 'd anaesthetized himself with chloroform and slashed open his thigh with a razor .
George Washington : First President of the United States of AmericaWashington died as the result of syphilis .
The treatment in those days was ' bleeding . '
The doctors believed that his disease was caused by ' bad blood , ' so they slit his arms with five razors and removed a few pints .
Surprisingly , he was only worse the next day , so they reasoned that not enough blood had been removed .
They repeated the procedure .
This continued for eleven days until Washington died .
The syphilis helped to insure Washington 's role as ' the father of our country !' Francis Bacon : One of the most influential minds of the late 16th century .
A statesman , a philosopher , a writer , and a scientist , he was even rumoured to have written some of Shakespeare 's plays .
How he died : Stuffing snow into a chickenOne afternoon in 1625 , Bacon was watching a snowstorm and was struck by the wondrous notion that maybe snow could be used to preserve meat in the same way that salt was used .
Determined to find out , he purchased a chicken from a nearby village , killed it , and then , standing outside in the snow , attempted to stuff the chicken full of snow to freeze it .
The chicken never froze , but Bacon did .
Jerome Irving Rodale : Founding father of the organic food movement , creator of ' Organic Farming and Gardening ' magazine , and founder of Rodale Press , a major publishing corporation .
How he died : On the ' Dick Cavett Show ' , while discussing the benefits of organic foods .
Rodale , who bragged ' I 'm going to live to be 100 unless I 'm run down by a sugar - crazed taxi driver , ' was only 72 when he appeared on the ' Dick Cavett Show ' in January 1971 .
Part way through the interview , he dropped dead in his chair .
Cause of death : heart attack .
The show was never aired .
Aeschylus : A Greek playwright back in 500 BC .
Many historians consider him the father of Greek tragedies .
How he died :
An eagle dropped a tortoise on his headAccording to legend , eagles picked up tortoises and attempt to crack them open by dropping them on rocks .
An eagle mistook Aeschylus ' head for a rock ( he was bald ) and dropped it on him instead .

How he died : A heart attack .... while jogging
Fixx was visiting Greensboro , Vermont when he walked out of his house and began jogging .
He 'd only gone a short distance when he had a massive coronary .
His autopsy revealed that one of his coronary arteries was 99 % clogged , another was 80 % obstructed , and a third was 70 % blocked .... and that Fixx had had three other attacks in the weeks prior to his death .
And finally there 's Lully , One of our favourite 16th - century composers , who wrote music for the king of France .
While rehearsing the musicians , he got too serious beating time with his staff , and drove it right through his foot .
He died of infection .
An 8 - year - old Ashford boy armed with an Uzi , accidentally shot himself in the head Sunday at a Massachusetts gun show , police said .
He died after being rushed to Baystate Medical Center .
Christopher Bizilj was firing an Uzi at the Machine Gun Shoot and Firearms Expo at the Westfield Sportsman 's Club in Westfield , Mass. , when he somehow lost control of the weapon .
The boy 's father and older brother were also there at the time , a gun club member and school official said .
Police called the incident a " self - inflicted accidental shooting . "
Lt. Hipolito Nunez said , " The 8 - year - old victim had the Uzi and as he was firing the weapon , the front end of the weapon went up with the backfire and he ended up receiving a round in his head . "
Francis Mitchell , a longtime member and trustee of the club , said he was told the boy 's father supporting his son from behind when the accident happened .
Although the death appears to be an accident , police and the Hampden district attorney 's office were investigating , officials said .
" We are going to review all the circumstance regarding what happened , who was involved , what authorities they may or may not have had , who was supervising , " District Attorney William Bennett said .
Christopher was a third - grader at the Ashford School and played soccer in town , said Leonard Lanza , interim superintendent of Ashford public schools .
Christopher 's brother , Colin , a sixth - grader at the same school , was with him during the accident , and crisis counselors spoke with students in both boys ' classes , Lanza said .

Women in Tech : 20 Trailblazers Share Their Journeys
Successful women in the tech trenches share their insights and tackle subjects ranging from how to search out a strong mentor to how to be one -- from how to advance in a large company to how to start your own firm .

It seems a fair statement to say that we here in the FOSS community are well - accustomed to ridicule .
That , after all , is a cross one must often bear when walking a righteous path outside the mainstream -- as has been aptly demonstrated , we might add , in countless examples throughout the annals of time .
But for one of us to get assaulted simply because he is a Linux advocate ?
That is far beyond the bounds of what we can be expected to endure .
Sure enough , though , that 's just what happened not long ago to none other than the Helios Project 's own Ken Starks .
Yes , Starks was apparently minding his own business at a gas station recently when a disgruntled Windows field technician for a local computer vendor verbally and physically accosted him for " costing us our jobs , " Starks recounts .
Turns out an exchange of the usual pleasantries had revealed that Starks was a FOSS advocate , leading the Windows tech to take matters into his own hands .
No one was seriously injured , thank goodness , but it 's a warning for us all !
Supporting free and open source software is not for the faint of heart , particularly during these tough economic times .
' You 'd Have to Be a Complete Moron '
Bloggers on Digg and LXer picked right up on the news , you can be sure , as did countless others throughout the blogosphere .
" I have been saying it for 20 years : Windows is not an OS .
It 's an employment program , " wrote TexMexRex among the more than 350 comments on Digg .

Tips Geeks Should Know
Yes well , living well is the best revenge , as they say ; what better way to show where your loyalties lie than by digging even deeper into geekdom ?
Several posts have been offered in recent weeks to help readers do just that , beginning with " Linux tips every geek should know " on TuxRadar .
The list of 57 tips -- beginning with " check processes not run by you " and ending with " Mac filtering Host AP " -- drew more than 2,000 Diggs and countless comments across the blogs .
So enthusiastic was the response , in fact , that TuxRadar later added " More Linux tips every geek should know , " with another 50 little gems .
That 's exactly 107 priceless tips for penguin supporters to feast upon and enjoy !
How to Become an ' Apt Guru '
Then , of course , there was also the recent post on MakeTechEasier entitled , " Things you need to know to become an apt guru " -- also filled with much sage advice .
When it rains , it pours !
Inspired by these sudden riches , we could n't resist taking a small poll of bloggers ' reactions .
" I do n't really have much to add here -- there 's some great tips , " Kevin Dean , a blogger on Monochrome Mentality , told LinuxInsider .
One of them was particularly timely for Dean , in fact .
" Having just moved , my wife and I are both coping with not having a home Internet connection , " he explained .
" We 're trying to extend our range to mooch off of the neighbor 's AP .
As I skimmed this article I pulled out my laptop and tried forcing my wlan 's connection speed , and it appears it 's not yet supported .
2.6.28 seems to hold some promise in that area . "
Building Packages From Source
Also worth highlighting -- this time from the " apt guru " article , Dean added -- " is how amazingly simple it is to build packages from source with Debian 's tools .
" Say I 'm interested in pulling in the latest copy of screen that has just been introduced into Debian Experimental , and I 'm running Ubuntu , " he explained .
" I 'd add the Debian source directory ( deb- src http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ experimental main ) , run my update ( apt - get update ) and then begin , " he went on .
" ' apt - get source screen ' would pull the source code ; ' sudo apt - get build - dep screen ' would install the needed build dependencies automatically ; cd scree [ tab ] would change me into the source directory of screen ( if your shell has tab completion ) ; ' fakeroot dpkg - buildpackage ' would configure , compile , build and package screen , " he said .
" In the directory above , I 'd have a fresh .deb file ready for installation on my system . "
' There 's Beauty in This Example '
It may not be a paradigm of simplicity , " but there 's beauty in this example , " Dean asserted .
" Notice I was actually mixing repositories , not from different releases , but different distributions !
Building .debs from source makes this fairly simple and not so failure - prone .
If there are dramatic inconsistencies , this process fails rather than breaking your system . "
Others had different favorites to extol .
" My favorite tip is SSH , " educator and blogger Robert Pogson told LinuxInsider .
" I have a couple of geeky students who are learning the ins and outs of the PC with GNU / Linux and hardware tricks , " he began .
" They had a defective CD drive and could not do the usual installation .
" I called them over to my desk and typed a few commands after netbooting the box using a floppy , " he said .
" I installed a netboot loader on the master boot record of the hard drive and rebooted the box to boot from the hard drive without leaving my chair -- the ultimate triumph of a geek . "
The result ?
" The boys ' mouths dropped open and they doubled over in exultation -- great fun ! " he said .
' How Cool Is That ?'
Another trick Pogson likes is forwarding X over the SSH connection .
" With this I can run an application on a GNU / Linux machine where I have set up passwordless sessions , " he explained .
" ' ssh -Y beast iceweasel -- no - remote ' starts my favorite browser on another machine so I can use its resources and browse the Web all at the same time remotely . "
" How cool is that ?
We can all own a supercomputer cluster incorporating our new machines with the old ones in a harmonious system using links on our menus and desktops , " he added .
Some Linux fans -- such as Montreal consultant and Slashdot blogger Gerhard Mack -- thought the lists of 107 tips were " a tad dated .
" The newer IDE code will optimize a lot of things for you , " Mack told LinuxInsider .
" You can tell if you 're using the new drivers by the drive showing up as / dev/sda instead of / dev/hda . "
' The Joys Are Great '
Others held up the tips as an illustration of why Linux has not yet won mainstream acceptance .
" If you have anything go wrong in Linux , your advice will ALWAYS be ' Launch Bash and type ' -- which of course just killed any chance at all of having the average PC user keep your system , " Slashdot blogger hairyfeet told LinuxInsider .
" In the 15 years I have been building , repairing , and servicing Windows , both home and business , I can count the number of times I HAD to use CLI on one hand and have fingers left over , " he said .
" There should not be a single task that you can do in Linux that requires a CLI .
None . "
Still , there 's no doubt that there 's much to love about Linux -- at least in the right hands .
" Whoohoo ! " concluded Pogson .
" The joys of being a computer geek are great with GNU / Linux . "
A microbial culture could be turned into a living energy storage system , researchers say , which could cheaply stockpile power from inconsistent solar and wind installations .
Proponents of these alternative energy sources are investigating many different ways to store power for the inevitable moments when the sun is n't shining or the wind is n't blowing .
The
intriguing new idea involves " feeding " surplus power to the microorganisms instead , which combine it with carbon dioxide to create methane .
That could then be stored and burned when needed .
The method is sustainable too , as the carbon is taken from the atmosphere , not released from long - term storage in oil or coal [ New Scientist ] .
The researchers have determined that a single - celled microorganism , a type of archaea , uses electricity to convert carbon dioxide and water into methane .
Sustainable energy expert Tom Curtis comments
that the use of microorganisms , rather than conventional catalysts , is a plus .
" There are no noble metals involved , so it should be very cheap , " he says .
Of the energy put into the system as electricity , 80 % was eventually recovered when the methane was burned – a fairly high efficiency .
" You do n't get all the energy back , but that 's a problem with any form of energy storage , " says Curtis [ New Scientist ] .
According to the new study , published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology , the microbe
is used as part of an electrolytic cell .
An electrolytic cell is the opposite of a battery – a battery takes two compounds that want to react with each other and taps that potential in the form of electricity .
In an electrolytic cell , the electrons are pumped in and they drive the reaction uphill , so to speak .
In this case that uphill reaction is CO2 turning into CH4 ( the opposite of the downhill version , which happens when we burn CH4 , or any other fossil fuel ) [ EcoGeek ] .
The microbe acts as a catalyst for the process .
Lead researcher Bruce Logan says the simple technology could easily be scaled up for commercial applications .
And while the eventual burning of the methane produced would put greenhouse gases into the air again , Logan notes that if the carbon dioxide used by the archaea was drawn from power plant emissions or from the open air , the process would at least be carbon neutral .

" THE SONS OF GOD " IN GENESIS 6
GENESIS 6:1
Now it came to pass , when men began to multiply on the face of the earth , and daughters were born to them , 2 that the sons of God saw the daughters of men , that they were beautiful ; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose .
3
And the LORD said , " My Spirit shall not strive with man forever , for he is indeed flesh ; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years . "
4
There were giants on the earth in those days , and also afterward , when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore children to them .
Those were the mighty men who were of old , men of renown .
( NKJV )
There has been much speculation about who these " sons of God " mentioned in the sixth chapter of Genesis were .
Three basic interpretations of this passage have been advanced .
The first , and oldest , belief is that " the sons of God " were fallen angels who consorted with human women , producing giant offspring called nephilim ( Heb. נפילים ) .
This view was widely held in the world of the first century CE , and was supported by Flavius Josephus , Philo , Eusebius and many of the " Ante - Nicene Fathers , " including Justin Martyr , Clement of Alexandria , Origen , Tertullian , Irenaeus , Athenagoras and Commodianus .
The second view is one which was first suggested by Julius Africanus in the third century CE and later advocated by Saint Augustine , the Catholic Bishop of Hippo .
Augustine rejected the concept of the fallen host having committed fornication with women .
In his early fifth century CE book The City of God , he promoted the theory that " the sons of God " simply referred to the genealogical line of Seth , who were committed to preserving the true worship of God .
He interpreted Genesis 6 to mean that the male offspring of Adam through Seth were " the sons of God , " and the female offspring of Adam through Cain were " the daughters of men . "
He wrote that the problem was that the family of Seth had interbred with the family of Cain , intermingling the bloodlines and corrupting the pure religion .
This view has become the dominant one among most modern biblical scholars .
The third view is that " the sons of God " were the sons of pre-Flood rulers or magistrates .
This belief became the standard explanation of rabbinical Judaism after Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai pronounced a curse in the second century CE upon those Jews who believed the common teaching that the angels were responsible for the nephilim .
This interpretation was advocated by two of the most respected Jewish sages of the Middle Ages , Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki ( Rashi ) and Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman ( Nachmanides ) , and became the standard explanation of rabbinical Judaism .
However , it is not widely accepted by modern scholars .
To determine who these " sons of God " were , we 'll first examine what various outside sources have to say about this topic .
Then we 'll examine the ultimate authority , the Bible , to see its position .
Let 's start with a quotation and footnote from William Whitson 's translation of the respected first century CE Jewish historian Flavius Josephus ' history of the Jewish people :
Now this posterity of Seth continued to esteem God as the Lord of the universe , and to have an entire regard to virtue , for seven generations ; but in process of time they were perverted , and forsook the practices of their forefathers , and did neither pay those honors to God which were appointed to them , nor had they any concern to do justice towards men .
But for what degree of zeal they had formerly shown for virtue , they now showed by their actions a double degree of wickedness ; whereby they made God to be their enemy , for many angels * of God accompanied with women and begat sons that proved unjust , and despisers of all that was good , on account of the confidence they had in their own strength ; for the tradition is , that these men did what resembled the acts of those whom the Grecians called giants .
But Noah was very uneasy at what they did ; and , being displeased at their conduct , persuaded them to change their dispositions and their acts for the better ; but , seeing that they did not yield to him , but were slaves to their wicked pleasures , he was afraid they would kill him , together with his wife and children , and those they had married ; so he departed out of that land .
( p. 32 , bk. 1 , ch. 3 , §§72 -74 , The Antiquities of the Jews , translated by William Whitson )
* This notion , that the fallen angels were , in some sense the fathers of the old giants , was the constant opinion of antiquity .
As you can see , Josephus believed and recorded that " the sons of God " mentioned in Genesis 6 were fallen angels .
As Whitson 's footnote acknowledges , this belief was standard in the ancient world .
Another well - known first century CE Jewish writer , Philo of Alexandria , shared Josephus ' views on this topic .
In his work " On the Giants , " Philo wrote :
" And when the angels of God saw the daughters of men that they were beautiful , they took unto themselves wives of all them whom they chose . "
Those beings , whom other philosophers call demons , Moses usually calls angels . . . ( p. 152 , The Works of Philo , " On the Giants , " translated by C.D. Yonge )
The Book of Enoch ( also called I Enoch ) is a collection of pseudepigraphic writings by various authors which dates to the first or second century BCE .
This book was well - known by the early church ; in fact , Jude , the brother of Jesus , quoted Enoch 1:9 in verses 14 and 15 of his epistle .
Obviously Jude felt that the Book of Enoch he had access to in the first century CE was trustworthy .
This work , which survived to our day against great odds , deals extensively with the fall of the angels .
It was viewed favorably by some early " Christian " writers also ( Irenaeus , Clement of Alexandria , and others ) .
However , it was never universally accepted as inspired Scripture .
Below is a selection from the Book of Enoch which records the sin of the angelic " watchers " :
ENOCH 6:1
And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto 2 them beautiful and comely daughters .
And the angels , the children of the heaven , saw and lusted after them , and said to one another : ' Come , let us choose us wives from among the children of men 3 and beget us children . '
And Semjaza , who was their leader , said unto them : ' I fear ye will not 4 indeed agree to do this deed , and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin . '
And they all answered him and said : ' Let us all swear an oath , and all bind ourselves by mutual imprecations 5 not to abandon this plan but to do this thing . '
Then sware they all together and bound themselves 6 by mutual imprecations upon it .
And they were in all two hundred ; who descended in the days of Jared on the summit of Mount Hermon . . . ( From The Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament , translated by R.H. Charles )
A similar passage is also found in the pseudepigraphic Book of Jubilees :
JUBILEES 5:1
And it came to pass when the children of men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them , that the angels of God saw them on a certain year of this jubilee , that they were beautiful to look upon ; and they took themselves wives of all whom they 2 chose , and they bare unto them sons and they were giants .
And lawlessness increased on the earth and all flesh corrupted its way , alike men and cattle and beasts and birds and everything that walks on the earth – all of them corrupted their ways and their orders , and they began to devour each other , and lawlessness increased on the earth and every imagination of the thoughts of all men 3 ( was ) thus evil continually . . . ( From The Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament , translated by R.H. Charles )
The Genesis Apocryphon , one of the texts uncovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls , also contains references to the angels interbreeding with human women .
In this text , a conversation between Lamech , the father of Noah , and his wife Bathenosh is detailed .
Lamech questions his wife because he thinks that the conception of Noah was due to either an angel or one of their offspring , a nephilim .
The Book of Enoch , the Book of Jubilees , and the Genesis Apocryphon all clearly show that the common understanding at the time of Yeshua was that the fallen host had committed fornication with women in the period before the Flood .
As stated previously , many early Christian writers accepted the story told in Enoch as fact .
Let 's examine the writings of two of them , beginning with Justin Martyr , who lived from 110 CE to 165 CE .
Here is what he had to say in chapter 5 of his Second Apology , entitled " " How the Angels Transgressed " :
God , when
He had made the whole world , and subjected things earthly to man , and arranged the heavenly elements for the increase of fruits and rotation of the seasons , and appointed this divine law – for these things also
He evidently made for man – committed the care of men and of all things under heaven to angels whom He appointed over them .
But the angels transgressed this appointment , and were captivated by love of women , and begat children who are those that are called demons ; and besides , they afterwards subdued the human race to themselves , partly by magical writings , and partly by fears and punishments they occasioned , and partly by teaching them to offer sacrifices , and incense , and libations , of which things they stood in need after they enslaved by lustful passions ; and among men they sowed murders , wars , adulteries , intemperate needs , and all wickedness .
. . . ( p. 363 , vol. 1 , The Ante- Nicene Fathers )
Now let 's examine chapter 3 , " The Worship of Demons , " from The Instructions of Commodianus , a North - African bishop who lived about 240 CE :
When Almighty God , to beautify the nature of the world , willed that that earth should be visited by angels , when they were sent down they despised His laws .
Such was the beauty of women , that it turned them aside ; so that , being contaminated , they could not return to heaven .
Rebels from God , they uttered words against Him .
Then the Highest uttered His judgment against them ; and from their seed giants are said to have been born .
By them arts were made known in the earth , and they taught the dyeing of wool , and everything which is done ; and to them , when they died , men erected images .
But the Almighty , because they were of an evil seed , did not approve that , when dead , they should be brought back from death .
Whence wandering they now subvert many bodies , and it is such as these especially that ye this day worship and pray to as gods .
( p. 435 , vol. 4 , The Ante- Nicene Fathers )
The idea that the nephilim or giants were the offspring of the fallen host and human females was not unique to Judaism .
This understanding was likely behind the Greek , Roman , and Egyptian mythologies , as well as those of India and the near east .
All these beliefs resulted not as mere inventions of fertile human imagination , but as a corruption of antediluvian truths which were distorted as their origin was forgotten over time .
Take , for example , the legend of the Titans .
In Greek mythology , the Titans were a family of giant gods who were the offspring of Uranus ( heaven ) and Gaea ( earth ) .
The most famous of the Titans was Cronus , who killed his father .
Cronus later led the Titans in their losing war against Zeus and the Olympian gods .
After their defeat , the Titans were imprisoned in a section of the underworld called Tartarus .
In his second epistle , the apostle Peter uses part of this Greek myth to explain the fate of some of the fallen angels .
He states that for their sins , these angels had been tartarosas , which The NKJV Greek English Interlinear New Testament translates literally as " confining them to Tartarus " ( also known in the Bible as " the Abyss " ) :
II PETER 2:4 For if God did not spare the angels who sinned , but cast them down to hell [ tartarosas ] and delivered them into chains of darkness , to be reserved for judgment ; ( NKJV )
This is the same Tartarus where Greek mythology says the Titans were imprisoned .
It 's highly unlikely that Peter would have used such an analogy if this pagan legend was n't based on at least some grain of truth which his readers would have knowledge of .
The idea that evil angels mated with human women and had offspring ( the nephilim ) appears far - fetched to us in this modern era , but it seems to have been widely accepted as fact in the ancient world .
As we 've seen above , the word translated " giants " in Genesis 6:4 is nephilim .
Let 's look at what The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia has to say about the possible origins of this Hebrew word :
The etymology of nepilim is uncertain , the following explanations have been advanced with mixed reception .
First , it may derive from the niphal of the verb pala , meaning " be extraordinary , " i.e. , " extraordinary men . "
Second , it may be derived from the verb napal , " fall , " in one of the following senses : ( 1 ) the " fallen ones " – from heaven , i.e. , supernatural beings ; ( 2 ) morally " fallen men " ; ( 3 ) " those who fall upon , " in the sense of invaders or hostile , violent men ; ( 4 ) " those who fell by " the sword ( cf. Ezk. 32:20 f . ) ; ( 5 ) " unnaturally begotten men " or bastards ( from cf. nepel , " abortion " or miscarriage " ) .
( pp. 518-519 , vol. 3 )
Michael S. Heiser , who holds a PhD in biblical Hebrew and ancient Semitic languages , believes that nephilim actually comes from the Aramaic word naphil , which means " giants " according to A Dictionary of the Targumim , the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi , and the Midrashic Literature ( pp. 923-924 , vol. II ) compiled by Marcus Jastrow .
The Septuagint Greek translation of the Old Testament renders the Hebrew term nephilim as gigantes , which literally means " earth - born . "
In Greek mythology , the Gigantes were the sons of Gaia , a savage race of giants eventually defeated by the Olympian gods .
From the sources we 've just examined , it 's readily apparent that the general understanding of Genesis 6:1 - 4 at the time of Christ was that the angels had sinned by committing fornication with human women .
But does the Bible support this theory ?
First , let 's look at all of the Old Testament references to " sons of God . "
This phrase is translated from the Hebrew beney ' elohim ( בני אלהים ) , beney ha'elohim ( בני האלהים ) , and beney ' elim ( בני אלים ) :
GENESIS 6:1
When men began to increase on earth and daughters were born to them , 2 the divine beings [ beney ha'elohim ] saw how beautiful the daughters of men were and took wives from among those that pleased them .
3 The Lord said , " My breath shall not abide in man forever , since he too is flesh ; let the days allowed him be one hundred and twenty years . "
4
It was then , and later too , that the Nephilim appeared on earth when the divine beings [ beney ha'elohim ] cohabited with the daughters of men , who bore them offspring .
They were the heroes of old , the men of renown .
( Tanakh , the new Jewish Publication Society translation according to the traditional Hebrew text )
DEUTERONOMY 32:8
When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance , when he separated the sons of men , he fixed the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the sons of God [ beney ' elohim ] . ( RSV )
JOB 1:6
Now there was a day when the sons of God [ beney ha'elohim ] came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan also came among them .
( NKJV )
JOB 2:1
Again there was a day when the sons of God [ beney ha'elohim ] came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord . ( NKJV )
JOB 38:4
" Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth ?
Tell Me , if you have understanding .
5
Who determined its measurements ?
Surely you know !
Or who stretched the line upon it ?
6
To what were its foundations fastened ?
Or who laid its cornerstone , 7 when the morning stars sang together , and all the sons of God [ beney ' elohim ] shouted for joy ?
( NKJV )
PSALM 29:1 O give the Lord you sons of God [ beney ' elim ] , give the Lord glory and power ; 2 give the Lord the glory of his name .
Adore the Lord in his holy court .
( The Psalms : A New Translation )
PSALM 89:5
The heavens proclaim your wonders , O Lord ; the assembly of your holy ones proclaims your truth .
6
For who in the skies can compare with the Lord or who is like the Lord among the sons of God [ beney ' elim ] ? ( The Psalms : A New Translation )
As you can see , each reference above is to angels .
There are no instances in the Old Testament where the phrase " sons of God " refers to men .
Let 's see what E.W. Bullinger has to say about these " sons of God " in Appendix 23 to The Companion Bible :
" The Sons of God " in Gen. 6.2 , 4 .
It is only by the Divine specific act of creation that any created being can be called " a son of God . "
For that which is " born of the flesh is flesh . "
God is spirit and that which is " born of the Spirit is spirit " ( John 3.6 ) .
Hence Adam is called a " son of God " in Luke 3.38 .
Those " in Christ " having the " new nature " which is by the direct creation of God ( 2 Cor. 5.17 ; Eph. 2.10 ) can be , and are called " sons of God " ( John 1.13 ; Rom. 8.14 , 15 ; 1 John 3.1 ) .
This is why angels are called " sons of God " in every other place where the expression is used in the Old Testament .
Job 1.6 ; 2.1 ; 38.7 ; Ps. 29.1 ; 89.6 ; Dan. 3.25 ( no art . ) .
We have no authority or right to take the expression in Gen. 6.4 in any other sense .
Moreover in Gen. 6.2 the Sept. renders it " angels " .
( pp. 26 , 27 , Companion Bible Appendixes )
Now let 's look at Genesis 6:9 , which discusses Noah 's genealogy .
This Scripture is further proof that fallen angels had interbred with humans :
GENESIS 6:9
This is the genealogy of Noah .
Noah was a just man , perfect [ tamim ] in his generations .
Noah walked with God. ( NKJV )
In Genesis 6:9 , the Hebrew word tamim , here translated " perfect , " means " physically without blemish . "
As the first sentence makes clear , it 's referring to the genealogy of Noah ; it does not refer to moral perfection .
Below is what Appendix 26 of The Companion Bible has to say about this word as used in verse 9 of Genesis 6 :
The Heb. word tamim means without blemish , and is the technical word for bodily and physical perfection , and , not moral .
Hence it is used of animals of sacrificial purity .
It is rendered without blemish in Ex . 12.5 ; 29.1 ; Lev. 1.3 , 10 ; 3.1 , 6 ; 4.3 , 23 , 28 , 32 ; 5.12 , 18 ; 6.6 ; 9.2 , 3 ; 14.10 ; 22.19 ; 23.12 , 18 ; Num .
6.14 ; 28.19 , 31 ; 29.2 , 8 , 13 , 20 , 23 , 29 , 32 , 36 ; Ezek .
43.22 , 23 , 25 ; 45.18 , 23 ; 46.4 , 6 , 13 .
Without spot : Num .
19.2 ; 28.3 , 9 , 11 ; 29.17 , 26 .
Undefiled : Ps. 119.1 .
This shows that Gen. 6.9 does not speak of Noah 's moral perfection . . . ( p. 28 , Companion Bible Appendixes )
Now let 's examine what Jude said about the fallen angels in the New Testament :
JUDE 6
And the angels which kept not their first estate , but left their own habitation , he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day .
7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha , and the cities about them in like manner , giving themselves over to fornication , and going after strange flesh , are set forth for an example , suffering the vengeance of eternal fire .
( KJV )
Because of the punctuation of verse 7 , this Scripture appears to say that Sodom and Gomorrah , as well as the cities around them , gave themselves over to sexual immorality .
However , the underlying Greek text does not support this interpretation .
Kenneth Wuest writes of verse 7 :
This verse begins with hos , an adverb of comparison having meanings of " in the same manner as , after the fashion of , as , just as . "
Here it introduces a comparison showing a likeness between the angels of verse 6 and the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha of this verse .
But the likeness between them lies deeper than the fact that both were guilty of committing sin .
It extends to the fact that both were guilty of the same identical sin .
The punctuation of the A.V. [ KJV ] is misleading , as an examination of Greek text discloses .
The A.V. punctuation gives the reader the impression that Sodom and Gomorrha committed fornication and that the cities about them committed fornication in like manner to the two cities named .
. . .
The words " in like manner " are related to the verbal forms , " giving themselves over to fornication " and " going after strange flesh . "
In addition to all this , the Greek text has toutois , " to these . "
Thus , the translation should read , " just as Sodom and Gomorrha and the cities about them , in like manner to these , having given themselves over to fornication and having gone after strange flesh . "
The sense of the entire passage ( vv.6 , 7 ) is that the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha and the cities about them , in like manner to these ( the angels ) , have given themselves over to fornication and have gone after strange flesh .
That means that the sin of the fallen angels was fornication .
( pp. 241-242 , vol .
II , Word Studies in the Greek New Testament )
The underlying Greek text indicates that the fallen angels left their own domain and indulged in sexual immorality , going after " strange , " or " other " flesh .
The KJV obscures this fact , probably because the view that the fallen angels were " the sons of God " spoken of in Genesis 6:2 , 4 was not accepted when it was translated in 1611 .
However , some translations do more clearly show the meaning of this passage .
The New English Bible better presents what Jude was saying :
JUDE 6 Remember too the angels , how some of them were not content to keep the dominion given to them but abandoned their proper home ; and God has reserved them for judgement on the great Day , bound beneath the darkness in everlasting chains .
7 Remember Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbouring towns ; like the angels , they committed fornication and followed unnatural lusts ; and they paid the penalty in eternal fire , an example for all to see .
( NEB )
It 's clear that Jude wrote of the fornication of the angels as a fact .
In verse 7 of his epistle , he compares the sexual wickedness in Sodom , Gomorrah , and the surrounding cities to the sin of the angels .
The nature of the angels ' fall is also clearly stated in Jude 6 , where it is said that they left their own " abode " ( Gr. oiketerion ) .
This word occurs in the New Testament only here and in II Corinthians 5:2 , where it is used of the spiritual body of a resurrected saint :
II CORINTHIANS 5:1
For we know that if our earthly house , this tent , is destroyed , we have a building from God , a house not made with hands , eternal in the heavens .
2
For in this we groan , earnestly desiring to be clothed with our habitation [ oiketerion ] which is from heaven , ( NKJV )
There is a great deal revealed in the Bible about angels .
Angels could and did assume human form and even eat men's food ( Gen. 18-19 ) .
Although the Bible does n't tell us how , Jude 6 shows that some angels left their proper abode ( their spiritual bodies ) and took on fleshly bodies so as to marry and produce offspring by the daughters of men .
Although the angels committed sexual sins and corrupted the human lineage to some extent , they did something else that threatened to foil God 's plan for humanity .
Let 's go back to 1 Enoch to see what these fallen angels did that affected the human race enormously :
1 ENOCH 8:1 And Azazel taught men to make swords , and knives , and shields , and breastplates , and made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of working them , and bracelets , and ornaments , and the use of antimony , and the beautifying of the eyelids , and all kinds of costly stones , and all 2 colouring tinctures .
And there arose much godlessness , and they committed fornication , and they 3 were led astray , and became corrupt in all their ways .
Semjaza taught enchantments , and root - cuttings , Armaros the resolving of enchantments , Baraqijal ( taught ) astrology , Kokabel the constellations , Ezeqeel the knowledge of the clouds , Araqiel the signs of the earth , Shamsiel the signs of the sun , and Sariel the course of the moon .
And as men perished , they cried , and their cry went up to heaven . . . ( From The Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament , translated by R.H. Charles )
As the text above shows , the angels brought with them knowledge which humanity did not have beforehand .
This information led to a rapid advance in the knowledge base of the antediluvian society , including the invention of advanced methods of waging warfare .
In the NKJV translation of Genesis 6:4 , the nephilim are called " mighty men who were of old , men of renown ; " however , the NRSV translates that same phrase as " heroes that were of old , warriors of renown . "
Genesis 6:11 shows that the earth was filled with violence ; this is very likely the direct result of the nephilim , who apparently were mighty warriors .
If the ancient legends are indeed based in fact , as they appear to be , these angelic offspring were superhuman in size and great in strength .
There is also an indication from the ancient text known as the Book of Jasher that this corruption of bloodlines extended to the animals also :
JASHER 4:18
And their judges and rulers went to the daughters of men and took their wives by force from their husbands according to their choice , and the sons of men in those days took from the cattle of the earth , the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air , and taught the mixture of animals of one species with the other , in order therewith to provoke the Lord ; and God saw the whole earth and it was corrupt , for all flesh had corrupted its ways upon earth , all men and all animals .
19 And the Lord said , I will blot out man that I created from the face of the earth , yea from man to the birds of the air , together with cattle and beasts that are in the field . . . ( From The Book of Jasher , published by J.H. Parry & Company , 1887 )
The Book of Jasher is mentioned twice in the Bible ( Jos. 10:13 ; II Sam. 1:18 ) .
While it 's evident the copy of this book that has survived to our time has been corrupted to some extent , the Scriptures seem to confirm the information contained in this section of Jasher :
GENESIS 6:7
So the LORD said , " I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth , both man and beast , creeping thing and birds of the air , for I am sorry that I have made them . "
( NKJV )
It appears likely that the objectives of the Flood were the destruction of the polluted human and animal bloodlines and the eradication of the forbidden knowledge that humanity had learned from the fallen host .
There is one other New Testament passage which hints at the sin of the angels before the Flood .
It is an enigmatic scripture found in Paul 's first letter to the Corinthian church :
I CORINTHIANS 11:7
For a man indeed ought not to cover his head , since he is the image and glory of God ; but woman is the glory of man .
8
For man is not from woman , but woman from man .
9
Nor was man created for the woman , but woman for the man .
10 For this reason the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head , because of the angels .
( NKJV )
In I Corinthians 11 , Paul states the position of women in relation to men and says that the symbol of authority on a woman 's head is needed " because of the angels . "
Without understanding what took place anciently between the fallen host and women , this verse is cryptic at best .
There is opposition to the view that the fallen angels are the " sons of God " referred to in Genesis 6 .
Some cite Matthew 22:29 - 30 and Mark 12:24 - 25 as objections , saying that these Scriptures clearly teach that angels do not marry :
MATTHEW 22:29 Jesus answered and said to them [ the Sadducees ] , " You are mistaken , not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God. 30 For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are like angels of God in heaven . "
( NKJV )
MARK 12:24 Jesus answered and said to them , " Are you not therefore mistaken , because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God ? 25 For when they rise from the dead , they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven . "
( NKJV )
First , these verses do not state whether angels can marry or procreate .
Here Messiah was referring only to the way things will be after the first resurrection of the dead .
Additionally , the angels in heaven who did not sin are the example cited , not the angels confined to Tartarus because they sinned by marrying humans and producing offspring .
To get a better perspective of what Yeshua was saying , let 's look at the parallel account of this conversation in Luke 's Gospel :
LUKE 20:34
And Jesus answered and said to them , " The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage .
35 But those who are counted worthy to attain that age , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry nor are given in marriage ; 36 nor can they die anymore , for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God , being sons of the resurrection . "
( NKJV )
Messiah 's primary purpose in his answer was to affirm the reality of the resurrection to these questioning Sadducees , who did not believe that there would be a resurrection .
As you can clearly see from Luke 's account of this confrontation , Yeshua is making two points about the age to come : ( 1 ) Resurrected humans will not marry , and ( 2 ) resurrected humans will be given eternal life , which the holy angels now have .
Interpreting these Scriptures to mean that angels have never been able to marry or procreate reads more into them than was intended by Yeshua .
Some also object by saying that Genesis 6:4 shows that there were nephilim on the earth before " the sons of God " came in to " the daughters of men " and also afterward ; therefore , these giants cannot be the offspring of this union .
Does the phrase " in those days , and also afterward " mean that the nephilim were present before the the sons of God cohabited with the daughters of men ?
" In those days " plainly means the time after the " sons of God " had come down to earth ; the fact that they had taken wives is disclosed in Genesis 6:2 .
In time sequence , chapter six of Genesis should follow chapter four ; the fifth chapter is an inset into the story flow .
" Afterward " specifies after the Flood , when we see another instance of giants appearing , this time in the land of Canaan which the Israelites were to inherit ( Num. 13:33 ) .
Satan once again tried to thwart God 's plan by using these savage hybrids to occupy the land of Canaan and keep Abraham 's offspring out .
Obviously none of the nephilim survived the Flood .
These giants are often mentioned in the early books of the Old Testament until the last of them were finally killed off .
The word nephilim only appears twice in the Old Testament ( Gen 6:4 ; Num. 13:33 ) , but these giants are also referred to as gibbor ( Gen 6:4 ; Num .
13:33 ; Job 16:14 ) and rephaim when they reappear in a more limited fashion after the Flood ( Gen. 14:5 ; 15:20 ; Deu .
2:11 , 20 ; 3:11 , 13 ; Jos. 12:4 ; 13:12 ; 15:8 ; 17:15 ; 18:16 ; II Sam .
5:18 , 22 ; 21:16 , 18 , 20 , 22 ; 23:13 ; I Chr. 11:15 ; 14:9 ; 20:4 , 6 , 8 ; Isa. 17:5 ; 26:14 ) .
They were known by the proper names of Rephaim , Zuzim , Emim , Horites , Anakim , Zamzummim , and Avim .
CONCLUSION
As shown above , the evidence that " the sons of God " mentioned in Genesis 6 are fallen angels is substantial .
By their sexual immorality , these angels produced offspring which were strong and violent .
The concept of a race of giants which resulted from the union of gods and humans is virtually universal in the world 's early civilizations .
The original intent of the angels may have only been to satisfy their forbidden lust .
Yet the knowledge they brought with them and taught mankind caused society to develop at a rapid technological pace .
This societal development was not positive , and it gave rise to a very violent society , one in which the nephilim apparently played a large role .
God restrained the wicked angels that produced the nephilim in the Abyss , and cleansed the earth of them and the violence they brought with the great Flood .

In the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal today , Army Ranger sergeant and Iraq war vet Brian Hughes , makes the case that gays and lesbians have served honorably in the War on Terror , and presents a clear and cogent argument on why the Obama administration needs to repeal Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell .
I was a line infantryman in the Army ’s Ranger regiment from 2000 - 04 , earning a promotion to sergeant within three years .
In that time , my platoon performed dozens of combat missions on the front lines .
Our lives depended on complete mutual trust .
Several of my colleagues knew I was gay .
We lived in the closest possible conditions .
When there were showers , we showered together .
When we were out overnight on the cold , bare mountains of Afghanistan , we slept huddled together for warmth .
It should go without saying that there was nothing remotely sexual about these situations .
We had uncomfortable experiences — we were at war , after all — but my buddies were never uncomfortable with me .
…
Today the strongest resistance to overturning “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ” may not come from the military , which polls show mostly supports repeal , nor from social conservatives , who are not in power .
Rather , there are many Democratic leaders and strategists who blame the issue of gays in the military for damaging the beginning of Bill Clinton ’s presidency .
They fear it could have the same effect on Mr. Obama .
The truth is that public opinion has moved dramatically on this issue .
Public support for repeal consistently polls above 75 % — well above Mr. Obama ’s approval ratings .
The fact that support is above 90 % for men and women aged 18 - 29 should put to rest any worries that repeal could interfere with recruitment .
…
Here at home , every government service is integrated , including the paramilitary sections of the CIA that work hand in glove with the armed services .
The presence of gays in these organizations is a nonissue .
The idea that our soldiers , sailors , airmen and Marines would have any greater difficulty adjusting is an insult to their professionalism .
Democrats have an opportunity to burnish their national security credentials by strengthening the military .
It ’s time for Congress and the Obama administration to order the full integration of gays and lesbians in the armed services .
TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
Dancing in public is not allowed in Iran , but thousands could hardly contain themselves at a recent presidential campaign rally in the capital city , Tehran .
Supporters hope Zahra Rahnavard will become Iran 's future first lady .
On this day , the deafening cheers were not for presidential hopeful Mir Hossein Mousavi , but rather for his wife -- a woman some are calling Iran 's Michelle Obama .
The comparisons to the first lady of the United States stem from the role Zahra Rahnavard is playing in her husband 's quest for the presidency .
Never in the history of Iranian presidential elections has a candidate put his wife in the forefront of his campaign .
Wherever Mousavi -- a centrist candidate -- goes , Rahnavard is usually nearby .
Watch more about Zahra Rahnavard »
" We look at her and we say , 'we want to be like her in the future , ' " said Shakiba Shakerhosseie , one of 12,000 people who packed into Tehran 's indoor Azadi ( Freedom ) sports stadium to hear Rahnavard speak .
Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979 after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced into exile .
The revolution also ended the ceremonial role of first lady that the last queen , Farah , enjoyed .
At this rally , Rahnavard -- a writer and art professor -- spoke for her husband , who was campaigning elsewhere .
Wearing a floral headscarf and a traditional black chador -- a full - length loose robe that women in Iran wear like a cloak -- Rahnavard called for freedoms she says were lost during President Mahmoud Ahmadijenad 's term .
" I hope freedom of speech , freedom of the pen and freedom of thought will not be forgotten , " she said .
The crowd , which was clad in Mousavi 's trademark color green , cheered wildly .
It waved placards with his picture and swayed from side to side , chanting and beating drums .
The women sat on one side ; the men on the other .
The overwhelming majority were young voters , many of whom said they attended because of Mousavi 's wife , a mother of three .
Iran 's population -- estimated at more than 66 million -- has a median age of 27 .
" I am really angry here in Iran with the position of women , " said Saghar Kouhestani , adding that she supports Mousavi because of his wife .
Mousavi , a former prime minister , is considered a threat to Ahmadinejad , a hard - liner , in the June 12 elections .
He is credited for successfully navigating the Iranian economy during a bloody eight - year war with Iraq in the 1980s .
Over the weekend , the Iranian government blocked access to the social networking site Facebook , where Mousavi has a page with more than 5,000 supporters , the semi-official Iranian Labor News Agency ( ILNA ) said .
Those attempting to visit Facebook received a message in Farsi saying , " Access to this site is not possible . "
Political science professor Mohammad Marandi downplays Rahnavard 's impact .
She may win over reformists and women , he says , but what will win the election is a solution to the floundering economy and a strong performance in the debates .
" If Ahmadinejad does well in the debates , I do n't think anyone will be able to defeat him , " Marandi said .
But try selling that to Rahnavard 's enthusiastic supporters .
" This is the first time after the Revolution we see a lady behind the president , " said Farhad Mahmoudi .
" And this is why we 're so happy because we can have a first lady . "

OVER 60 metres ( nearly 200 feet ) above the ground in the Picardy town of Beauvais , fiscal stimulus à la française is under way .
With tiny paintbrushes and sandblasters , artisans perched on scaffolding are painstakingly scraping away at the damaged façade of the towering 14th - century gothic cathedral .
The € 2 m ( $ 2.7 m ) restoration is one of 1,000 projects put in place by the French government as part of its € 26 billion stimulus plan .
Along with more conventional schemes , such as upgrades to motorways , ports and the TGV high - speed train network , France 's boost includes the scrubbing up of a host of its historic cathedrals and churches .
Even in a crisis , the French do things differently .
Despite calls from the Americans to do more to lift consumer demand , their stimulus plan relies heavily on front - loading investment in infrastructure , cathedrals included , in line with their dirigiste tradition .
A strong beneficent state , with heavy taxation , regulation and protection , is common to many continental European countries .
But nowhere is it more pronounced or entrenched than in France , where it reaches back to the construction of roads , canals and industrial mammoths under Jean - Baptiste Colbert , Louis XIV 's minister of finance and industry .
In recent years , before the financial crash , what is loosely known as the French model came in for fierce criticism , chiefly for failing to generate enough growth or jobs .
Its detractors have not only been les Anglo - Saxons but have also included Nicolas Sarkozy himself .
He may be better known now for proclaiming the end of laissez - faire capitalism .
But he was elected France 's president partly by arguing that the French model was moribund , and picking out the British and American models for praise .
Before him , a string of government - commissioned reports , written by such authors as Michel Camdessus , a former IMF managing director , and Michel Pébereau , chairman of BNP Paribas , laid bare the failings and costs of the system .
France 's public spending accounted for 52 % of GDP in 2007 , next to 45 % in Britain and 37 % in America .
Yet in 1997 - 2007 its annual rate of GDP growth was below the OECD average .
To be sure , the French economy has been battered by the global recession like any other .
Firms are cutting output and shedding jobs .
Unemployment reached 8.6 % in February .
There have been regular mass rallies across France in protest at job cuts .
More sinisterly , there has been a wave of “ boss - napping ” , a form of kidnapping in which managers are kept by workers overnight in their own offices .
Yet France 's economy has been less hard hit than many .
Its GDP is expected to shrink by 3 % this year , according to the IMF , against 4.1 % in Britain , 4.4 % in Italy and 5.6 % in Germany ( see charts ) .
It is less dependent on exports than Germany , and consumer spending in the first quarter of 2009 was up on the same period last year .
The government , usually reprimanded for profligacy , is set to have a deficit in 2009 ( 6.2 % of GDP ) well below those in America ( 13.6 % ) and Britain ( 9.8 % ) .
The French are great savers and most have not taken out unaffordable mortgages or spent heavily on credit .
Household debt as a share of GDP is less than half that in Britain or America .
The prospect of nationalising banks may give Americans nightmares about turning French .
In fact the French government has not yet had to rescue any big French bank from collapse , let alone nationalise one .
Though there is outrage at bonus payments in firms laying off workers , bosses ' pay in France is not that extravagant , and the income gap between the top 10 % and the bottom 10 % is far smaller than in Britain or America .
Indeed , with a mix of amusement and self - satisfaction , the French have watched les Anglo - Saxons start to sound , well , increasingly French .
Barack Obama says he wants Americans to save more and consume less , to make real things rather than short - term paper profits , to redistribute more wealth and provide health care for all .
When he dropped in on Strasbourg , in eastern France , a town now linked by the TGV to Paris in little over two hours , he asked enviously : “ Why ca n't we have high - speed rail ? ”
Time ran an article entitled “ How we became the United States of France ” .
Newsweek published one claiming that “ The last model standing is France ” .
When Christine Lagarde , France 's finance minister , appeared recently on Jon Stewart 's “ The Daily Show ” , an American comedy programme , she joked that “ maybe you are moving in our direction . ”
In Britain , Gordon Brown has declared — like Mr Sarkozy — that “ laissez - faire has had its day ” .
Business chiefs clamour for Britain to get itself a proper industrial policy and stop relying on the mirage of finance .
Howard Davies , head of the London School of Economics , wrote in praise of “ French lessons on the state 's new role ” .
Even Peter Mandelson , a former European trade commissioner whom the French regard as a high priest of economic liberalism , recently turned up in Paris to learn more about what he calls industrial activism .
“ We have something to learn from continental practice , ” he said , identifying French long - term strategic planning in such sectors as energy and transport .
To French ears , all this is rather pleasing .
Mr Sarkozy hailed the G20 London summit as the end of the Anglo - Saxon model of capitalism .
Le Monde , a leading daily , wrote : “ In the crisis , the French model , formerly knocked , finds favour once more . ”
Croissants and car tyres
Behind the loose terms and caricature , however , what exactly does the French model consist of ?
Does it work ?
As governments try to work out the best balance between the market and the state , have the French got that balance right after all ?
The low - lying region of Picardy in northern France has been as battered by the global slump as any other .
Workers at Continental , a tyre manufacturer , recently trashed an administrative building when the courts upheld the closure of a factory at Clairoix , with the loss of 1,120 jobs — a crushing blow to employees who had agreed to work a longer week in return for a promise to keep the site going .
In nearby Beauvais , Bosch closed its factory last year , putting 240 people out of work .
Now there are worries about the future of a sponge factory in the town .
Yet at lunchtime on a warm spring day , tables at the pavement cafés in the town centre , near the scaffolding - clad cathedral , are all taken .
Municipal flowerbeds , where cornflower - blue lupins nestle next to ornamental cabbages , are well stocked and tended .
The car park at the local hypermarket is packed .
Traffic at the nearby low - cost airport , a big employer , is still busy .
And local electronics and perfume factories are holding up well .
“ This is not a rich town , ” says Caroline Cayeux , the centre - right mayor .
“ But having the French social system enables people to keep their heads above water . ”
Beauvais , the administrative capital , captures the cushioning effect of the French model in recession , and its strong egalitarian ethos .
On the one hand , there is widespread fear of job losses .
On the other , there is a sense that the economy is propped up even in bad times by the public sector and the welfare system .
Fully 43 % of the town 's residents live in rent - subsidised social housing .
The town hall itself is a big employer .
Some 130 gardeners , for example , toil away in its flowerbeds year - round , digging , weeding and planting .
It also distributes all manner of direct help to families , such as vouchers for children 's holidays or after - school activities .
It has devised a special scheme for the 4,500 “ working poor ” , who fall outside other national welfare safety - nets .
Across France , 5.2 m workers , or 21 % of those with jobs , are employed by the public sector .
If you count others whose incomes or jobs are not exposed to the economic cycle , 49 % of those either in work or retired are only moderately vulnerable to the recession , according to Xerfi , an economics consultancy .
Add to that layers of social protection , including unemployment benefits that can reach up to 75 % of previous salary , and a raft of direct payments for families , such as € 889.72 for newborn babies , and the French are relatively sheltered from market downturns .
Moreover , France 's health system , a mix of private and public provision , manages both to guarantee universal coverage and produce a relatively healthy population for half the cost per person of America's , and with shorter waiting lists than Britain 's somewhat cheaper version .
The French have higher life expectancy than both the British and Americans .
Through means - testing , the state covers those without the top - up private insurance needed to complement the public scheme .
All these “ automatic stabilisers ” , argues Ms Lagarde , help to support demand and should be counted as part of the fiscal stimulus package .
Indeed , the finance ministry has received many recent visits from other governments ' officials interested in the French system .
“ The difference is that the French model provides shock absorbers that were already in place , ” she comments .
“ We have n't had to reinvent our unemployment , health or welfare systems . ”
A central feature of the French model is the state 's role as provider , cushioning citizens , redistributing wealth and propping up demand in hard times .
But it has two other functions : planner and regulator .
The ghost of Colbert
The French finance ministry is housed in a vast modern structure that juts out on pillars into the Seine in eastern Paris .
The finance minister also has use of the Hôtel de Seignelay , an elegant 18th - century riverside mansion in the capital 's fashionable heart .
Outside the minister 's parquet - floored office stands a fine bust of Colbert , whose grandson lived in the house .
Colbertist state planning helped to reconstruct France after the second world war , delivering the trente glorieuses , or 30 years of post - war economic growth .
Until recently an official “ planning commission ” , in charge of strategic four - year plans , still operated .
The official body has gone , but the spirit , like the bust , lives on .
Long - term planning of public infrastructure is the best example of where it works well .
London 's first fast - link cross-city underground line , Crossrail , is not due to open until 2017 , but Paris boasts a network of five such RER lines , first launched in the late 1960s .
Mr Sarkozy has just unveiled the latest step : a ten - year project to build an automated metro loop around the city outskirts , linking the main airports .
France 's TGV network , whose first tracks were laid in 1974 under Georges Pompidou , continues to spread .
The construction costs are heavy , with debt now hived off into a separate rail - network entity .
Yet with average speeds of 300 km per hour ( 190 m ph ) , the trains provide a viable and ecological alternative to air and road travel .
Many businessmen use the TGV for daily trips between big French cities .
Or take the nuclear industry .
The French government decided to push nuclear power in a big way back in the 1970s , in response to the oil shock and the country 's lack of fossil fuels .
Nuclear energy now generates 78 % of all French electricity , and the country is a net electricity exporter .
In EDF and Areva , it has two of the world 's leading nuclear companies .
France is now pioneering the construction of the latest - generation , missile - proof , earthquake - proof power plant , the EPR , with other countries set to adopt the same design .
Such French strategic planning is not only about long - term vision and infrastructure ; it is also about putting in place the industrial supply chain needed to get there .
The French state has either created companies ( EDF , Areva ) or bailed - out troubled private ones ( Alstom , the manufacturer of the TGV train ) in order to keep the supply side going .
Such planning extends to education too .
France has a world - class layer of engineering , business and public - administration schools , known as grandes écoles , which churn out a technically skilled elite to run such firms .
It is no coincidence that the bosses of EDF ( Pierre Gadonneix ) , Alstom ( Patrick Kron ) , and Areva ( Anne Lauvergeon , see Face Value ) are all graduates of grandes écoles in science or engineering .
The impulse to control , which underpins the French model , extends to the third function of the state too , that of regulator .
The French are champion rule - makers .
There are rules about how many pharmacies any one pharmacist can own ( one ) , and how many taxis there are on the Paris streets ( 15,300 ) .
There are rules about when lorries can use motorways ( not on Sundays ) , or when shops can hold sales ( twice a year , on dates set by officials ) .
New rules allowing shops to pick freely another two weeks have been greeted as a revolution .
“ To have cut - price discounts in April without waiting for the June sales is unheard - of ! ” exclaimed Le Parisien newspaper .
Some of these rules seem absurd .
But , in the financial sector , France 's regulatory urge has served it well in the current crisis .
France 's big banks may have lost plenty of money , but they have certainly performed better than their British or American peers , and most are still in profit .
One reason is tighter regulation .
Take the mortgage market .
French banks have generally been far more wary about lending to homebuyers .
In 2007 French mortgage debt represented only 35 % of GDP , according to the European Mortgage Federation , less than in Germany ( 48 % ) and way off that in the housing - bubble economies of Britain ( 86 % ) , Ireland ( 75 % ) and Spain ( 62 % ) .
French house prices did rise strongly .
But the Bank of France argues that this was as much because of demographic growth , higher real disposable income and limited housing supply as speculative buying .
How far all this is due to regulation is hard to measure precisely .
One leading French official reckons the answer is half thanks to a tradition of cautious borrowing , and half thanks to stricter rules .
France applies tighter rules on bank capitalisation than international standards dictate .
The regulator also recommends that banks should not make loans on which interest payments represent more than a third of the borrower 's income .
Banks are under a legal obligation not to push borrowers into more debt than they can manage , and cases are regularly brought to court .
So caution is built into the system .
Now for the flipside
If the French model has broadly sheltered its people from credit - fuelled excess , kept demand buoyant and inequalities manageable , and delivered well scrubbed buildings and blooming flowerbeds to boot , does this mean that the model works ?
Or what is the catch ?
The answer lies in a generally disappointing macroeconomic performance , with low growth and high unemployment , and is explained by the flipside of each of the three roles the French model allocates to the state .
First , as a provider , the government taxes employers and employees with such heavy social - security contributions to pay for all the health and welfare that it ends up deterring firms from creating jobs in the first place .
One reason why French workers are more productive per hour than Americans is that firms employ so few of them .
Many make widespread use of rotating interns and temps .
One fast - food boss says that he staffs the same restaurants in France with two - thirds of the numbers hired in Britain .
France 's jobless rate ( 8.6 % ) may now be the same as America 's ( 8.5 % ) .
But , unlike America's , it never falls much below 8 % even in good times .
The upshot is a split employment market .
On one side , decent permanent jobs , protected by industry - wide conventions negotiated by the unions .
On the other , unprotected short - term work — or none at all .
The young are particularly shut out : joblessness for the under - 25s is 21 % .
On some housing projects in the heavily Muslim banlieues , the rate is double that .

The state as planner has its flaws too .
French industrial policy has evolved , and is no longer just about big planes , trains and cars .
There is , for instance , a generous new research tax credit for companies , designed to boost innovation in industry particularly in the carbon - light and high - tech sectors .
A new “ auto - entrepreneur ” system to encourage self - employment , and run on the basis of “ no profit earned , no tax due ” , has lured a massive 145,000 people since it was launched in January , well ahead of official expectations .
“ Anybody who says that the French just want to be civil servants and not entrepreneurs has n't got it , ” declares Ms Lagarde .
But , as a senior French official points out , the Colbertist engineering culture is on the whole much better at devising and managing big planned projects than it is at dealing with bottom - up ideas and uncertain markets .
France lacks start - ups , and its small firms have difficulty growing .
Hardly any of the biggest companies listed on the Paris bourse were founded in the past 50 years .
Moreover , the old - style policy of picking national champions has had , at best , a mixed record .
Transport and utility firms may be one thing .
In other sectors , including computers ( remember Groupe Bull ) or banking ( think of Crédit Lyonnais under state ownership ) , it has been a disaster .
Even the French have been unwinding public stakes in private enterprise over the past 15 years .
There has been no widespread nationalisation for more than a quarter of a century .
Nor is the egalitarian impulse necessarily a guarantor of quality , as French universities demonstrate .
In reality , France has two - tier higher education : its world - class grandes écoles cater to a tiny elite , and its broadly second - rate universities fail the masses .
Tuition at universities is free .
There is no undergraduate selection at entry .
Recent reforms have begun to inject an element of competition , and could produce centres of excellence in time .
But , for the rest , a virulent distrust of competition and selection has led to overcrowded amphitheatres , an oversupply of philosophy and sociology students and high drop - out rates .
In the Shanghai Jiao Tong University 's world ranking , not one French university makes it into the top 40 .
As for the state as regulator , it may have protected the French economy from extreme volatility , but that goes for the upside too .
A more stable economy in a recession also means a less dynamic , less innovative economy in good times .
For all its positive elements , the French model has not yet not incorporated enough flexibility , leaving it with the task of ensuring solidarity , but not the dynamic growth needed to sustain it in the long run .
When I was younger I assumed that drunks and stoners must inherently hate each other , at least philosophically .
Really my silliest assumption was that anyone only did one or the other .
Every stoner I know loves beer , and every drunk I know gets excited when someone busts out a joint .
Only jerkoffs are purist .
Nonetheless , booze and weed are different beasts and there are strengths and weakness to each .
Endurance : Being drunk all day can be awesome , but it ’s a plan rife with potential disaster that can lead to puking and gross errors in judgment .
Whereas any wake 'n ' bake fan will tell you , all it takes to be stoned from sunup to sundown is the desire to do so and an appropriate supply .
win : weed Party :
When I was in Amsterdam the thing that struck me most about the " coffee shops " was n't that I could legally buy weed ( I live in California after all ) , but how quiet the places were .
People chat softly or just sit in a daze .
You ca n’t really have a “ crazy ” stoner party .
There are no weed keggers .
Get a room of people stoned and you ’ll probably all end up playing video games or watching a ( bad ) movie .
win : booze
Sports :
A bit of alcohol dulls your inhibitions , which can actually improve your reaction timing .
Of course that all goes out the window once you get shitfaced .
But everything from softball to bowling is more fun with beer .
Weed does n’t make you worse at sports so much as it makes you not want to do them ; touch football out , Madden on the PS3 in .
win : booze Conversation : Drunks speak a language only other drunks can understand , and stoners tend to prattle meanderingly like nursing home inhabitants .
Talking to either while you ’re sober is awful .
win : neither Chores : Painting or building IKEA crap seems like a great time to throw back some booze .
Yes , it ’ll make the process more fun , but your work will likely turn out embarrassing once you sober up .
Getting high can greatly improve boring tasks like laundry and vacuuming , with little - to - no effect on your skill level .
Though you are prone to dumbass gaffes like leaving your clothes in the drier all day .
win : weed
Sex : Sex is great both drunk and high .
Drunk sex is wild ; involving positions you 're not sure how you knew and on top of things that are n't your bed .
Stoned sex is hippie sex ; slow and full of childlike wonderment .
" Wow , this is great ! " I 've actually said out loud before during stoned sex .
win : both A tie !
More research is necessary .
Who has some kush ?
I 'll bring the Scotch .
Jackie Chan and The World ’s Largest Sushi Roll
Anything that is prefixed by the two words , “ World ’s Largest ” piques curiosity .
And nowhere is that more true than in the food industry .
People simply love edible monstrosities .
This ginormous version of the bite - sized dish was on display at G. Sushi , the famed Honk Kong based chain that recently opened an outlet in Shanghai , China .
It is owned by Jackie Chan , the martial arts hero and actor .
The restaurateur tries to put his arms around the gigantic sushi roll , ( makizushi ) wrapped in a blanket of seaweed ( nori ) .
Sushi is perhaps , the island nation ’s most popular gastronomic export to the world and they come in an endless variety .
But this particular one is certainly , one of a kind .
Any sushi-lovers headed to Shanghai yet , for the big bite ?

All Kelley Coffman - Lee wanted to do was broadcast her love of tofu to the driving public .
So the Colorado vegan applied to the state ’s Department of Revenue for a vanity license plate for her Suzuki SL7 carrying the message : ILVTOFU .
Clerks at her local motor vehicle office approved the plate -- but it did not escape the discerning eyes of state revenue officials , who detected another way that Coffman - Lee ’s penchant for tofu could be read .
“ It could be misinterpreted in a way that suggests that she likes something other than tofu , ” explained revenue department spokesman Mark Couch .
Application denied .
Not only that , but Coffman - Lee ’s pithy ode to soy went straight onto the department ’s list of letter combinations banned under a state law that permits authorities to weed out those applications deemed “ offensive to good taste or decency . ”
Others that have n’t passed muster : OBITEME , 2EROTIC and PASSGAS .
The list has grown to 2,744 entries over the years as residents apply for creative letter combinations to express their personal preferences .
“ Ever since we ’ve had vanity plates , there ’s been someone trying to slip one by us , ” Couch said .
Coffman - Lee , who could not be reached for comment , has said that ILVTOFU does not deserve to be listed .
“ My whole family is vegan , so tofu is like a staple for us .
I was just going to have a cool license plate , and the DMV misinterpreted my message , ” Coffman - Lee told the Denver Post after the application was denied .
Now the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado has entered the fray , questioning what it calls censorship by the state .
The ACLU has obtained the list of banned phrases .
The list reveals “ the more serious ways in which this attempt to purge offensive words has wound up being an effort to censor ideas and viewpoints , ” said Mark Silverstein , legal director of the Colorado ACLU .
He noted that the list includes : BADUSA , 4HEMP and OK2BGAY .
Silverstein noted the U.S. Supreme Court ’s ruling in a 1971 case that a profane message on a California man ’s jacket had free speech protections .
The courts are divided in their rulings on states ’ rights to restrict license plate messages , said Gene Policinski , executive director of the Tennessee - based First Amendment Center .
Some have ruled that governments can regulate such messages as long as the restrictions are n’t based on viewpoints .
Others have held that motorists have the right to express what they wish with little restriction .
The next step in Colorado ?
STYTUND
Correll writes for The Times .
The proposals would see credit unions taking control of crisis lending Emergency state loans given to the poorest people in the UK could cease to be interest free , under changes being considered by ministers .
The social fund currently extends £ 500 m a year in interest - free loans to some 1.2 million benefit claimants .
But the government says in future some loans could be run by credit unions , who it says typically charge annual rates ranging from 12.68 % to 26.8 % .
The Tories accused ministers of acting like " loan sharks " .
The BBC 's political correspondent Jo Coburn said the reforms were designed to ensure that interest - free loans were not offered to people who did not really need them .
The social fund was set up to help needy people , many of them elderly or disabled , meet the costs of items such as cookers , cots and funerals .
Credit unions Details of the proposed changes were released in a Department for Work and Pensions consultation document .
It states that the government is considering offering contracts to credit unions to provide " affordable loans " , as well as other services such as savings accounts and financial advice , to people at a local level .
[ It ] seems to me that it would make a bad situation even worse
John McFall
Treasury Select Committee
" To fund the cost of these extra services , we are proposing that the credit offered under these arrangements could attract an interest charge of 1 - 2 % per month , " it says .
The paper states that credit unions of the sort they are considering " typically charge interest at rates varying from 12.68 % to 26.8 % APR " .
The DWP said that in 2007 / 8 the average " budgeting loan " given by the social fund was £ 433.30 , and the average repayment was £ 10.54 a week .
In future , if interest were charged at 2 % a month , it would take 46 weeks to repay that amount instead of 42 , with total interest of £ 47.80 .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The people who need it the most will suffer while those who milk the system will not notice a thing Steve Godrich , Reading A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said : " The social fund provides affordable credit for people who need it .
" We are now exploring how we can make it more widely available to people in work as well as on benefits .
" We want to make sure people in need do not turn to illegal loan sharks who can charge interest of 1,000 % . "
No decisions had been made and the government would do nothing to create difficulties for low - income families , she added .
' Totally unacceptable ' Labour MP and chairman of the Treasury Select Committee John McFall told the BBC that the social fund " does not work " .
" The government needs to ... ensure that people get the genuine loans and genuine needs met , " he said .
" To put a 26.9 % interest rate on that seems to me that it would make a bad situation even worse , so I think that 's a bit of a joke . "
It 's harsh , it 's insensitive and it does n't reflect the needs of the day
Vince Cable
Liberal Democrats Shadow work and pensions secretary Chris Grayling said : " These proposals are simply outrageous .
" Thousands of people are losing their jobs every week , and it is nothing short of extraordinary that the government 's answer is to propose abandoning interest - free emergency loans , and start charging 27 % a year instead .
" Gordon Brown and [ Work and Pensions Secretary ] James Purnell are behaving like loan sharks . "
The Liberal Democrats said the proposal was " totally unacceptable " and " seemed to be destroying the purpose " of the social fund .
Treasury spokesman Vince Cable told the BBC : " It 's completely self defeating .
It 's just driving people who are already in difficulty into even further difficulty .
" It 's harsh , it 's insensitive and it does n't reflect the needs of the day . "

When I was a kid , I used to love the idea of Pringles potato chips snacks .
They were all the same size .
They were all the same color .
They lasted forever .
And they came in a can .
The appeal to me , and other snackers , was the consistency and sameness .
They were so very different from all of the other “ chips ” which were all ( gasp ) in irregular potato shapes in wrinkly foil bags .
How did Pringles do it ?
Last year , the world learned the reason for this snack food mystery : Pringles are actually not potato chips .
They are n’t even mostly potato .
Surprisingly , it was the manufacturer of Pringles making this argument .
Proctor & Gamble did not want Pringles to be considered potato chips – or potato crisps – so that the chips would be exempt from the snack tax .
The company claimed that Pringles are not potato chips – or even like potato chips – since they are cooked from baked dough and not slices of potato .
The court agreed .
This week , however , a three - judge appeals court , reversed the lower court decision .
They declared Pringles a non-exempt snack and therefore , subject to the snack tax .
Proctor & Gamble spokesman Paul
Fox did not guarantee another appeal but did say that it is under consideration .
He added , “ Obviously we ’re disappointed with the court ’s decision .
We ’ve always asserted that Pringles should be tested on the same manner as other savory snacks of similar composition . ”
In other words , those other savory snacks masquerading as potato chips but really not made out of potatoes …
In the end , the court ruled that the ratio of ingredients did n’t matter .
Even if it ’s not really a “ potato chip ” because of the lack of potato ( insert throat clearing here ) , it ’s still taxable .
Does this strike anyone else as odd ?
It ’s a massive case of letting the tax tail wag the dog .
Proctor & Gamble is clearly so eager to escape this sales tax that they ’re willing to parade their “ snacks ” in public as a potato chip substitute .
We now know that there is only about 40 % potato in the “ chips ” – and that is potato flour .
In fact , counsel , noting that the chip was mostly flour , fat and other ingredients , claimed :
If a product has a number of significant ingredients it cannot be said to be ‘ made from ’ one of them .
Ewww .
I do n’t know about you but this seriously decreases the chances that I ’m picking up a bag can of potato flour snacks at the market for the holiday weekend .
If you say potato , I say give me an actual potato .
It has long been known that heat is an effective weapon against tumor cells .
However , it 's difficult to heat patients ' tumors without damaging nearby tissues .
Now , MIT researchers have developed tiny gold particles that can home in on tumors , and then , by absorbing energy from near - infrared light and emitting it as heat , destroy tumors with minimal side effects .
Such particles , known as gold nanorods , could diagnose as well as treat tumors , says MIT graduate student Geoffrey von Maltzahn , who developed the tumor - homing particles with Sangeeta Bhatia , professor in the Harvard - MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology ( HST ) and in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science , a member of the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator .
Von Maltzahn and Bhatia describe their gold nanorods in two papers recently published in Cancer Research and Advanced Materials .
In March , von Maltzahn won the Lemelson - MIT Student Prize , in part for his work with the nanorods .
Cancer affects about seven million people worldwide , and that number is projected to grow to 15 million by 2020 .
Most of those patients are treated with chemotherapy and / or radiation , which are often effective but can have debilitating side effects because it 's difficult to target tumor tissue .
With chemotherapy treatment , 99 percent of drugs administered typically do n't reach the tumor , said von Maltzahn .
In contrast , the gold nanorods can specifically focus heat on tumors .
" This class of particles provides the most efficient method of specifically depositing energy in tumors , " he said .
Wiping out tumors
Gold nanoparticles can absorb different frequencies of light , depending on their shape .
Rod - shaped particles , such as those used by von Maltzahn and Bhatia , absorb light at near - infrared frequency ; this light heats the rods but passes harmlessly through human tissue .
In a study reported in the team 's Cancer Research paper , tumors in mice that received an intravenous injection of nanorods plus near - infrared laser treatment disappeared within 15 days .
Those mice survived for three months with no evidence of reoccurrence , until the end of the study , while mice that received no treatment or only the nanorods or laser , did not .
Once the nanorods are injected , they disperse uniformly throughout the bloodstream .
Bhatia 's team developed a polymer coating for the particles that allows them to survive in the bloodstream longer than any other gold nanoparticles ( the half - life is greater than 17 hours ) .
In designing the particles , the researchers took advantage of the fact that blood vessels located near tumors have tiny pores just large enough for the nanorods to enter .
Nanorods accumulate in the tumors , and within three days , the liver and spleen clear any that do n't reach the tumor .
During a single exposure to a near - infrared laser , the nanorods heat up to 70 degree Celsius , hot enough to kill tumor cells .
Additionally , heating them to a lower temperature weakens tumor cells enough to enhance the effectiveness of existing chemotherapy treatments , raising the possibility of using the nanorods as a supplement to those treatments .
The nanorods could also be used to kill tumor cells left behind after surgery .
The nanorods can be more than 1,000 times more precise than a surgeon 's scalpel , says von Maltzahn , so they could potentially remove residual cells the surgeon can't get .
Finding tumors
The nanorods ' homing abilities also make them a promising tool for diagnosing tumors .
After the particles are injected , they can be imaged using a technique known as Raman scattering .
Any tissue that lights up , other than the liver or spleen , could harbor an invasive tumor .
In the Advanced Materials paper , the researchers showed they could enhance the nanorods ' imaging abilities by adding molecules that absorb near - infrared light to their surface .
Because of this surface - enhanced Raman scattering , very low concentrations of nanorods - to only a few parts per trillion in water [ gf1 ] - can be detected .
Another advantage of the nanorods is that by coating them with different types of light - scattering molecules , they can be designed to simultaneously gather multiple types of information - not only whether there is a tumor , but whether it is at risk of invading other tissues , whether it 's a primary or secondary tumor , or where it originated .
Bhatia and von Maltzahn are looking into commercializing the technology .
Before the gold nanorods can be used in humans , they must undergo clinical trials and be approved by the FDA , which von Maltzahn says will be a multi- year process .
Other authors of the Advanced Materials paper are Andrea Centrone , postdoctoral associate in chemical engineering ; Renuka Ramanathan , undergraduate in biological engineering ; Alan Hatton , the Ralph Landau Professor of Chemical Engineering ; and Michael Sailor and Ji-Ho Park of the University of California at San Diego .
Park and Sailor are also authors of the Cancer Research paper , along with Amit Agrawal , former postdoctoral associate in HST ; and Nanda Kishor Bandaru and Sarit Das of the Indian Institute of Technology Madras .
The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health , the Whitaker Foundation and the National Science Foundation .
Nanopartz Inc. supplied the precursor gold nanorods used in this work .

David Cameron was under mounting pressure last night to end the political career of one of his closest allies as the MPs ' expenses scandal claimed its first casualties .
Andrew MacKay resigned as Mr Cameron 's senior political and parliamentary adviser after he admitted claiming a " second home " allowance when he only had one property .
He received £ 140,952 on the London home he shares with his MP wife Julie Kirkbride , who listed it as her main home and claimed £ 141,779 for a house she bought in her Bromsgrove constituency .
Mr MacKay , who does not have a home in his Bracknell constituency , admitted his arrangement now looked " strange " but insisted it had been approved by Commons officials .
Asked if he had done anything wrong , Mr MacKay said he had made " an error of judgement that looks wrong " .
Tory officials say Ms Kirkbride has done nothing wrong and had also had her arrangements approved by the Fees Office .
No action is planned against her .
Mr Cameron has promised to take a tough line against Tory MPs who have made suspect claims but he appears reluctant to withdraw the party whip from Mr MacKay – which would ban him from being a Tory candidate at the general election .
A survey of 1,400 Tory grassroots members found that 66 per cent believe Mr MacKay should cease to be an MP .
The ConservativeHome website found that 82 per cent of Tory members want MPs facing questions about their behaviour to face deselection meetings .

On a day of shame for Parliament , Elliot Morley , a former environment minister , was suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party after it emerged he had claimed £ 16,000 for a mortgage that did not exist .
The police have received a complaint about his actions from the Taxpayers ' Alliance .
Boris Johnson , the Mayor of London and chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority , said there was a case for the police to be called in to investigate the claims made by some MPs .
Meanwhile , two Labour peers face a six - month suspension from the House of Lords after an investigation into allegations they were prepared to take " cash for amendments " .
A senior Labour source said Parliament was " having a collective nervous breakdown . "
Today , The Daily Telegraph accuses the Justice Minister Shahid Malik , of claiming £ 66,827 , the maximum amount allowed for a second home over three years , despite securing his main three - bedroom home in his constituency of Dewsbury , West Yorkshire , for a discounted rent of less than £ 100 a week .
He denied breaking any rules , saying the expenses system was flawed .
The newspaper discloses that Clare Short , the former International Development Secretary who now sits as an independent candidate , claimed the full cost of her mortgage for two - and - a - half years when she was entitled only to the interest .
She was asked by the Fees Office to repay more than £ 8,000 .
Last night she said she made an " honest mistake " when she switched from an interest - only to a repayment mortgage in 2003 .
But the damage over the expenses saga continued to hurt Labour most , with a YouGov survey in The Sun today putting Labour on 22 per cent , its lowest - ever rating , the Tories on 41 per cent and the Lib Dems on 19 per cent .
Labour denied dithering over Mr Morley 's case .
Although it did not act until after the Telegraph revealed his £ 800 - a- month mortgage claim , Labour sources say the party did not know the full details until yesterday .
The party 's national executive committee will consider disciplinary action against other Labour MPs when it sits next Tuesday .
Cameron aides denied he had gone soft over Mr MacKay to protect a close adviser .
They said there was no need to discipline him because he had promised to abide by the verdict reached by a new Tory scrutiny panel being set up by Mr Cameron .
It is likely to order Mr MacKay to repay the money .
Speaking on the BBC's Question Time last night amid a row over the expenses saga , the Lib Dem Home Affairs Spokesman Chris Huhne joined the growing number of MPs calling for the Speaker , Michael Martin , to step down after comments he made on Thursday .
Douglas Hogg , the former Agriculture minister , backed away from a confrontation with the Tory leader .
On Wednesday , he cast doubt on the Tory panel 's legitimacy .
Last night , he agreed to repay £ 2,200 he claimed for maintaining his country estate " in recognition of public concern " .
He admitted the cost of cleaning his moat " was not positively excluded from the claim " .
Greg Barker , a Tory environment spokesman , will make a " voluntary payment " for capital gains tax .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Gold futures fell Monday for a third straight session to end near $ 870 an ounce , wiping out their yearly gains as traders shaved positions on worries that the 403 tons of gold sales by the International Monetary Fund will increase supply and depress gold prices .
Meanwhile , a stronger U.S. dollar also added downward pressures on gold prices .
" There is still this fear of a lot of selling coming from different central banks and the IMF , " said George Gero , a precious metals trader for RBC Capital Markets .
" The perception is that ' I am getting out of the way until all the sales are completed and let 's see how it 's absorbed . ' "
Gold for April delivery fell $ 24.10 , or 2.7 % , to end at $ 871.50 an ounce in North American electronic trading .
It dropped to as low as $ 865.10 earlier .
The more active June contract also fell Monday , down 3.2 % at $ 868.50 .
Gold has lost nearly 6 % since April 1 and is now down 1.4 % for the year , partly out of optimism that collective actions by leaders of the world 's major nations may stem the global economic crisis .
In spot trading , the benchmark London afternoon gold - fixing price stood at $ 870.25 an ounce Monday , down $ 34.75 , or 3.8 % , from the previous day .
In other metals futures , silver for May delivery fell 4.9 % to $ 12.11 an ounce .
June palladium was up 0.4 % at $ 225.75 an ounce , while April platinum fell 1.2 % to $ 1,145.70 an ounce .
May copper dropped 2.1 % to $ 1.959 a pound .
IMF gold sales
Leaders from the Group of 20 nations said last Thursday they endorse 403 tons of gold sales by the IMF .
The proceeds will be used to provide finance for the poorest countries over the next two to three years .
The announcement came one day after the European Central Bank said it had completed the sale of 35.5 tons of gold .
The IMF 's plan to sell the gold still needs to be approved by an 85 % majority vote from its 185 members .
The U.S. , which has 17 % voting power in the fund , essentially holds veto power .
See full story on IMF gold sales .
If the plan is approved , the gold selling will be implemented in coordination with major central banks to minimize the impact on the market , the IMF said .
The possible IMF gold sales helped gold prices move lower in the short turn , said Hussein Allidina , an analyst at Morgan Stanley .
But he added he sees " any weakness in price as a buying opportunity as the sale would occur over years and be under the CBGA limit . "
The second Central Banks Gold Agreement , or CBGA , caps total gold sales of the signatories at 500 tons a year and expires in September .
A third CBGA is expected to be signed before September .
See related story about central bank gold selling .
Also helping gold move lower Monday , the U.S. dollar rose against most of its major rivals Monday , with the dollar index DXY , +0.23 % up nearly 1 % at 84.767 .
See Currencies .
A stronger greenback tends to push down dollar - denominated prices of commodities such as gold and crude .
Crude futures fell nearly 4 % Monday .
Falling ETF investment
Investment in gold exchange - traded funds also stalled recently .
Holdings in SPDR Gold Shares GLD , - 0.54 % , the biggest gold exchange - traded fund , stood at 1,127.37 tons Friday , down slightly from a day ago , according to latest data from the fund .
It 's the first drop in SPDR holdings in one month .
The SPDR lost 2.2 % to $ 85.68 on Monday .
Investors seeking investment safe haven had been buying gold earlier this year as deepening troubles in the economy pushed stocks to their lowest level in decades .
But actions from the world 's major nations has boosted investment sentiment and reduced gold 's safe - haven appeal .
The U.S. government and the Federal Reserve have spent , lent or committed more than $ 10 trillion to stem the economic downturn since the financial crisis began .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a speech Friday that he expects the gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth is coming .
The recent weakness in gold prices is " a sure sign risk appetite has increased further following the actions of various governments and central banks as well as the combined efforts of the G20 nations last week , " said James Moore , a precious metals analyst at TheBullionDesk.com

Mercurial book is now in production , and a little gift
I recently opened a Roth IRA for the first time .
For more information on the Roth IRA , see that post .
Today I wanted to get into a little more detail about that process , specifically the Vanguard Roth IRA opening process .
As an FYI , these screens may change over time , but the process should stay the same .
You ’ll need to select the type of investment account , enter your personal and banking information , select a fund or funds , and you ’re done .
Here ’s the Vanguard home page , where you simply need to click on the “ open an account ” button under the “ Invest Now ” section .
You can see from the front page what Vanguard values most : the simple message of low - cost investing .
Vanguard keeps it pretty simple with their next screen .
Here you ’ll need to designate whether you want to open a new account ( like I did ) , roll over an existing 401k ( very common to have one of these back with an old employer ) , or transfer investment funds from another account .
You ’re also asked to register with Vanguard ( but you can put this off till the end ) .
The next screen is almost a repeat of the previous one , except you have a section on the bottom to make a choice between going with Vanguard Mutual Funds , or stocks , bonds , and non-Vanguard funds .
Since I ’m at the Vanguard site looking for low - cost funds , this choice was a no - brain - er for me .
Although , this is a good time to point out that you can invest in just about any type of investment product within your Roth IRA .
It does n’t just have to be mutual funds .
I ended up investing in the Vanguard Target Retirement 2040 Fund .
Okay , the next screen is when you begin to enter your personal information .
All the basics , including the SSN are required .
If you ’re married and both you and your spouse are opening an account , make sure you put a different SSN in when you open your spouse ’s account .
Up next is the screen where you ’ll enter your bank information .
This is the account you ’ll be withdrawing your investment deposit from .
A quick login to my Capital One 360 account enabled me to track down my routing and account numbers .
Alright , now to the fun stuff .
To your right you ’ll see the default option , the Prime Money Market Fund .
If you have yet to do the research regarding which particular fund you ’d like to invest in , this money market fund might be the best place to house your initial investment while you learn which particular fund or group of funds you want to invest in .
Keep in mind , most of the funds on the left have a $ 3,000 minimum deposit .
So if you ’re not at that level yet , then the money market fund will have to do .
Note though , that these funds wo n’t be FDIC insured .
So you might want to put a small amount here just to get started and save up the balance of your $ 3,000 in an FDIC insured high - yield savings account .
As for the mutual funds on the left , the choice is entirely up to you .
This is definitely an area I ’m not qualified to comment on .
Let me just say that there are plenty of low - cost funds to chose from and there ’s something in there to meet your risk tolerance and balance your asset allocation .
The final screenshot I have to show you is the page below where you ’ll get to select what tax year you ’d like your Roth IRA contribution going towards .
This screen will only be active from January 1 to April 15 each year , as that ’s the only time you can contribute to either tax year .
After that step is complete you will have made your initial investment .
You will simply need to complete the online account opening process .
I wo n’t take you through those last steps because they ’re pretty straight - forward .
I hope this guide will provide some value to those wanting to open up a Roth IRA with Vanguard .
The process is really easy and takes less time than you think .

Canadians give their take on the evils of socialized health care ( ie. all of them get it ) :
LeBron ’s buzzer - beater saves Cavs ’ season …
… and maybe the franchise itself .
When the home team loses Game 1 of a seven - game series at home , they usually come out strong and focused in Game 2 , and that ’s exactly what the Cavs did tonight .
They actually built a 23 - point lead , and looked like they were on their way to an easy win , but the Magic slowly but surely chipped away at the lead .
It was 12 at halftime .
Then it was six at the end of the third quarter .
The Magic just kept coming .
Orlando had the ball with 0:13 to play , tied at 93-93 , when Hedo Turkoglu ran the clock down , drove into the lane and hit the go - ahead bucket with 0:01 to play .
He should have taken that extra second , because on the next possession , LeBron caught the ball at the top of the key extended , fading away , and rattled home the game - winning three .
I ’m amazed that he was even able to get open that easily , but he simply walked into Turkoglu , shoved him a little ( nothing illegal ) creating the space to catch the ball and shoot .
I bet Stan Van Gundy would like to have that defensive possession back and double - team LeBron instead of having Rashard Lewis guard the ball out of bounds .
With only 1.0 seconds remaining , there would n’t be enough time for the passer to get the ball back and get off a shot .
The Cavs were very fortunate to escape Game 2 with the series tied , and the win might breathe new life into a team that is playing with very little consistency right now .
The Magic are simply a bad matchup for the Cavs .
Dwight Howard is a tough guard down low and the versatility of Hedo Turkoglu and Rashard Lewis is causing fits for the Cleveland forwards .
And Stan Van Gundy has outcoached Mike Brown thus .
He swapped the matchups for Dwight Howard ( putting him on Varejao ) and Rashard Lewis ( putting him on Ilgauskas ) to allow each defender to play to his strengths .
Typically , when a team loses a heartbreaker like this , they are a little hungover in the next game , but this Magic team is mentally tough , and they will keep coming at the Cavs .
Cleveland will need to play 48 minutes ( and maybe more ) of good , solid basketball in order to get a win in Orlando .
I can’t imagine what Cavs fans went through over the last quarter of this game .
They ’re fooling themselves if they think it ’s a sure thing that LeBron is going to stay next summer .
The Cavs need to get to the Finals , and if they flame out against the Magic , I ’d fully expect all the LeBron - to - NY / NJ rumors to start back up again .
The city of Cleveland cannot afford a Cavs ’ loss in this series .
I have begun work on the electrical subsystems .
The 12v will be handled by a Iota 55 Amp 96 – 190vdc DC / DC converter , along with a small auxiliary battery to power the initial contactor activation to switch the traction circuit on .
I ’ve also begun etching the new battery rack / motor mount for coating with POR - 15 .
I am also creating a new front wiring harness .
I upgraded the original setup which routed the headlight power through the physical switch in the steering wheel , with a pair of relays switching straight to the 12v system ’s battery .
This should bring the voltage at the bulbs from the ~ 11.5 volts it was previously up to 13.6 volts from the dc /dc .
I ’ve heard this makes a significant difference with the dim old headlights of this 38 year old vehicle , as well as removing the biggest strain on the aging wiring .
All front headlight and side marker connectors were replaced with OEM grade dual gasketed weather pak connectors .
I ’m also etching the front and rear battery rack components .
Also shown here is the contactor brackets made from 1/8 ″ steel flat stock .
I also fabricated a proper foot controlled throttle using a 25 k potentiometer .
This worked out so that the ~ 70 * of mechanical throw from the original throttle setup became a steady linear range of 0 ohms through 5 k ohms .
A spring provides positive return and a very nice amount of pedal resistance .
I set up forced air cooling for the kostov motor .
An automotive blower provides several hundred CFM of airflow through the motor .
It was oriented as to swirl through the brushes before exiting the motor .
Testing shows that even after several minutes of acceleration with many huge amp draws through the motor ( 600 + amps ) the exhaust air was only warm , and the case barely warm to the touch .
The blower draws approximently 10 Amps free air and 6 Amps when installed blowing through the motor .
The cooling setup is not finished .
I must still create an end shroud for the motor to force more air to pass through the body of the motor .
ST . LOUIS ( AP )  Charter Communications , the cable operator , said Friday that it had filed a prearranged Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan .
The company , controlled by a Microsoft founder , Paul G. Allen , had planned to file a prearranged Chapter 11 bankruptcy by April 1 .
For years the company has ducked insolvency , but it is now coming up against tight credit and billions of dollars of debt coming due .
Charter had about $ 21.7 billion in debt at the end of 2008 .
Holders of $ 8 billion of the debt agreed to exchange it for almost full ownership in the company , and some old debt was exchanged for new debt .
After the bankruptcy , the company will have $ 13 billion mainly in bank debt , which expires from 2013 to 2016 .

Update : Since a few months ago , Geiser has its own home in the interwebs .
I hope you ’ll pardon a shameless plug of one of my latest hacks , Geiser , a new Emacs - Scheme interaction mode .
After having lots of fun implementing Fuel , i was left with a lot of Elisp code that , i realized , could be easily reused for languages other than Factor .
I also decided that it was high time to stop whining about Scheme environments not being dynamic enough and do something about it .
As they say , talk is cheap .
Thusly , Geiser was born , and today it came of 0.0.1 0.0.2 age , as per the git tag in its repository .
If you know Slime or Fuel , you know what Geiser aims at : a pleasant , live interaction with Scheme without leaving Emacs .
This first release is by no means there yet , but you ’ll already find some joy using it : module - aware and incremental evaluation , jumping to definitions , dynamic symbol completion and automatic signature display in the echo area are the highlights .
Currently , Geiser supports two Scheme implementations : Guile and PLT .
Yeah , i like both ( and several others ) .
It ’s been really fun discovering how to tweak them to obtain the metadata i wanted , and their developers and users have been helpful , kind and patient to no end .
A big thanks to them ( you know who you are ) , and my promise that i’ll keep nagging .
Both Guile and PLT have given me many pleasant surprises .
Guile is the most common - lispy Scheme around , and the recent hard work and improvements by the likes of Andy Wingo is making much of the criticism it memetically receives just moot .
And PLT is by no means the rigid system i thought it was , while retaining all the great features i knew it had .
Try any of them , with or without Geiser : they ’re real fun .
Back to Geiser , this being an alpha release , there ’s no screencasts or real documentation … the code just escaped leaving a blood trail , you know .
Maybe one day it ’ll have a webpage , a mailing list and even users .
In the meantime , if you ’re brave enough , the README will hopefully do ; and , of course , the code :
git clone git://gitorious.org/geiser/mainline.git
( If you ’re not brave enough , but curious , the code is browsable here . )
Needless to say , all kinds of comments , criticisms and laundry lists are welcome and , actually , encouraged .
Happy scheming !
GM is to let its dealers know its fate by the end of the week General Motors going into bankruptcy protection was looking more likely , the firm 's chief executive has said .
Fritz Henderson added the task to avoid the measure was " large " - with his comments sending GM shares down 10 % .
The US government has given GM a deadline of 1 June to restructure the business successfully if it wishes to gain more emergency loans .
GM has already warned it will probably need to enter bankruptcy protection if it cannot get the additional funding .
" Certainly the task that we have in front of us is large , " Mr Henderson said , but added that there was " still an opportunity and still a chance for it to be done outside of a court process . "
GM is continuing plans to close 2,600 of its 6,246 US dealerships - with a reduction in the network part of major cost - cutting plans at the firm , which hopes to reduce its $ 44bn ( £ 29 bn ) debt mountain .
It has also not ruled out moving its base from Detroit .
Opel issue Earlier Mr Henderson reiterated that the firm was in " urgent need of funding " , despite having already been given $ 15bn in loans from the government since December .
Last month , General Motors confirmed that it would be cutting 21,000 jobs worldwide and shutting a number of factories in an effort to stay in business .
As part of the plan , GM is selling a number of its brands - Hummer , Saturn and Saab - and scrapping Pontiac entirely .
It is also in talks to sell its GM Europe business , which comprises Opel , Vauxhall and Saab .
Fiat is the front - runner to take over Opel and Vauxhall , although a number of stumbling blocks are emerging - not least from trade unions and governments , who fear any such tie - up could mothball a number of factories and cost thousands of jobs around the continent .
' Integral part ' Commenting on the prospect of Fiat taking over Opel and Vauxhall in Europe , and any resulting plant closures , Mr Henderson praised Vauxhall 's plants in the UK for their " superb work " , which he said was " an integral and a crucial part of the business " .
He added , though , that he could not stipulate what any new investor in GM Europe would do with the factories .
The Canadian component manufacturer Magna is also in talks to take a substantial stake in GM Europe , and the BBC has learned that the Chinese car company SAIC is also negotiating with GM .
GM has said that while it would surrender control to a new investor in GM Europe , it would like to retain a stake in the business .
Back in the US , GM said it was also in talks with two potential buyers for its Hummer brand .

With high - speed internet connections and BitTorrent now common , it 's easier than ever to download the most popular PC games ... illegally .
Publishers are fighting back against the pirates with increasingly strict copy protection .
Caught in the crossfire are legitimate paying customers : the PC gamers .
They are people who , generally speaking , are technically sophisticated enough to download illegally , but who choose to buy instead .
And they have started to revolt .
The Boston Tea Party of this particular revolution took place with the September 2008 launch of Will Wright 's highly anticipated Spore .
Wright is the legendary game designer behind the popular Sims series of games , and Spore was supposed to be his masterpiece .
The problem was that the game had to be activated online before it could be played .
The title could only be activated a limited number of times before the game shut down , which rankled customers with multiple computers .
( Imagine buying a CD that you could only play on a few stereos , and one starts to understand the anger . )
Even worse , the game installed a program called SecuRom that had the potential to change the behavior of other programs on the gamer 's system , and there was no disclosure of what the program was , what it did , or how to remove it .
Because of the unusually strong copy - protection , gamers fought back .
Amazon.com was filled with one - star reviews for the game , and many of the would - be buyers seemed to find the moral high ground in pirating the game instead of purchasing it legally .
After all , the pirated version was SecuRom - free , and could be used on any number of systems .
Downloading a cracked version of the game from a pirate stopped being something that felt a lot like stealing , and started to seem like plain common sense .
It was a way for gamers to keep their hard - drives free of a program that looked suspiciously like malware .
Electronic Arts , Spore 's publisher , had pulled out the big guns in an attempt to protect its massive , estimated $ 35 million investment from pirates , and ended up alienating the people who support the company : its customers .
Other gaming executives have gotten the message , too .
" What really miffs gamers is when they purchase games legitimately and are then made to feel like pirates through excessive or invasive DRM measures , " says Ron Pessner , general manager in Microsoft 's Interactive Entertainment Business .
Even the Federal government has taken notice .
The Federal Trade Commission recently held a summit in March of this year to explore the issue of digital rights management , and how it may be hurting consumers .
" We 're at an important crossroads ; one which will define ownership , use and even fair use going forward , " says Hal Halpin , president of the Entertainment Consumers Association .
" That software publishers and developers are aware of the rising tide of discontent regarding intrusive DRM is n't a good thing , it 's a great thing . "
Halpin , lobbying for the gamer at the FTC summit , argued that publishers should be required to disclose the level of DRM on the game 's packaging .
That way , everyone is aware of how invasive or benign the copy protection added to the game will be upon installation .
Even if the FTC does n't take up the proposal , the issue has gained a lot of traction in the video game press .
Since Spore , the inclusion of a program like SecuROM in a new video game is so controversial that it 's nearly a story unto itself .
Nearly lost in all the hoopla over SecuRom and install limits is the larger issue : how much damage is piracy really doing to the gaming industry ?
We will never know if without SecuRom and the subsequent buyer revolt Spore would have been a larger success , but it 's worth looking at numbers for the industry as a whole .
According to the PC Gaming Alliance the size of the PC Gaming industry in 2008 was $ 11 billion dollars in sales worldwide .
That 's roughly equal to the console market , where piracy is extremely rare .
( Typically pirating a console game requires physically modifying game hardware , or buying third - party add - ons for consoles or portables . )
While it impossible to know how big the industry would be without piracy , numbers like these suggest that piracy may be a non-issue .
One thing is for sure , the PC gaming industry is remarkbly healthy ... unless they manage to alienate those who keep the business alive : the customers .
Online giving is steadily becoming a major part of any nonprofit 's fundraising campaign .
But it 's not just about slapping a donation button up and calling it a day .
What are ways to improve your online giving ?
Here are my top five : I 've seen so many donations pages on nonprofit websites that are hard to navigate and down right confusing .
If it 's difficult to donate , then people wo n't go through with it .
Having a clear and concise page will make it easier for people to donate .
It 's important to examine your process with online donors and ensure it 's up to snuff .
Are you thanking them in a timely manner ?
Do they get an e-receipt or do you have to mail it to them ?
Making it quick and easy will encourage people to donate again .
Just having the page up there is n't going to magically bring in donors .
Make sure your promote online giving in your brochures , direct mail campaigns and more .
Email campaigns are a great way to improve your online giving .
Even if it 's just a short note to your donors telling them of an event or sharing program news .
Linking back to your donations page will help improve your online giving .
There 's been a lot of buzz about social media and whether it works for nonprofits or not .
I think there is potential in social media for nonprofits , but only if they use it to truly connect with their donors .
Try raising online funds through Twitter or Facebook .
This will improve your web presence and drive traffic to your site .
I doubt direct mail will ever go away , but as more and more people turn to online giving , it 's important that you be prepared for them .
The apparent subject of the poem is familiar : the romantic fascination that older men have for younger women — a favorite of poets for centuries .
Seidel ’s take on such couplings —
“ It ’s almost incest when it gets to this ” — is as novel as it is harsh , even if the line ’s iambic pentameter is sweet .
So much of your susceptibility to Seidel ’s poetry depends upon how you receive — or are repelled by — such loaded lines .
And “ incest ” is n’t even the half of it , only the base camp from which “ Climbing Everest ” begins its priapic ascent to an even more perilous view .
For the title , we come to understand , is a metaphor for the sexual act the poem goes on to detail , in which an old man makes the deliriously pleasurable but nonetheless arduous and by all rights deadly trip into seductively thin , late - life sexual air .
When the poet reaches that summit , he pays the price , reduced to being “ constantly out of breath . . . reporting to the world from an oxygen tent . ”
The poet ’s mind makes its weary march to the exit music of the poem ’s final lines :
A naked woman my age is just a total nightmare ,
But right now one is coming through the door
With a mop , to mop up the cow ﬂops on the floor .
She kisses the train wreck in the tent and combs his white hair .
“ Those lines caused a great ruckus , ” Seidel told me during dinner , ruefully .
“ I got lots of extraordinarily unpleasant mail . ”
At first , it would seem easy to understand why .
In a poem that features an old man having sex with a very young woman , so frank a statement as “ A naked woman my age is just a total nightmare ” could seem uncomplicatedly cruel , could seem merely cruel .
And yet , aging is a nightmare , totally so , a nightmare from which each of us — when we become , inevitably , “ the train wreck ” the poet has by poem ’s end — would only too gladly awake .
Seen in this light , Seidel ’s line , and the larger poem it serves , presents , with utter candor , the nightmarishness of bodily descent and responds , with honest disgust , to the indignity of that decline .
As may be said of so many of Seidel ’s poems , “ Climbing Everest ” produces not relief from experience nor reassurance about experience but — in all its complexity — experience itself .
“ When he mentions East Hampton or the Carlyle or Le Cirque or Ducati , ” the former poet laureate Billy Collins told me , “ it does n’t even seem like name - dropping .
He does what every exciting poet must do : avoid writing what everyone thinks of as ‘ poetry . ’ ” Collins ’s quotation marks around “ poetry ” are the keys that begin to unlock Seidel ’s art .
As Lorin Stein , an editor at Seidel ’s publishing house , Farrar , Straus & Giroux , and a friend of Seidel ’s , explained recently , Seidel ’s qualities as a poet are in direct opposition to the poetry of many of his peers .
“ A lot of ways that people gin themselves up to write poetry nowadays require a setting aside of certain crass realities , ” Stein said .
“ Crass realities of everyday colloquial communication ; crass realities of money and power and sex ; crass realities of the ‘ I ’ in its filthier manifestations .
A lot of contemporary poetry has manufactured these great machines for avoiding coarseness — the dream of an escape . ”
That Seidel ’s poems embrace the crassness at the heart of modern living makes him sound a good deal more like a novelist in the 19th - century mode — Stendhal and his mirror walking down the street reflecting modern life .
And novelists are among Seidel ’s most articulate advocates .
Norman Rush recognizes how Seidel ’s choices can be misunderstood : “ The risks Seidel takes have to do with threatening the potential affection of new readers .
They may see him as a ‘ swell ’ and take that presentation as reason enough not to be interested in what he ’s doing .
He does n’t cozen the reader .
But if you persist , the power and profundity of Seidel ’s games , and his nerve , will get you — draw you into the extremely complex set of experiences that he ’s laid out for you to have . ”
“ I GREW UP , ” SEIDEL TOLD ME one weirdly warm December afternoon at a diner on upper Broadway near where he lives , “ with very large beautifully dark blue trucks with very chaste excellent elegant white lettering saying seidel everywhere you went . ”
This was in what Seidel describes as the “ fierce cold ” and “ hothouse green sweetness ” of the St. Louis of his birth , in 1936 .
The trucks of the flourishing family business distributed coal and , in summer , ice to white and black families and businesses in the segregated city .
Seidel ’s father and uncle ran the business started by their father , Seidel ’s grandfather , a Russian - Jewish émigré .
The Seidels lived well .
There were maids , a cook .
In that privileged atmosphere , Seidel did not want but , very early , came to know what he wanted — and did n’t .
“ I was thought by my cranky violin teacher ” — a first violinist of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra — “ to be the future , his future . ”
But when Seidel was 11 , he abandoned the instrument in disgust .
“ I arrived for my lesson and found seated there a kid named John Perkins , a little older than me and well known in St. Louis as an enormously gifted composer and piano player — a genius .
My teacher had asked Perkins to come round without having asked me if it were appropriate .
And I was just enraged , to the point of tears .
I remember the magnification of a tear on my violin , the grain on the fiddle enlarged as I looked down at it .
And of course what was appalling about finding Perkins there was also heartbreaking because what he was doing was showing me off . ”
This was not the last occasion when Seidel would bridle at not having a hand in how he was presented to the world .
‘’ When I was asked if I wanted to be Bar Mitzvahed , I was promised that if I did it , two things would come my way , ” Seidel explained .
“ One , I would learn Hebrew — that turned out not to be true — and two , that the speech of the coming of age that I would give I would be able to write and deliver , all on my own .
That also turned out to be untrue .
There was an enormous and seriously unpleasant struggle between me and the rabbi , in my considerable bitterness and disappointment over learning that the guy wanted me to deliver a speech of nothingness .
So I refused .
Everybody having been invited , I said I was terribly sorry , I was n’t going through with it .
In the end I gave in .
I gave some meaningless speech — part his , part mine .
And that was it for religion . ”
In the autumn before his Bar Mitzvah , the 12 - year - old made a discovery .
In the Oct. 25 , 1948 , issue of Time , Seidel saw a review of Ezra Pound ’s long poem “ The Cantos . ”
The unsigned article offers little enduring interest as journalism but provided Seidel with his first exposure to Pound ’s verse , lines of which the review quoted , including some from “ The Pisan Cantos , ” written while Pound was detained in Italy by the U.S. Army during World War II :
What thou lovest well remains ,
the rest is dross
What thou lov’st well shall not be reft from thee
What thou lov’st well is thy true heritage
So , here ’s the thing .
Back when 4E first came out , one of my friends and I had a conversation about the builds they present for each character class .
He was talking about optimal builds for individual classes , and I was talking about options for creating the kind of character you want to play .
We had a bit of a disconnect over the issue , because we were coming from two different sets of assumptions , and were n’t really talking about the same things at all when we talked about building characters .
He was coming from a World of Warcraft mindset , where there is * a right way and a wrong way to build a character that works in the system .
I was coming at it from a tabletop game mindset , where there is n’t a right way and a wrong way to build a character as long as it fits with your concept .
One of the words my buddy would throw around was “ optimized ” and it ’s various forms .
“ I ’m trying to optimize my fighter , ” he would say .
“ Optimize for what ? ” I ’d ask .
He ’d blink at me , and say , “ Optimize him for being a fighter . ”
I ’d blink at him , and say , “ He ’s already a fighter . ”
And round we ’d go .
What he eventually bludgeoned into my skull was that , when he said “ optimize , ” he meant “ choose the correct build elements to be the best at what the role entails . ”
Which led me to ask , “ Well , what do you want him to do ? ”
“ I want him to be a good defender . ”
And we were off again .
These sorts of discussions have led me to do a lot of thinking about the way you build characters in 4E , and what things the game seems to encourage .
Roles
I was very leery about the idea of roles in 4E .
When people started talking about them online , I got nervous that they were going to be very restrictive , very rigid , and very limiting .
The idea that each class would be slotted into one of only four party roles sounded way too much like a video game , where the limitations of the medium lead to a narrowly - defined play experience .
I like my pen-and - paper RPGs to be open , and rollicking , and full of choice .
I like the rules to open up possibilities , not shut them down .
I want the character concept of the player , and not the design limitations of the rules , Â to shape the build of the character .
I did n’t want a bunch of cookie - cutter classes , where this class does exactly what that class does , but wears a different coloured hat .
So I was looking long and hard at the implementation of the roles in the PHB when it came out .
And it turns out I did n’t find them limiting at all .
The thing that I discovered about the roles in play is that they are a useful starting point for your character .
Each character tends to spread out from the primary role into at least one secondary role as they develop , which really increases the variety in characters of the same class .
The PHB2 acknowledges this head on in the class write - ups , talking about which secondary roles the individual classes will fulfill the easiest .
For example , in my Storm Point game , I ’veÂ got a fighter , a rogue , a cleric , a warlord , a ranger , and a swordmage .
That ’s two defenders , two leaders , and two strikers .
But the fighter has concentrated on powers that let him move his opponents around the battlefield , giving him a strong secondary role as controller .
The other defender , the swordmage , concentrates on movement and damage , giving him aspects of the striker .
The cleric is doing his best to double as a striker , and the warlord , ranger , and rogue make good secondary defenders .
Now , the fighter is still best at his defender role – he gets up close and personal with the biggest , baddest enemy and whups it back and forth all over the battlefield , keeping it tied up and focused on him .
He does n’t do a lot of damage , and he does n’t handle large numbers of enemies as well as a wizard would , but he ’s got that monkey wrench ability that controllers have .
The rogue easily dishes out more damage , but he tends to fall down a lot more if he gets caught in melee .
That ’s just within one group of six players .
The flexibility of the roles , and the way characters can be built to fulfill a secondary role ** makes for a great deal of player choice and variety .
And that ’s not even getting into multiclassing .
So , like I said , the roles are a starting point , a place to begin with character creation , and it ’s useful to understand what each one does .
One of my worries , way back before the game was released , was that , with roles , I would n’t be able to play the swashbuckling fighter who relied on his agility and his rapier .
And really , you can ’t , using the fighter class .
But if I look at the roles , I see that this concept fits the idea of the striker better than the defender , so I build the same character using the rogue class .
It ’s a new way of thinking about it for me , but I ’ve come to really like the idea of the roles .
And the juxtaposition of role with power source gives a great way to differentiate between different classes that fulfill the same roll .
The fighter and the swordmage are both defenders , but they play very differently .
They feel very different .
Even two arcane strikers , the warlock and the sorcerer , have a very different flavour .
And that ’s all to the good .
Builds
Each character class offers a couple of builds for that class , listing feats , powers , class features , etc. that reinforce the idea of the build .
I think that , as examples , they are very good for giving people ideas of what can be done with the different classes , and getting people to think about some of the synergies and combinations among the feats , powers , and features .
I do n’t think they were presented very well , though .
In the class write - ups , the builds are presented in such a way as to make them seem like the only possibilities for that character class .
You have to look in a section headed Â
Creating a CharacterÂ on page 52 of the PHB to actually see them explain that the builds are only suggestions , that they ’re not meant to be a constraint , and that you do n’t have to choose one .
With the experienced players in my Storm Point game , this was n’t an issue .
They tend to ignore anything that says they can’t create the kind of character they want , so the builds were viewed as suggestions or starting points only .
Which is what they are .
In my other game , which started off as Scales of War , I had a number of newer players .
If I had n’t been careful to explain that they did n’t have to follow the build recommendations , they would have , and may have felt limited by it .
Just looking at powers alone , if a class has 4 At - Will , 4 Encounter , and 4 Daily powers available at first level , that ’s 96 possible combinations at first level .
Ninety - six .
Not two .
And then you have to factor in class features , feats , race , skills , weapon choice …
Do n’t get me wrong .
I think including the builds was a good idea to help people get started with the new rules .
But I think that they would have been better handled if they were done like the examples of adventurers from the various races – illustrations of the kinds of things you can do as a fighter , cleric , wizard , whatever .
Which brings us to …
Optimization
How do you optimize a character ?
Well , what do you want your character to do ?
There are a number of optimization threads on the official Wizards of the Coast message boards .
Â
These talk in detail about how to build the “ best ” fighter , or cleric , or what have you .
They focus primarily on powers and feats that reinforce each other in order to provide synergies and compiled benefits .
What I like about these threads is that they have a multitude of different ideas for a given class .
They have acknowledged and embraced the idea that there is no one right way to build a fighter ; it all depends on what you want the fighter to do .
What I do n’t like about these threads is not a problem with the threads , but a problem with the basics of the game design and the assumptions behind it .
I ’m going off on a little tangent here , so bear with me .
The majority of rules pertaining to characters are combat - oriented .
Most of the 4E rules revolve around combat .
The default assumption of the game is combat .
This is not necessarily a bad thing , but the focus is , sometimes , a little too narrow .
At this point , the primary non -combat resources your character has are skills , which are chosen once and then just level up with you , and rituals , which get a little more involved but are restricted to those with the Ritual Caster feat .
Powers and most feats are focused entirely on combat , and the majority of magic items are , as well .
This means that most of the optimization threads are based on optimizing your character to do something well in combat .
There is n’t a lot you can do to focus and specialize your character in non-combat abilities .
And that , I think , is a limitation .
Sure , the primary activity in the default D&D game is combat against monsters .
And sure , you want your character to be able to hold his or her own in a fight , and pull out some cool tricks .
And 4E does the cool tricks so very well .
But I miss the ability to build a character with a focus elsewhere .
This is my idea of optimization – being able to craft the abilities of the character to fit with the concept you have for the character .
Now , I know you do n’t need a lot of rules for the roleplaying bits of the game , and the skill challenge rules add some structure ( and a consummate reward ) to non-combat situations , but there just are n’t a lot of choices for characters to make among the feats , powers , and class features that apply outside of combat .
At least , not compared to the combat choices .
Anyway .
That ’s the problem I have with the optimization threads .
Having said that , I think that optimization really starts with having a clear concept of what you want your character to be .
A strong concept that you keep in mind can inform each of your choices , whether for power or feat or whatever , and help make the character more of what you want .
The ideal character for you may not be the one that does the most damage , or has the best AC , or the most fire spells .
It may be the one with the broadest range of different kinds of abilities , or with the strange weapon choice , or the most spoken languages .
Optimization means making the character fit what you want it to be , sometimes in spite of lack of support from the rules .
So , What ’s Your Point ?
My point is that , despite the fact that I really like 4E , on the surface it can lean a bit too much towards a combat system / MMORPG feel than I generally prefer in a game system .
I find it ’s important for me to keep in mind that the game is not what ’s in the rulebooks : the game is what happens at the table .
Rulebooks can have a huge influence on that , but the responsibility for what the game is ultimately lies with those of us who play it .
I find that I can do all the things I like to do in 4E .
If some of it is n’t as supported by the rules as I might like , well , there are plenty of other things that make me happy about it .
And plenty of other games to play for a change of pace .
When it comes to making characters , the rules should help you bring the concept in your mind to life .
Every ruleset has some sorts of restrictions that can prevent you from perfectly fulfilling your ideal , and 4E is no different in that respect .
It offers a wide range of choices and customizability in the area of the game that gets the most development in the rules *** , and does n’t completely ignore the areas that were not the developers ’ focus .
But your character is your responsibility .
Your fun is your responsibility .
Come up with a character you want to play , and then find the rules that let you do it .
Take all the advice you can get , but ignore anyone who says you are n’t doing it right .
Have fun playing , or you ’re doing it wrong .
Â
Â
* As I understand it , anyway .
I do n’t play WoW .
I have nothing against it , but I have enough trouble trying to fit all my other hobbies into my life .
** Maybe even a tertiary one ?
I dunno .
I ’m going to be watching for it as the game goes on .
*** I.E. Combat .
This makes sense , as it is a central aspect of the game , and one of the more slippery elements that benefits from extensive , detailed rules .
4E does a good job of building rules that help cover a variety of situations and encourage cinematic , exciting fantasy combat .

THE wheel of fortune turns swiftly in politics .
Gordon Brown pulled off the G20 meeting in London on April 2nd , emerging with a plausible aura of global statesmanship .
After a handful of Labour sleaze stories and a misguided statement on YouTube , the prime minister looked more like Richard Nixon : shifty , angry and with a list of enemies to smear .
And that was before a downright dishonest budget on April 22nd .
The budget was a crucial one , for two reasons .
First , Mr Brown is running out of time — he has to hold an election by June 2010 — and Britain seems increasingly fed up with him .
The public regards his party with distaste ( see article ) .
That 's partly because a dozen years in power tends to tarnish : when the home secretary 's husband charges the taxpayer for the porn he watches , one gets an inkling that a government 's time is up .
But it 's also because of Mr Brown 's character .
His strength , which the G20 meeting displayed , is dour pragmatism .
Too often , though , he resorts to tribal politics , in a way that seems both scheming and incompetent .
Second , the budget marks the government 's attempts to deal with the fiscal consequences of the worst slowdown since the second world war .
Mr Brown is partly to blame for this mess , but crisis management should have played to his strengths ; instead , it revealed his worst side .
The eye - watering figures
The budget presented a statistical snapshot of the gruesome shape in which Britain now finds itself ( see article ) .
Gone are the days when quarters of growth succeeded each other nose to tail and national debt was limited by a fiscal rule to 40 % of GDP .
Even the Treasury now expects the economy to contract by 3.5 % in the financial year beginning this April .
That , bad as it seems , is better than many countries ( Japan or Germany , for example ) can look forward to , as our accompanying leader makes clear .
Sterling 's fall and Britain 's relatively low dependence on manufacturing exports are the main reasons .
Britain 's public finances , however , are on some measures the worst of any rich country .
It is likely to have a bigger deficit in 2010 , as a percentage of GDP , than even the likes of Italy .
With the financial heart shot out of the economy , tax revenues have fallen dramatically just as social spending has increased .
That is unavoidable ; but the government 's heavy borrowing , even before recession hit , was not .
Now Mr Brown needs to tap the markets for £ 175 billion ( $ 254 billion ) in the current fiscal year and the same the year after .
In last year 's budget , public net debt was expected to be 39 % of GDP this year ; now it is put at 59 % , and likely to increase to 79 % by 2013 - 14 .
This outcome would push Britain only to the middle of the rich - country pack .
But the rapid increase in borrowing is eye - watering .
Given these constraints , the budget was never going to be pretty .
Alistair Darling , Mr Brown 's chancellor of the exchequer , looked a harried man as he made what is usually a grip - and - grin sprint to the House of Commons , brandishing the budget in Gladstone 's red box .
He had to reassure potential creditors that the government had a plan for tightening fiscal policy in the medium term , while convincing voters that any such austerity would not wallop them personally or at once .
A hard job , not least because he could not blame his predecessor for the mess ; but one in which candour , above all , was necessary .
Instead came two all - too - political sleights of hand : a string of over - optimistic economic assumptions and the misleading message that soaking the rich could absolve the other 98 % of the population from personal sacrifice .
The fiscal plans are like one of those childish excuses that begin with a little exaggeration and morph into outright falsehood .
The theoretical commitment to cut the growth of current spending to 0.7 % a year from 2011 - 12 is to be implemented only after the election ; it also relies a lot on the familiar hogwash of “ efficiency savings ” .
It would be unworldly to expect a government on the eve of an election to be explicit about its intended cuts , and the depths of a recession are not the place to wield the axe anyway .
What is really galling is that , in order to make the deficit shrink , the Treasury assumes that the economy will start growing again at the end of this year and expand by 3.5 % in 2011 .
This “ trampoline recovery ” , as the Tories called it , is a far more optimistic view than either the IMF or most private - sector economists take .
No prudent prime minister would have allowed it .
The second fiction is that squeezing the rich can absolve the rank and file from privation ( other than dearer fuel , tobacco and drink ) .
Mr Darling and Mr Brown propose raising the top rate of tax from 40 % to 50 % next year ( they had already mooted a rise to 45 % from 2011 - 12 ) on those with incomes over £ 150,000 and a couple of other bash - the - rich measures .
This will irritate the 1 - 2 % of taxpayers affected ; but it will hardly solve the problem .
That will require broader , more painful measures in the medium term : higher taxes for all , tougher spending cuts , or a bit of both .
Do n't quit the centre
This must seem like clever politics to Mr Brown and his crew : folk have been inflamed by the greed and grubbiness of bailed - out bankers .
In the short run , a bit of class war may work .
But , like Nixon , Mr Brown is already struggling to escape the suspicion that he has a grudge against the world .
And for every voter who likes the idea of soaking the rich , there may be several who remember that Labour pledged at the last election not to raise tax rates during the life of this parliament .
In turning his back on the revolution in thinking that brought New Labour to power in 1997 — that even though few Britons were very rich , many aspired to be —
Mr Brown may be quitting the hard - won centre ground too soon .
The entrepreneurial classes are now surely the Tories ' for the taking .
April offered Mr Brown two shots at reviving his flagging premiership .
The G20 went well .
But by attempting to use the budget for political advantage rather than engaging the nation honestly in a slow , shared transformation , the prime minister has done neither himself nor his country any favours .
The public is losing patience with him , and so is this newspaper .
1 Airplane Graveyard ( Arizona , USA )
Meet the Bone Yard , near Davis Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson , Arizona .
For those of you that have never seen it , it ’s difficult to comprehend the size of it .
The number of aircraft stored there and the precision in the way they are parked is impressive .
Another important fact is that they are all capable of being returned to service if the need ever arises .
Both the museum and the Bone Yard are very popular attractions in the Arizona desert .
2 Train Graveyard ( Bolivia )
In southwest Bolivia lies a place where it looks as if all the country ’s ailing old locomotives have rolled into the wilderness to chug their last chugs – or been struck dead on the spot at the hand of the evil stationmaster in the Earth ’s furnace .
This gigantic train graveyard – chock - full of the hollow husks and skeletal remains of long forsaken steam engines – is situated on the deserted outskirts of the small trading post of Uyuni , high in the Andean plane some 3,670 m above sea level .
3 Ship Graveyard ( Mauritania )
The city of Nouadhibou is the second largest city in Mauritania , and the location of one of the largest ship graveyard in the world .
Hundreds of rusting ships can be seen all around , in the water , and on beaches .
This phenomenon started in the 80’s after the nationalization of the Mauritanian fishing industry , numerous uneconomical ships were simply abandoned there .
Foreign ship owners later found very convenient to get rid of their old vessels in the bay .
4 Soviet Tank Graveyard ( Afghanistan )
On the outskirts of Kabul , Afghanistan there ’s a massive collection of abandoned Soviet battle vehicles left behind after the failure of a massive eastern bloc military occupation of the country in the 1970 ’s and 1980’s .
The Soviets left in a hurry and could n’t be bothered to find a way to get broken - down tanks back home , so now they sit , partially stripped and covered in graffiti .
Afghanistan has few recycling facilities , so this cemetery of tanks will likely remain where it is for many more years as a reminder of the Russian invasion .
5 Anchor Graveyard ( Portugal )
Among the dunes of Tavira island , in Portugal , there ’s an impressive called the Cemitério das Âncoras ( The Anchor Graveyard ) .
It was built in remembrence of the glorious tradition of tuna fishing with large nets ( “ armações de atum ” ) fixed with these anchors , a fishing technique already invented by the Phoenicians .
Tavira used to be a place devoted to the tuna fishing .
They built up this anchor graveyard to remember those who had to quit their occupation when the big fish abandoned the coasts .
6 Vending Machine Graveyard ( Japan )
Located in Tamamura , Gunma - ken , Japan , this vending machine graveyard remind us what an environmental problem they are , because of the amount of power devoted to keeping them brightly lit and cold / hot 24 hours a day .
7 War Graveyard ( Eritrea )
In Asmara - an important city of Eritrea - a huge graveyard of wrecked military tanks , armoured vehicles and other relics of war , captured by the Eritreans or left behind by the Dergue from Ethiopia while evacuating Eritrea .
“ We keep this place as a reminder , ” says Peter from the Department of Tourism .
We walk through the masses of mostly Russian vehicles , tanks and piles of spent shells .
In a normal country this place would be a scrap metal merchant ’s dream , but here in Eritrea it remains as a symbol of pride and victory over Ethiopia .
8 Soviet Car Graveyard ( Russia )
Meet the Soviet Car Graveyard .
Most of these cars are very rare nowadays on Russian streets and were a subject to a great desire to a few generations of Soviet people , almost deprived of the right to have a car .
Now they stay there as a silent monument in far - away countryside to the Soviet era and it ’s style of life .
Maybe on some of these cars Stalin or Brezhnev drove across the streets of Moscow .
First of all , the place was packed .
The Representatives Hall was filled nearly to capacity , with probably 300 + attendees , pro and con .
When I first arrived , the white " One Marriage / One Man + One Woman " stickers seemed to be everywhere ...
... but maybe there was a rally elsewhere , because by the time the hearing actually started , green " Support Marriage Equality " stickers had caught up and even may have outnumbered the white ones .
Signs had to be left outside , though a few people snuck theirs in -- only to be confiscated when they first appeared .
The chairwoman of the committee brought the session to order and announced that speakers would be limited to three minutes due to the number of people who wished to speak .
She then introduced the primary sponsor of the bill , Rep. Jim Splaine , a man in his early sixties ( - ish ? ) who described being forced " to hide deep in the closet " because he had first been elected Representative when he could have been arrested for simply being gay ...
-- and right as he was winding up , three or four loud voices yelled " TIME'S UP ! " and " TIME ! "
It was just the first hint of the vitriol that peeped out occasionally the entire hearing .
The chairwoman gavelled them down and threatened them with ejection , granting a bit of courtesy time to Rep.
Splaine as the sponsor of the bill .
After that , speakers pro and con alternated .
Many of the arguments are those you might expect -- including at least one that left spittle on the microphone -- but a few were surprises .
Among the speakers was the lead counsel for the New Jersey facility which refused service to a same - sex couple which was referenced in the NOM ad .
His arguments were along the lines of " think what a domino effect this will have : you wo n't be able to discriminate here , or there , or anywhere else for that matter " -- ca n't remember the exact items he cited , but housing was among them .
Several members of the clergy got up to speak , some on each side .
I got to meet Bishop Gene Robinson after he spoke ; that was a real pleasure ( a fairly short guy with a 10 foot tall personality -- he seems like he would be a great guy to get to know better . )
Several people rose to speak on behalf of gay or lesbian family members .
I particularly remember one red - haired college - age girl who said she could not imagine any heterosexual parents being better at raising children than her lesbian older sister , who apparently had brought her up .
One woman got up to say she had two children , " one of each -- not one boy and one girl , but one straight daughter and one lesbian daughter , " and were they supposed to want something for the one child that could not be given to the other ?
Anyway ... after listening for a couple of hours I had to leave , but I penned some written testimony and handed it in based on what I had seen so far .
I was n't planning to , but it seemed like an important point to make , and is actually the point of this diary ( for which I apologize for taking so long to get to ) , so I reproduce it here , as closely as I can remember :
Dear Legislators ;
I 've never written testimony before , give me a break . :D
I was not planning to submit testimony today but what I have seen here changed my mind .
I expected to see all the standard arguments , to which I am sure you 've heard the counterarguments : Separation of Church and State requires that any law motivated by " it 's God 's Law " either not be passed or be revoked as soon as it is identified .
I , a heterosexual , am shamed and demeaned by any privilege I gain by that status which is not generally available to all people .
There are no laws preventing marriage for the infertile or the elderly , nor laws against divorce of couples with children .
" Tradition " would require we accept slaves and women as chattels and live in caves .
If this legal change requires extra work to change the law and the land , then we should do it !
Because this is how we will expose unwitting discrimination .
But instead of making these arguments I want to draw your attention to something I saw today .
One side of this discussion spoke of fear of change , fear of the unknown , of order through stagnation , of distrust and ( at least ) distaste of a part of our citizenry they regard as second class .
The other side of this discussion spoke of ethics , and joy , and love .
I know which side of this discussion I want to be on .
I urge your support of H.B. 436 .
Thank you .
Update : Rec'd !
Thanks .
While teabaggers make good targets , a steady diet of mockery is tiring .
Andrew McLaughlin , Google ’s head of global public policy , is leaving the company to join the Obama administration , according to two people with knowledge of Mr. McLaughlin ’s plans .
Mr. McLaughlin will be deputy chief technology officer , reporting to Aneesh Chopra , the chief technology officer , who was previously Virginia ’s secretary of technology , said these people , who agreed to speak only if their names were not used because Mr. McLaughlin ’s appointment had not been announced .
Mr. McLaughlin ’s move is likely to renew concerns among some Google rivals and public policy groups about Google ’s growing clout in Washington .
A Google spokesman confirmed that Mr. McLaughlin was leaving the company .
Mr. McLaughlin did not immediately respond to an e-mail message seeking comment .
An e-mail message to the White House press office was not immediately answered .
Mr. McLaughlin joined Google about five years ago and directed the company ’s public policy efforts .
Previously he was an executive at the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers , a nonprofit group that helps coordinate the Internet ’s address system .
He is an emeritus fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard , and was part of Mr. Obama ’s transition team as a member of the Technology , Innovation and Government Reform Policy Working Group .
Mr. McLaughlin is the latest Google executive to take an official role in the Obama administration .
Eric Schmidt , Google ’s chief executive , has been a close adviser to President Obama ’s transition team and is now a member of the President ’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology .
Katie Stanton , a former Google project manager , joined the White House as its director of citizen participation .
And Sonal Shah , former head of global development at Google.org , now heads the White House Office of Social Innovation .
Some critics fear that the growing presence of former Google employees in the administration could lead to purchasing and policy decisions that improperly benefit the company at a time when the company ’s power is likely to come under increasing scrutiny from regulators .
Already the Federal Trade Commission is looking into whether the ties between the boards of Google and Apple amount to a violation of antitrust laws .
The Justice Department is inquiring into the antitrust implications of Google ’s settlement of a lawsuit with publishers and authors .
In a statement , Google said : “ We understand that in order to be successful in Washington we need relationships on both sides of the aisle , and we have worked over the past few years to strengthen those relationships .
As for a small handful of Googlers leaving the company to join the administration , we respect their decision to work in public service and wish them all the best in their new and exciting jobs . ”
Since there is a current and hot debate over a new law that ’s about to be passed in Germany and a highly successful online petition against that law , I thought it might be a good idea to do a summary in english for non-german bloggers and journalists .
I chose an easy way to this :
By publishing the transcript of an email conversation .
And yes , I do have permission to do so .
Hey , what ’s going on with that child porn debate over there in Germany ?
The German government wants to pass a new law that ’s supposed to stop child porn ( that ’s what they call it , I prefer to call it sexual child abuse ) on the web by blocking those sites for internet users in Germany .
The sites , that are to be redirected to a stop sign put up by internet access providers , are gathered on a list that ’s exclusively maintained by the BKA ( German Federal Criminal Police Office ) .
But what ’s wrong with stopping child abuse ?
Absolutely nothing , of course .
It ’s just that the filters wo n’t stop or constrain crimes , they wo n’t even really stop the accessibility of the documentation of it .
The government plans on using DNS blocks , which are easily bypassed .
At the same time , implementing the blocks will give criminals an early warning :
They will be the first to notice that their site is blocked and will have enough time to change servers .
What do you suggest instead ?
I , amongst many , many others who are better experts than I am , suggest taking sites showing sexual abuse down and off the net and prosecuting the originators instead of just making them invisible to some .
After all , sexual child abuse and the documentation of it fortunately already is prohibited , not only in Germany , but in most parts of the world .
The German government , most notably Ursula von der Leyen , who ’s our Minister for Family Affairs and who leads the public communication of the bill , implies that you constantly stumble upon sexual child abuse while surfing the ’net and that you ’re also in danger of getting „ hooked “ to it if you do so .
This is pretty outrageous , I think .
Fortunately , I never came across sexual child abuse one single time in 20 years of using the internet .
And if I did get across it , you can be sure I ’d call the authorities .
It would be great to have something like an official email address or web site for reporting possible crimes on the internet , but that ’s not part of the current plan , as far as I know .
Oh , and did I mention that the IPs of users who visit a blocked site will be stored by the access provider who is obliged to transfer those IPs to the BKA if they require so ?
Wait a second , that ’s a little scary .
What if I got fooled onto a site ?
After all , ads keep popping up in my browser and I certainly never entered their address .
Exactly .
There ’s also browsers who pre-fetch links .
So anyone could get really nasty by putting hidden links to illegal sites up and suddenly we ’re all criminals without knowing it .
And without being it , in the first place .
But still … it might not be perfect , but at least they ’re doing something , right ?
I seriously doubt that the real reason for the law is the fight against child abuse .
Why ’s that ?
If this was really about child abuse , they ’d start where it happens in most cases :
In families .
They ’d also give the police much better equipment and more people to work with .
They ’d give tools to the public to make it easier for us to report abuse or other crimes on the net .
And :
There ’s already a rising demand by lobbyist groups from the entertainment or gambling industry for putting sites up on the list that have nothing to do with child abuse whatsoever .
The system is one for controlling content on the internet , it is a system making censorship possible .
That ’s very appealing to some groups who can put a lot of pressure on the government .
But if the government keeps its promise ?
And only uses the lists for sites showing child abuse ?
There ’s an oxymoron in your first sentence .
LOL , okay :
What if they do not misuse the list ?
As long as there ’s no way of making sure , I doubt that they will not give in to other demands .
Usually , democracy has , in general , pretty effective ways of dealing with crimes .
There ’s the police .
There ’s courts .
There ’s lawyers and district attorneys .
In this case , those processes and correctives are bypassed .
So we ’ll never know what ’s really happening on those lists .
Until they leak , that is : Lists from other countries using systems like the one we ’re talking about have already leaked .
And it showed that only a small percentage of the sites on the lists were indeed illegal .
Instead , gay sites , political sites , art sites and others were on those list and of course nobody knew how and why they got there .
I imagine it being really difficult ( and expensive ) getting off the list if you accidentally got on it , and the law does n’t state solutions to such problems .
Hm .
It all sounds very complicated .
Yes , it is .
That ’s why I blame the government for taking the easy route by communicating the topic on a pretty cursory level and not answering to criticism .
They also published figures that have long been exposed as being wrong or unproven and they never corrected or explained those numbers .
I mean , everybody who ’s remotely human is concerned about rape , sexual child abuse or any abuse of people for that matter , and everybody must speak and act up against such crimes .
I support the government in putting the topic , which is a social one , after all , on the agenda .
I oppose sexual child abuse on the internet or anywhere , so I ask the government to fight the sources of those crimes and take down the sites .
Because I neither want censorship tools to be implemented by law and I believe that they wo n’t help crime victims or crime prevention .
I understand .
So what can you do ?
There ’s an online petition against the law that has already been signed by nearly 80.000 people .
It ’s the fastest growing online petition since they installed the petition system .
That may be why there ’s a growing media interest in more facts and the criticism against the law .
If you understand some German , check these current links :
ZEIT Online
WELT Online
And one of the best articles about this whole topic , also in german , was published by c’t .
" WASHINGTON — Torture is an impermissible evil .
Except under two circumstances .
The first is the ticking time bomb .
An innocent ’s life is at stake .
The bad guy you have captured possesses information that could save this life .
He refuses to divulge .
In such a case , the choice is easy .
Even John McCain , the most admirable and estimable torture opponent , says openly that in such circumstances , “ You do what you have to do . ”
And then take the responsibility .
Some people , however , believe you never torture .
Ever .
They are akin to conscientious objectors who will never fight in any war under any circumstances , and for whom we correctly show respect by exempting from war duty .
But we would never make one of them Centcom commander .
Private principles are fine , but you do n’t entrust such a person with the military decisions upon which hinges the safety of the nation .
It is similarly imprudent to have a person who would abjure torture in all circumstances making national security decisions upon which depends the protection of 300 million countrymen .
The second exception to the no-torture rule is the extraction of information from a high - value enemy in possession of high - value information likely to save lives .
This case lacks the black - and - white clarity of the ticking time bomb scenario .
We know less about the length of the fuse or the nature of the next attack .
But we do know the danger is great .
We know we must act but have no idea where or how — and we ca n’t know that until we have information .
Catch - 22 .
Under those circumstances , you do what you have to do .
And that includes waterboarding . " -- Charles Krauthammer , Townhall.com .
So I got pelted with emails from the usual lunatics this weekend after making the mistake of saying on television that I thought the lawyers who greenlighted the waterboarding program should be prosecuted .
I ’m not going to delve into this too deeply , because this is clearly one of those issues that few people are willing to change their minds about , but I feel like I ’ve got to talk about one particular aspect of this debate , because it ’s just too crazy to let go .
Here ’s a snippet from one letter I got : “ What really gets me about liberals like you is that when other countries torture and kill our people , and cut off their heads , [ there 's ] not a peep from you .
But you dunk some terrorist ’s head underwater for a few minutes and you go all weepy . ”
I saw the same kind of thing in a letter from a guy named Robert Reeg to the New York Post this morning :
My chest was crushed in the collapse of 2 WTC .
If people think waterboarding is torture , they should try having their chest cracked while fully conscious .
I have n’t had a pain - free day since then , never mind the memories .
What outrages me most is the “ selective ” outrage .
No one complains when Americans are tortured and murdered .
Obviously Mr. Reeg suffered a terrible experience ; I would never make light of that .
What I do want to say is that there seems to be this idea that those of us who are against making torture an allowable practice in the U.S. are somehow condoning the behavior of those wacko / asshole religious extremists , that we ’re picking “ their side ” in the debate , like it ’s an either / or proposition or something .
I do n’t think I could count the number of times I ’ve had this argument on the campaign trail at Republican rallies :
ME : No , actually I ’m not even talking about whether torture works or not , although incidentally it does n’t .
I ’m just saying that no civilized society does it , and we probably should n’t either , so – ANGRY WHITE PERSON :
But what about what those monsters did to our boys in Fallujah ?
I suppose you ’re not outraged about that !
ME : ( perplexed )
Well , I — wait , what ?
Where the fuck do you get that from ?
ANGRY WHITE PERSON :
You ’re standing in front of me complaining about water - boarding !
It just follows that you ’re not outraged about what they did to our boys in Fallujah !
ME : ( scratching head , confused ) Um …
The thing is , we ’ve been listening to this stuff for so long that when we hear it , we do n’t recoil in confused disbelief anymore — we ’re so familiar with these arguments we ’ve forgotten that they do n’t make any sense .
It ’s similar to that other Bush - era standard : “ We fight them over there , so we do n’t have to fight them here . ”
I never understood what the hell that was all about .
The best I could figure is that the people who were saying this think of the world like a big Stratego game , and they think that if we commit a big force to some place like Iraq , the “ other side ” will have to leave all his forces over there or something to keep us from moving through Eurasia .
This might make sense in a real war , in a war - between - nations war , but it ’s completely absurd in a conflict where the “ other side ” is actually hundreds if not thousands of different / unrelated actors and can successfully attack a country like the U.S. using just a few people at a time .
Sending 160,000 troops to Iraq does absolutely nothing to prevent a terrorist group like al - Qaeda from sending over a couple of “ exchange students ” to dump botulinum toxin into the Akron reservoir .
Okay check that — it does nothing positive .
Because it might prevent such attacks in the sense of giving foreign terrorists an array of more enticing targets to shoot at who are closer to home .
But in real terms the idea “ we fight them over there so we do n’t have to fight them here ” is just magical thinking , the kind of notion that feels like it makes sense because your brain is running amok in the unconscious making unsupervised connections between unrelated things , sort of like an OCD patient who believes that if he steps on every third sidewalk crack he wo n’t get into a car accident .
What ’s amazing about this sort of propaganda is that once it gets hammered into your head enough , the logic of it begins to feel self - evident , above the need for explanation .
Over and over again on the campaign trail last year I had people explain this concept to me by simply repeating themselves .
I once asked a guy in South Carolina who had laid that line on me if he thought our forces in Iraq were , simultaneous to their occupation mission , physically blocking the airports in Saudi Arabia and Yemen to keep potential terrorists from coming to the U.S. – if that was why fighting them over there kept “ them ” from committing terrorist acts here .
“ You ’re not listening to me , ” he said .
“ The point is that if we were n’t over there , we ’d be fighting them here .
Now that we ’re over there , they fight us there . ”
“ But why ca n’t they attack us here anyway ? ” I asked .
He stared at me for something like thirty seconds .
I remember having enough time to check to make sure I had tape left on my recorder .
“ Because we ’re over there , ” he said finally .
It ’s the same thing with this torture business .
There are a lot of people in this country who genuinely believe that torture opponents are “ not upset ” about things like 9/11 or the beheading of American hostages .
The idea that “ no one complains when Americans are murdered ” is crazy — of course we “ complained , ” and of course we ’d all like to round up those machete - wielding monsters and shoot them into space — but these people really believe this , they really believe that torture opponents are secretly unimpressed / untroubled by Islamic terrorism , at least as compared to American “ enhanced interrogation . ”
For them to believe that , they must really believe that such people are traitors , nursing a secret agenda ( an agenda perhaps unknown even to themselves , their America - hatred being ingrained so deep ) against their own country .
Which is really an amazing thing for large numbers of Americans to believe about another large group of Americans , when you think about it .
The reason it ’s possible is that it ’s been drilled into their heads to instinctively perceive opposition to their point of view as support for their enemies .
They ’ve lost the ability to distinguish between real , honest - to - God enemies ( al Qaeda , Kim Jong - Il ) and people they simply disagree with or dislike ( Boston liberals , the French , gays , the ACLU , etc ) .
If you give a Yankee fan shit about Joba Chamberlain ’s fist pumps , his first answer is going to be to wonder why you ’re not also complaining about Jonathan Papelbon ’s screaming — because he assumes everyone who disagrees with a Yankee is a Red Sox fan .
The same sort of thing is at work here .
You bring up the subject of torture as an American citizen , concerned about what allowing torture would do to us as a society , how it would change us , and these people answer the issue by wondering why we ’re not also complaining about the terrorists on 9/11 or in Fallujah .
Because the thinking here is that everyone who disagrees with the torture position is in some degree or another in league with a real murderous enemy .
They do n’t understand that this is not a question of taking different sides in a war ; this is two groups of Americans having a disagreement about how best to deal with a foreign enemy both of these groups of Americans despise , fear and revile equally .
My group , the anti-torture group , believes that what should make us superior to terrorists is respect for law and due process and civilization , and that when we give in and use these tactics , we forfeit that superiority and actually confer a kind of victory to the al Qaedas of the world , people who should never be allowed any kind of victory in any arena .
We furthermore think that the war on terror does n’t get won with force alone , that it ’s a conflict that ultimately has to be won politically , by winning a propaganda battle against these assholes , and we ca n’t win that battle so easily if people in the Middle East see us openly embrace these tactics .
Whether or not you agree with that is up to you — we could be wrong , after all — but when you respond to these arguments by asserting that people like me did n’t “ complain ” when Americans were tortured and murdered , what you ’re really doing is calling me a traitor .
And while it may be more interesting and exciting for you to think like that , in reality it ’s just nuts .
Seriously .
Trust us on this one .
So think it over and ask yourself again if it really makes sense to say that torture opponents like me did n’t “ complain ” when Americans get their heads chopped off .
Ask yourself if you really mean that , before you say it .
And then get back to me .

I already have plenty of plastic and a staple - gun .
Very nice !
I like the style !
I do n't think I 've seen it anywhere else on Newgrounds !
Although , for some reason it reminded me of Sesame Street even though Sesame Street did n't do anything like this .
I think it was just that you used kids .
By the way , are you in Britain ?
I just noticed that the kids had very pronounced accents .
Anyway , nice smooth animation that went well with what the kids were saying .
For unrehearsed interviews , you got some marvelous answers although I doubt those boys did asking their teacher when art was invented .
Anyway , nice intervies and I do n't know what you 're talking about ' averagey ' film and wasted money .
An HD camera is never a waste of money as long and you continue using it and the film was lovely !
Anyway , 5/5 and 10/10 .
Beautiful job .
Oxygen depletion threatens ocean habitats : study
by Staff Writers
Washington ( AFP ) May 1 , 2008
Oxygen - depleted regions of tropical oceans are expanding , restricting habitats for fish and other marine life , an international team of scientists said in a study published Thursday .
The researchers found that oxygen levels at 300 to 700 meters ( 985 to 2,300 feet ) have declined significantly over the past five decades .
" The ecological impacts of this increase could have substantial biological and economical consequences , " a summary of the study said .
The team of oceanographers said it remained unclear if the reduction in oxygen levels could be linked to climate change , according to the study published in the May 2 edition of Science .
" Whether or not these observed changes in oxygen can be attributed to global warming alone is still unresolved .
The reduction in oxygen may also be caused by natural processes on shorter time scales , " said co-author Lothar Stramma from the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences in Kiel , Germany .
The largest decline in oxygen levels occurred in the northeast Atlantic , with much less dramatic changes seen in the eastern Indian Ocean , the study said .
The oxygen - poor areas could possibly reach coastal zones through currents flowing from the mid-depth tropical oceans , said co-author Janet Sprintall of Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California at San Diego .
" The width of the low - oxygen zone is expanding deeper but also shoaling toward the ocean surface , " said Sprintall .
The study was carried out as part of a long - running program on climate variability and predictability led by the World Climate Research Programme , which looks at climate through the interaction of ocean and atmosphere .
The disks at the center of Dr. David Mooney 's current cancer research do n't appear very powerful .
Grayish - brown circles with the texture of a dry , hardened sponge , they are dwarfed by a fingertip and snap in half easily .
But if recent work on melanoma therapies by the McKay professor of bioengineering and his team are any kind of harbinger , these tiny disks could become cancer 's biggest challenger .
Cancer is a tough enemy .
Against most diseases , the human immune system is a stalwart defender , equipped with a huge arsenal of molecular weapons to fight off bacteria , viruses , and all sorts of other harmful foreign invaders .
But cancer flies under the radar : created by the body , it is camouflaged by familiar proteins the system has learned to view as harmless .
The relatively new field of cancer immunotherapy seeks to resolve this quandary by retraining the body 's defenses to seek out and destroy cancer cells it would normally pass by .
So far , the vaccines and therapies developed using this approach typically involve removing cells from a patient 's body , programming them externally , and then reinjecting them .
At that point , the hope is that the cells will travel to the lymph nodes and activate tumor - fighting killer T - cells .
" But there are limitations with that protocol , " says Omar Ali , a postdoctoral fellow and a principal collaborator with Mooney .
" Specifically , when you inject the cells back into the patient , many of them -- which you have spent so much time programming - - will die . "
Once trained outside their natural environment , Ali says , the cells have trouble readjusting to the body , leaving only 1 to 2 percent to mobilize cancer - fighting T - cells .
Mooney 's team has solved this problem by finding a way to deliver cancer therapy from within .
Mooney had been working with biomaterials and implantable systems in his research for years , stimulating blood - vessel growth and bone regeneration using small subcutaneous disks : just the kind of device that might allow researchers to recruit immune cells and activate more efficient attacks on the cancer .
As they detail in a recent issue of Nature Materials , Mooney 's team began their research by locating a good internal recruiter -- a special protein that attracts dendritic cells , the immune -- system workers that instruct T - cells to attack .
Their delivery method was a thin , eight - millimeter polymer disk that they implanted under the skin of mice with an aggressive melanoma .
Reacting to the internal recruiter , dendritic cells sought out the disk , where they were activated by two additional items it harbored : antigens to train the cells to seek their specific cancer target , and so - called " danger signals , " which mimic infection and energize the cells .
Then the dendritic cells migrated to the lymph nodes to create armies of tumor - specific T - cells .
The addition of the " danger signals " proved crucial , sending 13 percent of the cells toward the lymph nodes , an improvement of more than 10 percentage points over results from external treatments .
That outcome , coupled with the apparently more lasting benefit of internal manipulation by the activated dendritic cells , produces a qualitative as well as quantitative effect , says Mooney .
The mice -- which had been dying from the melanoma at around the twenty - fifth day - - began surviving at a rate of 90 percent .
In addition to the promising results , there were other practical benefits : the disks cost only about $ 300 to manufacture ; external treatments , Ali says , can take up to a month to prepare and can cost up to $ 10,000 .
Working with Harvard 's Office of Technology Development ( see " Retooling Tech Transfer , " January - February 2008 , page 57 ) , the findings have become the foundation of a start - up company , InCyTu ( a play on in situ , and a nod to Mooney 's bioengineering models ) .
The team expects to begin clinical trials by the end of the year , and hopes for reasonably quick acceptance because the Food and Drug Administration has already approved most of the elements they are working with , including the disk .
They see the possibility of treating a host of diseases beyond cancer , including administering stem - cell treatments , with this novel delivery method .
Even if the clinical trials result in something more modest than a cure , says Ali -- if the technique enhances survival rates or gives chemotherapy a better chance to work -- it could be a huge advance in the fight against cancer , exciting enough for him to postpone a planned move to Malaysia 's burgeoning biotech community .
The in situ approach is " very easy to reproduce " and inexpensive , " so it could be used in both developed and developing countries . "
Yet he retains a healthy cynicism .
" I 'm always a bit skeptical , " he explains , " because we have n't made the translation " from mice to humans .

OptiSolar Inc. , which grabbed headlines last year with plans to build a massive solar power plant in California 's Central Valley , has stopped its manufacturing operations and will lay off most of its staff .
Low on funding , the company has been searching for a buyer but has n't been able to find one , said Alan Bernheimer , OptiSolar 's vice president of communications .
In all , 200 employees will lose their jobs : 142 at the company 's Hayward headquarters and 58 at a second facility just outside Sacramento .
Fewer than 100 employees will remain .
The company will continue hunting for a buyer and could resume production of its thin - film solar panels in Hayward if someone purchases the operation , Bernheimer said .
" If we can find a buyer , it 's certainly ready to start , " he said .
" But it 's going to take a buyer with resources , cash flow , the ability to invest in research and development . "
OptiSolar 's experiences reflect the solar industry 's recent , stunning change in fortunes .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Last summer , OptiSolar announced that it would build a solar power plant capable of generating a maximum of 550 megawatts , roughly the same as a midsize fossil fuel power plant .
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. agreed to buy the electricity from the plant , to be built in San Luis Obispo County .
But the credit crisis cut off the ability of young , green - tech companies to find funding for their projects .
Earlier this month , OptiSolar sold its portfolio of planned but unbuilt power plants to rival First Solar for $ 400 million in stock .
Rather than develop power plants , the company would concentrate on making and selling its ultra - thin solar panels .
But even after the deal with First Solar , OptiSolar could n't find enough funding to keep its operations running .
( CNN ) --
Here 's a little - known fact :
Under current law , it 's possible to hold a patent on a piece of human DNA , otherwise known as a gene .
Some breast cancers , shown here , are linked with the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 .
Companies that have acquired patents for genes have specific rights to their use , which may include diagnostic tests based on those genes , as well as future mutations that are discovered .
In a new lawsuit , the American Civil Liberties Union alleges that the policy is unconstitutional .
The targets of the lawsuit , Myriad Genetics and the University of Utah Research Foundation , hold patents to BRCA1 and BRCA2 , the genes responsible for many cases of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers .
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is also named in the suit .
The lawsuit asserts that the patents prevent some people from accessing medical screening for BRCA1 and BRCA2 .
It also challenges the general patentability of genes , which has been legal since 1980 .
That year , in Diamond v. Chakrabarty , the Supreme Court found in favor of Ananda Mohan Chakrabarty , who used bacteria to engineer a microbe that dissolves oil .
Watch Dr. Gupta explain the lawsuit »
Genes form the basic unit of heredity .
With modern technology , researchers have determined that particular genes carry an associated risk of illness .
A striking 20 percent of all human genes have been patented .
However , now that all 20,000 to 25,000 human genes have been mapped and sequenced through the Human Genome Project , they are in the public domain , meaning they would no longer be considered " new " for the purposes of patents , said Lee Silver , professor of molecular biology and public policy at Princeton University .
Now , patents on human genes must specify a new use , such as a diagnostic test .
If a company wants to patent the purified form of an antibiotic that exists in nature in a fungus , no one challenges that , Silver said .
Plant DNA , as well as human DNA , can be synthesized in a laboratory .
Distinguishing this case from a patented human gene that is useful in diagnostics would require the ethical argument that the human genome is sacred -- and even then , things get murky , considering that about 25 percent of human genes are shared by chimpanzees , he said .
Do n't Miss ACLU sues over patents on breast cancer genes
" The patent law says nothing about ethics , " he said .
But Josephine Johnston , bioethicist at the nonpartisan Hastings Institute , said she thinks that allowing patents for human genes was probably a mistake .
She said she would draw the line at modified genes being acceptable as intellectual property , but not genes in pure form .
From a legal point of view , that would mean unmodified plant and animal genes would also be off - limits .
In a moral argument , however , one could say that there is a " common humanity " -- that human genetic material belongs to all humans -- or agree that no plant or animal genes should be patented .
" I think that legal arguments about why this kind of thing is n't really something that should be patentable are really strong at a theoretical level , " she said .
" I would n't be that confident that the American court system would agree . "
Patents protect inventors and spur innovation by giving companies an incentive to create new things .
The invention must be " useful , " " novel " and " nonobvious " and carry a description that enables someone to use it for the stated purpose , according to U.S. patent law .
Dan Ravicher , executive director of the Public Patent Foundation , who partnered with the ACLU in the lawsuit , said the lawsuit 's argument is akin to " saying if someone removes your eyeball ... just because you remove the eyeball and wash it off , that does n't make the eyeball patentable . "
But Silver finds this analogy faulty .
Though an individual 's eyeball is unique and cannot be made in a laboratory , any given form of any gene is present in many people and can be synthesized .
The DNA molecule is defined at the atomic level by a genetic sequence .
Scientists can make purefied substances with the same characteristics as human genes , whereas they cannot exactly manufacture any person 's eyeball .
" The main problem is that people do n't understand what genes are and what they 're not , " Silver said .
Some ethicists do not take issue with Myriad 's patents but with how the company uses them .
Part of the ALCU 's argument is that Myriad charges $ 3,000 for its diagnostic cancer test , a price that prevents some women from seeking this preventive measure .
" I think we 're talking about unreasonable profit and exploitation of people at risk , " said M. Sara Rosenthal , director of the University of Kentucky Program for Bioethics .
" The issue is greed , which is never ethical . "
From Rosenthal 's perspective , the main issue in this case is no different from a situation in which a pharmaceutical company , regardless of where the ingredients came from , uses a patent to charge unreasonably high prices for drugs .
Such companies have a right to recoup their costs , but they should make their health care products available to the average person , she said .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Genetic testing for breast cancer
The patentability of such tests , however , gives companies an incentive to create them in the first place , Silver said .
" If you patent any diagnostic test , this should be no different , " he said .
Myriad 's attorney , Richard Marsh , said Wednesday that the company plans to " vigorously defend our intellectual property rights . "
The patents on genes also expire 20 years after the date of application , meaning the plethora of existing patents on the human genes themselves will run out relatively quickly , Silver said .
Moreover , with exceptions such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 , there are relatively few genes whose patentability is actually profitable , Silver said .
" I suspect that 95 percent of patents on genes are worthless in an economic sense , " he said .
A good use of a gene patent was for the insulin gene , which led to recombinant human insulin , which led to essential treatments for diabetes , Rosenthal said .
" Gene patenting should not mean that commercial companies unreasonably profit from those of us unlucky in genetic lotteries , " she said .

Frequent television portrayals of Christians as absurd make it more difficult for believers to defend themselves , a national journalist has said .
Recent storylines in a number of soaps have sent the clear message that “ Christians are nutters ” , the Daily Telegraph ’s religion correspondent , Jonathan Wynne - Jones , wrote last week on his blog .
Christians should expect robust criticism , Mr Wynne - Jones said , but as faith is made to look more ridiculous “ the line between ridicule and persecution becomes even thinner ” .
Mr Wynne - Jones wrote on his blog : “ Some would argue that Christianity has been undermined for some time on television . ”
He continues : “ Even some of the BBC ’s religious documentaries have tended to challenge traditional beliefs , from claiming Mary was raped by a Roman soldier to arguing that Paul ’s conversion on the road to Damascus was caused by an epileptic fit . ”
Earlier this week it emerged that dozens of viewers complained to the television regulator after an Easter Sunday episode of Coronation Street featured a string of outbursts against Christianity .
The character Ken Barlow described the Christian faith as a “ superstition ” , accusing churches of targeting “ vulnerable people ” and “ indoctrinating ” his grandson .
Mr Wynne - Jones also referred to Hollyoaks , a soap hugely popular with teenagers , where the ‘ Christian ’ in the show claims to have found an image of Jesus in a potato .
“ Outspoken criticism of Christian beliefs should be expected , but the stealthy attempts to make believers look absurd is much more damaging , ” Mr Wynne - Jones said .
“ Once faith has been made to look ridiculous , the attempts of believers to rebut the criticism will be met with deaf ears .
And then the line between ridicule and persecution becomes even thinner . ”
It emerged earlier this month that the producers of Coronation Street are planning to portray a ‘ born - again Christian ’ character embarking on a lesbian affair in a bid to make the soap more reflective of modern Britain .
The BBC received 150 complaints about an episode of Eastenders shown in October last year , in which ‘ Christian ’ character Dot Cotton was made to look old fashioned and ridiculous in her beliefs on homosexuality .
She was shown getting to grips with an mp3 player before coming across two men kissing on a park bench and asking them to stop .
The two male characters sniggered at her efforts to engage with modern technology .
Mark Thompson , the Director General of the BBC , admitted last year that he believes Christianity should be treated with less sensitivity in television programmes than other religions .
WEST HAVEN , Utah ( AP ) 
The principal of a Utah middle school has been asked to apologize for forcing a kilt - wearing Scottish - American student to change his clothes .
Weber School District spokesman Nate Taggart says Craig Jessop has been asked to extend an apology to 14 - year - old student Gavin McFarland of Hooper after the school official 's comments Wednesday .
Gavin says he wore the kilt twice in the past two weeks to Rocky Mountain Junior High as a prop for an art project , the Standard - Examiner reported .
Jessop told the boy that the outfit could be misconstrued as cross-dressing .
Taggart says the district recognizes the kilt as an expression of the boy 's Scottish heritage and that the kilt was not inappropriate .
Kilts are traditional Scottish apparel generally worn by men for formal or special occasions .

Man strip - searched and held for 24 hours over friend 's ' joke text ' about sabotaging a train
Spy threat :
The man ( not pictured ) was held after authorities intercepted a text : ‘ Do you know how to derail a train ? ’
An innocent man was strip - searched and held in a cell for 24 hours after receiving a joke text message from a friend about sabotaging a train .
The 29 - year - old was arrested after his mobile phone provider passed on details of the message to police - who accused him of not reporting a crime .
The case , which happened in France , provoked widespread outrage about the ' sinister ' march of the Big Brother state there .
The man , referred to only by his first name of Stephane , received a message saying ' Do you know how to de-rail a train ? ' last month in Abbeville , in the Somme region .
The woodworker thought nothing of the text but hours later he was arrested .
Detectives said his mobile provider had passed on details of the message .
They claimed Stephane should have called the police as soon as he received the text .
Stephane said : ' I was strip - searched and forced to hand over the name of my colleague who had sent the message .
' Then the court gave an order that I could be held for up to 24 hours .
It was a real shock .
In two seconds I felt I had become a vulgar criminal .
' I was held in a prison cell which smelled of urine .
I felt I was being treated like a dog . '
He was released without charge after 24 hours .
His friend was also held for 24 hours .
French law allows information including texts to be handed over to the authorities if there is a ' concern about terrorism ' .
Security services here are not allowed to snoop on British citizens ' texts .
But it is thought they sidestep these restrictions by monitoring other countries ' communications and then exchanging data with them .
Éric Fouard , the Abbeville public prosecutor , said :
‘ The phone operator has the right to consult these messages and must alert the authorities if he thinks a crime or an offence is likely to be committed .
‘ The penal sytem is the same for everybody , whether the risk is great or small . ’
But a spokesman for the French civil liberties group CNIL said : ‘ The fact that someone can be arrested on the strength of receiving a text message has very sinister implications . ’
In France the law allows information including text messages to be handed over to the authorities if there is a ‘ concern about terrorism ’ .
France is on high alert against attacks on its rail system at the moment , following a number of acts of vandalism on lines and rolling stock .
Stéphane , who was released without charge following his arrest on April 16th , said : ‘ It was all profoundly shocking .
I really hope that a train is n’t de-railed in coming weeks . ’
Britain 's information watchdog , the Information Commissioner 's Office , has frequently called for tighter regulation on information being handed over to the authorities by phone companies .
Research shows that British phone companies regularly hand over data about their customers to some 650 public bodies , including the police .
Last month Jacqui Smith , the Home Secretary , scrapped plans to build a giant database to monitor the UK ’s e-mails , phone calls and internet activity .
Instead the records of every electronic communication will be held by private companies at an estimated cost to the taxpayer of £ 2 billion over ten years .
About 57 billion text messages were sent in Britain last year .
News that police have stopped a plan to set off explosives during the G20 summit this week is going to make everyone concerned even more twitchy — and frankly I would n't have thought that was possible .
Police have been warning for weeks that serious disruption is planned .
Protesters have been warning for weeks that police are coming down too heavily .
Some protesters are trying to disown other protesters .
Nerves are fraying everywhere you look in the countdown to the demonstrations planned in London on 1 April .
I went along to the Put People First march on Saturday to see if I could get any feeling for who might be around this Wednesday .
It was interesting , with a better turnout than I had feared , and a cheery mix of marchers , from woolly - jumper - wearing communists through militant unionists to rainbow - tie - dye trousered hippies .
In a funny way it was 1978 all over again .
But the centre of attention was the anarchists .
Sorry , I 'll try that again in true pantomime style : the ANARCHISTS ( boo , hiss !!! ) .
In the middle of their line - up was a fairly small — 100- 200 at a guess — group of young people in black hoodies , black baggy trousers and , in some cases , a bandana across their faces .
Some of them waved red and black anarchist flags .
And across the front of the bloc they carried a large banner promising direct action , and suggesting that the bosses and bankers should be " first against the wall " ( a sentiment I believe many across the nation would vehemently support ) .
But it was n't really their natty dress - sense or their flags that made them stand out so distinctively from the rest of the march .
It was the very special policing tactics that were focused on them : the anarchists , the police seemed to feel , were such an imminent danger to society that they needed to be ' kettled ' — in other words , to have three police vans crawling along blocking their left - hand side , and a tight line of police one behind another on their right - hand - side , to make sure there was no possibility of break - out .
I 've seen ' kettling ' done even more intensively than this , at a recent Smash EDO protest in Brighton , for example , where the police were lined along the front and back of the group as well as down the sides , and I ( walking my kid home from school ) was warned to get out of the way as if it was an advancing army , rather than just 50 - 60 protesters .
This small group in the ' kettle ' was as resentful as you would expect , and a horrendous mood hung over the small event .
There , as here at the Put People First march , with the cops wearing those nice bright yellow jackets , it was as if someone had taken a giant highlighter pen and drawn a line around the anarchists to indicate " Here be dragons " .
You may wonder , who are these young anarchist folk , and why are they attracting so much attention ?
Over the last few years the movement in Britain has really put down roots , setting up social centres , book fairs , and newsletters around the country .
A basic tenet of the culture is anti-police , and this is often fed by local long - running protests – anti-arms , animal rights , anti-road or pipeline – which sour relations with the local coppers , who almost inevitably handle the protesters as if they are radioactive .
Local information will have been fed through to the Metropolitan police , identifying this particular bunch as trouble - makers ( most of them probably have their own files – hence , they say , the bandanas across their faces ) .
And so , we have the kettle .
Let 's not be naïve here and say – as protesters far too often do – that it's all the police 's fault , they were provoking us .
The anarchists want action , they are delighted that the system is imploding on itself , they may well wade joyfully into battle with the police on Wednesday .
And if police are dealing with intelligence of explosive devices , you can imagine that they 're going to be feeling less than amiable towards the activists .
But similarly , if the police try to claim that it was all the fault of the protesters , caution will be needed .
It could all get very messy indeed , and extremely careful monitoring is needed of police behaviour at the G20 protests ( Climate Camp included ) .
I must admit I feel pricklings of fear about it all , and so do many others .
Because if I was a young person , fed up , no job on the horizon , watching my future implode thanks to a system I did not believe in , and I was being treated as a criminal by the police for simply wearing black , I too might feel stirring resentment .
Is this really the best way to handle protesters ?

1 Girl died playing World of Warcraft and got online funeral
A young Chinese girl nicknamed “ Snowly ” died after playing the online game “ World of Warcraft ” for several continuous days during a national day holiday .
Snowly ’s friends , who share the same game community , said that she was always connected to the Internet .
Several days before Snowly ’s death , the girl was said to be preparing for a relatively difficult part of the game and had very little rest .
She told her friends that she felt very tired .
A big online funeral was held for Snowly one week after her death .
The Chinese government is now seeking to instate a gaming curfew , limiting sessions to three hours at a time .
2 Gang kidnaps Gunbound MMO High Score Holder to steal Account
In July 2007 , a Brazilian gang called “ La Firma ” kidnapped the top score holder in the licensed MMO , Gunbound in order to get his account and sell it , according to Xinhua .
Gunbound is a very popular light combat / competitive MMO developed by Softnyx from Korea .
The game does not allow the exchange of user accounts , but they are traded on the blackmarket for up to $ 2,700 .
Apparently , the group tried to steal the unnamed top players account on a number of occasions ( perhaps by stealing his password ) .
They successfully trapped the player by using a girl who flirted with him online and enticed him to meet her in an internet cafe in Sao Paulo .
She did n’t show up , instead , a guy with a gun did and kidnapped the player and forced him to disclose his account information .
The gang then offered the account on a website for $ 8,000 .
Brazilian Police arrested the gang later .
3 Boy saves his sister from a moose attack with skills learned from World of Warcraft
A 12 year - old Norwegian boy saved his sister and himself from a moose attack using skills he picked up in the online role playing game ‘ World of Warcraft . ’
Hans Jurgen
Olsen and his sister got into a spot of trouble when they encroached on the territory of one of these antlered cold weather staples ( otherwise known as a moose ) .
When the beast went on the offensive , Hans knew the first thing he had to do was taunt it so that it would leave his sister alone and she could run to safety .
“ Taunting ” is a move one uses in World of Warcraft to get monsters off of the less - well - armored team members .
Once he was a target , Hans remember another skill he ’d picked up at level 30 in ‘ World of Warcraft ’ — he feigned death .
The moose lost interest in the inanimate Hans and wandered off into the woods .
When he was safely alone Hans ran back home to share his tale of video game - inspired survival .
4 Player of Legends of Mir 3 stabs fellow gamer to death
In March 2005 , a Chinese man was stabbed to death in a row over a sword in online game Legends of Mir 3 .
Shanghai gamer Qiu Chengwei killed player Zhu Caoyuan when he discovered he had sold a “ dragon sabre ” he had been loaned .
Mr Chengwei only got the powerful virtual weapon shortly before it was sold for 7,200 yuan ( £ 460 ) .
Before the attack Mr Chengwei told the police about the theft but had no response since the police said the weapon was not real property .
The online gamer has been given a suspended death sentence for his crime .
5 Dutch teen steals nearly $ 6,000 worth of virtual furniture
17 - year - old was pinched for burglary in the Netherlands after walking off with $ 5,900 worth of virtual furniture from Habbo Hotel .
Habbo , which attracts more than 6 million users in over 30 countries each month , is comparable to Second Life in that people use the service to create a virtual likeness to inhabit an online world .
A lot of real money changes hands in Habbo in order to purchase virtual goods used by people to personalize their online experience .
That real money involved is what got the police interested in the theft .
Apparently jealous of other patrons ’ decor , the suspect swiped their keys , stole the furnishings and stashed them in his own room and the suites held by five accomplices .
The virtual thief methods were a little nefarious : he lured Habbo Hotel users into giving up their passwords by creating fake Habbo sites .
He was charged with burglary and hacking .
6 Woman Offers Sex for ‘ Warcraft ’ Gold
In an attempt to make her character stronger in the online game of World of Warcraft , a woman prostituted herself .
Needing 5000 gold to purchase an ‘ Epic Flying Mount , ’ one of the fastest mounts in the game , she offered anyone , male or female , playing on her server the opportunity to perform a variety of sexual acts in exchange for the in - game currency .
In a posting on Craigslist on 4/8/07 , the player stated that if someone were to transfer 5000 gold pieces to her account to purchase an epic flying mount , then that person can , “ mount , ” her .
It stated that she wanted whoever was going to do this to send her a picture so that she could evaluate the perspective , “ John . ”
The posting player stated that her email was full with messages from people that were interested in taking her up with her offer .
In a response that she placed on Craigslist the next day , she scolded the other players for making such a big deal out of all of this .
She stated that she was able to get both things that she was looking for .
She wanted both a mount for her character , and one for herself .
7 Korean dies after game session
South Korean man died in 2007 after reportedly playing an online computer game for 50 hours with few breaks .
The 28 - year - old man collapsed after playing the game Starcraft at an internet cafe in the city of Taegu , according to South Korean authorities .
The man had not slept properly , and had eaten very little during his marathon session , said police .
Identified as Lee , he started playing Starcraft and only paused playing to go to the toilet and for short periods of sleep .
The cause of death was heart failure stemming from exhaustion .
He was taken to hospital following his collapse , but died shortly after .
He had recently been fired from his job because he kept missing work to play computer games .
8 Teenager gets DVT after a whole day with a console
A boy who spent an entire day kneeling down playing computer games needed hospital treatment for a blood clot in his leg .
Dominic Patrick , 14 , from Merseyside , developed deep vein thrombosis after a rainy day inside with a games console .
The potentially dangerous condition was caused because Dominic had his legs tucked under his body .
Dominic noticed something was wrong when , after getting up from playing games all day , he got pins and needles in his legs and one of his calves swelled up .
When this failed to go away , his father initially put it down to “ growing pains ” , but eventually took him to a doctor , who diagnosed DVT .
9 Plague ravage World of Warcraft
In 2005 , Blizzard introduced a new area to its popular MMORPG , World of Warcraft .
The boss of the area was able to cast a spell called Corrupted Blood , which was supposed to infect and cause damage to all the players nearby .
Contrary to what Blizzard planned , however , the players got their pets infected and used them to transmit the disease outside of the area , contaminating pretty much everyone around them .
The plague spread through the game servers and thousands of players died .
Blizzard managed to create quarantine zones within the game , and shortly afterwards it introduced a ‘ cure ’ for the infection .
Despite the remedies the event created a lot of buzz in online forums and community websites .

Belgian user of Second Life was forced , by using a so called “ voodoo doll ” –a piece of code that takes the form of a regular object as a cup or pen or whatever but in fact gives control of your avatar– to perform sexually explicit behavior .
In theory , a user must give his consent in order for other player to take control of his avatar , but using one of the above mentioned voodoo dolls and some persuasion you can make a user ( especially a new one ) to give access to his avatar .
After the incident , Brussels ’ public prosecutor asked patrol detectives of the Federal Computer Crime Unit to go on Second Life to investigate the “ virtual rape ” .
What you need to know about COVID - 19 : September 30 , 2020
Update in 2015 : Our most recent housemate , Dan , who gardened in 2013 in exchange for rent , was a joy .
I ’m grateful for his good work , and his positive presence in the house .
He ’s 63 , in contrast to our prior work - for - rent folks , who were recent college graduates .
Who says that single people ought to live alone , or that married couples would n’t want or need a housemate ?
I ’m happily married and I love having a housemate who helps us garden , clean the house and tend our urban chickens in exchange for rent .
It raises our quality of life altogether , and also reduces overall carbon footprint .
This piece below first appeared as a guest post at Get Rich Slowly .
“ Friendly married couple , both professionals in sustainability , seeks one competent , friendly person to serve as Home & Garden Manager in exchange for free rent . ”
That ’s the opener to the Craigslist ad that has turned our weedy front lawn into a beautiful garden , freed up six hours of our time per week and yielded us a lot of fun at no cost .
Conversely , two bright , energetic college graduates have each repaid about $ 2,500 on their student loans that they would still owe if they had n’t been ( one at a time ) our housemates , working in exchange for rent .
A work / rent exchange can be a win - win for both parties , especially in this tightening economy , and could revolve around child care , home repairs , cooking , painting , etc. rather than gardening .
While some people would craft this as a landlord / tenant arrangement , especially if living quarters were completely separate , it works nicely for us as a housemate arrangement .
Here are the common - sense rules that have worked for us .
The recruitment ad should be specific , giving a clear picture of what both parties should expect .
Here ’s the rest of our Craigslist ad :
We ’re offering : Pleasant house with spacious , sunny bedroom for you
$ 15 - $ 20 / hour in rent / util . for skilled , reliable work
Great location by Mt Tabor Park
You are : Organized and able to keep an accurate work - log
Happy to work 6 hours / week without excuses
Experienced at gardening & housekeeping
Able to make vegetarian meals and enjoy them with us
Experienced at living with others
Equipped with references , both employment and housemates
Comfortable with green lifestyle , i.e. CFL ’s , low hot - water use , composting
If you are qualified , please email a letter of interest and your phone number .
I ’ll call or write back if I see a possible fit .
Thank you !
________________________________________________________
The “ hiring ” process is similar to that for any job , with the addition that you definitely need to like being around this person .
If their written information looks good , do a phone interview .
If they sound good , have an in - person interview .
Volunteer lots of information , including downsides ( “ Sorry , but your bedroom will be hot in the summer . ” )
If everyone is seeing a fit , arrange a paid trial work - session .
( Seeing the person actually work is the most important step . )
Finally , check references from both employers and housemates .
The applicant must feel right to you at each stage in order to move to the next stage .
Past experience in hiring is great , but even without it , you can generally tell if a person is responsible and has the work ethic and social skills you need in a working housemate .
The paid work - session tells you much more about a person ’s actual work - skills than either their resume or references – but references are still crucial .
Also critical : do you like the person and feel comfortable ?
The housemate fit is probably more a make - or - break than their work - skills .
Have all parties sign a simple , written agreement .
Ours was a single page and included cost of rent plus utilities ; rate of starting pay and possibility of raises ; our groceries agreement ; spreadsheet - based work - log to be updated and turned in every Sunday .
It was for six months , with either party able to cut it short with 30 days notice .
Be willing to supervise your housemate who is working for rent .
They can only succeed in their role with your active involvement , especially in the beginning .
Be clear on what tasks they will do .
At the same time , do n’t micromanage , or expect perfect performance .
Be quick to praise and appreciate .
Practice healthy boundaries .
When they are not working , they ’re off duty , i.e. your housemate and not an employee .
It ’s not a 24/7 job .
Conversely , if the agreed - upon work is n’t getting done steadily , the person may need to pay the difference in cash ( if that ’s in the written agreement ) , or eventually be asked to leave .
I once wrote a note to Steve when he was temporarily slacking off : “ This is a real job , despite the fact I like you .
Do these tasks today . ”
He did them .
Have fun with the new , different situation .
Our ‘ working housemates ’ have brought lively , positive energy into our home , and plenty of laughs .
Most have remained our friends after moving on to other living situations .
Someone asked me once about the wisdom of having a ‘ stranger ’ live in my home .
I replied , “ Well , all of my friends were strangers — until they became my friends . ”

As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plane landed in Washington Sunday , contractors were being given a tour of the northern Jordan Valley settlement Maskiot in the framework of a tender that was issued to build a new neighborhood there ..
" The tender is part of the process to populate the community , " Jordan Valley Regional Council Chairman David Elhayani told Ynet .
West Bank Real Estate Yesha realty prices on the rise Efrat Weiss Slump affecting general real estate prices across Israel seems to skip West Bank as Yesha Council reports property sale , rent prices steadily increasing Yesha realty prices on the rise
" This process takes a few months to complete .
The timing is coincidental , and anyone who says otherwise is jeopardizing Israel 's security - related interests .
There is a consensus among the Zionist parties that the Jordan Valley must remain under Israel 's control in any future ( peace ) agreement . "
Peace Now Secretary - General Yariv Oppenheimer said the fact that the contractors ' tour coincided with Netanyahu 's trip to Washington was " an indication of the government 's plan to expand isolated settlements .
" This sends a clear message to the US and the international community as a whole regarding the government 's plan to expand settlement construction , " he said .
Elhayani said in response " it 's shocking to think that the leftists of Peace Now are doing everything , and I mean everything , to undermine Israel 's security interests . "
Established in 1982 , Maskiot formerly housed a Nahal Brigade base and several years ago included a pre-conscription military academy for national - religious youth .
In December 2006 , then - Defense Minister Amir Peretz approved the decision to build 30 new homes in the religious community , where the evacuees from the settlement of Shirat Hayam in Gush Katif could be housed .
Peretz later revoked his decision amid US pressure .
In July 2008 Defense Minister Ehud Barak authorized the settlement 's repopulation with 50 families , some of them from the evacuated Jewish settlements in Gaza .
Currently about 10 families reside in Maskiot , but many others are waiting for their lots to be released .
" The decision to populate Maskiot was approve by Barak ; the residents of the Jordan Valley are law abiding citizens , " Elhayani said .
" I 'm certain that the citizens of Israel would be pleased to learn that we are carrying on with the strengthening of the Jordan Valley , which is the country 's security belt . "
Yesha Council Chairman Danny Dayan told
Ynet regarding the construction plans at Maskiot " Peace Now is sabotaging Netanyahu 's mission to seek support against the Iranian nuclear program in Washington . "
Knesset Member Ahmad Tibi ( United Arab List - Ta'al ) criticized the decision to hold a construction bid for a new neighborhood in the northern Jordan Valley settlement .
" The Israeli government is acting like a bull in a China shop by expanding settlements all across the West Bank , " he said , adding that Monday 's meeting between US President Barack Obama and Netanyahu " will be tested by the US ' ability to compel Israel to halt all settlement construction . "
Knesset Member Yohanan Plesner ( Kadima ) called the decision " foolish " , saying it " would turn Israel into a bi-national state and deteriorate Israel 's relations with the US . "
MK Shlomo Molla , also of Kadima , said " the PM is slapping Obama in the face by expanding the settlement under the false pretense of natural growth .
" The PM and his associates would be better off evacuating settlements , launching negotiations and concentrating on the demographic problem , " he said .
LSD  My Problem Child
Albert Hofmann
11 . LSD Experience and Reality
Was kann ein Mensch im Leben mehr gewinnen
Als dass sich Gott - Natur ihm offenbare ?
What more can a person gain in life
Than that God-Nature reveals himself to him ?
 Goethe
Valious Realities
Of greatest significance to me has been the insight that I attained as a fundamental understanding from all of my LSD experiments : what one commonly takes as " the reality , " including the reality of one 's own individual person , by no means signifies something fixed , but rather something that is ambiguous that there is not only one , but that there are many realities , each comprising also a different consciousness of the ego .
One can also arrive at this insight through scientific reflections .
The problem of reality is and has been from time immemorial a central concern of philosophy .
It is , however , a fundamental distinction , whether one approaches the problem of reality rationally , with the logical methods of philosophy , or if one obtrudes upon this problem emotionally , through an existential experience .
The first planned LSD experiment was therefore so deeply moving and alarming , because everyday reality and the ego experiencing it , which I had until then considered to be the only reality , dissolved , and an unfamiliar ego experienced another , unfamiliar reality .
The problem concerning the innermost self also appeared , which , itself unmoved , was able to record these external and internal transformations .
Reality is inconceivable without an experiencing subject , without an ego .
It is the product of the exterior world , of the sender and of a receiver , an ego in whose deepest self the emanations of the exterior world , registered by the antennae of the sense organs , become conscious .
If one of the two is lacking , no reality happens , no radio music plays , the picture screen remains blank .
If one continues with the conception of reality as a product of sender and receiver , then the entry of another reality under the influence of LSD may be explained by the fact that the brain , the seat of the receiver , becomes biochemically altered .
The receiver is thereby tuned into another wavelength than that corresponding to normal , everyday reality .
Since the endless variety and diversity of the universe correspond to infinitely many different wavelengths , depending on the adjustment of the receiver , many different realities , including the respective ego , can become conscious .
These different realities , more correctly designated as different aspects of the reality , are not mutually exclusive but are complementary , and form together a portion of the all - encompassing , timeless , transcendental reality , in which even the unimpeachable core of self - consciousness , which has the power to record the different egos , is located .
The true importance of LSD and related hallucinogens lies in their capacity to shift the wavelength setting of the receiving " self , " and thereby to evoke alterations in reality consciousness .
This ability to allow different , new pictures of reality to arise , this truly cosmogonic power , makes the cultish worship of hallucinogenic plants as sacred drugs understandable .
What constitutes the essential , characteristic difference between everyday reality and the world picture experienced in LSD inebriation ?
Ego and the outer world are separated in the normal condition of consciousness , in everyday reality ; one stands face - to - face with the outer world ; it has become an object .
In the LSD state the boundaries between the experiencing self and the outer world more or less disappear , depending on the depth of the inebriation .
Feedback between receiver and sender takes place .
A portion of the self overflows into the outer world , into objects , which begin to live , to have another , a deeper meaning .
This can be perceived as a blessed , or as a demonic transformation imbued with terror , proceeding to a loss of the trusted ego .
In an auspicious case , the new ego feels blissfully united with the objects of the outer world and consequently also with its fellow beings .
This experience of deep oneness with the exterior world can even intensify to a feeling of the self being one with the universe .
This condition of cosmic consciousness , which under favorable conditions can be evoked by LSD or by another hallucinogen from the group of Mexican sacred drugs , is analogous to spontaneous religious enlightenment , with the unio mystica .
In both conditions , which often last only for a timeless moment , a reality is experienced that exposes a gleam of the transcendental reality , in vihich universe and self , sender and receiver , are one .
[ The relationship of spontaneous to drug - induced enlightenment has been most extensively investigated by R. C. Zaehner , Mysticism Sacred and Profane ( The Clarendon Press , Oxford , 1957 ) . ]
Gottfried Benn , in his essay " Provoziertes Leben " [ Provoked life ] ( in Ausdnckswelt , Limes Verlag , Wiesbaden , 1949 ) , characterized the reality in which self and world are separated , as " the schizoid catastrophe , the Western entelechy neurosis . "
He further writes :
. . .
In the southern part of our continent this concept of reality began to be formed .
The Hellenistic - European agonistic principle of victory through effort , cunning , malice , talent , force , and later , European Darwinism and " superman , " was instrumental in its formation .
The ego emerged , dominated , fought ; for this it needed instruments , material , power .
It had a different relationship to matter , more removed sensually , but closer formally .
It analyzed matter , tested , sorted : weapons , object of exchange , ransom money .
It clarified matter through isolation , reduced it to formulas , took pieces out of it , divided it up .
[ Matter became ] a concept which hung like a disaster over the West , with which the West fought , without grasping it , to which it sacrified enormous quantities of blood and happiness ; a concept whose inner tension and fragmentations it was impossible to dissolve through a natural viewing or methodical insight into the inherent unity and peace of prelogical forms of being . . . instead the cataclysmic character of this idea became clearer and clearer . . . a state , a social organization , a public morality , for which life is economically usable life and which does not recognize the world of provoked life , cannot stop its destructive force .
A society , whose hygiene and race cultivation as a modern ritual is founded solely on hollow biological statistics , can only represent the external viewpoint of the mass ; for this point of view it can wage war , incessantly , for reality is simply raw material , but its metaphysical background remains forever obscured .
[ This excerpt from Benn 's essay was taken from Ralph Metzner 's translation " Provoked Life : An Essay on the Anthropology of the Ego , " which was published in Psychedelic Review 1 ( 1 ) : 47 - 54 , 1963 .
Minor corrections in Metzner 's text have been made by A. H. ]
Mystery and Myth
The notion of reality as the self juxtaposed to the world , in confrontation with the outer world , began to form itself , as reported in the citation from Benn , in the southern portion of the European continent in Greek antiquity .
No doubt people at that time knew the suffering that was connected with such a cleft reality consciousness .
The Greek genius tried the cure , by supplementing the multiformed and richly colored , sensual as well as deeply sorrowful Apollonian world view created by the subject / object cleavage , with the Dionysian world of experience , in which this cleavage is abolished in ecstatic inebriation .
Nietzsche writes in The Birth of Tragedy :
It is either through the influence of narcotic potions , of which all primitive peoples and races speak in hymns , or through the powerful approach of spring , penetrating with joy all of nature , that those Dionysian stirrings arise , which in their intensification lead the individual to forget himself completely ....
Not only does the bond between man and man come to be forged once again by the magic of the Dionysian rite , but alienated , hostile , or subjugated nature again celebrates her reconciliation with her prodigal son , man .
And I will pray the Father , and he shall give you another Comforter , that he may abide with you forever ;
Even the Spirit of truth ; whom the world cannot receive , because it seeth him not , neither knoweth him : but ye know him ; for he dwelleth with you , and shall be in you .
I will not leave you comfortless : I will come to you .
Yet a little while , and the world seeth me no more ; but ye see me : because I live , ye shall live also .
At that day ye shalt know that I am in my Father , and ye in me , and I in you .
Guides
Computer numerical control ( CNC ) machining can make certain manufacturing processes easier by automating complex commands and speeding up the rate at which equipment completes tasks .
But operating a CNC machine is by no means a self - explanatory procedure , and technicians must undergo training to develop the skills necessary for proper CNC handling .
A lathe is a complex machine that presents its own set of challenges , but with the addition of computer numerical controls , the skilled lathe operator must also understand programming parameters , automation - specific safety standards , and a host of other vital pieces of information .
It should be emphasized that the completion of a set amount of coursework and the obtainment of appropriate certification are requisite for handling a CNC lathe .
Learning about the various types of skills and training that are available may help a prospective technician to plan for an education in CNC machining .
The Learning Curve
Although there are many technical schools out there , an accredited industrial training organization can provide the necessary training for a CNC lathe operator .
Most programs will involve multiple classes or sessions , offering a gradual instruction process broken up into several steps .
While the beginning stages might not include hands - on experience , later courses typically involve actual lathe operation .
In addition , the importance of adhering to safety protocols is reinforced throughout the training process .
The following is a typical CNC lathe training outline that may be helpful for illustrating what a student can expect to learn .
Beginners ’ Classes
An important training step involves explaining the limitations of computer numerical controls to those who are unfamiliar with its workings .
Despite being an automated system , a CNC lathe requires much more than design input to accomplish its task .
The technician usually needs to consider tool selection , spindle speed , workpiece clamping and positioning , and cutting sequences before machining can begin .
Furthermore , the CNC lathe only understands commands in a specific programming language , such as g-code .
CAD specifications must be translated through CAM software in order to be intelligible to a CNC machine .
Due to these complex requirements , it is best not to rush through the training program , but to segment the knowledge into learnable chunks .
Thus , some early stage coursework might include :
Checking to make sure the lathe is lubricated and learning to schedule routine maintenance in accordance with workplace standards .
and learning to schedule routine maintenance in accordance with workplace standards .
Learning to translate product specificationsand work instructions into a machine - readable format .

Learning to load a machining program into the CNC lathe and aligning its data points according to project requirements .
into the CNC lathe and aligning its data points according to project requirements .
Producing sample parts to verify if they match specifications and operator instructions .
Advanced Classes
After a trainee learns the methods for preparing a CNC lathe for operation and setting its equipment for test runs , the coursework begins to focus on more sophisticated tasks .
The initial stages will have taught a technician how to read , comprehend , and create computer numerical control programs .
This range of programming instructions typically includes drilling , grooving , facing , threading , and turning .
Late stage training will often cover CNC program editing , machine adjustments , and developing new command syntax .
Some typical coursework might include :
Identifying editing needs by comparing test results with design specifications and machine instructions .
by comparing test results with design specifications and machine instructions .
Learning to perform programming edits and updating them in accordance with workplace standards .
and updating them in accordance with workplace standards .
Producing additional cycles of sample components to verify editing changes and refine the editing process .

C leaning the lathe and removing any waste material in a safe manner .
Although these guidelines are a broad indication of some of the subjects covered in CNC training , the fundamental principles of following careful instructions , learning safety protocols , and remaining realistic about the capabilities of a CNC lathe will likely be a part of any training curriculum .

Wheel slippage during attempts to extricate NASA 's Mars Rover Spirit from a patch of soft ground during the preceding two weeks had partially buried the wheels by the 1,899th Martian day , or sol , of the Spirit 's mission on Mars ( May 6 , 2009 ) .
Image credit : NASA / JPL - Caltech
( PhysOrg.com ) --
The five wheels that still rotate on NASA 's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit have been slipping severely in soft soil during recent attempts to drive , sinking the wheels about halfway into the ground .
The rover team of engineers and scientists has suspended driving Spirit temporarily while studying the ground around the rover and planning simulation tests of driving options with a test rover at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
" Spirit is in a very difficult situation , " JPL's John Callas , project manager for Spirit and its twin rover , Opportunity , said Monday .
" We are proceeding methodically and cautiously .
It may be weeks before we try moving Spirit again .
Meanwhile , we are using Spirit 's scientific instruments to learn more about the physical properties of the soil that is giving us trouble . "
Both Spirit and Opportunity have operated more than five years longer than their originally planned missions of three months on Mars and have driven much farther than designed .
The rover team has so far developed ways to cope with various symptoms of aging on both rovers .
Spirit has been driving counterclockwise from north to south around a low plateau called " Home Plate " for two months .
The rover progressed 122 meters ( 400 feet ) on that route before reaching its current position .
In the past week , the digging - in of Spirit 's wheels has raised concerns that the rover 's belly pan could now be low enough to contact rocks underneath the chassis , which would make getting out of the situation more difficult .
The right - front wheel on Spirit stopped working three years ago .
Driving with just five powered wheels while dragging or pushing an immobile wheel adds to the challenge of the situation .
Favorably , three times in the past month , wind has removed some of the dust accumulated on Spirit 's solar panels .
This increases the rover 's capability for generating electricity .
" The improved power situation buys us time , " Callas said .
" We will use that time to plan the next steps carefully .
We know that dust storms could return at any time , although the skies are currently clear . "
Behavioral problems that Spirit exhibited in early April -- episodes of amnesia , computer resets and failure to wake for communications sessions -- have not recurred in the past three weeks , though investigations have yet to diagnose the root causes .

Hemp is used to make a lightweight , insulating concrete that will form the walls of the house
But never before has the class B drug been described as a way to save the environment too .
Researchers at BRE Centre for Innovative Construction Materials believe they have discovered a way to build carbon - neutral homes of the future - by using cannabis instead of the usual bricks and mortar .
Experts are working on a revolutionary housing project - delivered by the National Non-Food Crops Centre ( NNFCC ) - using construction materials made out of hemp - lime , a form of the drug .
The lightweight building material is made of fibres from the fast - growing cannabis plant , bound together using a lime - based adhesive .
The hemp plant stores carbon as it grows and combined with the low carbon footprint of lime and its efficient insulating properties , gives the material a “ better than zero carbon ” footprint , researchers said .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The recession tightened its grip on U.S. businesses and consumers in February , according to economists , who are predicting the largest one - month job loss in almost 60 years .
" Pink slips continue to fly , " said Meny Grauman , an economist for CIBC World Markets .
With output still falling at a dizzying rate , most companies are shedding unneeded workers and cutting back the hours of those remaining .
Strapped by debt and seeing their paper wealth evaporating , many consumers are spending as little as they can .
" The economic patient is still in critical condition , with little medication to relieve the pain , " wrote economists Brian Bethune and Nigel Gault of IHS Global Insight .
" We will have to bite the bullet . "
The first week of the new month brings two of the most important economic indicators : the ISM index and the nonfarm payrolls report .
Both are expected to be very grim news .
Little joy in manufacturing data
First , on Monday , the Institute for Supply Management reports back from purchasing managers at manufacturing firms across the nation .
Although few people outside of the financial markets or the economics profession know what it is , the ISM is probably the best single leading indicator marking the end of a recession .
The ISM is a diffusion index that measures the breadth of economic distress or success across firms .
It asks key executives to judge whether business is getting better or worse .
Once the ISM -- and especially the new - orders component -- turns up decisively , the expansion is typically one to four months away , although in some cases it has turned up as much as a year before the end of a recession .
The ISM plunged to 32.9 % in December -- a level only seen at the depths of the very worst recessions -- but it bounced back to 35.6 % in January , giving some hope that we 'd seen the bottom .
Unfortunately , the ISM is expected to dip back to 34 % in February , according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by MarketWatch , as global export markets worsened and U.S. capital spending remained weak .
The key components to watch will be new orders , export orders and inventories .
Manufacturers ' own inventories are too high , and they judge that their customers ' inventories are too high as well .
Once customer inventories are worked down , factories can get back to work .
Horrendous payroll numbers
If the ISM is forecast to be awful , the nonfarm payrolls report is expected to be horrendous .
The Labor Department is slated to report the figures Friday .
Economists expect payrolls to plunge 630,000 in February , slightly more then the 598,000 lost in January and the 597,000 lost in November .
The unemployment rate is expected to climb to 7.9 % from 7.6 % , breaking through the 7.8 % peak in the 1991 recession to the highest level since 1984 .
It would mean that a record 4.2 million jobs will have been lost since the recession began in December 2007 , with no end in sight .
" Employment losses have deepened considerably in recent months , " wrote economists for Wachovia , who expect total losses for the recession to top 6.5 million .
" With total revenue declining at its worst pace since the late 1950s , many businesses and governments are in survival mode and have no choice but to cut jobs , " Wachovia economists said
The main evidence for a worsening job market has been the rise in unemployment benefits .
First - time claims have risen decisively over 600,000 , nearly double the level at the beginning of the recession .
Continuing claims are at an all - time high .
Consumer surveys also show extreme pessimism about finding a job .
While some forecasters think job losses in February stayed in the ballpark of about 590,000 , a few economists think the labor market got much worse in February and are expecting losses of 650,000 , 700,000 , or in one case , even 800,000 .
The report is " likely to be the weakest to date , " wrote economists for Barclays Capital , who expect payroll losses of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 8 % .
" February was the worst month yet , " said Global Insight 's Bethune and Gault , who are predicting payroll losses of 750,000 and an employment rate of 8 % .
Others have a slightly less dire view , if a loss of 625,000 could be considered upbeat .
" Our sense , admittedly based mostly on anecdotes , is that labor market conditions remain dismal but are not necessarily accelerating to the downside , " wrote Stephen Stanley , chief economist for RBS Greenwich Capital .
Economists expect the number of hours worked to continue plunging as more workers are forced into part - time shifts .
In January , 7.8 million workers wanted to work full time but could only get part - time work .
Average weekly earnings likely rose 0.3 % again , as the lowest - paid occupations took a larger share of job losses .
Worst since ' 49 ?
Or since ' 45 ?
If the economy did shed 630,000 jobs in February as expected , it would be the third largest monthly loss on record , dating back to 1939 .
The record was set in September 1945 , when nearly 2 million people lost their jobs after the Allies won the most destructive war in history and industry was retooling for peacetime , sending " Rosie the Riveter " back to her knitting .
In October 1949 , 834,000 jobs were lost when almost all the nation 's steelworkers went on strike in the final month of a brutal but short recession .
Another strike in July 1956 cost 629,000 jobs , but the next month saw 678,000 jobs regained .
Of course , the size of the workforce is much larger today than it was in 1949 or 1956 .
But as a proportion of the workforce , this recession also is moving up in the record books .
If 630,000 jobs were lost in February , it would bring total losses in this recession to just over 3 % of payrolls , close to the 3.1 % lost in the recessions of 1982 , 1954 and 1949 ( excluding the strike ) .
Next on the list : 4 % in 1958 and 6.9 % in 1945 .
If Wachovia economists are right that 6.5 million will lose their jobs by the end , employment will have fallen by 4.7 % in this recession .
And remember :
These forecasts assume the Federal Reserve will slowly be able to get credit flowing again , and that the recently approved fiscal stimulus will give a significant boost to the economy .

Minsk , Belarus
One of the questions I was repeatedly asked during a recent trip to the capital of Belarus was whether the Obama administration would opt for greater pragmatism at the expense of idealism in foreign policy .
Both the government and opposition in this country have a vested interest in the answer .
As early as next week , the U.S. will decide whether or not to continue sanctions against the country known as " Europe 's last dictatorship . "
The European Union faces fresh choices as well .
NATO sees Belarus as a potential threat to neighboring Lithuania .
Russian tanks stationed in Belarus can be in the Lithuanian capital , Vilnius , in about 90 minutes .
This small nation of 10 million can threaten in other ways : 20 % of EU gas imports from Russia pass through the former Soviet state .
Belarus also remains a notorious human - rights abuser .
In its press - freedom index , Freedom House ranks Belarus 188th out of 195 countries .
Transparency International rates Minsk as more corrupt than Moscow .
Minsk can feel like a time warp : Main avenues in the capital are still named after Lenin , Marx and Engels .
On my trip , I attended a dinner with leading oppositionists in a private room at a local restaurant .
It was private except for the two minders who were stationed about five feet away from us .
At a meeting of former political prisoners at the U.S. embassy to celebrate the 55th anniversary of Radio Liberty broadcasts to Belarus , I met a former trade minister who had served two years for breaking with the regime .
Another young , charismatic businessman had spent six years behind bars for his pro-opposition views .
Researchers at SUNY Downstate Medical Center have apparently been tinkering with selectively erasing the memories of rats with a mysterious drug they call ZIP .
In the trial , mice who had learned to avoid an electrified area of their cage , once injected with ZIP , appeared to have forgotten about the electrification , and ceased to avoid the area .
They have also successfully made the rats forgot about their distaste for a substance that had previously made them sick .
Dr. Todd Sacktor , head of the project , believes that the drug may be used in humans one day , and that it may also help enhance memories as well .
We do n't really have any specific info about the drug itself , or how it works , so until then ... we 'll just have to keep hoping that the lyrics to Use Your Illusion II fade on their own .

The 5,000 year - old eye was unearthed two years ago and is believed to be the oldest prosthetic in the world .
Made of natural tar and animal fat , the eye was placed inside the left eye socket of a 28 - to 32 - year - old woman .
A leather pouch was also found beside the female skeleton appears to have been used to keep the eye when it was removed .
The 5000 - year - old Burnt City is located near the northeastern city of Zabol and spans an area of over 300,000 hectares .
Four civilizations have lived in the city which was burnt down three times and not rebuilt after the last fire .
The world 's oldest animated picture , dice and backgammon set , and caraway seed has been found in Burnt City .
Read more on AMR at Being online while being airborne is fast becoming reality for U.S travelers .
American Airlines ( AMR ) is announcing on Tuesday that it 's joining rival Delta Air Lines ( DAL ) in making Wi -Fi Internet connections available to most domestic passengers .
American , No. 2 in the world in passenger traffic after Delta acquired Northwest Airlines last year , says it will equip more than 300 planes used primarily in the U.S. with high - speed Wi -Fi capability .
Delta said in December that it would offer the service on its planes by the end of this year and on newly acquired Northwest planes by the end of next year .
Virgin America expects to have its fleet of 28 planes outfitted for Wi-Fi by the end of June .
American 's announcement accelerates what largely has been a limited service offered by revenue - starved airlines to see whether passengers would pay for the access .
It follows a six - month trial that Dan Garton , American 's executive vice president of marketing , said gave customers " the chance to choose to remain connected to work , home or elsewhere when flying , " and the airline a chance to study " customers ' willingness to take advantage " of it .
Southwest Airlines ( LUV ) and JetBlue ( JBLU ) also are experimenting with it on planes flying inside the USA .
American 's service will cost laptop users $ 12.95 on flights longer than three hours , and $ 9.95 on shorter ones .
Travelers using handheld devices , such as smartphones and PDAs , will pay $ 7.95 no matter the length of the flight .
The service will be available only after planes reach 10,000 feet so it does n't interfere with communications between the cockpit and air traffic control .
International flights are n't being equipped with American 's Gogo in - flight Wi -Fi system developed by Aircell because it operates on ground - to - air signals from cellular towers .
Southwest is experimenting with a satellite - based system that would allow access on international flights , though it flies only domestic routes .
Despite the airlines ' push to keep customers connected while flying , there 's one service passengers should n't expect soon : cellphone service .
Carriers are reluctant to make cellphone connections available during flights , partly for technical and bandwidth reasons and partly to avoid problems between passengers seeking quiet and those talking loudly to be heard above flight noise .

The Latvian prime minister and his government have resigned amid growing political and economic strife in the Baltic country .
Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis submitted his resignation to the president , Valdis Zatlers , on Friday ( 20 February ) afternoon after the two largest parties in the ruling four - party coalition demanded he step down .
The Latvian parliament :
The president will seek a fresh governing coalition ( Photo : Latvian parliament )
Earlier in the day , Mareks Seglins , the head of the People Party , which held the most seats in the coalition , said that his party and the Union of Greens and Farmers asked him to go .
President Zatlers has said he is to immediately start talks with all parties on the formation of a new government .
Mr Godmanis , of the Latvian Way party - the third largest within the coalition - survived a no-confidence motion in the parliament on 3 February .
The economic crisis has hit Latvia harder than most other EU states , with the country receiving a € 7.5 billion emergency bail - out from the IMF and the EU .
Latvia 's economy contracted by 10.5 percent year on year in the final quarter of 2008 and its GDP is expected to fall 12 percent in 2009 .
The economic collapse has in turn provoked rolling civil unrest , which saw riots in the capital on 13 January and farmers in February blocked roads and surrounded government buildings , ultimately winning the resignation of the agriculture minister .
The fall of Mr Godmanis ' coalition is the first European Union government to fall as a result of the economic crisis , and the second such collapse after Iceland .
[ Haskell - cafe ] ANNOUNCE : Vintage BASIC 1.0
I am pleased to announce the initial release of Vintage BASIC , an interpreter for microcomputer - era BASIC .
Fully unit-tested , it faithfully implements the common elements of the language .
On the web site , you can find 102 games from the classic book BASIC Computer Games , all of which run flawlessly .
Have fun !
This is a standalone interpreter , operating on text files .
Although not an embedding , like Lennart Augustsson 's clever implementation , it does use a custom BASIC monad in order to execute the code .
A unique feature of this implementation is that control structures such as FOR are implemented using resumable exceptions : FOR is a handler and NEXT throws an exception .
A Developer 's Guide is included with the source .
This is my first public release of open source software .
I have been working on this project since 2003 .

Link to live speech :
Update :
Obama started off great with huge applause .
Made a bit of a dig at ASU about not giving him an honorary degree .
Someone just tried to shout down Obama and got booed by the crowd .
Text of the Speech :
Thank you , Father Jenkins , for that generous introduction .
You are doing an outstanding job as president of this fine institution , and your continued and courageous commitment to honest , thoughtful dialogue is an inspiration to us all .
Good afternoon , Father Hesburgh , Notre Dame trustees , faculty , family , friends and the class of 2009 .
I am honored to be here today and grateful to all of you for allowing me to be part of your graduation .
I want to thank you for this honorary degree .
I know it has not been without controversy .
I do n't know if you 're aware of this , but these honorary degrees are apparently pretty hard to come by .
So far I 'm only 1 for 2 as president .
Father Hesburgh is 150 for 150 .
I guess that 's better .
Father
Ted , after the ceremony , maybe you can give me some pointers on how to boost my average .
I also want to congratulate the class of 2009 for all your accomplishments .
And since this is Notre Dame , I mean both in the classroom and in the competitive arena .
We all know about this university 's proud and storied football team , but I also hear that Notre Dame holds the largest outdoor 5 - on - 5 basketball tournament in the world — Bookstore Basketball .
Now this excites me .
I want to congratulate the winners of this year 's tournament , a team by the name of " Hallelujah Holla Back . "
Well done .
Though I have to say , I am personally disappointed that the " Barack O'Ballers " did n't pull it out .
Next year , if you need a 6 - foot , 2 - inch forward with a decent jumper , you know where I live .
Every one of you should be proud of what you have achieved at this institution .
One hundred and sixty - three classes of Notre Dame graduates have sat where you are today .
Some were here during years that simply rolled into the next without much notice or fanfare — periods of relative peace and prosperity that required little by way of sacrifice or struggle .
You , however , are not getting off that easy .
Your class has come of age at a moment of great consequence for our nation and the world — a rare inflection point in history where the size and scope of the challenges before us require that we remake our world to renew its promise ; that we align our deepest values and commitments to the demands of a new age .
It is a privilege and a responsibility afforded to few generations — and a task that you are now called to fulfill .
This is the generation that must find a path back to prosperity and decide how we respond to a global economy that left millions behind even before this crisis hit — an economy where greed and short - term thinking were too often rewarded at the expense of fairness , and diligence , and an honest day 's work .
We must decide how to save God 's creation from a changing climate that threatens to destroy it .
We must seek peace at a time when there are those who will stop at nothing to do us harm , and when weapons in the hands of a few can destroy the many .
And we must find a way to reconcile our ever - shrinking world with its ever - growing diversity — diversity of thought , of culture and of belief .
In short , we must find a way to live together as one human family .
It is this last challenge that I 'd like to talk about today .
For the major threats we face in the 21st century — whether it 's global recession or violent extremism , the spread of nuclear weapons or pandemic disease — do not discriminate .
They do not recognize borders .
They do not see color .
They do not target specific ethnic groups .
Moreover , no one person , or religion , or nation can meet these challenges alone .
Our very survival has never required greater cooperation and understanding among all people from all places than at this moment in history .
Unfortunately , finding that common ground — recognizing that our fates are tied up , as Dr. King said , in a " single garment of destiny " — is not easy .
Part of the problem , of course , lies in the imperfections of man — our selfishness , our pride , our stubbornness , our acquisitiveness , our insecurities , our egos ; all the cruelties large and small that those of us in the Christian tradition understand to be rooted in original sin .
We too often seek advantage over others .
We cling to outworn prejudice and fear those who are unfamiliar .
Too many of us view life only through the lens of immediate self - interest and crass materialism ; in which the world is necessarily a zero - sum game .
The strong too often dominate the weak , and too many of those with wealth and with power find all manner of justification for their own privilege in the face of poverty and injustice .
And so , for all our technology and scientific advances , we see around the globe violence and want and strife that would seem sadly familiar to those in ancient times .
We know these things ; and hopefully one of the benefits of the wonderful education you have received is that you have had time to consider these wrongs in the world , and grown determined , each in your own way , to right them .
And yet , one of the vexing things for those of us interested in promoting greater understanding and cooperation among people is the discovery that even bringing together persons of good will , men and women of principle and purpose , can be difficult .
The soldier and the lawyer may both love this country with equal passion , and yet reach very different conclusions on the specific steps needed to protect us from harm .
The gay activist and the evangelical pastor may both deplore the ravages of HIV / AIDS , but find themselves unable to bridge the cultural divide that might unite their efforts .
Those who speak out against stem cell research may be rooted in admirable conviction about the sacredness of life , but so are the parents of a child with juvenile diabetes who are convinced that their son's or daughter 's hardships can be relieved .
The question , then , is how do we work through these conflicts ?
Is it possible for us to join hands in common effort ?
As citizens of a vibrant and varied democracy , how do we engage in vigorous debate ?
How does each of us remain firm in our principles , and fight for what we consider right , without demonizing those with just as strongly held convictions on the other side ?
Nowhere do these questions come up more powerfully than on the issue of abortion .
As I considered the controversy surrounding my visit here , I was reminded of an encounter I had during my Senate campaign , one that I describe in a book I wrote called " The Audacity of Hope . "
A few days after I won the Democratic nomination , I received an e-mail from a doctor who told me that while he voted for me in the primary , he had a serious concern that might prevent him from voting for me in the general election .
He described himself as a Christian who was strongly pro-life , but that 's not what was preventing him from voting for me .
What bothered the doctor was an entry that my campaign staff had posted on my Web site — an entry that said I would fight " right - wing ideologues who want to take away a woman 's right to choose . "
The doctor said that he had assumed I was a reasonable person , but that if I truly believed that every pro-life individual was simply an ideologue who wanted to inflict suffering on women , then I was not very reasonable .
He wrote , " I do not ask at this point that you oppose abortion , only that you speak about this issue in fair - minded words . "
Fair - minded words .
After I read the doctor 's letter , I wrote back to him and thanked him .
I did n't change my position , but I did tell my staff to change the words on my Web site .
And I said a prayer that night that I might extend the same presumption of good faith to others that the doctor had extended to me .
Because when we do that — when we open our hearts and our minds to those who may not think like we do or believe what we do — that 's when we discover at least the possibility of common ground .
That 's when we begin to say , " Maybe we wo n't agree on abortion , but we can still agree that this is a heart - wrenching decision for any woman to make , with both moral and spiritual dimensions .
So let 's work together to reduce the number of women seeking abortions by reducing unintended pregnancies , and making adoption more available , and providing care and support for women who do carry their child to term .
Let 's honor the conscience of those who disagree with abortion , and draft a sensible conscience clause , and make sure that all of our health care policies are grounded in clear ethics and sound science , as well as respect for the equality of women . "
Understand — I do not suggest that the debate surrounding abortion can or should go away .
No matter how much we may want to fudge it — indeed , while we know that the views of most Americans on the subject are complex and even contradictory — the fact is that at some level , the views of the two camps are irreconcilable .
Each side will continue to make its case to the public with passion and conviction .
But surely we can do so without reducing those with differing views to caricature .
Open hearts .
Open minds .
Fair - minded words .
It 's a way of life that has always been the Notre Dame tradition .
Father Hesburgh has long spoken of this institution as both a lighthouse and a crossroads .
The lighthouse that stands apart , shining with the wisdom of the Catholic tradition , while the crossroads is where " differences of culture and religion and conviction can coexist with friendship , civility , hospitality and especially love . "
And I want to join him and Father Jenkins in saying how inspired I am by the maturity and responsibility with which this class has approached the debate surrounding today 's ceremony .
This tradition of cooperation and understanding is one that I learned in my own life many years ago — also with the help of the Catholic Church .
I was not raised in a particularly religious household , but my mother instilled in me a sense of service and empathy that eventually led me to become a community organizer after I graduated college .
A group of Catholic churches in Chicago helped fund an organization known as the Developing Communities Project , and we worked to lift up South Side neighborhoods that had been devastated when the local steel plant closed .
It was quite an eclectic crew .
Catholic and Protestant churches .
Jewish and African - American organizers .
Working - class black and white and Hispanic residents .
All of us with different experiences .
All of us with different beliefs .
But all of us learned to work side by side because all of us saw in these neighborhoods other human beings who needed our help — to find jobs and improve schools .
We were bound together in the service of others .
And something else happened during the time I spent in those neighborhoods .
Perhaps because the church folks I worked with were so welcoming and understanding ; perhaps because they invited me to their services and sang with me from their hymnals ; perhaps because I witnessed all of the good works their faith inspired them to perform , I found myself drawn — not just to work with the church , but to be in the church .
It was through this service that I was brought to Christ .
At the time , Cardinal Joseph Bernardin was the archbishop of Chicago .
For those of you too young to have known him , he was a kind and good and wise man .
A saintly man .
I can still remember him speaking at one of the first organizing meetings I attended on the South Side .
He stood as both a lighthouse and a crossroads — unafraid to speak his mind on moral issues ranging from poverty , AIDS and abortion to the death penalty and nuclear war .
And yet , he was congenial and gentle in his persuasion , always trying to bring people together ; always trying to find common ground .
Just before he died , a reporter asked Cardinal Bernardin about this approach to his ministry .
And he said , " You can't really get on with preaching the Gospel until you 've touched minds and hearts . "
My heart and mind were touched by the words and deeds of the men and women I worked alongside with in Chicago .
And I 'd like to think that we touched the hearts and minds of the neighborhood families whose lives we helped change .
For this , I believe , is our highest calling .
You are about to enter the next phase of your life at a time of great uncertainty .
You will be called upon to help restore a free market that is also fair to all who are willing to work ; to seek new sources of energy that can save our planet ; to give future generations the same chance that you had to receive an extraordinary education .
And whether as a person drawn to public service , or someone who simply insists on being an active citizen , you will be exposed to more opinions and ideas broadcast through more means of communications than have ever existed before .
You will hear talking heads scream on cable , read blogs that claim definitive knowledge , and watch politicians pretend to know what they 're talking about .
Occasionally , you may also have the great fortune of seeing important issues debated by well - intentioned , brilliant minds .
In fact , I suspect that many of you will be among those bright stars .
In this world of competing claims about what is right and what is true , have confidence in the values with which you 've been raised and educated .
Be unafraid to speak your mind when those values are at stake .
Hold firm to your faith and allow it to guide you on your journey .
Stand as a lighthouse .
But remember too that the ultimate irony of faith is that it necessarily admits doubt .
It is the belief in things not seen .
It is beyond our capacity as human beings to know with certainty what God has planned for us or what he asks of us , and those of us who believe must trust that his wisdom is greater than our own .
This doubt should not push us away from our faith .
But it should humble us .
It should temper our passions , and cause us to be wary of self - righteousness .
It should compel us to remain open , and curious , and eager to continue the moral and spiritual debate that began for so many of you within the walls of Notre Dame .
And within our vast democracy , this doubt should remind us to persuade through reason , through an appeal whenever we can to universal rather than parochial principles , and most of all through an abiding example of good works , charity , kindness and service that moves hearts and minds .
For if there is one law that we can be most certain of , it is the law that binds people of all faiths and no faith together .
It is no coincidence that it exists in Christianity and Judaism ; in Islam and Hinduism ; in Buddhism and humanism .
It is , of course , the golden rule — the call to treat one another as we wish to be treated .
The call to love .
To serve .
To do what we can to make a difference in the lives of those with whom we share the same brief moment on this earth .
So many of you at Notre Dame — by the last count , upwards of 80 percent — have lived this law of love through the service you 've performed at schools and hospitals ; international relief agencies and local charities .
That is incredibly impressive , and a powerful testament to this institution .
Now you must carry the tradition forward .
Make it a way of life .
Because when you serve , it does n't just improve your community , it makes you a part of your community .
It breaks down walls .
It fosters cooperation .
And when that happens — when people set aside their differences to work in common effort toward a common good ; when they struggle together , and sacrifice together , and learn from one another — all things are possible .
After all , I stand here today , as president and as an African - American , on the 55th anniversary of the day that the Supreme Court handed down the decision in Brown v. the Board of Education .
Brown was of course the first major step in dismantling the separate but equal doctrine , but it would take a number of years and a nationwide movement to fully realize the dream of civil rights for all of God 's children .
There were freedom rides and lunch counters and Billy clubs , and there was also a Civil Rights Commission appointed by President Eisenhower .
It was the 12 resolutions recommended by this commission that would ultimately become law in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .
There were six members of the commission .
It included five whites and one African - American ; Democrats and Republicans ; two Southern governors , the dean of a Southern law school , a Midwestern university president , and your own Father Ted Hesburgh , president of Notre Dame .
They worked for two years , and at times , President Eisenhower had to intervene personally since no hotel or restaurant in the South would serve the black and white members of the commission together .
Finally , when they reached an impasse in Louisiana , Father Ted flew them all to Notre Dame 's retreat in Land O ' Lakes , Wis. , where they eventually overcame their differences and hammered out a final deal .
Years later , President Eisenhower asked Father Ted how on Earth he was able to broker an agreement between men of such different backgrounds and beliefs .
And Father
Ted simply said that during their first dinner in Wisconsin , they discovered that they were all fishermen .
And so he quickly readied a boat for a twilight trip out on the lake .
They fished , and they talked , and they changed the course of history .
I will not pretend that the challenges we face will be easy , or that the answers will come quickly , or that all our differences and divisions will fade happily away .
Life is not that simple .
It never has been .
But as you leave here today , remember the lessons of Cardinal Bernardin , of Father Hesburgh , of movements for change both large and small .
Remember that each of us , endowed with the dignity possessed by all children of God , has the grace to recognize ourselves in one another ; to understand that we all seek the same love of family and the same fulfillment of a life well - lived .
Remember that in the end , we are all fishermen .
If nothing else , that knowledge should give us faith that through our collective labor , and God 's providence , and our willingness to shoulder each other 's burdens , America will continue on its precious journey towards that more perfect union .
Congratulations on your graduation , may God bless you , and may God bless the United States of America .

Canonical has unveiled the first fruits of a project that could put applications for Google 's Android on a netbook sooner than the search giant can deliver itself .
Ubuntu 's chief sponsor has demonstrated an execution environment that lets applications built to fit the screen , power , and hardware of an Android smartphone on an Ubuntu - powered PC .
The execution environment potentially lets these applications take advantage of features common to a PC such as support for mouse - based input instead of touch , multiple windows open simultaneously , and have an application run while the CPU is idle .
Demonstrated at the Ubuntu Developer Summit in Barcelona , Spain , the environment lets Android applications work with the PC by harnessing Ubuntu .
It puts patches in place that fool applications into thinking they are on the phone , Canonical told The Reg .
You can see some screen shots here .
Canonical unveiled the project against a backdrop of growing expectation that we 'll soon see the Android operating system for the G1 phone running on a netbook .
Cupcake , the update to Android that began US roll - out this week , is expected to power such machines .
Dell last week showed off a Mini 10 v netbook running Cupcake on a video blog but gave no commitment to product .
It 's unclear how Google would feel about somebody else providing the operating - system layer for Android applications on a PC .
But Canonical believes Ubuntu can provide a quick solution because it 's already done the hard work of getting Linux running on a PC .
" People have thought of Android or Ubuntu on netbooks - we are convinced the way forward will be Android applications on Ubuntu netbooks , " a Canonical source told us .
" You get the full operating system underneath .
For all its faults , desktop Linux has solved lots of complicated problems and Android has n't even started to address them . "
The Ubuntu execution environment compiles the Android code to its own version of libc instead of Google 's libc .
Android libraries are mapped to Ubuntu libraries where appropriate with others masked and fooled into thinking they are running on a phone .
Long term , the project wants to tackle USB keys , printing , and sound .
The Barcelona unveiling was designed to see where people want to go .
" It 's definitely running with our blessing .
We will see where people want to take it this week , and we will go from there , " our source said .
Bootnote
The Canonical project comes as Microsoft and Intel have reportedly taken steps to carve up the netbook market to suit their product roadmaps and business - unit plans .
DigiTimes said the companies had " reached a consensus " to limit the size of a screen for netbooks running Windows to 10.2 inches .
The move means OEMs that go over this size would not qualify for the low - priced versions of Windows 7 - Starter Edition - for netbooks .
OEMs that do go large would see their margins damaged , meaning they'd be forced to fall into line rater than incur losses and Microsoft and Intel would have shaped the form factors for this nascent market to their desire .
Intel refused to comment on what it called rumors and speculation , while Microsoft was unable to comment at the time of going to press .
If true , the move fits what 's emerging as a strategy by Microsoft to use netbooks as a way to up sell people into more expensive , full - featured notebooks and PCs that run Windows .
Pricing for Windows 7 has not been announced , but Windows 7 Starter Edition is an entry level option that will only let you run three applications simultaneously .
The Microsoft and Intel news , combined with the Ubuntu execution environment , would potentially play to Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth 's belief that netbooks should combine local computer processing with offline services and applications . ®
Reports in the British press today say that singing sensation Susan Boyle became upset and uttered a profanity when a Britain 's Got Talent judge praised one of Boyle 's rivals in the popular singing competition .
Boyle became an Internet phenomenon earlier this year when YouTube videos of her performance became hugely popular .
Boyle is a favourite to win the competition , whose judged include American Idol judge Simon Cowell .
According to reports , Boyle was watching the show with more than 100 other guests at a hotel when judge Piers Morgan told 12 - year - old singer Shaheen Jafargholi – who also became popular on YouTube – that the boy had just given ' the best singing performance we have heard in the semi- finals so far . '
The report says Boyle then made a two - fingered gesture at the television and shouted " f--- off ! "
But a spokeswoman for Boyle denied that the 48 - year - old singer was even in the room at the time .
According to the spokeswoman , Boyle had already returned to her room by the time it was Jafargholi 's turn .
It was n't all bad news for Boyle , however , as another big name jumped on her bandwagon .
Kelly Clarkson , the winner of the debut season of American Idol in 2002 , says she 's a fan of surprise British singing star , adding to a growing number of celebrity admirers that already include Oprah Winfrey and Demi Moore .
" I think it 's awesome .
I 'm bawling whenever I hear her sing , " Clarkson told The Associated Press in Hong Kong , saying Boyle 's rendition of " I Dreamed a Dream " from the musical Les Misérables sounded beautiful .
Clarkson was in Hong Kong promoting her new album , All I Ever Wanted .
Boyle , who lives alone with her cat , became one of the world 's hottest celebrities after surprising judges with her singing .
An unemployed church worker from Scotland 's West Lothian district , she captured hearts with her back story of " having never been kissed . "
In late April , Boyle appeared on the cover of The Sun tabloid sporting freshly dyed and styled brown locks and newly shaped eyebrows .

Study : Scientists Discover Active Thermitic Material in WTC Dust
Berkeley , CA , April 3 , 2009 --
A new study by independent scientists and researchers suggests the cause behind the catastrophic destruction of World Trade Center Towers on September 11th can be seen in the dust itself : active thermitic material , a highly engineered explosive .
The study , published today in The Open Chemical Physics Journal , describes a finding of " red / gray bi-layered chips " in samples of dust taken from vicinity of the World Trade Center following its destruction .
Using tools such as a scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) and x-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy ( XEDS ) to analyze the material , the study authors concluded that , " the red portion of these chips is found to be an unreacted thermitic material and highly energetic . "
The study 's finding lends new support to the demolition theory put forth by critics of the official reports .
At a time when the American public is finding it difficult to understand the full story behind the current economic crisis , findings of a demolition raise new questions about how the ' War on Terror ' -- an enormous source of recent American spending -- was started .
Officials with the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) , charged with establishing the cause of the buildings ' destruction , have stated that they " did not test for the residue of these compounds in the steel , " and that thermite , " or another incendiary compound , " would be too difficult to have placed in the buildings without notice .
NIST has stated that such difficulties make demolition unlikely .
They concluded that aircraft impacts and the subsequent fires led to the building failures .
Dr. Steven Jones , physicist and author on the paper , says that NIST has refused to test the dust for thermite , super - thermite , or any other accelerant or explosive .
" We 've repeatedly asked them to follow standard investigative procedure , to perform these tests and release the results .
They have n't . "
Jones says such tests may be required by fire protection codes .
Kevin Ryan , chemist and co-author on the paper , explained why he thinks NIST is wrong .
" What we 've discovered is not conventional thermite -- which is what NIST continues to refer to -- but a highly engineered thermitic material , or ' super thermite ' , probably designed for just this type of application . "
Pre-planned demolition , supporters say , is the ' best - fit ' model for the many unusual and unexplained characteristics of the building failures , such as the speed and symmetry of the collapses , and the extreme pulverization of the materials leading to clouds of micron - sized dust particles , described in one insurance report as behaving similar to a " volcanic eruption " .
" One of the unusual features that piqued my interest , " Jones said , " was the pools of molten metal seen in all three rubble piles , WTC 1 , 2 & 7 . "
NIST officials have published a response stating that the condition of the steel was " irrelevant to the investigation of the collapse . "
Jones , formerly a Professor of Physics with Brigham Young University and known for his work in muon - catalyzed fusion , published in Nature , Scientific American , and the Journal of Physical Chemistry , began researching the 9/11/01 attacks in 2005 .
Jones discovered the curious thermitic material in 2007 , when he ran a magnet over a dust sample given to him by a Manhattan resident survivor of the attack , and found that some particles were attracted to the magnet .
" That was very odd to me , " he said .
Those particles turned out to be iron - rich microspheres , partially described in a 2001 USGS study of the dust .
But to fully analyze , describe and report on the thermitic material would take longer .
Jones was joined in that effort by several others including Dr. Niels Harrit , a chemistry professor with the University of Copenhagen for over 30 years and author of numerous research papers in journals such as Nano Letters , the Journal of the American Chemistry Society , and the Journal of Physical Chemistry A .
Harrit says that he is frequently asked why he researches the September 11th attack .
and says has two answers .
" First , I am opposed to crime , and second , when my 6 grandchildren ask me , ' Grandfather , which side were you on ? '
I will be able to answer them , ' I was on your side ' . "
Co-author Dr. Jeffrey Farrer , a materials scientist and Director of the TEM ( Transmition Electron Microscopy ) laboratory at BYU , says he hopes the paper will " change the way the 9/11 truth movement is viewed by the mainstream public and media . "
And chemist and co-author Kevin Ryan , a former Underwriters Laboratories manager , challenged the NIST report in public statements in 2004 , and was consequently fired .
" This finding really goes beyond anything that has previously been shown , " says Jones .
" We had to use sophisticated tools to analyze the dust because this is n't just a typical explosive , RDX or CD4 or something -- this is a highly engineered material not readily available to just anyone . "
In a 2006 interview with Deseret News , Jones noted that commercial explosives must contain tag elements for traceability , but that no law requires tagging of advanced forms of thermitics .
In 2008 , several of these authors published three articles challenging the official reports in US scientific journals , The Open Civil Engineering Journal , The Environmentalist , and The Journal of Engineering Mechanics Dozens of other papers making similar challenges have been published in the sister publication of the Scholars group , The Journal of 9/11 Studies
Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice is a non-partisan organization of over 700 independent researchers analyzing the September 11 , 2001 attacks with a strong emphasis on the scientific method .

In Part 1 of The Joy of Null I discussed a variety of ways null - equivalent values make it into the software design .
Often times , developer laziness or immutability of the database tier drives many developers to insert values that simulate null values , rather than using a database null itself .
In this second half , I ’ll talk about other ways null - equivalent values arise as well as problems associated with using them .
Part 1 : Revisited
The most consistent comment I saw for why some developers choose to use empty strings instead of null values was for performance reasons .
As I ’ve mentioned on this blog before , database query optimizers are often a loose association of greedy algorithms and indexes , and its certainly possible a DBMS may perform better when a field is an empty string rather than a null , but I doubt its a general rule .
In fact , from a theoretical standpoint , testing whether a field is null should be faster than comparing two strings .
Consider that testing whether a field is null is a binary test , it either is or it is not null .
Alternatively , testing whether a string is empty , or in the more difficult case is a set of blank spaces equivalent to an empty string , requires a string comparison which , depending on how it ’s implemented , could be slow .
I think when people consider performance , they might be referring to the fact that no string = null in a database .
In order to query on null , you must use “ IS NULL ” syntax since ( x = null ) returns false for all values of x , null or otherwise .
Yes , having nulls and empty strings in a query could complicate the logic , but your goal should be to remove the empty strings , not the null values .
Part 2 : Data Ambiguity
The first problem with null - equivalent values is you may unintentionally have more than one of them .
For example , if you consider an empty string to be a null - equivalent value , do you also consider a 1 or more blank spaces null - equivalent ?
If so , your software will have to formulate SQL queries with syntax such as “ trim ( widget ) LIKE ” ” , or alternatively “ length ( trim ( widget ) ) = 0 ” .
Either way , you now have to perform a database function on every string in a table in order to determine if a value is present , whereas “ IS NULL ” should be a lot faster .
The second problem with null - equivalent values is you may intentionally have more than one of them .
I ’m going to refer to enumerated null values as a set of null values that all represent null , but might mean slightly different things .
As one reader pointed out , you may have a DBMS that supports enumerated null values such as NULL_MISSING , NULL_REMOVED , NULL_UNKNOWN , etc . I have no objection to using enumerated nulls except that very few , if any , major DBMS systems support it due to the fact it would be difficult to get a group of developers and DBA ’s to agree on an enumerated set of nulls that would work across all domains .
With that in mind , the vast majority of times enumerated null values are used , they are set as strings in the database .
Such as Name = ‘ NULL_MISSING ’.
This has all the performance and string comparison problems of my previous argument , but one even worse – someone ’s name / data might actually match a null equivalent value .
Your system would be a lot more prone to SQL injection if such a thing were allowed and would require constant conversion between the enumerated value and a useful value in the UI , since you do n’t want to expose NULL_MISSING to the user .
Keep in mind , this includes alternative null - equivalent values such as using - 1 or 0 for a positive numeric field .
At some point - 1 or 0 may be allowed , or accidentally displayed to the user as a real value .
No matter how you set it up , enumerated nulls can often lead to bad data such as the issue with little bobby tables
Finally , there are many times null - equivalent values are used side by side with null values leading to unruly queries such as “ WHERE widget IS NULL OR length ( trim ( widget ) ) = 0 ″ .
As most good DBA ’s already know , disjunctive searching ( using OR ) in SQL queries can significantly hurt a query optimizer .
Disjunctions are among the most common paths query optimizers will ignore because searching them is not possible in real - time .
In short , if you are using an empty string as a null - equivalent value then you should use it everywhere and make the column not nullable .
This will at the least simplify your queries and remove the disjunction .
There are other ways to formulate the query above without disjunctions , such as using the negation of length > 0 , but it still leads to complicated queries .
Part 3 : Choose one
I know there are some developers uncomfortable with using database null or “ IS NULL ” in their queries , so to them I say , at least be consistent .
Either use a null - equivalent value , such as an empty string , everywhere or use null everywhere .
The ambiguity is when you allow both , which in some data models may mean different things .
Overall , allowing both will likely cause a performance hit .
As for which you should choose , null or null - equivalent , if you have strong reason to believe your DBMS will handle empty strings better than null values , then go with empty strings .
I , on the other hand , will stick with database null values since they should be faster for the vast majority of queries .

The lithium ion batteries used in laptops and cellphones , and tipped for future use in electric cars , are approaching their technological limits .
But chemists in the UK say that there ’s a way to break through the looming energy capacity barrier – let the batteries “ breathe ” oxygen from the air .
A standard lithium ion battery contains a negative electrode of graphite , a positive electrode of lithium cobalt oxide , and a lithium salt - containing electrolyte .
Lithium ions shuttle between the two electrodes during charging and discharging , sending electrons around the external circuit to power a gadget in the process .
The problem with that design , says Peter Bruce at the University of St Andrews , is that the lithium cobalt oxide is bulky and heavy .
“ The major barrier to increasing the energy density of these batteries is the positive electrode , ” he says .
“ Everyone wants to find a way to push up the amount of lithium stored there , which would raise the capacity . ”
Advertisement
Breath of fresh air
The answer , he thinks , is to borrow an idea from the zinc - air batteries used in hearing aids , which get their power reacting zinc with oxygen from air .
So , working with colleagues at the Universities of Strathclyde and Newcastle , Bruce has begun designing a lithium - air battery .
The new battery has a higher energy density than existing lithium ion batteries because it no longer contains dense lithium cobalt oxide .
Instead , the positive electrode is made from lightweight porous carbon , and the lithium ions are packed into the electrolyte which floods into the spongy material .
When the battery is discharged , oxygen from the air also floods through a membrane ( see image , top ) into the porous carbon , where it reacts with lithium ions in the electrolyte and electrons from the external circuit to form a solid lithium oxide .
Reversible process
The solid lithium oxide gradually fills the pore spaces inside the carbon electrode as the battery discharges .
But when the battery is recharged the lithium oxide decomposes again , releasing lithium ions again and freeing up pore space in the carbon .
The oxygen is released back to the atmosphere .
Most batteries have all the chemicals they need built in from the start .
“ By using oxygen from the environment instead you save weight and volume because you do n’t have to carry the reagents around inside the battery – you just need the carbon scaffold , ” says Bruce .
The new design is like a battery - fuel cell hybrid , says Bruce .
Like a fuel cell it uses reactants from outside the system , while like a battery it also has internal reactants .
Power boost
The team ’s prototype device has a capacity - to - weight ratio of 4000 milliamp hours per gram – eight times that of a cellphone battery .
Even a 10 - fold improvement is possible , but tweaking conventional lithium - ion designs will likely offer only a doubling in capacity , Bruce estimates .
Chemist Saiful Islam researches batteries at the University of Bath , and was not involved in the new design .
“ My understanding is that the lithium - air battery indeed has the potential to deliver an eight - to - 10 - fold increase in energy density , ” he told New Scientist .
However , work is still needed to fully understand the processes taking place in the novel battery , he adds .
That should help optimise the technology so it can become a commercially viable product .
Bruce and colleagues are now working to transform their proof - of - principle version into a small working battery like those used in mobile electronic devices .
“ But the technology could be just as important for electric and hybrid vehicles in future , ” Bruce points out .
But Michele A. Flournoy , the under secretary of defense for policy , said of the detainees : “ I think there will be some that need to end up in the United States . ”
Pentagon officials said there had been no pressure from the Obama White House to suppress the report about the Guantánamo detainees who had been transferred abroad under the Bush administration .
The officials said they believed that Defense Department employees , some of them holdovers from the Bush administration , were acting to protect their jobs .
The report is the subject of numerous Freedom of Information Act requests from news media organizations , and Mr. Whitman said he expected it to be released shortly .
The report , a copy of which was made available to The New York Times , says the Pentagon believes that 74 prisoners released from Guantánamo have returned to terrorism or militant activity , making for a recidivism rate of nearly 14 percent .
The report was made available by an official who said the delay in releasing it was creating unnecessary “ conspiracy theories ” about the holdup .
A Defense Department official said there was little will at the Pentagon to release the report because it had become politically radioactive under Mr. Obama .
“ If we hold it , then everybody claims it ’s political and you ’re protecting the Obama administration , ” said the official , who asked for anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation .
“ And if we let it go , then everybody says you ’re undermining Obama . ”
Previous assertions by the Pentagon that substantial numbers of former Guantánamo prisoners had returned to terrorism were sharply criticized by civil liberties and human rights groups who said the information was too vague to be credible and amounted to propaganda in favor of keeping the prison open .
The Pentagon began making the assertions in 2007 but stopped earlier this year , shortly before Mr. Obama took office .
Amidst all the hubbub about last year ’s Farm Bill , which healthy food advocates criticized for maintaining the commodity subsidies that make “ Big , Unhealthy Ag ” profitable , young farmers - to - be might have missed a few small but significant changes worth celebrating .
The 2008 Bill has new and expanded provisions for beginning farmers and ranchers , a demographic that needs the support of everyone who eats .
Earlier this month , the USDA ’s 2007 Ag Census reported that the average age of the American farmer is 57 , up from 55 in 2002 ’s Census .
We are now a nation at risk of losing a generation of farmers who know how to adapt their means of agriculture to the particular piece of land on which they stand .
That knowledge is critical to a sound , sustainable food system and would take many more generations to reaccumulate .
If we want to ensure that our food is safe and nutritious , then we ’d better convince a whole lot of young people to become farmers or to keep farming their family ’s land , and we ’d better do it fast .
Like me , many young people who imagine themselves future farmers are city - born , office - bound and for the most part unfamiliar with the federal government ’s programs to support farmers .
To learn more about them , I consulted the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition ’s “ Grassroots Guide to the 2008 Farm Bill ” and listened to a recording of a panel discussion on “ New and Beginning Farmer Opportunities from the Farm Bill ” that convened at last month ’s Eco -Farm Conference .
I ’m compiling what I ’ve learned into the list that appears below .
I should be clear that this list is an overview and only gives an idea of what ’s out there to help new farmers .
If you ’d like to dig deeper , please read the full text of NSAC ’s Guide or read the USDA ’s lengthy but comprehensive “ Provisions for Traditionally Underserved Groups in the 2008 Farm Bill . ”
Consider this list a call to action .
If enough of us young farmers - to - be contact our local Farm Services Agencies to ask about these programs , if enough of us apply for these loans and grants and if enough of us demand that these policies be put into action , then legislators will come to see that there ’s a groundswell of young people who are passionate about farming and who feel a personal duty to grow and share real food .
When the next Farm Bill comes up for reauthorization in four years , politicians must feel our pressure to respond to the food , agriculture and health needs of the people .
Here are some places to begin :
Get the latest articles in your inbox .
• The Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program funds competitive grants for education , extension , outreach and technical assistance initiatives to help beginning farmers and ranchers get started .
The grants go to community - based organizations ( like California Farm Link and the Center for Rural Affairs ) , university extension agencies and state agencies that link retiring farmers with new farmers looking for land , train new farmers in business practices , create on - farm apprenticeships and so on .
The 2008 Farm Bill mandates $ 75 million in funding for the program and authorizes an additional $ 30 million a year for appropriations , so keep an eye out for organizations and agencies in your area that will soon be able to expand or launch their programs to train new farmers .
• The Beginning Farmer and Rancher Individual Development Accounts Pilot Program helps beginning farmers finance farm purchases and operations through matched - savings accounts .
Beginning farmers who are eligible ( i.e. do n’t already have the money to buy a farm ) can start a savings account and have their deposits matched one - to - one or two - to - one by the government , i.e. , if you deposit $ 100 a month , the government will deposit either $ 100 or $ 200 a month along with you .
The 2008 Farm Bill authorizes $ 5 million for the program , but Congress has n’t appropriated that funding yet .
If they appropriate it this year , the program would probably begin in 2010 .
• Loan Set - Asides are government credit programs that are targeted at beginning farmers who have little credit history and find it hard to convince banks to loan them money to purchase farms .
In order to address “ the aging of American agriculture and the loss of minority land ownership , ” the 2008 Farm Bill raises the percentage of Direct Farm Ownership and Operating Loans ( where the government loans the money directly ) and Guaranteed Farm Ownership Loans ( where the government guarantees the bank ’s loan ) that are reserved for beginning or socially disadvantaged farmers to 75 % , 40 % and 50 % , respectively .
Point is , the government will give you or help you get loans .
• The Down Payment Loan Program is a credit program that ’s specific to finding the money to purchase a farm .
If a beginning farmer can make a down payment equivalent to 5 % of a piece of land ’s value , then the government will cover the next 45 % of the loan at an interest rate that is 4 % lower than the loan rate established by the USDA ’s Farm Services Agency .
The remaining 50 % of the loan can come from a bank or private lender .
The 2008 Farm Bill decreased the down payment to this percentage from 10 % and decreased the interest rate to this percentage from 4 % , both of which are significant improvements .
• The Conservation Reserve Program seeks to conserve and improve soil , water and wildlife resources by temporarily renting land from farmers and removing it from agricultural production .
A brand - new Transition Option for Beginning Farmers and Ranchers provides an extra two years of rental payments to landowners whose Conservation Reserve contract is about to end if the landowner agrees to then rent or sell their land to a beginning farmer or rancher .
The new farmer must agree to graze animals or grow crops sustainably and can transition to organic agriculture .
This program is new to the 2008 Farm Bill .
• The Contract Land Sales Program provides an incentive for farm transitions in the form of loan guarantees to retiring farmers who can self - finance the sale of their land to beginning farmers .
The 2008 Farm Bill makes this program permanent and available nationwide .
• The Environmental Quality Incentives Program gives financial cost - share assistance and technical help to farmers who voluntarily implement conservation practices like water and energy conservation or ( new this year ) responsible forest management and organic agriculture .
In the 2008 Farm Bill , beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers are eligible for cost - share rates 25 % above the usual rate and up to 90 % of the practice costs .
That ’s substantial help for young farmers looking to try smart and innovative farm practices .
• The Value - Added Producer Grants Program gives competitive grants to farmers and ranchers seeking to create or develop value - added , producer - owned businesses .
“ Value - added ” refers to an agricultural crop or product that has been transformed or marketed in a way that enhances its value to consumers , e.g. apples that the farm turns into apple cider or beef that ’s grass - fed and can be sold at a higher price .
In addition to improving the program ’s scope ( “ local ” is now considered value - added ) and application process , the 2008 Farm Bill advises the USDA to grant priority to projects that increase opportunities for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers .
The Farmers ’ Market Promotion Program and Rural Cooperative Development Grants also give priority to beginning farmers .
• The Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance Program is a new program in the 2008 Farm Bill to provide potential entrepreneurs in rural areas with the skills necessary to establish new businesses and continue operating existing small businesses .
The loans and grants go to regional non-profits , Indian tribes and public institutions that create skills training programs and grant micro-loans to new entrepreneurs .
The 2008 Farm Bill authorizes $ 15 million in mandatory funding for the program .
If you ’re looking for advice and technical help on starting a small business ( local food marketing ?
kitchen garden installation ? ) in a rural area , watch for new and expanded training programs in your area .
• There are also a number of new or expanded resources in the 2008 Farm Bill that are not specific to beginning farmers but that are generally available to small - and medium - scale , diversified , organic and environmentally responsible farms :
The Conservation Stewardship Program , The Organic Certification Cost - Share Program , The Rural Energy for America ( REAP ) Program and Community Food Project Grants .
The 2007 Ag Census shows that young farmers starting or taking over operations tend to farm in ways that can benefit from these programs , so young farmers - to - be should read through all of them .
In sum , there is a toolkit of resources available to young people who want to learn to farm , to purchase a farm or to try out new farm practices .
I had this in mind last week while attending a panel discussion at UC Berkeley on local meat production .
There , I was surprised to hear Mac MacGruder , a local rancher , tell a crowd of students , “ For the first time in thirty years , I think you can make a living at this . ”
Take that to heart .

As clean tech research develops fuels synthesized from nature ’s ingredients , algae has become synonymous with protecting the environment .
However many algal strains are toxic enough to cause massive fish and coral die - offs .
photo credit : Lee Nachtigal
Algae has been touted as an all - important source of fuel in the new energy economy .
Algal oil , which is produced by algae can be used to produce biodiesel .
Micro algae multiplies very quickly making it an ideal product to farm .
One acre of algae can produce between 5,000 and 20,000 gallons of oil that can be converted to biodiesel .
Biodiesel production from algal oil has the potential to produce the amount of biodiesel needed to completely replace gasoline .
However the fact that algae multiplies rapidly , is also the cause for potentially fatal algal blooms in natural water bodies throughout the world .
Â
The specific names of algae vary based upon the species of microscopic plant .
However , the basic mechanism of these phytoplankton , which thrive in oceans , rivers or lakes alike , is the same .
Under certain favorable conditions , they can multiply so rapidly they form dense toxic patches known as an algal bloom .
A study conducted by the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi ( EAD ) has identified a dominant strain of algae called Gymnodinium catenatum .
This phytoplankton that is toxic to people if eaten in seafood .
Effects range include gastrointestinal problems , neurological disorders , and possibly even death .
As the algae dies , it sinks to the bottom of the ocean , where it rots , consuming large amounts of oxygen in the process .
This lack of oxygen then leads to the eventual kill - off of marine life in the area .
Toxic algal blooms are on the rise in many parts of the world .
Already , this phenomenon has devastated marine life and industry in the waters around Texas , New York , Bulgaria and Dubai .
Â
It is not clear why such blooms are taking place however , there is a growing belief among many biologists that the urbanization of coastlines could play a major role .
â€ œHarmful blooms are having more impact , in my view because human exploitation of the coastal zone is having more impact , â€ says Tim Wyatt , who compiles a newsletter on behalf of the Harmful Algal Bloom Program of UNESCOâ€™s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission ( IOC ) .
Dr Dr Thabit Zahran al Abdessalaam , director of marine biodiversity management at EAD , stresses the importance of maintaining the natural profile of water bodies which can be seriously affected by man-made interventions .
Introducing new breakwaters , creating confined areas and slowing down water circulation all help create favorable conditions for algal blooms .

Undergraduate general psychology students listening to podcasts from a lecture of their professor who took notes while listening to the podcast scored significantly higher than the students attending the in - class lecture condition on the exam on lecture content .
Ten years ago I would have given about 7 days of lectures to hordes of medical students , 2 to 3 hundred in each lecture each 3 months .
Interaction hardly possible .
Nowadays these lectures are mostly presentations of patient problems and life patients demonstrations .
In a whole year the number of lectures for medical students can be counted on the fingers of two hands .
The results of this study are in no way an indication that audio copies of lectures could or should replace actual professors , or even regular class attendance .
The advantage the students in our study received was only when the student took notes as they would do during a lecture , and when they listened to the lecture more than once .
In essence , the same things a student does during the actual lecture , they would need to do to show a benefit of the podcast .
The authors are very cautious with their conclusions .
In the results section an initial t- test revealed that the students in the podcast condition scored significantly higher on the exam in session two than the students in the in - class lecture .
Only with further analysis it was discovered that those who took notes during the podcast were responsible for this significant difference .
The others did not differ significantly with the in class lectures .
This cautiousness is probably due to the critique by their fellow professors on campus : …. generated much debate among our colleagues on campus was that in this study the podcast condition was not used to enhance a college lecture ( perhaps giving students who attended the actual lecture a chance to listen to it again ) , but rather was in place of attending the lecture .
Another evident advantage of the podcast compared to the in - class lecture was that they were able to listen to the lecture several times , the in - class lecture group only had their notes .
Overall of the 66 students that completed the experiment , 57 of them owned mp3 players ( 86 % ) .
Twenty - eight out of the 57 also had video capabilities on their players ( 49 % ) .
While 57 of the participants had mp3 players , only 3 students in the study had ever listened to podcasts before ( 5 % ) , and none of the students had ever listened to a podcast of a classroom lecture .
The average amount of time the students who had mp3 players spent listening to them each day was 1.67 h ( SD = 1.20 h ) .
The most common answer to the question of time spent listening was 1 h per day .
In the podcast condition the ProfCast software to record the lecture had the addition of chapter markers into the podcast .
With each PowerPoint slide a chapter marker was created , this feature was very appreciated by the students and at least 88 % of the students in the ProfCast condition preferred the podcasts .
How was this study done ?
In the lecture condition , participants listened to a 25 - min lecture given in person by a professor using PowerPoint slides .
Copies of the slides were given to aid note - taking .
In the podcast condition , participants received a podcast of the same lecture along with the PowerPoint handouts .
Participants in both conditions were instructed to keep a running log of study time and activities used in preparing for an exam .
One week from the initial session students returned to take an exam on lecture content .
It is only needed to study the kind of material , the complexity of the lectures that might benefit the most from ProfCasts .
Replication in larger groups and different studies are very welcome .
What do you think can professors be replaced by podcasts ?

District attorney 's investigators raided City College of San Francisco on Wednesday , seeking evidence that college officials had illegally spent public money on donations to education - related political campaigns .
A copy of a search warrant served on the college shows that investigators are scrutinizing the actions of former Chancellor Philip Day , who left the college last year to work for an education lobbying firm in Washington , D.C .
Investigators searched Day 's former office , now occupied by Chancellor Don Griffin .
The offices of Peter Goldstein , vice chancellor of finance , and Stephen Herman , dean of administrative services , also were searched , said an official who saw the searches under way .
Investigators were seeking documents concerning donations to the political campaigns of two city bond measures that benefited the college and two state initiatives that sought increased funding for community colleges , the search warrant says .
The Chronicle disclosed in 2007 that college officials had diverted $ 10,000 in public money to political donations for a $ 246.3 million college bond measure that San Francisco voters approved in 2005 .
A county grand jury then began investigating Day and his aides on suspicion of violating state laws against misusing public funds and failing to make accurate reports of political donations , college documents show .
An internal probe ordered last year by City College 's trustees found a continuing pattern of political fundraising abuses at the school .
Some transactions appeared to violate state law , wrote lawyers for the firm of Renne , Sloan , Holtzman & Sakai , which conducted the investigation .
Day , now the head of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators , could not be reached for comment Wednesday .
In an interview last year , he denied that he had ever misused college funds or failed to report political donations accurately .
" That did not happen , " he said at the time .
" That is not true . "
Martha Lucey , City College 's dean of public information , said , " Any comment should come from the D.A . "
Erica Derryck , spokeswoman for District Attorney Kamala Harris , declined to comment .
Matthew Siroka , an attorney for Goldstein , said the raid was needlessly disruptive .
" The college has bent over backwards to cooperate " with prosecutors , Siroka said .
" Most of what was seized today were ( copies of ) documents that had already been turned over . "
The search warrant indicates that investigators are focusing on these transactions :
-- A $ 10,000 donation to the 2005 bond campaign , made by a motorcycle driving school that leases a parking lot at City College .
The school 's president told The Chronicle that the $ 10,000 was a lease payment he owed to the college , but that Assistant Vice Chancellor James Blomquist told him to make it a donation to the bond campaign instead .
Blomquist later acknowledged steering the payment to the bond campaign , saying he had n't realized he was doing anything wrong .
-- A $ 20,000 donation to the 2005 bond campaign , made by a cafe owner who had just won a contract to operate a coffee bar at the college .
The cafe owner owed the money to the college , but it was given to the bond campaign , records show .
Before the election , the donation was refunded and the cafe owner paid the money to the college , Day said .
-- $ 30,000 in donations to the same bond campaign , made by two women with ties to the operator of vending trucks that sold food on campus .
The donations were made shortly after the vendor obtained a new five - year contract , records show .
Day said the food vendor was simply a friend of the college .
-- More than $ 28,000 in donations to two 2006 state education measures , made by the college 's nonprofit foundation .
Unlike the college , the foundation was legally permitted to make political donations .
According to the report by the college 's internal investigators , the $ 28,000 was owed to the college by PepsiCo on its contract to sell beverages on campus .
Day , through his aide Herman , instructed PepsiCo to make the payments to the foundation , which then donated the money to the political campaigns , the internal report said .
At the time , Vice Chancellor Goldstein expressed discomfort with the PepsiCo transaction , apparently for legal reasons , the report said .
-- An additional $ 10,000 in donations to the same state measures , also from the foundation .
According to the internal investigation , Day used $ 7,000 from the college bookstore and $ 3,000 from the cafe owner who operated the coffee shop to finance this donation , but had it made in the foundation 's name .
At Day 's direction , the foundation repaid the $ 10,000 to the college in 2007 , after The Chronicle began reporting on political fundraising abuses at the college , the internal report said .

Here 's a purely hypothetical scenario .
Let 's say you were a dedicated imperial militarist who believed that your country 's security , prestige and financial interests could best be served by war and the ever - present threat of war .
Let 's say you had some really hot and juicy operations going on , endless deadly conflicts that were pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into your war machine and entrenching national policy even more deeply in the militarist philosophy – the machtpolitik – that you believe in .
But there 's a problem .
The general public – the cow - like herd out there that does n't understand grand strategy the way you and your fellow elites do – is growing weary , and wary , of your Long War .
The national treasury is bankrupt , the national infrastructure is rotting , the nation 's communities are dying ; millions of people are out of work , losing their homes , losing their dreams , spiraling down into want , privation and despair .
Yet you have big plans to escalate the war , expand your war machine , and maintain the global dominance that you believe is the right and natural role for your special nation – and its elites .
What to do ?
How to galvanize the truculent , self - absorbed herd into enthusiastically supporting your vital agenda once more ?
Well , here 's one purely hypothetical approach you might try .
You goad and provoke violent extremist groups into retaliating against your attacks , your civilian - slaughtering invasions and incursions into their territory .
Being unable to confront directly your war machine – the largest , most advanced military force in the history of the world , sustained by a tsunami of public money that each year surpasses the military spending of the rest of the world – they naturally respond with " asymmetrical " operations .
At first , these are directed at nearby targets : your supply lines , the forces of your local proxies and allies , and other chaos - inducing depredations in the groups ' own regions , designed to foul the lines of your control and drive you out .
Just as naturally , you use these attacks to justify an even greater military presence in their regions .
The cycle inevitably , inexorably ratchets upwards and outwards , until at last the extremists strike at your homeland – either with your connivance , or your covert acquiescence , or , in any event , with your foreknowledge that such an attack was sure to come .
This is the moment you have waited for ; this is exactly what you wanted .
Now you can whip the herd back into a martial frenzy , keep the Long War going , and push aside the rabble 's petty , small - minded desires for a peaceful , prosperous life at home , minding their own business .
One never knows exactly what goes on behind the imperial drapery in the Potomac palaces , of course ; ordinary American citizens were long ago turned into Kremlinologists of their own government , trying to discern -- through ceremonial signs , backstairs gossip , and slight deviations in ritualized rhetoric -- just what their masters are really up to .
But some cynics darkly suspect that scenarios something like the one sketched out above have already been enacted ; for instance , in the " new Pearl Harbor " that struck America on September 11 , 2001 – one year after a group channeling the views of future Bush Administration bigwigs ( including Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , Scooter Libby and many others ) had openly pined for a " new Pear Harbor " to " catalyze " the American people into supporting their militarist agenda , which included an invasion of Iraq – whether Saddam Hussein was in power or not .
But leaving aside for now the ever - thorny matter of divining the varying proportion of connivance , acquiescence , foreknowledge , exploitation , incompetence and fate involved in 9/11 , we can say this as an established fact :
It is the policy of the United States government to provoke violent extremist groups into action .
Once they are in play , their responses can then be used in whatever way the government that provoked them sees fit .
And we also know that these provocations are being used , as a matter of deliberate policy , to rouse violent groups on the " Af - Pak " front to launch terrorist attacks .
In other words , just as I first wrote in the Moscow Times more than six years ago ( and followed up three years later ) , the United States is deliberately fomenting terrorist attacks in order to pursue its political and military agendas .
[ For more on how these policies and similar uses of terrorism and death squads have been realized in Iraq and elsewhere , see " A Furnace Seal'd : The Wondrous Death Squads of the American Elite , " " Ulster on the Euphrates : The Anglo - American Dirty War in Iraq , " and " Willing Executioners : America 's Bipartisan Atrocity Deepens in Somalia . " ]
Eagle - eyed Jason Ditz at Antiwar.com draws the connection between this policy and the most recent " asymmetrical " strike by a " tickled " terrorist group in Pakistan : the deadly attack on a police center in Lahore by the Tehreek-e Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) .
The group , led by Baitullah Mehsud , said the attack was in retaliation for the American campaign of drone strikes in Pakistan 's frontier regions – strikes which have killed many civilians along with usually unidentified " militants . "
As Ditz notes , one goal of the campaign – which has been intensified by Barack Obama – is precisely the aforementioned fomenting of terrorist activity :
The Obama Administration has launched an ever growing number of attacks in the FATA , generally aimed at Mehsud ’s training facilities in North and South Waziristan .
In September , then - CIA Director Michael Hayden said the attacks were an attempt to “ provoke a reaction ” from the militant groups led by Mehsud .
It appears that now , six months later , they have finally done so .
[ Hayden described this bloodsoaked strategy as " tickling " terrorists into a response . ]
What 's more , Mehsud has now vowed to carry the fight back to American soil .
As The Times notes ( via Antiwar.com ) :
“ Soon we will launch an attack in Washington that will amaze everyone in the world , " [ Mehsud declared . ]
" The maximum they can do is martyr me .
But we will exact our revenge on them from inside America . "
Whether or not the rag - tag TTP could actually carry out such a threat is another matter , as Juan Cole notes .
But that is not really the point .
The point is that once again , a violent group has been knowingly prodded into murderous action .
Even better , it has now set itself up as a " deadly terrorist threat " to the sacred Homeland itself : yet another made - to - order supervillain from central casting .
And remarkably , this new , open threat to bring terror to the American heartland comes just days after Barack Obama announced his vaunted surge in the Af - Pak War , citing – what else ?
– the need to protect the United States from terrorists based in Afghanistan and Pakistan as his chief reason for escalating and expanding the conflict .
Yet another astonishing coincidence to justify the militarist agenda , which needs a constant supply of PR - plausible villains and hyped - up , nation - rattling threats like a junkie needs smack .
And once again , we are left to puzzle out the varying proportion of connivance , acquiescence , exploitation , luck , etc. , involved in this serendipitous pairing of declarations from Obama and Mehsud .
II .
It is worth looking again at the implications of this policy of terrorist - tickling .
As we noted recently , such things are not just counters on the Great Gameboard : they are deadly realities that kill , maim and despoil multitudes of innocent people around the world .
So let 's go back to the first glimmers of this strategy in its Terror War context .
This is from the Moscow Times article in November 2001 :
In [ a Los Angeles Times ] article by military analyst William Arkin ... [ comes ] the revelation of Rumsfeld 's plan to create " a super - Intelligence Support Activity " that will " bring together CIA and military covert action , information warfare , intelligence , and cover and deception . "
According to a classified document prepared for [ Donald ]
Rumsfeld by his Defense Science Board , the new organization – the " Proactive , Preemptive Operations Group ( P2OG ) " – will carry out secret missions designed to " stimulate reactions " among terrorist groups , provoking them into committing violent acts which would then expose them to " counterattack " by U.S. forces .
In other words – and let 's say this plainly , clearly and soberly , so that no one can mistake the intention of Rumsfeld 's plan – the United States government is planning to use " cover and deception " and secret military operations to provoke murderous terrorist attacks on innocent people .
Let 's say it again : Donald Rumsfeld , Dick Cheney , George W. Bush and the other members of the unelected regime in Washington plan to deliberately foment the murder of innocent people – your family , your friends , your lovers , you – in order to further their geopolitical ambitions .
For P2OG is not designed solely to flush out terrorists and bring them to justice – a laudable goal in itself , although the Rumsfeld way of combating terrorism by causing it is pure moral lunacy ...
No , it seems the Pee - Twos have bigger fish to fry .
Once they have sparked terrorists into action – by killing their family members ?
luring them with loot ?
fueling them with drugs ?
plying them with jihad propaganda ?
messing with their mamas ?
or with agents provocateurs , perhaps , who infiltrate groups then plan and direct the attacks themselves ?
– they can then take measures against the " states / sub- state actors accountable " for " harboring " the Rumsfeld - roused gangs .
What kind of measures exactly ?
Well , the classified Pentagon program puts it this way : " Their sovereignty will be at risk . "
The Pee - Twos will thus come in handy whenever the Regime hankers to add a little oil - laden real estate or a new military base to the Empire 's burgeoning portfolio .
Just find a nest of violent malcontents , stir 'em with a stick , and presto : instant " justification " for whatever level of intervention / conquest / rapine you might desire .
Scientists at the University of Utah report that the genes of offspring are modified in the womb as a result of the mother ’s diet , emphasizing that what the mother eats ( or does n’t eat ) influences the health of the child throughout its life .
“ The new ‘ epigenetics ’ has taught us how nature is changed by nurture .
The jury ’s in and , yes , expectant moms really are eating for two .
This study shows not only that we need to address problems such as preeclampsia during pregnancy , but also that prenatal care is far more important than anyone could have imagined a decade ago . ” – Gerald Weissmann , M.D. , Editor - in - Chief of FASEB Journal
[ social_buttons ]
The science of epigenetics explains how genes can be modified by the environment , and according to the new study published in FASEB ( Journal of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology ) , “ You are what your mother did not eat during pregnancy . ”
The research found that rat fetuses which received poor nutrition in the womb were genetically primed to be born into an environment lacking proper nutrition .
As a result , the offspring were more likely to be smaller , as well as being at higher risk for lifelong health problems , such as obesity , diabetes , cardiovascular disease , growth retardation , and neurodevelopmental delays .
The authors of the study stated that the genes and cellular mechanisms affected are the same in rats as in humans , and therefore the same links can be made for humans .
“ Our study emphasizes that maternal–fetal health influences multiple healthcare issues across generations .
To reduce adult diseases such as diabetes , obesity , and cardiovascular disease , we need to understand how the maternal–fetal environment influences the health of offspring . ” – Robert Lane , professor of pediatric neonatology at the University of Utah
The experiments used two groups of rats , a control group and a restricted nutrient group .
The group receiving restricted nutrients ( through the placenta ) was examined after birth and at 21 days old ( preadolescent age for rats ) and measured for IGF - 1 , a protein responsible for normal growth and development .
Researchers found that the lack of nutrients in the second group caused the gene responsible for IGF - 1 to significantly reduce the amount produced in the body both before and after birth .

Having followed Pandora 's progress for nearly a decade , I 've seen the company do just about everything one can do with interactive radio — except for turn a profit .
That will change in 2010 , according to Pandora founder Tim Westergren .
He told Bloomberg on Monday that Pandora could make as much as $ 40 million in revenue this year — and that it will become profitable for the first time next year on the strength of its seemingly ever - expanding user base and an iPhone app that attracts around 20,000 new users each day .
Pandora 's iPhone app has " changed the perception people have of what internet radio is , from computer - radio to radio , because you can take the iPhone and just plug it into your car , or take it to the gym , " he explained .
Earlier this year , Pandora started including audio ads in addition to banners , further buttressing its bottom line .
Westergren said Pandora listeners can soon expect more 15 - second audio ads — as many as three per hour .
But compared to terrestrial radio , with its incessant nattering about doomed car dealerships , this practically constitutes commercial - free listening .
What about those royalty payments that once threatened to drive Pandora out of business ?
Westergren said he 's " never been more optimistic than [ he is ] now " about the prospect of that situation being favorably resolved .
As the rest of the economy crumbles , it 's heartening to see a free , labor - intensive , ad - supported , royalty - paying interactive music service like Pandora thrive like this .

Britain : Another “ terror scare ” revealed as baseless
By Julie Hyland
28 April 2009
Only the most damning political conclusions can be drawn from the admission that 12 people rounded up in a major terror scare in Britain have all been released without charge .
Once again hysterical claims of an impending terrorist atrocity have proven baseless .
The 12 men—11 Pakistani nationals and one Briton — were arrested on April 8 in a series of high - profile swoops in Liverpool and Manchester .
Armed anti-terror police raided several premises in an operation that Prime Minister Gordon Brown claimed had uncovered a “ very big plot ” against the UK .
One young man was arrested by officers carrying machine guns as he ate his lunch outside Liverpool ’s John Moores University ( ten of the men are students at various northwest colleges and universities ) .
Two other men were detained at the DIY store where they worked .
The media claimed the men had been planning to carry out a series of Al Qaeda - type explosions — potentially including suicide bombings — over the Easter holidays , targeting major public venues .
Despite holding the men for up to 13 days , searching their homes , computers and personal papers , police found nothing to substantiate these claims .
It transpires that not only was no terrorist attack “ imminent , ” there is no evidence it was even in preparation .
The Crown Prosecution Service has concluded there are no grounds for any charges and police failed to convince magistrates that they should hold the men any longer .
Police can detain people for up to 28 days without charge under Britain ’s anti-terror laws .
The men appear to be so blameless that there is no evidence of any misdemeanour .
But that has not stopped police handing over the Pakistani nationals to the UK Border Agency for deportation .
A spokesman for the prime minister claimed that they were to be removed “ on grounds of national security .
The government ’s highest priority is to protect public safety .
Where a foreign national poses a threat to the country , we will seek to exclude or deport them where appropriate . ”
In a further infringement of the men ’s democratic rights , their cases are to be put before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission , which is not subject to the burden of proof required in a criminal case .
The supposed “ evidence ” supporting their deportation will be heard in secret .
Without a shred of evidence , their education is to be disrupted and they are to be banned from the country .
What fate will await them in Pakistan under such conditions is another matter for concern .
The moves have been condemned by the men ’s representatives .
Lawyer Mohammed Ayub stated , “ After 13 days in custody , during which no evidence of any wrongdoing was disclosed , they have now been released without charge .
“ Our clients have no criminal history , they were here lawfully on student visas and all were pursuing their studies and working part - time .
Our clients are neither extremists nor terrorists . ”
Inayat Bunglawala , of the Muslim Council of Britain , said the government had been “ dishonourable ” in its treatment of those arrested .
Their detention “ took place in very dramatic circumstances of students being arrested at university and thrown to the floor , ” he said , with authorities claiming they posed a serious threat to the public .
Such claims represented political interference in the legal process , he continued .
It was unacceptable for the government to make such prejudicial remarks , and then , having failed to substantiate them , deport the men anyway .
Executive action
The media have described the release of the 12 as a humiliation for the government and the police .
The suggestion is that the raids were moved forward after Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick — Britain ’s leading anti-terror officer — allowed a top secret document on the raids to be photographed when he went to brief ministers on the operation at Downing Street .
He resigned the following day .
To reduce the issue to one of “ embarrassment ” in ruling circles , however , is to trivialise the issues raised by this latest “ anti- terror ” scare and its ramifications for democratic rights .
The Guardian reported that “ Investigators had desperately hoped they would find something at the suspects ’ homes .
But after initially hunting for , and failing to find , bomb - making equipment , they turned to the computers with their fingers crossed that some evidence of a plot would turn up .
They found nothing substantial . ”
“ Desperately hoped , ” “ fingers crossed , ” “ turn up . ”
What type of security operation is initiated on a wing and a prayer , and why ?
Ever since the 9/11 atrocities , and especially since the London bombings in July 2005 , the government and the security services have cynically manipulated public anxieties over potential terrorist attacks .
The latest raids followed an all - too familiar pattern .
A major plot is supposedly discovered just on the eve of its execution .
The media , ministers and so - called “ terror experts ” warn of the dire threat to life and limb that was only narrowly averted thanks to swift police action .
Time subsequently reveals that much of this was hype .
The vast majority of those arrested under anti-terror legislation are never charged with terrorist activity .
In the few instances that do come to court , it usually transpires that much of the original claims made about the “ plot ” were built up out of all proportion .
In the meantime , the scare has served its real aim in providing the pretext for a further assault on civil liberties .
As the World Socialist Web Site pointed out , the recent scare occurred “ just as the government and Metropolitan Police faced mounting condemnation of police actions during the G20 summit of world leaders in London , which ended April 3 . ”
Video footage and photographic stills of indiscriminate violence meted out against protestors and bystanders — as in the tragic death of Ian Tomlinson — revealed the extent to which political dissent has been criminalised under Labour .
Another disturbing aspect of the recent raids was also revealed by the Guardian , although without any comment .
Reporting on tensions between MI5 and the police over the raids , the Guardian reported that the police decided “ to take ‘ executive action ’ even though the intelligence suggested there was little evidence to charge the suspects . ”
Such are the extraordinary powers given to the police by the Labour government that they are now able to mount high - profile raids and arrests on the flimsiest of pretexts , detain people for weeks at a time while circulating false and highly damaging claims about them and then , at least in the case of foreign nationals , remove the evidence of their “ mistakes ” by handing them over for deportation on the most dubious grounds .
And all apparently on the basis of “ executive action ” and without any form of democratic oversight .
An artist 's impression of how the mammoth wooden version of Britain 's famous Stonehenge monument would have looked at the Hill of Tara in Co Meath
SCIENTISTS have unearthed what appears to be a mammoth wooden version of the famous Stonehenge monument at the Hill of Tara .
In a revealing new RTE documentary , many theories and insights into the country 's prehistoric past and 150,000 ancient monuments are unveiled and explained .
For the first time , people will be able to view a computer - generated recreation of what archaeologists believe was a major wooden structure -- a version of Britain 's Stonehenge -- at the ancient seat of the Irish high kings in the Hill of Tara in Co Meath .
Archaeologist Joe Fenwick revealed a LiDAR ( Light Detecting and Ranging ) laser beam had been used to scan the ground surface to create a three - dimensional map , which revealed more than 30 monuments around Tara .
Using another technique -- described as taking an X - ray through the hillside -- archaeologists discovered the huge monument , a ditch stretching six metres wide and three metres deep in the bedrock .
The ditch , circling the Mound of the Hostages passage tomb , separated the outside world from the ceremonial centre of Tara .
It was believed the ancient architects had also surrounded the ditch with a massive wooden structure on each side -- a version of Stonehenge -- on a large scale .
Its sheer size meant a whole forest would have had to be cleared to build it .
" In scale , it is comparable , for example , to Croke Park 's pitch .
The Hill of Tara had enormous ritual significance over the course of 5,000 - 6,000 years , so it 's not surprising that you get monuments of the scale of the ditch pit circle , " said Mr Fenwick , from the Department of Archaeology , NUI Galway .
Cutting - edge technology is helping to provide a new insight into the lives of our ancestors , according to the documentary makers behind ' Secrets of the Stones ' .
Civilisation
It shows Ireland 's first civilisation began 7,000 years ago , they withstood major climatic changes and voyaged throughout Europe , returning with new religions and mementos .
An RTE spokesman said the broadcaster , along with the Department of Education , would be sending two free copies of the book accompanying the series to all second - level schools in the country .
The first part of the ' Secrets of the Stones ' will be shown on RTE One at 6.30 pm on Easter Monday .
IT IS GETTING VERY SERIOUS NOW
By Chuck Baldwin
May 12 , 2009
NewsWithViews.com
First , it was a Missouri Analysis and Information Center ( MIAC ) report ; then it was a Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) report ; now it is a New York congressman 's bill .
Each of these items , taken on their own , is problematic enough ; taken together they portend " a clear and present danger " to the liberties of the American people .
It is getting very serious now .
As readers may recall , the MIAC report profiled certain people as being potential violence - prone " militia members " : including people who supported Presidential candidates Ron Paul , Bob Barr , and myself .
In addition , anyone who opposed one or more of the following were also included in the list : the New World Order , the U.N. , gun control , the violation of Posse Comitatus , the Federal Reserve , the Income Tax , the Ammunition Accountability Act , a possible Constitutional Convention , the North American Union , the Universal Service Program , Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) , abortion on demand , or illegal immigration .
The MIAC report prompted a firestorm of protest , and was eventually rescinded , with the man responsible for its distribution being dismissed from his position .
The DHS report profiled many of the same people included in the MIAC report , and added returning Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans as potentially dangerous " extremists . "
As I have said before , it is very likely that when all of the opinions and views of the above lists are counted , 75 % or more of the American people would be included .
Yet , these government reports would have law enforcement personnel to believe we are all dangerous extremists that need to be watched and guarded against .
If this was not bad enough , a New York congressman has introduced a bill in the House of Representatives to deny Second Amendment rights to everyone listed above .
According to World Net Daily , May 9 , 2009 , " A new gun law being considered in Congress , if aligned with Department of Homeland Security memos labeling everyday Americans a potential ' threats , ' could potentially deny firearms to pro-lifers , gun-rights advocates , tax protesters , animal rights activists , and a host of others -- any already on the expansive DHS watch list for potential ' extremism . '
" Rep. Peter King , R - N.Y. , has sponsored H.R. 2159 , the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists
Act of 2009 , which permits the attorney general to deny transfer of a firearm to any ' known or suspected dangerous terrorist . '
The bill requires only that the potential firearm transferee is ' appropriately suspected ' of preparing for a terrorist act and that the attorney general ' has a reasonable belief ' that the gun might be used in connection with terrorism .
" Gun rights advocates , however , object to the bill 's language , arguing that it enables the federal government to suspend a person 's Second Amendment rights without any trial or legal proof and only upon suspicion of being ' dangerous . ' "

WND quotes Gun Owners of America Executive Director Larry Pratt as saying , " By [ DHS ] standards , I 'm one of [ DHS Secretary ] Janet Napolitano 's terrorists .
This bill would enable the attorney general to put all of the people who voted against Obama on no - gun lists , because according to the DHS , they 're all potential terrorists .
Actually , we could rename this bill the Janet Napolitano Frenzied Fantasy Implementation Act of 2009 . "
Pratt was also quoted as saying , " Unbeknownst to us , some bureaucrat in the bowels of democracy can put your name on a list , and your Second Amendment rights are toast . "
He went on to say , " This such an anti-American bill , this is something King George III would have done . "
Now that DHS has established both a list and a lexicon for " extremists , " it looks to Congress to confer upon it police - state - style powers through which these individuals may be disarmed and eventually done away with .
Rep. Peter King is accommodating this goal with H.R. 2159 .
Let me ask a reasonable question : how long does anyone think it would be , after being profiled by DHS and denied the lawful purchase of firearms , that those same people would be subjected to gun confiscation ?
And how long do you think it would be before DHS began profiling more and more groups of people , thus subjecting them to gun confiscation ?
This was exactly the strategy employed by Adolf Hitler .
The Jews were the first people denied their civil rights -- especially the right to own and possess firearms .
Of course , after disarming Jews , the rest of the German citizenry was likewise disarmed .
And we all know where that led .
I 'm not sure how many of the American people realize that it was the attempted confiscation of the colonialists ' cache of arms in Concord , Massachusetts , that started America 's War for Independence .
Yes , my friends , it was attempted gun confiscation that triggered ( pun intended ) the " shot heard ' round the world . "
And now it would appear that , once again , a central government is on the verge of trying to deny the American people their right to keep and bear arms .
I am told that as of 2004 , 50 % of the adults in the United States own one or more firearms , totaling some 270 million privately owned firearms nationwide .
I would venture to say that the vast majority of these gun owners would find themselves matching the DHS profile of a potential " extremist . "
I wonder how many gun owners realize the way they are now being targeted by their government , and just how serious -- and how close -- the threat of gun confiscation has become ?
If one doubts the intention of the elitists in government today to deny the American people their right to keep and bear arms , consider what former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is purported to have said just a couple of weeks ago .
Kissinger attended a high - level meeting with Russian President Medvedev that also included former Secretaries of State James Baker and George Shultz ; former Secretary of Defense William Perry ; and former Senator Sam Nunn .
Included in the discussions was Kissinger 's assertion that the American people were now ready to accept a " New Global Order . "
He is also reported to have told Medvedev , " By September we 'll have confiscated all privately owned guns so it really does n't matter what we do , we 'll still be in charge . "
( Even though the national news media has not reported this statement , the Internet is abuzz with Kissinger having said it .
Whether Kissinger actually made that statement or not , he , and rest of his ilk , have repeatedly called for a New World Order , in which there will be no constitutional protection for the right to keep and bear arms . )
This leads to a very serious question : how many of America 's gun owners would allow their government to deny them gun ownership ?
Further , how many would passively sit back and allow their guns to be confiscated ?

Full page ads questioning President Obama ’s stance on climate change were published in the Washington Post , the New York Times , the Chicago Tribune , the Washington Times , and the Los Angeles Times last week , paid for by the Cato Institute .
Environmentalists , journalists , and scientists alike are calling foul and poking holes in the assertion that “ there has been no net global warming for over a decade now . ”
From PolitiFact :
The definitive statement on global warming comes from a 2007 study by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , a group of scientists from more than 130 nations .
They concluded that the “ warming of the climate system is unequivocal , as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures , widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level . ”
The group also concluded that there is “ very high confidence that the global average net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warming . ”
From Real Climate :
“ The “ global warming stopped ” meme is particularly lame since it relies on both a feigned ignorance of the statistics of short periods and being careful about which data set you use .
It also requires cherry - picking the start year , had the period been “ exactly a decade ” or 12 years then all the trends are positive . ”
From Joseph Romm at Grist :
“ a key study Cato uses to argue we may see much less warming than the models predict comes to exactly the opposite conclusion . ”
From Andrew Revkin , NY Times :
“ Of course , there are quite a few experts in climate science and policy who warn that debating whether the research pointing to a disruptive human climate influence is , or is not , settled is a complete distraction from the reality that the basics are not in dispute ( more CO2 = warming world = rising seas and lots of changing climate patterns ) . ”
From The New Republic :
“ The ad ’s method boils down to : “ Ignore the facts you do n’t dispute , pick some others that are ambiguous and imply that , because they are subject to some debate , we therefore know nothing . ” ”

A coherence theory of truth states that the truth of any ( true ) proposition consists in its coherence with some specified set of propositions .
The coherence theory differs from its principal competitor , the correspondence theory of truth , in two essential respects .
The competing theories give conflicting accounts of the relation that propositions bear to their truth conditions .
( In this article , ‘ proposition ’ is not used in any technical sense .
It simply refers to the bearers of truth values , whatever they may be . )
According to one , the relation is coherence , according to the other , it is correspondence .
The two theories also give conflicting accounts of truth conditions .
According to the coherence theory , the truth conditions of propositions consist in other propositions .
The correspondence theory , in contrast , states that the truth conditions of propositions are not ( in general ) propositions , but rather objective features of the world .
( Even the correspondence theorist holds that propositions about propositions have propositions as their truth conditions . )
Although the coherence and correspondence theories are fundamentally opposed in this way , they both present ( in contrast to deflationary theories of truth ) a substantive conception of truth .
That is , unlike deflationary theories , the coherence and correspondence theories both hold that truth is a property of propositions that can be analysed in terms of the sorts of truth - conditions propositions have , and the relations propositions stand in to these conditions .
The coherence theory of truth has several versions .
These versions differ on two major issues .
Different versions of the theory give different accounts of the coherence relation .
Different varieties of the theory also give various accounts of the set ( or sets ) of propositions with which true propositions cohere .
( Such a set will be called a specified set . )
According to some early versions of the coherence theory , the coherence relation is simply consistency .
On this view , to say that a proposition coheres with a specified set of propositions is to say that the proposition is consistent with the set .
This account of coherence is unsatisfactory for the following reason .
Consider two propositions which do not belong to a specified set .
These propositions could both be consistent with a specified set and yet be inconsistent with each other .
If coherence is consistency , the coherence theorist would have to claim that both propositions are true , but this is impossible .
A more plausible version of the coherence theory states that the coherence relation is some form of entailment .
Entailment can be understood here as strict logical entailment , or entailment in some looser sense .
According to this version , a proposition coheres with a set of propositions if and only if it is entailed by members of the set .
Another more plausible version of the theory , held for example in Bradley ( 1914 ) , is that coherence is mutual explanatory support between propositions .
The second point on which coherence theorists ( coherentists , for short ) differ is the constitution of the specified set of propositions .
Coherentists generally agree that the specified set consists of propositions believed or held to be true .
They differ on the questions of who believes the propositions and when .
At one extreme , coherence theorists can hold that the specified set of propositions is the largest consistent set of propositions currently believed by actual people .
For such a version of the theory , see Young ( 1995 ) .
According to a moderate position , the specified set consists of those propositions which will be believed when people like us ( with finite cognitive capacities ) have reached some limit of inquiry .
For such a coherence theory , see Putnam ( 1981 ) .
At the other extreme , coherence theorists can maintain that the specified set contains the propositions which would be believed by an omniscient being .
Some idealists seem to accept this account of the specified set .
If the specified set is a set actually believed , or even a set which would be believed by people like us at some limit of inquiry , coherentism involves the rejection of realism about truth .
Realism about truth involves acceptance of the principle of bivalence ( according to which every proposition is either true or false ) and the principle of transcendence ( which says that a proposition may be true even though it cannot be known to be true ) .
Coherentists who do not believe that the specified set is the set of propositions believed by an omniscient being are committed to rejection of the principle of bivalence since it is not the case that for every proposition either it or a contrary proposition coheres with the specified set .
They reject the principle of transcendence since , if a proposition coheres with a set of beliefs , it can be known to cohere with the set .
Two principal lines of argument have led philosophers to adopt a coherence theory of truth .
Early advocates of coherence theories were persuaded by reflection on metaphysical questions .
More recently , epistemological and semantic considerations have been the basis for coherence theories .
2.1 The Metaphysical Route to Coherentism
Early versions of the coherence theory were associated with idealism .
Walker ( 1989 ) attributes coherentism to Spinoza , Kant , Fichte and Hegel .
Certainly a coherence theory was adopted by a number of British Idealists in the last years of the nineteenth century and the first decades of the twentieth .
See , for example , Bradley ( 1914 ) .
Idealists are led to a coherence theory of truth by their metaphysical position .
Advocates of the correspondence theory believe that a belief is ( at least most of the time ) ontologically distinct from the objective conditions which make the belief true .
Idealists do not believe that there is an ontological distinction between beliefs and what makes beliefs true .
From the idealists ’ perspective , reality is something like a collection of beliefs .
Consequently , a belief cannot be true because it corresponds to something which is not a belief .
Instead , the truth of a belief can only consist in its coherence with other beliefs .
A coherence theory of truth which results from idealism usually leads to the view that truth comes in degrees .
A belief is true to the degree that it coheres with other beliefs .
Since idealists do not recognize an ontological distinction between beliefs and what makes them true , distinguishing between versions of the coherence theory of truth adopted by idealists and an identity theory of truth can be difficult .
The article on Bradley in this Encyclopedia ( Candlish 2006 ) argues that Bradley had an identity theory , not a coherence theory .
In recent years metaphysical arguments for coherentism have found few advocates .
This is due to the fact that idealism is not widely held .
2.2 Epistemological Routes to Coherentism
Blanshard ( 1939 , ch. XXVI ) argues that a coherence theory of justification leads to a coherence theory of truth .
His argument runs as follows .
Someone might hold that coherence with a set of beliefs is the test of truth but that truth consists in correspondence to objective facts .
If , however , truth consists in correspondence to objective facts , coherence with a set of beliefs will not be a test of truth .
This is the case since there is no guarantee that a perfectly coherent set of beliefs matches objective reality .
Since coherence with a set of beliefs is a test of truth , truth cannot consist in correspondence .
Blanshard ’s argument has been criticised by , for example , Rescher ( 1973 ) .
Blanshard ’s argument depends on the claim that coherence with a set of beliefs is the test of truth .
Understood in one sense , this claim is plausible enough .
Blanshard , however , has to understand this claim in a very strong sense : coherence with a set of beliefs is an infallible test of truth .
If coherence with a set of beliefs is simply a good but fallible test of truth , as Rescher suggests , the argument fails .
The “ falling apart ” of truth and justification to which Blanshard refers is to be expected if truth is only a fallible test of truth .
Another epistemological argument for coherentism is based on the view that we cannot “ get outside ” our set of beliefs and compare propositions to objective facts .
A version of this argument was advanced by some logical positivists including Hempel ( 1935 ) and Neurath ( 1983 ) .
This argument , like Blanshard ’s , depends on a coherence theory of justification .
The argument infers from such a theory that we can only know that a proposition coheres with a set of beliefs .
We can never know that a proposition corresponds to reality .
This argument is subject to at least two criticisms .
For a start , it depends on a coherence theory of justification , and is vulnerable to any objections to this theory .
More importantly , a coherence theory of truth does not follow from the premisses .
We cannot infer from the fact that a proposition cannot be known to correspond to reality that it does not correspond to reality .
Even if correspondence theorists admit that we can only know which propositions cohere with our beliefs , they can still hold that truth consists in correspondence .
If correspondence theorists adopt this position , they accept that there may be truths which can not be known .
Alternatively , they can argue , as does Davidson ( 1986 ) , that the coherence of a proposition with a set of beliefs is a good indication that the proposition corresponds to objective facts and that we can know that propositions correspond .
Coherence theorists need to argue that propositions cannot correspond to objective facts , not merely that they can not be known to correspond .
In order to do this , the foregoing argument for coherentism must be supplemented .
One way to supplement the argument would be to argue as follows .
As noted above , the correspondence and coherence theories have differing views about the nature of truth conditions .
One way to decide which account of truth conditions is correct is to pay attention to the process by which propositions are assigned truth conditions .
Coherence theorists can argue that the truth conditions of a proposition are the conditions under which speakers make a practice of asserting it .
Coherentists can then maintain that speakers can only make a practice of asserting a proposition under conditions the speakers are able to recognise as justifying the proposition .
Now the ( supposed ) inability of speakers to “ get outside ” of their beliefs is significant .
Coherentists can argue that the only conditions speakers can recognise as justifying a proposition are the conditions under which it coheres with their beliefs .
When the speakers make a practice of asserting the proposition under these conditions , they become the proposition ’s truth conditions .
For an argument of this sort see Young ( 1995 ) .
Any coherence theory of truth faces two principal challenges .
The first may be called the specification objection .
The second is the transcendence objection .
3.1 The Specification Objection
According to the specification objection , coherence theorists have no way to identify the specified set of propositions without contradicting their position .
This objection originates in Russell ( 1907 ) .
Opponents of the coherence theory can argue as follows .
The proposition ( 1 ) “ Jane Austen was hanged for murder ” coheres with some set of propositions .
( 2 ) “ Jane Austen died in her bed ” coheres with another set of propositions .
No one supposes that the first of these propositions is true , in spite of the fact that it coheres with a set of propositions .
The specification objection charges that coherence theorists have no grounds for saying that ( 1 ) is false and ( 2 ) true .
Some responses to the specification problem are unsuccessful .
One could say that we have grounds for saying that ( 1 ) is false and ( 2 ) is true because the latter coheres with propositions which correspond to the facts .
Coherentists cannot , however , adopt this response without contradicting their position .
Sometimes coherence theorists maintain that the specified system is the most comprehensive system , but this is not the basis of a successful response to the specification problem .
Coherentists can only , unless they are to compromise their position , define comprehensiveness in terms of the size of a system .
Coherentists cannot , for example , talk about the most comprehensive system composed of propositions which correspond to reality .
There is no reason , however , why two or more systems cannot be equally large .
Other criteria of the specified system , to which coherentists frequently appeal , are similarly unable to solve the specification problem .
These criteria include simplicity , empirical adequacy and others .
Again , there seems to be no reason why two or more systems cannot equally meet these criteria .
Although some responses to the Russell ’s version of the specification objection are unsuccessful , it is unable to refute the coherence theory .
Coherentists do not believe that the truth of a proposition consists in coherence with any arbitrarily chosen set of propositions .
Rather , they hold that truth consists in coherence with a set of beliefs , or with a set of propositions held to be true .
No one actually believes the set of propositions with which ( 1 ) coheres .
Coherence theorists conclude that they can hold that ( 1 ) is false without contradicting themselves .
A more sophisticated version of the specification objection has been advanced by Walker ( 1989 ) ; for a discussion , see Wright ( 1995 ) .
Walker argues as follows .
In responding to Russell ’s version of the specification objection , coherentists claim that some set of propositions , call it S , is believed .
They are committed to the truth of ( 3 ) “ S is believed . ”
The question of what it is for ( 3 ) to be true then arises .
Coherence theorists might answer this question by saying that “ ‘ S is believed ’ is believed ” is true .
If they give this answer , they are apparently off on an infinite regress , and they will never say what it is for a proposition to be true .
Their plight is worsened by the fact that arbitrarily chosen sets of propositions can include propositions about what is believed .
So , for example , there will be a set which contains “ Jane Austen was hanged for murder , ” “ ‘ Jane Austen was hanged for murder ’ is believed , ” and so on .
The only way to stop the regress seems to be to say that the truth conditions of ( 3 ) consist in the objective fact S is believed .
If , however , coherence theorists adopt this position , they seem to contradict their own position by accepting that the truth conditions of some proposition consist in facts , not in propositions in a set of beliefs .
There is some doubt about whether Walker ’s version of the specification objection succeeds .
Coherence theorists can reply to Walker by saying that nothing in their position is inconsistent with the view that there is a set of propositions which is believed .
Even though this objective fact obtains , the truth conditions of propositions , including propositions about which sets of propositions are believed , are the conditions under which they cohere with a set of propositions .
For a defence of the coherence theory against Walker ’s version of the specification objection , see Young ( 2001 ) .
A coherence theory of truth gives rise to a regress , but it is not a vicious regress and the correspondence theory faces a similar regress .
If we say that p is true if and only if it coheres with a specified set of propositions , we may be asked about the truth conditions of “ p coheres with a specified set . ”
Plainly , this is the start of a regress , but not one to worry about .
It is just what one would expect , given that the coherence theory states that it gives an account of the truth conditions of all propositions .
The correspondence theory faces a similar benign regress .
The correspondence theory states that a proposition is true if and only if it corresponds to certain objective conditions .
The proposition “ p corresponds to certain objective conditions ” is also true if and only if it corresponds to certain objective conditions , and so on .
3.2 The Transcendence Objection
The transcendence objection charges that a coherence theory of truth is unable to account for the fact that some propositions are true which cohere with no set of beliefs .
According to this objection , truth transcends any set of beliefs .
Someone might argue , for example , that the proposition “ Jane Austen wrote ten sentences on November 17th , 1807 ” is either true or false .
If it is false , some other proposition about how many sentences Austen wrote that day is true .
No proposition , however , about precisely how many sentences Austen wrote coheres with any set of beliefs and we may safely assume that none will ever cohere with a set of beliefs .
Opponents of the coherence theory will conclude that there is at least one true proposition which does not cohere with any set of beliefs .
Some versions of the coherence theory are immune to the transcendence objection .
A version which holds that truth is coherence with the beliefs of an omniscient being is proof against the objection .
Every truth coheres with the set of beliefs of an omniscient being .
All other versions of the theory , however , have to cope with the objection , including the view that truth is coherence with a set of propositions believed at the limit of inquiry .
Even at the limit of inquiry , finite creatures will not be able to decide every question , and truth may transcend what coheres with their beliefs .
Coherence theorists can defend their position against the transcendence objection by maintaining that the objection begs the question .
Those who present the objection assume , generally without argument , that it is possible that some proposition be true even though it does not cohere with any set of beliefs .
This is precisely what coherence theorists deny .
Coherence theorists have arguments for believing that truth cannot transcend what coheres with some set of beliefs .
Their opponents need to take issue with these arguments rather than simply assert that truth can transcend what coheres with a specified system .
3.3 The Logic Objection
Russell ( 1912 ) presented a third classic objection to the coherence theory of truth .
According to this objection , any talk about coherence presupposes the truth of the laws of logic .
For example , Russell argues , to say that two propositions cohere with each other is to presuppose the truth of the law of non-contradiction .
In this case , coherentism has no account of the truth of law of non-contradiction .
If , however , the coherence theorist holds that the truth of the law of non-contradiction depends on its coherence with a system of beliefs , and it were supposed to be false , then propositions cannot cohere or fail to cohere .
In this case , the coherence theory of truth completely breaks down since propositions cannot cohere with each other .
Coherentists have a plausible response to this objection .
They may hold that the law of non-contradiction , like any other truth , is true because it coheres with a system of beliefs .
In particular , the law of non-contradiction is supported by the belief that , for example , communication and reasoning would be impossible unless every system of beliefs contains something like law of non-contradiction ( and the belief that communication and reasoning are possible ) .
It is true that , as Russell says , if the law is supposed not to cohere with a system of beliefs , then propositions can neither cohere nor fail to cohere .
However , coherence theorists may hold , they do not suppose the law of non-contradiction to be false .
On the contrary , they are likely to hold that any coherent set of beliefs must include the law of non-contradiction or a similar law .
Paul Thagard is the author of the first of two recent new arguments against the coherence theory .
Thagard states his argument as follows :
if there is a world independent of representations of it , as historical evidence suggests , then the aim of representation should be to describe the world , not just to relate to other representations .
My argument does not refute the coherence theory , but shows that it implausibly gives minds too large a place in constituting truth .
( Thagard 2007 : 29–30 )
Thagard ’s argument seems to be that if there is a mind - independent world , then our representations are representations of the world .
( He says representations “ should be ” of the world , but the argument is invalid with the addition of the auxiliary verb . )
The world existed before humans and our representations , including our propositional representations .
( So history and , Thagard would likely say , our best science tells us . )
Therefore , representations , including propositional representations , are representations of a mind - independent world .
The second sentence of the passage just quoted suggests that the only way that coherentists can reject this argument is to adopt some sort of idealism .
That is , they can only reject the minor premiss of the argument as reconstructed .
Otherwise they are committed to saying that propositions represent the world and , Thagard seems to suggest , this is to say that propositions have the sort of truth - conditions posited by a correspondence theory .
So the coherence theory is false .
In reply to this argument , coherentists can deny that propositions are representations of a mind - independent world .
To say that a proposition is true is to say that it is supported by a specified system of propositions .
So , the coherentist can say , propositions are representations of systems of beliefs , not representations of a mind - independent world .
To assert a proposition is to assert that it is entailed by a system of beliefs .
The coherentist holds that even if there is a mind - independent world , it does not follow that the “ the point ” of representations is to represent this world .
If coherentists have been led to their position by an epistemological route , they believe that we cannot “ get outside ” our system of beliefs .
If we can not get outside of our system of beliefs , then it is hard to see how we can be said to represent a mind - independent reality .
Colin McGinn has proposed the other new objection to coherentism .
He argues ( McGinn 2002 : 195 ) that coherence theorists are committed to idealism .
Like Thagard , he takes idealism to be obviously false , so the argument is a reductio .
McGinn ’s argument runs as follows .
Coherentists are committed to the view that , for example , ‘ Snow falls from the sky ’ is true iff the belief that snow falls from the sky coheres with other beliefs .
Now it follows from this and the redundancy biconditional ( p is true iff p ) that snow falls from the sky iff the belief that snow falls from the sky coheres with other beliefs .
It appears then that the coherence theorist is committed to the view that snow could not fall from the sky unless the belief that snow falls from the sky coheres with other beliefs .
From this it follows that how things are depends on what is believed about them .
This seems strange to McGinn since he thinks , reasonably , that snow could fall from the sky even if there were no beliefs about snow , or anything else .
The linking of how things are and how they are believed to be leads McGinn to say that coherentists are committed to idealism , this being the view that how things are is mind - dependent .
Coherentists have a response to this objection .
McGinn ’s argument works because he takes it that the redundancy biconditional means something like “ p is true because p ” .
Only if redundancy biconditionals are understood in this way does McGinn ’s argument go through .
McGinn needs to be talking about what makes “ Snow falls from the sky ” true for his reductio to work .
Otherwise , coherentists who reject his argument cannot be charged with idealism .
He assumes , in a way that a coherent theorist can regard as question - begging , that the truth - maker of the sentence in question is an objective way the world is .
Coherentists deny that any sentences are made true by objective conditions .
In particular , they hold that the falling of snow from the sky does not make “ Snow falls from the sky ” true .
Coherentists hold that it , like any other sentence , is true because it coheres with a system of beliefs .
So coherentists appear to have a plausible defence against McGinn ’s objection .
A truly vivid and well illustrated read , Alan Campbell 's Scar Night is full of gorgeous and competently fleshed - out imagery , making it the kind of visually staggering read that would lend itself well to film .
Set in the city of Deepgate , a massive steampunk - esque metropolis suspended over an equally massive abyss by a network of gigantic chains , Scar Night is the tale of a young man named Dill who is n't a man at all -- he is the last of the angels who serve Ulcis , or so it is said .
Only one other angel remains in Deepgate , a sadistic and scar - covered female named " Carnival " that hunts the streets at night , snapping up unsuspecting victims .
Scar Night is extremely well detailed for a fantasy novel -- complete with the intricacies and mythologies of a world that , while alien with it 's ideas of evil mazes and an abyss god that is prophesied to be building an army intent on overthrowing the goddess who keeps men from entering the paradise of the sky , contains many elements that make it not so different from our own world , or rather , what our world might be like centuries after some grand catastrophy .
Campbell 's descriptions tantalize the mind , and the arcane technologies of the ancients , the rooms full of esoteric remnants like the skeletons of angels who died serving Ulcis or the broken glass and maddening voices that haunt an evil priest 's maze grab us and make us wonder .
Even the depths of the abyss itself with it 's pounding hell - forge and rotting minions of Ulcis is crafted well enough to pull in the reader and paint an amazing tapestry of darkness within his mind .
The plot and storyline of Scar Night are pretty well written too , leaving only a little to be desired , but considering the fact that this is Alan Campbell 's first book and the first book in his debut series The Deepgate Codex , it 's well worth a read .
All in all , I give it four solid stars out of five , even though the writing has it 's rough spots here and there .
It really is that gorgeous .
Also , check out the sequel , Iron Angel , if the first book does it for you .
Sylvain Martel , what hast thou sown ?
The director of the NanoRobotics Laboratory at the École Polytechnique de Montréal this week is presenting his latest microbot at ICRA in Japan , and it 's got a pretty crazy trick .
The solar panel - equipped device sizes up to about 300 x 300 microns , and using a sensor to detect nearby pH levels , it 's been shown as capable of controlling a swarm of 3,000 bacteria using electromagnetic pulses .
Sure , Martel suggests there 'll be some eventual medical uses for the technology , but we'd be lying if we said the video demonstration did n't give us the willies .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Germany heaved a sigh of relief on Saturday over a deal with Canadian auto parts group Magna , General Motors and the U.S. government to save carmaker Opel from the imminent bankruptcy of its U.S. parent .
The accord sealed after six hours of talks in Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s offices still needs final approval but seemed set to ringfence Opel and its 50,000 workers in Europe from a GM Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing widely expected for Monday .
Merkel said U.S. President Barack Obama -- due to visit Germany next week -- helped swing the deal with a telephone call on Friday .
That helped clear hurdles over financing that had threatened to scupper the entire transaction and allowed GM to agree the deal with Magna about the future of its European operations , of which Opel is the centerpiece .
“ I spoke on the phone with the American president yesterday and we were in agreement that we had to do everything possible to come up with a good result for this complicated task , ” Merkel told reporters .
“ That conversation clearly influenced the negotiations last night . ”
Labour leader Klaus Franz said some Opel workers arriving for early Saturday shifts hugged each other in spontaneous celebrations even though some worried the proud company , which traces its roots to the 19th century , was not out of the woods .
“ This was pure emotion , ” Franz told Reuters Television .
“ I have to see now how to get the adrenaline levels down . ”
Opel workers favored Magna over rival suitor Fiat even though Magna will cut some 11,000 jobs in Europe , a quarter in Germany .
Plants in Belgium and Britain may not survive .
“ It ’s really super , ” said one beaming Opel worker as he headed into Opel ’s main plant in Russelsheim at 6 a.m .
“ It ’s good that we ’re still alive , ” said one middle - aged Opel factory worker .
“ But we still have to see what comes out of all this , where jobs will be cut .
We ’ll probably end up having to pay the bill .
But the main thing is : we ’re still alive . ”
There was no word on the fate of plants outside Germany , including two in Britain , where unions have accused the government of being much less energetic about saving jobs .
Like its parent GM , Opel has suffered acutely from world recession .
Its fate has gripped Germany , where the auto industry remains a potent symbol of the country ’s postwar recovery .
Merkel faces an election in September and was keen to avert large job losses .
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck emerged from the marathon meeting at 2:15 a.m. to tell journalists a comprehensive deal was agreed that included bridge financing worth 1.5 billion euros ( $ 2.1 billion ) and a trustee model for the carmaker .
Siegfried Wolf , the co-chief executive of Magna , cautioned there were still details to be ironed out .
“ In five weeks ’ time we should have the formal signing of the contract , ” he said .
Hesse state premier Roland Koch said , for example , the state assemblies in both Hesse and North Rhine - Westphalia -- two of four states with Opel plants -- would still have to endorse it .
He said he hoped that could be completed by Sunday .

RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT
Magna plans to use Opel to push into Russia , Europe ’s fastest - growing car market before the economic crisis hit .
Russian state - controlled Sberbank , which is helping to finance the deal and is set to get a 35 percent stake in Opel , welcomed the agreement as a way to restructure the Russian automotive industry .
“ To my mind , this is a very good chance for Russia to obtain one of the most advanced European automakers in terms of technology for an unprecedentedly low price , ” Chief Executive German Gref told the Vesti 24 news channel .
Yelena Matveyeva , deputy head of Magna ’s Russian partner GAZ , also hailed the accord , which will give the carmaker access to technology and boost output at its plant .

The German government has been scrambling to safeguard Opel ’s future before GM files for bankruptcy .
A first round of talks collapsed amid mutual recriminations on Thursday .
Italian carmaker
Fiat pulled out of talks on Friday , leaving the door open for Magna , a company started by Austrian emigre Frank Stronach in a Toronto garage nearly half a century ago .
Magna and Opel had presented their plan to senior German officials and representatives of the U.S.
Treasury to win their support and ensure the release of the financing that Opel desperately needs to survive over the coming months .
An agreement between GM and Magna is a first step toward securing the future of Opel , which GM bought in 1929 .
“ I think this is the start of a new future for Opel , for the workers , the company and the brand , ” GM Europe head Carl - Peter Forster told journalists .
He added , however , that there would still be some hard negotiations on the fine - print ahead .
MINISTER’S MISGIVINGS
Economy Minister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg renewed his reservations about risks involved with the rescue but added there would also have been risks if Opel declared bankruptcy .
In a sign of conservatives ’ misgivings about state aid for companies , a source close to the situation said Guttenberg had handed the lead role in the Opel rescue to Merkel ’s office .
But Merkel praised her party ally for raising critical questions .
Another stumbling block had been U.S. Treasury opposition to German demands that Opel assets be temporarily placed in a trust to protect them from GM creditors .
Germany will now release the bridge financing to tide Opel over until a merger is completed .
Based in Ruesselsheim near Frankfurt , Opel employs 25,000 staff in four German plants .
It is part of a GM Europe operation that makes cars in Spain , Poland , Belgium and Britain , where Opel cars are sold under the Vauxhall brand .
When he was buried – at the insistence of the Catholic church in unconsecrated ground – Galileo Galilei left behind at least two conundrums : how could a man with impaired eyesight have made the observations that revolutionised astronomy ; and did his faulty vision alter what he saw and recorded ?
When his body was moved to the basilica of Santa Croce in Florence , almost 100 years later on the initiative of local freemasons , it gave rise to a third riddle : who was the woman found buried alongside him ?
Scientists are planning now to solve all three questions with the help of genetics .
Paolo Galluzzi , the director of Florence 's museum of the history of science , said yesterday he had applied to the local authorities for permission to exhume Galileo 's body and that of his companion in death to take samples of their DNA for examination .
" From the time of his astronomical discoveries onwards , Galileo wrote to friends and relatives about the trouble he was having with his eyes and the difficulties it created for his observations , " said Galluzzi .
In his later years he was heavily dependent on his disciple , Vincenzo Viviani .
By the end he was blind , or nearly so .
Yet by then he had analysed the spots on the sun , chronicled the lunar mountains and " seas " , and discovered the largest of the satellites orbiting Jupiter .
Based on his own accounts , it has been speculated that the great Tuscan physicist suffered from uveitis , or inflammation of the middle layer of the eye .
That could explain some of the idiosyncrasies in Galileo 's observations .
He described Saturn , for example , as having bulges on either side , instead of a ring .
His insistence that the earth orbited the sun led to his being tried in Rome in 1633 .
The court ordered him to " abjure , curse and detest " his opinions and he spent the rest of his life under house arrest .
The young woman whose body was found alongside his is thought to be that of his eldest daughter , Virginia , who became a nun and died at the age of 33 .
But the theory lacks proof .
To obtain it would cost " some hundreds of thousands of euros " , said Galluzzi , who added that he was hoping to raise the necessary funding before the end of 2009 , which the UN has declared International Year of Astronomy to mark the 400th anniversary of Galileo 's observations .
BCS = communism ?
com-mu-nism
–noun
1. a theory or system of social organization based on the holding of all property in common , actual ownership being ascribed to the community as a whole or to the state .
2. ( often initial capital letter ) a system of social organization in which all economic and social activity is controlled by a totalitarian state dominated by a single and self - perpetuating political party .
If the above definition sounds familiar , Republican Rep. Joe Barton of Texas says that it ’s probably because you ’ve been watching college football and are familiar with the BCS .
A congressman who wants to see college football adopt a playoff system is comparing the Bowl Championship Series to communism .
Republican Rep. Joe Barton of Texas said Friday that efforts to tinker with the BCS are bound to fail .
He told a House hearing that the BCS is like communism and ca n’t be fixed .
Barton has introduced legislation that would prevent the NCAA from labeling a game a national championship unless it ’s the outcome of a playoff system .
The coordinator of the Bowl Championship Series told the panel that a playoff system would threaten the existence of celebrated bowl games .
Fans , President Barack Obama and some lawmakers favor a playoff system .
While I agree that there is a massive need for a playoff to be implemented into college football , I would n’t go as far to compare the BCS to communism .
Fascism ?
Maybe . Communism ?
Not so much .
Does anyone else find it ironic that Barton is a Republican representative of Texas and is comparing the BCS to communism after the Long Horns did n’t get a shot to play for the national championship last year ?

No , this is n’t the latest horror movie , this is something that has been going on and is now becoming a real problem for consumers .
This expanding new industry has prompted a flood of complaints to state and federal agencies .
We all know what a debt collector is , this is about debt collectors who are attempting to collect zombie debts .
Basically a zombie debt is a debt that is old and maybe you have forgotten about it .
So you suddenly get this call out of the blue from a debt collector stating you owe this money .
What usually happens is another debt collection agency buys an old debt from another agency for pennies on the dollar , and this new collection agency starts aggressively trying to collect .
Many times these debts were n’t even valid debts or for other reasons such as identity theft are n’t valid debts .
The consumer with a lot of work finally gets it cleared up years ago , but somehow these new debt collectors get a hold of this debt and start trying to collect on it starting the whole mess over again .
Other times these collection agencies will buy old debts that were charged off a long time ago and then use a credit scoring search to determine who would be the most likely to pay these old debts .
And if you are one of the lucky ones your phone will start ringing .
Many of these debts are past the statute of limitations that they can even try and collect the debt .
There is a statute of limitations ( SOL ) when past a certain amount of time it is too late to try and collect on a debt .
Each state has their own statute of limitations for certain types of debts .
Consumers are getting harassing calls now for debts as far back as the early 1990s .
Here are some of the worst abuses of these debt collectors at this time .
Constantly calling and badgering consumers about a debt that has already been paid or has been legally erased through a bankruptcy .
Illegally re-aging the debt on credit reports .
What the collection agency does here is report to the credit reporting companies that this old debt is really a new debt , which extends the limit of reporting debts past the 7 - year limit .
Threatening to sue or actually suing you for a debt that is past the statute of limitations .
They promise to delete the negative remarks on your credit report if you pay just a small portion of the debt .
Be aware of this especially .
If you only pay a part of the debt this resets the statute of limitations all over again .
If you are going to negotiate a lower payment for the full amount , get this in writing first before paying anything if you owe the debt .
Make sure it says full amount paid .
Know these Laws about Collections
When does the clock start ticking on a debt , usually it is 180 days after the account first goes delinquent or after you ’ve missed your first payment .
A negative report cannot stay on your credit report after 7 years ( 10 years for a bankruptcy ) .
On your credit report the clock should start ticking when it says date of last activity .
But in some states you can restart the clock if you start making payments , agree to a payment plan or even acknowledge the debt is yours .
You do not want to restart the clock unless you agree that the debt is yours , is not past your states SOL and the amount is correct .
And you have all of this in writing from the collection agency .
Being threatened or actually being sued for a debt that is past your states statute of limitations is a violation of the federal Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ) .
If sued you will have to go to court and show this .
Never miss a court date .
If you ’ve moved to a different state , the rule of thumb is to go with your current states SOL .
A credit card is usually considered an open - ended account established under the Truth - In - Lending Act .
Should You Pay These Old Debts ?
You realize you owe this debt but the statute of limitations has run out , it is still a debt but under your state laws you do n’t owe it anymore , but you would like to pay it .
Be very careful about this .
If you agree to pay and then suddenly you find you can’t pay , you have restarted the clock again and the collection agency can come after you legally and report it on your credit report .
Also , if you pay it can possibly be reported for the next 7 years on your credit report where if you do n’t pay it , if would drop off much sooner if not already .
And this of course can lower your credit score .
You have little to gain and a lot to lose if you continue contact with these debt collectors and they know the SOL has run out .
Paying an old debt can play havoc with your credit score .
If your conscious bothers you about never paying this debt than pay it .
But make sure you get everything in writing .
Do not deal over the phone .
If your conscious is bothering you but you do n’t want to risk your credit score by paying or talking to these debt collectors you could give the money to your favorite charity .
If you do owe this debt , you know it is yours and the amount is correct and your states statute of limitations is not up , do n’t ignore the collection agency , they have a right to collect this debt .
They are bound under the FDPCA of your state and the federal government .
If you continue to have problems with these zombie debt collectors and you either do n’t owe the money and or the SOL has run out , contact an attorney .

Microsoft ’s bizarre relationship with VMware is no news and given the role of EMC in this relationship , it ’s clear that so - called ' moles ' are driving the affair .
According to the latest news , EMC and Microsoft are growing even closer .
Much closer .
EMC , Microsoft team for share of IT budgets [...]
While tech spending has not evaporated , Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said on Tuesday that most companies have mandated that their IT departments cut a significant percentage from their budgets .
“ To save 5 ( percent ) to 10 percent , you have to save a little bit on a lot of things , ” Ballmer told CNET News on Tuesday , in a joint interview with EMC CEO Joe Tucci , “ It ’s not like there ’s nothing new getting done .
Some new projects are getting killed .
There ’s pressure on vendors to reduce prices . ”
For the uninitiated , here is some background reading :
As The Inquirer puts it , “ Microsoft divides IT budgets with EMC . ”
By a sort of inference , Microsoft is now sharing money with VMware as well .
VMware is managed by former Microsoft employees , some of whom have a criminal past that Microsoft paid a lot of money to hide .
This week ’s news speaks a lot about an open source product from VMware , but almost nobody pays attention to the fact that VMware is now promoting Microsoft ’s pet GNU / Linux distribution , which comes at a cost ( of software patents ) .
In other words , the ‘ new ’ VMware ( under Microsoft ’s management ) already helps demote distributions and vendors that do n’t sell out to Microsoft , very much like Hyper - V does [ 1 , 2 ] .
We ’ll note here that prominent among VMware View Open Client ’s features is a Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise Thin Client Add - On RPM package and command line interface .
But what about Red Hat ?
Is n’t Red Hat the leading GNU / Linux distribution ?
It sure seems as though Paul Maritz came from Microsoft to scoop up some former Microsoft colleagues with Tucci ’s endorsement ( Tucci became Microsoft ’s partner of the year last year ) .
Now he ’s working from inside VMware to put a software patents ‘ price tag ’ on GNU / Linux .
Was n’t that predictable ?
Microsoft pried VMware from the hands of GNU / Linux .
It is using its money and its partners to rob parts of the industry of GNU / Linux and impose Microsoft 's rules .
Remember XenSource too .
Here is a new article about it .
If Microsoft Loved Open Source , Who Would It Buy ? [...]
Could Microsoft take its cash reserves and buy an open source company ?
Why not ?
Who expected Oracle and Citrix Systems to become such big investors in open source .
Citrix ’ purchase of XenSource sure has worked out –for Microsoft , in my opinion .
And that example might seed a desire for more open source code in Microsoft ’s camp . [... ]
“ [ Y ] ou have to save a little bit on a lot of things , ” Ballmer told CNET News on Tuesday , in a joint interview with EMC CEO Joe Tucci , “ It ’s not like there ’s nothing new getting done .
Some new projects are getting killed .
There ’s pressure on vendors to reduce prices . ”
For background about XenSource and Microsoft , start here .
What Microsoft and its super - close partner did there eventually pressured Red Hat into buying KVM ( with its parent company ) and maintaining its own virtualisation solution , which is laborious and cumbersome .
As Matt Asay correctly pointed out a couple of days ago , this is Microsoft ’s and Novell ’s war on Red Hat ( and any GNU / Linux distribution that does not pay for mythical software patents ) .
Going forward , I believe that Red Hat must expand its solution offerings if it wants to take market share from Microsoft .
The Unix - to - Linux “ low hanging fruit ” wo n’t last forever .
When it ’s gone , the biggest barrier to Red Hat ’s continued growth will be Microsoft .
Unless Red
Hat starts acting now to build up a holistic response to Microsoft ’s value proposition , including the desktop , Red Hat will eventually struggle to grow .
The piece above contains a dramatic exaggeration because we keep seeing businesses that dump Windows for Red Hat , but either way , it ’s clear that Novell and Microsoft are both attacking any distribution which is not a vassal to software patents , Microsoft and its ecosystem .
Therefore , Novell and SLE * must be stopped . █

Wholesale prices in the United States rose slightly in April , the government reported on Thursday , as falling oil and gasoline prices leveled off and food prices rose the most in a year .
The Labor Department reported that prices received by producers of finished goods rose 0.3 percent last month , further discounting the prospect that the economy was veering into a vicious cycle of lower prices and lower wages known as deflation .
But for some economists , the prospect of rising energy and food prices at a time of deep unemployment and shrinking wages raised concerns that strapped consumers could see their cost of living rise even as the job market continued to get worse .
Although falling producer and consumer prices raised fears about deflation last year as the recession deepened and the financial crisis broke , the end of $ 4 - a - gallon gas and lower heating and energy costs effectively put billions of dollars into consumers ’ pockets .
I would like to extend a special thanks to the Keene District Court , Superior Court , and New Hampshire Supreme Court .
My name is Sam Dodson , and on April 13 I was arrested for filming on public property , the lobby of the Keene District Court .
Since then I ’ve been denied the right to remain silent , the right to an attorney , the right to a speedy and public trial , the right to due process of law , and the right to be “ formally and substantially ” presented with the charges against me ( as required by the New Hampshire Bill of Rights ) .
By order of judge Burke and judge Lane of the Keene District Court , I am currently being held indefinitely without trial .
To protest what I believe to be an unlawful and illegal detention , I have refused solid food since my arrest , currently over 28 days ago .
Several motions and writs have been filed with the aforementioned courts .
They so far have only denied , delayed , and hid behind their procedures despite the clear understanding , from the courts ’ own written order , that I am being held indefinitely without trial .
Through their actions , they have demonstrated utter contempt for the oath they swore to uphold , the rule of law , and civil rights fundamental to the founding and history of this country .
Essentially , they have engaged in civil disobedience , and for this I thank them .
As a voluntarist , I , too , believe in and understand the power of civil disobedience to bring about social and political change .
Unfortunately , what the courts have done and what governments typically do , is to use civil disobedience to punish and oppress out of fear .
Fear of losing control ; fear of the challenge to their authority ; all of which are rooted in a fear of change itself .
Governments have historically feared change they do n’t control .
After all , government at its core is a group of men and women who are willing to use the threat of force – or actual force – to achieve their ends .
They desire to control their neighbors by enforcing their laws upon them .
What ’s wrong for one neighbor to do to another , suddenly becomes justified and “ necessary ” if you get a group of friends together and call yourself a government .
So my new challenge is to explain to the courts how civil disobedience can be used more effectively to bring about positive change .
When liberty activists engage in civil disobedience , the goal is to educate and enlighten others , motivated by love .
Love for what could be ; love and compassion for those abused at the hands of the state .
What ’s it going to take to convince government to stop using violence against our friends , families , and neighbors ?
I do n’t know , but you can count on liberty activists like me to continue using peaceful means to educate and enlighten the masses with reason and logic , until one day we ’re all looking back amazed that we did n’t figure it out sooner .
In Peace ,
SamIAm
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The White House has rejected South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford 's request to use a portion of the state 's allotted federal stimulus funds to pay off state debt instead of spending it on government services or programs .
South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford asked to use some of his state 's stimulus funds to pay off the state debt .
Sanford is perhaps the most outspoken Republican opponent of the stimulus bill .
He asked the president last week for a waiver that would have allowed South Carolina to use a quarter of the money -- $ 700 million -- to pay down " our very sizable state debt and contingent liabilities . "
In a Monday letter to Sanford that CNN's Jessica Yellin obtained , White House Budget Director Peter Orszag rejected the request .
He wrote that the $ 48.6 billion allocated to the states must be used for education and public works projects .
" Congress has not authorized the Executive Branch to waive any of the above statutory requirements governing the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund , " Orszag wrote , saying he was writing at the president 's request .
Sanford 's office responded to the rejection , saying it would draft another plan for the White House " which will more narrowly tailor our request to pay off debt in a way consistent with the administration 's response .
We believe there is a way to do so , " said a statement from Joel Sawyer , communications director for Sanford .
The governor has said that if the president does not grant the waiver request , he will reject the funds altogether .
In an interview with CNN last week , Sanford said " spending money you do n't have I think is a horrible idea . "
Sanford 's position on the stimulus was the subject of a new ad by the Democratic National Committee .
When asked to respond to charges by Democrats that he 's using the stimulus debate to position himself for higher political office , Sanford responded , " If you do n't want to debate the merits of the stimulus package itself , instead talk about motives . "
A response from Sanford 's office to Orszag 's letter said the " attack dogs from the DNC " should be called off .
" It 's time for the president 's game of good cop , bad cop to end , and therefore we again ask him to end these ads so we can engage in a productive dialogue on the merits or our request , " the statement said .
The issue of whether to accept stimulus funds could next go before the South Carolina legislature , where lawmakers can vote to overrule their governor .
Rep. James Clyburn , D - South Carolina , who last week called Sanford 's decision not to accept the money " 100 percent political posturing , " said in a statement Monday his state 's needs are numerous .
" The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provides sufficient flexibility for states to address those needs as they see fit , " he said .
" I hope the legislature will move forward with plans to draw down recovery funding to meet our needs . "

Ron Gilbert - the DeathSpank Interview
Interview - posted by baby arm on Tue 12 May 2009 , 07:10:58
Tags : DeathSpank
1 . Tell us about DeathSpank .
What 's the premise ?
The gameplay ?
The elevator pitch for DeathSpank is Monkey Island meets Diablo .
All the interesting and complex storytelling and humor of the golden age of adventure games blended with an action RPG .
That said , DeathSpank is not a hardcore RPG .
2. Describe some of the RPG aspects you intend on having in the game ( character creation , stats , equipment , etc ) .
The one thing DeathSpank is missing from the traditional RPG is character creation , since the game revolves around the character DeathSpank .
He is who he is .
Do n't try to change him .
But , there are a lot of different stats , equipment and abilities in the game .
Players will build those up over time , customizing DeathSpank to fit their play style and challenges the game throws at them .
3 . How are you combining the adventure and RPG elements ?
What will the balance between the two genres be ?
More adventure or more RPG ?
Good question and probably the hardest thing about designing DeathSpank .
If there were ever two genres that belonged together , I think it 's Adventure and RPG .
They share a lot in being story and world focused .
But there are also differences , mainly in what motivates players to move forward and how they attack problems .
An adventure game can be described as a bunch of immovable objects you need to navigate your way around , and a RPG is a bunch of really heavy objects you need to push out of the way .
I would be lying if I said it 's not a constant challenge to balance the two .
As John F. Kennedy once said of the moon landings :
We do these things , not because they are easy , but because they are hard .
4 . What about dialog ?
Will there branching dialog trees ?
Yes , the way you interact with other characters ( besides beating on the them with a sword if the need arises ) is humorous Monkey Island style dialog trees .
In the past few years this has become a lost art .
Players today do n't seem to enjoy a good conversation , or maybe it's that no one is giving them a good one to enjoy .
5 . How important will the story be in DeathSpank ?
What sort of story could you create around this character ?
Story is paramount to the game .
This is one of the strongest aspects borrowed from traditional adventure games .
There is a complex story the weaves its way through the world .
DeathSpank has always been a character that stories just write themselves around given that both the character and the game are a satirizing of games and two dimensional game characters .
6 . What about exploration ?
Will there be a world to roam around in or it will it be a more linear situation ?
It 's a completely open world .
You can go anywhere you want , provided that you can either puzzle solve or fight your way there .
There is not set order events will unfold in .
This aspect of how stories are told is taken directly from good classic adventure games ( not the bad ones , just the good ones ) .
The large non -linear world is also completely load - less .
As you wonder from area to area , in and out of caves and buildings , there is never a load screen .
In my mind , this kind of immersion is one of the more important aspects of the game .
7. Since a Diablo mention is unavoidable at some point , is there anything about Diablo you 'd like to avoid with DeathSpank ?
There are a couple of things .
But first , I think Diablo is a brilliantly designed game .
It should be standard for deconstruction in game schools ( if game schools did that sort of stuff , which they do n't , which is too bad ) .
I never felt the Diablo world was one that I could just explore and experience .
Diablo is very much about getting equipment / stats to kill the next thing you encounter ( PvP mode aside ) .
While there is a very rich world , it 's mostly told as backstory .
I prefer stories are told to me while I play the game .
Some of the older games such as Baldur 's Gate do a pretty good job of this .
Zelda also does this well .
8 . Does the sad fate of Hellgate : London give you any pause about going into the action RPG business ?
After all , these guys were professionals at this sort of thing ...
No .
One game failing to live up to expectations should never write off an entire genera .
It 's important to look at games that fail as much as games that succeed .
There are always lessons to be learned .
9 . Can we expect further RPGs from you in the future , whether action - oriented or more traditional ?
I tend not to think too far in the future .
10 .
Is it anymore of a challenge incorporating comedy into an action RPG rather than an adventure game ?
Is there any difference in how you 'd approach it ?
The most important thing for me when integrating comedy into DeathSpank was to make sure -- at some level -- the combat is always taken seriously .
I did n't want to give DeathSpank a bunch of silly abilities like throwing a pie in someone 's face or farting .
There are funny things he does , such as cast a spell that conjures a bunch of chickens that attack someone ( it 's the funniest thing you 've ever seen ) but there are real stats behind the attack .
Players can look at it and understand the damage it does and the effects it has on the enemies ( i.e. fearing them ) , plus these chickens are tearing some guy to pieces .
Tragedy is when bad things happen to you , comedy is when bad things happen to someone else .
11 . What made you decide to go with Hothead Games ?
What was your role on the Penny Arcade games ?
The main reason I went with Hothead was they were a small Indie studio that self published their games .
I did not want to do the game with a huge publisher that would want to water down the game .
It 's a weird game .
I wanted to preserve that .
12 . Are there any other studios you 'd like to work with in the future ?
I 'd go work for Blizzard if they wanted me to work on their next MMO .
13 .
What are some of the challenges you 've found working on an episodic game ?
DeathSpank is no longer episodic , so I guess you could say there were some challenges . :-)
I really like episodic , but it's hard for it to make financial sense unless you drop yourself into a fairly ridged structure and we decided that was n't the best thing for DeathSpank .
When the industry has matured a little more , I think episodic will be big and I very much want to do that .
14 . Given your and Clayton Kauzlaric 's connection to Total Annihilation , was there any consideration of going with an RTS ?
Any other genres you 'd like to give a try ?
Any genre you 'd never try ?
Funny you should mention that .
Back when I was running Cavedog Entertainment , I was designing a game called " Good & Evil " that was a melding of adventure and RTS .
DeathSpank shares a lot in common with that game .
As far as other genres I 'd like to try ?
Just about anything except FPS .
I 'm not a huge fan of them and I 'd probably make a really bad one .
15 .
What recent or upcoming projects in the adventure field excite you , give you hope ?
Anything about the current state of the genre that frustrates you ?
Telltale does a lot of good things with adventure games .
It 's good to see them being commercially successful making them .
It 's also nice to see the indie movement take up the genre , but I 'd love to see more market aware innovation from them .
Adventure games suffer from two problems in todays market : 1 ) The majority of today 's gamers enjoy things that are more visceral .
They like to be told what to do and where to do it and then get good at doing it .
Adventure games are fundamentally about not knowing what to do or where to do it and figuring it out .
Adventure games are slow moving contemplative affairs .
2 ) I believe there is a big emerging market for more traditional adventure games .
Casual players outnumber hard core players today and adventure games ( with some changes ) would have great appeal if we could figure out how to reach them .
It 's a problem time will solve .
16 . Has being the " Monkey Island guy " ever been a hindrance to you in the industry ?
For example , pitching an idea and being told " ... but that does n't sound like an adventure game . "
Just to opposite .
Conversations usually start with " We do n't want to hear an adventure game pitch " .
17 .
It 's pretty safe to say that most of the folks that follow your career are adults .
But are you concerned about keeping DeathSpank below the threshold of a " Mature " title , especially since the yougins are likely to be drawn to any combination of the words " death " and " spank " ?
There is no specific mandate to keep DeathSpank a T .
If the game needs to be a M , it will be a M. Problem with a lot of M titles is they come from " developer immaturity " more than artistic need .
The industry is made up of a lot of people that still giggle when they see a breast .
Being M does n't make you cool .
Making a game where two girls kiss does n't make you an " artist " .
18 . Where do you go after DeathSpank ?
The overarching story in DeathSpank is more than one game , so I hope to finish the sequels in fairly quick succession .
I do n't want to have another Money Island 3 situation .
At the end of the DeathSpank saga all will be explained .
19 .
You 're given $ 10 million and told to go make Diablo 4 or Anachronox 2 .
Which would you go with and what would you do with it ?
Would there be any more or less pressure working with someone else 's I.P. ?
I have a feeling Blizzard 's Diablo 3 cut - scene budget is well over $ 10 million .
Working on someone else 's IP is a lot of work if you want to be true to their creation .
The thing I love about designing games is creating worlds and characters , so working on someone else 's IP always removes one of the " fun components " for me .

If there ’s a positive to the leftward economic lurch among our political class , it has to do with the certainty that the imposed initiatives will fail .
No matter the political party or supposed ideology overseeing it , when politicians seek to share the gains of the productive , their efforts come up short .
Simplified , collectivism applied is collectivism ’s capitulation .
So while there ’s good reason right now to be pessimistic , there ’s also reason to be optimistic given the certainty that we ’ll eventually move in the other direction .
On the tax front , whatever the result of President Obama ’s attempts to move the cost of success upward , his efforts insure a strong response from those eager to simplify the income tax , or abolish it altogether .
When it comes to tax simplification , the debate seems to come down to the merits and demerits of the Flat Tax and the Fair Tax .
The former would tax income at one flat rate , while the latter would tax our consumption .
At first glance , it should be said that both tax solutions are dreamy when we consider their economic implications .
Both , if applied correctly , would lead to the abandonment of all manner of deductions that distort behavior and retard economic growth .
If either were passed , the economy would no longer suffer under economy enervating incentives that cause people to plow money into sinks of wealth like housing , not to mention the purchases of federal and municipal debt that would be much less attractive absent their tax advantages .
For the abolishment of the various deductions alone , the economy would boom given the more rational path that capital would take in the direction of productive investment .
Regarding the flat tax , its greatest appeal is its simplicity .
As its most prominent advocate ( Steve Forbes ) frequently notes , under a flat tax individuals could calculate what they owe the federal government on what would amount to a postcard .
The potentially greater unseen here would be the economic boost that would result from smart minds producing , rather than evading the tax collector , not to mention all the money formerly consumed on lawyers and accountants that would flow into the productive economy .
Assuming these taxes were n’t withheld , but instead were paid on a monthly or quarterly basis , the dynamism of the flat tax would be even greater .
Indeed , one problem with tax withholdings is that individuals do n’t as much feel the sting of writing a check to the federal government with regularity .
If this were to be implemented under a simplified tax code , Americans would become intimately aware of the cost of government , and hopefully ask for less of it in return for lower tax bills .
The obvious negative of a flat tax has to do with the basic truth that taxes on income are a price put on work .
Work is penalized when income is taxed .
And while the most productive among us would presumably embrace with vigor a lower , flatter rate , there is the problem that usually materializes under low rates of taxation whereby the rich provide the vast majority of federal revenues .
In that case , it seems a flat tax perfectly applied would include a ceiling after which the rate would go to zero .
Considering a consumption tax , or what its advocates call the Fair Tax , if applied correctly this is surely the ideal tax .
Rather than a system that penalizes work and savings , we should have a tax that only shows up when we consume .
This would insure that more money would be saved and flow to productive investment , plus with each purchase , Americans would see up close the horrific cost of government .
It ’s pointed out by many that a consumption tax would be more equitable for those in the underground economy paying their share of taxes given the difficulty of evading taxes assessed at the time of purchase .
On its face this is a positive , but it could be argued that we should n’t cheer big increases in government revenues .
We should n’t because rather than save those revenues for a rainy day , governments invariably use revenue spikes to create new programs that are difficult to sunset .
Higher revenues could well be the result of flat or fair taxes , but this would n’t necessarily be a good thing .
Naysayers suggest that a consumption tax is regressive due to the reality that the poor almost by definition consume more of their total income .
But those naysayers speak with a forked tongue .
Indeed , out of one side of the mouth they decry regressive tax rates , but out of the other they frequently wail about what they deem the ‘ wealth gap ’ .
The problem there is that the only way for an individual to amass wealth is if that individual saves .
The beauty of a consumption tax is that it would drive incentives among the non-rich to save more , and in doing so , build their wealth .
The alleged regressive nature of taxes on consumption would in fact reduce gaps in wealth .
It says here the wealth gap is not a problem – if anything it ’s a positive for the risk taking it engenders – but if a reduction of wealth inequality is the goal , a consumption tax is the answer .
Another potential negative of a consumption tax involves the certain frenzied lobbying that would ensue for exemptions .
With “ our children ’s future ” used as an excuse , the education and book publishing lobbies would seek exemption from the tax altogether .
Following them outside the office of each legislator would be the lobbyists for every weak industry in the United States ( think carmakers , airlines , newspapers to name three ) looking for similar exemptions .
The good would likely outweigh the bad , but it ’s not unrealistic to fear that the imposition of a consumption tax would also lead to a process whereby exemptions would serve to prop up the weak , thus blunting the healthy process of Schumpeterian “ creative destruction . ”
Despite the negatives mentioned about both taxes , assuming either were a possibility , it would be foolhardy to let the perfect be the enemy of the good .
At present , our wildly complicated tax code saps our productivity all the while driving massive amounts of precious capital away from the productive economy .
Be it the Fair or Flat tax , either one would drive massive economy - wide gains alongside large wage increases for all .
So while things may look bleak today , the looming failure of our bipartisan flirtation with collectivism means that somewhere down the line there will exist the opportunity to right our economic course .
Here ’s hoping that when that day comes , the coalitions are in place to push through the very tax simplification that would forever discredit the impoverishing notion suggesting we ’re better off economically when we penalize the work and savings of the productive .

Galveston ’s mayor gets hurricane evacuation tips in Cuba Galveston ’s mayor gets evacuation tips in Cuba
Cuba typically floods hurricane - evacuation areas with police and military personnel to convince residents reluctant to evacuate that their possessions are secure .
That ’s among the lessons that Galveston Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas learned Thursday in a meeting with a top Cuban official here .
Thomas discussed hurricane preparedness with Dago­berto Rodriguez Barrera , Foreign Ministry vice minister , for about two hours on the second day of her fact - finding visit to this storm - lashed country .
She is here for four days to share information on how to cope with hurricanes .
While in Havana , Thomas also visited the Hospital Nacional and the Latin American Center for Disaster Medicine to learn how Cuba copes with hurricane - related injuries .
“ We ’ve learned a lot , and we ’ve got a lot of work to do , ” the mayor said about the meetings , saying she would answer questions later .
Her visit to Cuba comes as the communist nation and the U.S. seek to improve relations .
President Barack Obama last week eased restrictions on U.S. - Cuban travel and allowed American companies to seek to operate satellite radio and television on the island .
Thomas arrived Wednesday and dined with Cuban author and poet Pablo Armando Fernandez , but did not meet with government officials until Thursday .
She hopes to bring back information from Cuba , which was hit by four hurricanes last year , including Ike .
Evidence of Cuba ’s experience with hurricanes is n’t hard to find .
Battered buildings along the five - mile Malecon , a seawall next to Havana Harbor that was built the same time as Galveston ’s Seawall , are testimony to a tidal wave spawned by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
Ike crashed ashore on Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula on Sept. 13 , submerging most of the island and sweeping away houses on the peninsula .
Hurricanes Ike , Faye , Gustave and Paloma struck Cuba last year , which is recovering much more slowly than Galveston because of its weaker economy , said Patrick Doherty , director of the U.S. - Cuba Policy Initiative at the New American Foundation in Washington , D.C .
Only 7 deaths from Ike
Residents of the nation of 11.4 million have an average monthly income of $ 17 , and Cuba lost 10 percent of its gross domestic product because of damage from Ike.
Cubans ’ daily caloric intake , or the amount of calories from food , has fallen 30 percent since the storm .
However , the Associated Press reported only seven deaths in Cuba from Ike , far fewer than the number of fatalaties in Texas .
Nicholas Kralj , a lobbyist for the Galveston County Beach Erosion Task Force who accompanied Thomas to Thursday ’s meeting , said Rodriguez acknowledged that even Cuba had to deal with residents reluctant to evacuate during a hurricane .
Although Cuban evacuations are mandatory , the government makes sure residents feel secure about leaving their homes by a heavy police and military presence , Kralj said .
National hurricane drill
Police and soldiers even move furniture and goods to the second stories of homes where residents were unable to do so , he said .
“ These are people who obviously do n’t have the same resources we have and are able to evacuate millions of people , ” Kralj said .
Cuba evacuated at least 900,000 to safe zones and state - run shelters as Ike approached the island .
A mainstay in evacuation preparedness is the two - day hurricane drill the entire country undergoes in May .
The government also requires all adults to take civil defense training .
Cuba ’s state - run media broadcasts hurricane information and weather reports nonstop .
Kralj said he hopes to meet with Cuban officials who will advise him how they cope with erosion and environmental problems caused by hurricanes .
At the hospital and the Disaster Medicine Center , Thomas learned that Cuba evacuates patients but keeps its hospitals open during storms to provide medical care , said Gerald Sullivan , Port of Galveston board chairman , who is part of the mayor ’s entourage .
“ They are much more experienced than we are because they get every hurricane that comes through , ” Sullivan said .
Thomas is expected to meet with officials from Cuba ’s Meteorological Institute Friday .

WTKK in Boston has indefinitely suspended conservative talk show host Jay Severin for blaming the swine flu on “ some of the world ’s lowest primitives ” in Mexico .
He also referred to Mexicans as unhygienic leeches from a primitive country .
According to Think Progress over the course of this week Severin has said , “ So now in addition to venereal disease and the other leading exports of Mexico — women with mustaches and VD — now we have swine flu . …
We should be if anything surprised that Mexico has not visited upon us poxes of more various and serious types considering the number of cimminalieans already here … ”
He also called Mexicans unhygienic , and blamed them for the swine flu , “ When scoop up some of the world ’s lowest of primitives in poor Mexico and drop it down in the middle of the United States .
Poor , without skills , without language , not share our culture , not share our hygiene . …
It ’s millions of leeches from a primitive country . …
Now they are exporting a rather more active form of disease which is the swine flu . ”

I do n’t even know what to say about this blatant racism .
The station was more than justified in suspending Severin .
After 9/11 , some Republicans thought that racism against people from the Middle East , and Muslims was acceptable , and now they are using the swine flu to unleash their racism against Mexicans that was barely below the surface to begin with .
In an article on the Boston Globe website , Severin is described as , “ a bombastic voice whose views often mirror those of fringe conservatives . ”
We first got a taste of this form of racism when George W. Bush tried to pass comprehensive immigration reform , but Severin ’s comments take it to a whole new level .
Of course , he was just following the lead of conservative talkers like Michael Savage , who have spent the week railing against Mexicans for spreading the swine flu .
I would argue the biggest threat to America is n’t a virus , like the flu , but exploitation of this crisis to fan the flames of racism .
Comment Lies , spin and establishment contempt for the rules by which the rest of the population are meant to live , are nothing new .
It is just possible , however , that the last few weeks have been a tipping point , with large swathes of the population now questioning just why they should adhere to the letter of the law when others do n’t .
More seriously , if this resentment spills over into active disobedience , then for a while at least , the British population may become just that bit less governable – with all the implications that may have for added costs of law enforcement .
It begins with spin .
Over the last year , The Register may have given the impression that it is less than confident in the views expressed by the Secretary of State for Culture , Media and Sport , Andy Burnham .
One very definite flash point was his observation that it would not be impossible that " before you download something there is a symbol or wording which tells you what 's in that content " .
He added : " It does n't seem over - burdensome for these to be regulated " .
For this we have taken him to task – frequently – interpreting his words as indication that he thinks that it is possible to categorise the billions of pages on the internet in a way that is even remotely akin to the classification systems applied to film .
That , in turn , has led to some lively debate with his departmental press office , who will neither confirm nor deny such an interpretation .
As their spokesman puts it : " Those are his words .
How you interpret them is up to you " .
We are not so sure about that .
This is a tactic that politicians regularly adopt in public debate , setting out a proposition that is open to a range of interpretations – and then steadfastly refusing to be pinned down on what they actually mean .
It is arguably disrespectful to the public : Worse , it introduces a sense that it is perfectly acceptable to obfuscate and duck responsibility for personal utterances – a trend that is exacerbated in everyday life by the widespread use of automated customer service centres and service staff not allowed to deviate from their pop -up script .
A far more dangerous piece of rhetoric was let loose on the British public by Deputy Prime Minister , and trained lawyer , Harriet Harman MP .
In response to question by Andrew Marr in his politics programme on 1 March , she said of the controversial pension awarded to Fred Goodwin , former chief executive at Royal Bank of Scotland : " It might be enforceable in a court of law , this contract , but it is not enforceable in the court of public opinion and that is where the government steps in " .
That phrase – the " court of public opinion " - may eventually be her political epitaph .
Whilst it plays well to the gallery and is qualified by the caveat that " this is where the government steps in " , it introduces a dangerous expectation of populism to the political debate , as well as a challenge to any and every slightly unpopular measure the government wishes to introduce .
What , for instance , has the court of public opinion to say on issues such as ID cards ?
The policing of photography ?
Phorm ?
Not to mention MP ’s expenses and the recently discovered practice of " flipping " .
What , too , has it to say about those individuals who have reacted to the expenses row by hurling bricks through the window of their local MP 's surgery ?
It is , however , in the area of policing that on - going and deep damage is in the process of being done to respect for the law .
This week we reported the case of Colin Port , Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Police , who has gone public with his own populist rhetoric , proclaiming his willingness to go to prison before obeying a court order .
Our own investigation suggests the matter is more complex than the simplistic " court sides with paedophile " spin provided by the Sun .

Guandique , a day laborer , came under the scrutiny of investigators months after Levy disappeared , but a series of delays and missteps allowed the case to languish .
Nine months before Levy 's remains were found in Rock Creek Park , a D.C. inmate came forward to say that Guandique had confessed to the crime while they were in jail , but the inmate 's account was dismissed after he failed an FBI - administered polygraph exam .
A polygraph test taken by Guandique before he was sentenced in the other two attacks was deemed " inconclusive . "
Neither exam was administered by a bilingual polygrapher , even though Guandique and the other inmate speak little or no English .
Polygraph results can be skewed if there are translation problems , experts say .
Interestingly , while it is now being claimed that Guandique 's polygraph results were " inconclusive , " this is not what was reported back in 2002 .
Press accounts from the time make it unambiguously clear that Guandique passed a polygraph test , and that investigators relied on those results in ruling out Guandique as a suspect .
( At the time of Guandique 's polygraph test , then Congressman Gary Condit , who had had an extramarital affair with Levy , was the focus of the investigation , and polygraph results were also at issue .

Quote :
Detectives in the Chandra Levy murder case are focusing on a man convicted of assaulting two women jogging in Rock Creek Park last year -- a suspect who was initially discounted after he passed a polygraph test that investigators now believe was flawed .
Ingmar A. Guandique , 21 , has been in prison for the assaults on the joggers since July 2001 , two months after Levy disappeared .
After her remains were found in the park May 22 , some investigators reexamining his case were struck by the similarities in the three crime scenes , law enforcement sources said .
Investigators then discovered that a Spanish - speaking interpreter instead of a bilingual polygraph technician was used in administering Guandique 's polygraph , sources said .
Relying on an interpreter , according to legal experts , can skew the results of the test because the questions are filtered through and possibly altered by the interpreter .
...
A Tip Discounted
D.C. police first spoke to Guandique about the Levy case in the summer of 2001 after U.S. Park Police alerted them to his arrest in the jogger assaults , according to court records .
But law enforcement sources said they found nothing to indicate he was involved in her disappearance , especially since , at the time , they were n't aware that her body was in the park .
After Guandique 's arrest , an inmate at the D.C. jail told authorities that Guandique had confided in him that he stabbed Levy and left her body in the park , law enforcement sources said .
The inmate did n't try to trade the information for a lighter sentence , saying he came forward because he felt bad for the Levy family .
In September 2001 , the inmate failed a polygraph test , also administered through an interpreter .
Guandique , who denied involvement in the Levy case , passed , the sources said , and authorities felt comfortable that he was not their man .
When Levy 's body was found eight months later , Guandique 's name surfaced as someone who had attacked other women in the park .
High - ranking police , knowing that their detectives had discounted him because of the polygraph , played him down as a suspect , with Ramsey scolding , " The press is making too big a deal of it . "
Ramsey 's then - deputy , Terrance R. Gainer , was more blunt : " He was n't our suspect then .
He 's not our suspect now . "
Ramsey last week defended the use of the interpreter .
" When you 've got language issues , it 's not unusual to use a translator , " he said .
But Billy Franklin , director of the Virginia School of Polygraph in Norfolk , said he prefers not to use interpreters because if they do n't pose the questions correctly , the answers can be wrong .
" In such an important case , they should have used a bilingual examiner if possible , " he said .
James Starrs , professor of law and forensic science at George Washington University , contends that because lie detector tests can be unreliable , they should n't always determine the course of an investigation .
" Simply because someone passes the test , they should n't be written off , absolutely not , " he said .
The re-characterization of Guandique 's polygraph results as " inconclusive " and the suggestion by " experts " that " polygraph results can be skewed if there are translation problems " seem to be post hoc rationalizations for an apparent failure of the polygraph .
But there is a simpler explanation for such failure :
The Chandra Levy murder investigation appears to be yet another example of a case where misplaced reliance on the pseudoscience of polygraphy led to investigatorial misdirection .
staff writers Sari Horwitz and Scott Higham report that on 3 March 2009 , a warrant was issued for the arrest of Ingmar Guandique , who was polygraphed about the disappearance of Chandra Levy in 2001 .
Regarding that polygraph examination , Horwitz and Higham write : Interestingly , while it is now being claimed that Guandique 's polygraph results were " inconclusive , " Press accounts from the time make it unambiguously clear that Guandiquea polygraph test , and that investigators relied on those results in ruling out Guandique as a suspect .
( At the time of Guandique 's polygraph test , then Congressman Gary Condit , who had had an extramarital affair with Levy , was the focus of the investigation , and polygraph results were also at issue .
See FBI Doubletalk on Condit's Polygraph Results .)
Here is whatstaff writers Sari Horwitz and Allan Lengel reported on 29 September 2002 regarding the polygraph examination of Ingmar Guandique :
The re-characterization of Guandique 's polygraph results as " inconclusive " and the suggestion by " experts " that " polygraph results can be skewed if there are translation problems " seem to be post hoc rationalizations for an apparent failure of the polygraph .
But there is a simpler explanation for such failure : polygraphy is junk science .
No one should be surprised when an invalid test produces erroneous results .
Today is Earth Day .
Every year on April 22 , trees are planted , litter is cleaned up , and awareness for the issues plaguing the planet are raised , in honor of the holiday , which is celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2020 .
The first Earth Day was on April 22 , 1970 .
Environmentalists took to the streets with concerned citizens and pop culture icons , like poet Allen Ginsberg , who were asked to speak on behalf of Mother Earth .
The 1970s saw the passage of the most comprehensive environmental legislation in U.S. history , including the Clean Air Act , the Water Quality Improvement Act , the Endangered Species Act , the Toxic Substances Control Act , and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act .
In addition , just eight months after the first Earth Day , Richard Nixon approved the creation of a new organization tasked with monitoring the nation ’s natural assets : the Environmental Protection Agency .

I manage a company that spends every day inspecting and cleaning water storage tanks and towers .
Our goal is to save treated drinking water by performing required inspections without draining storage tanks .
We use underwater cameras that allow us to enter the water system , inspect the tank , and produce a comprehensive report on its condition without disrupting water service .
Over the years our “ no water loss ” inspections have saved tens of millions of gallons of treated drinking water .
Earth
Day makes me think about what could be and how we could do more .
In 2019 we inspected 651 potable water storage tanks and towers , but we only cleaned 105 of them .
and that is a very typical year .
Even on one of our best years in 2017 we inspected 863 facilities but only cleaned 95 .
There were hundreds more that needed to be cleaned but the decision was made not to clean the tank .
To understand why we only clean a fraction of the tanks that need to be cleaned and why that is a big deal , I need to give you a brief explanation of how water systems work .
Your drinking water comes from ground water ( aquifers ) , or from rivers and lakes ( surface water ) .
The most common disinfectant used is chlorine if it is from surface water it is also processed through different media at a water treatment plant .
After the water has been processed it is pumped into a storage facility like a ground storage tank tank ( GST ) , or an elevated storage tank ( EST ) , where it sits and waits until you use it at your tap ( 60 Second Video Click here ) .
A few states have rules that require water storage facilities to be inspected every year but very few require tanks to be cleaned .
Texas Administrative Code 290.46 ( M ) ( 1 ) requires all potable water tanks to be inspected inside and out annually .
I guess it was assumed that when the inspection showed the interior floor was covered with sediment the utility would take action to keep it clean .
That is not what is happening .
Water regulations that keep us safe are much too complex for this article .
The short answer is , as long as water testing is negative for coliform the water is deemed to be safe .
Coliform is what is looked for to determine if microbes can live in the water .
When it is not found the water is deemed safe to drink .
About 7 years ago new rules under the Revised Total Coliform Rule ( RTCR ) required some additional monitoring of total coliform ’s and E. coli .
There are now also requirements for assessments and corrective action when monitoring results show that public water systems ( PWS ) may be vulnerable to contamination .
In this case if no other breach can be found a good look at the water storage tank would meet the requirements for an additional assessment .
If the results of the inspection showed that sediment was covering the floor of the tank , cleaning the tank could be the corrective action needed .
Unfortunately , the complexity of the Revised Total Coliform Rule does not result in most tanks not being cleaned .
In Texas , tank inspections are required but tank cleaning is often put off due to budget constraints or because those responsible do n’t understand the dangers that can lurk in sediment .
The problem is as simple as a game of Hide & Seek .
When conducting the required water testing a sample of water is taken from a tap on , or near , the water tank .
Coliform must be found in the water to know there is a problem .
Only a few feet away sediment on the floor of the tank may be hiding the contamination .
A host of undetected microbes including bacteria , protozoa and even viruses , can use the tank sediment to get a foothold in the tank .
Often left undisturbed for years , these contaminants continue to grow until they overpower the disinfectant in the tank .
They can then be detected through required water monitoring but the damage is already done .
The water system is compromised when testing finds too much Coliform in the system .
Then boiled water notices are sent out to protect public health .
Sediment covering the floor of water storage tanks is a breach .
It is as bad as a hole in the roof .
Sediment can let almost any microbe or parasite that may have just passed through get a foothold in the water system , grow and become a public health problem .
Tank inspections are required in some states .
However , even in those states tank cleanings still require a sales pitch unless the water system is compromised and testing finds too much Coliform in the system .
That is often when we get the call .
Many well managed and well funded water utilities keep their water tanks and towers cleaned .
This is why I came up with the tag line “ Your zip code should not determine your water quality ” .
The fact is , like many other things in life , where you live affects almost everything , but it should not affect your water quality in the United States .
Smaller systems that are not well - funded just need additional information about why keeping water tanks clean makes such a big difference .
When tanks are clean the cost of disinfectants like chlorine goes down .
The system is healthier and less likely to get a RTCR violation .
In this case doing the right thing actually saves money and makes maintaining regulations easier .
This small , overlooked part of the world affects millions of people .
Keeping tanks clean is just basic housekeeping and should be the standard at every public water utility .
Unfortunately , it is not the first thing thought of when violations occur .
The knee - jerk reaction is to add more disinfectants .
However , when the maximum residual is reached , the decision is often made to change disinfectants .
This just adds up to more time and money wasted if the tanks have not been properly inspected or kept clean .
Thanks for staying with me this far .
This is where I decided to DO SOMETHING .
The Ron Perrin Clean Water Tank Project Inc. was established to educate water utility managers about the importance of keeping tanks clean .
Help me get water utility managers to think about cleaning storage tanks FIRST instead of Last or not at all !
We are producing a documentary , promoting our blog and creating literature on the importance of keeping tanks clean .

For a willing music audience , the art of drawing emotion from notes is classic .
Composers play with subtle , intricate changes and rates of change to try and elicit emotion .
In recent studies , scientists found that people already familiar with the music are more likely to catch a chill at key moments :
When a symphony turns from loud to quiet
Upon entry of a solo voice or instrument
When two singers have contrasting voices
People covered in goose bumps also tend to be driven more by rewards , and less inclined to be thrill - and adventure - seekers , according to research conducted at the Institute for Music Physiology and Musicians ’ Medicine in Hanover , Germany .
Mystery Monday Each Monday , this LiveScience series explores an amazing aspect of the world around you .
" Our results suggest that chills depend very much on our ability to interpret the music , " said Oliver Grewe , a biologist and musicologist at the institute .
" Music is a recreative activity .
Even if it is relaxing to listen to , the listener has to recreate its meaning , the feelings it expresses .
It is the listener who gives life to the emotions in music . "
The researchers ' latest findings are currently being reviewed for journal publication , while their previous research has been published in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences .
Music can do more than just give you goose bumps .
A melody can :
Ease labor pain
Reduce the need for sedation during surgery
Evoke strong memories
Lessen depression
Listening to your favorite hits can shift your breathing pattern and speed up your heart rate .
Shivers down the spine even show up in brain scans , according to research at McGill University .
As chills grow in intensity , bloodflow increases between areas of the brain associated with euphoria - inducing vices like food , sex , and drugs .
In the near future , the German research team plans to further study the central nervous system 's reactions to music that gives fans the chills .
OK , we do n't even remember Google ( GOOG ) having a delicious - clone called " Google Shared Stuff . "

Mandalay Pictures has acquired theatrical rights to and will develop a big - screen version of “ Full Metal Panic , ” a Japanese manga series that blends action , comedy and high school romance , says The Hollywood Reporter .
The property derives from writer Shoji Gatoh ’s series about a teenage anti-terrorist commando named Sousuke Sagara who is given the mission to protect a high - school girl with mystical powers .
“ Panic , ” which is set in a world almost exclusively without adults , is known for mixing visceral action with wry comedy .
Zac Efron ’s name has surfaced in connection with “ Panic , ” with the actor holding a conversation on the project , adds the trade .
He ’s also potentially attached to the Warner Bros. adventure Jonny Quest .

Something disturbing is happening in the online broadband space .
Fear , manipulation , and sneaky presentation of facts abound all of it designed to lure competitors ' customers , either by planting doubt in their minds about the honesty of their current providers or by tricking them into thinking that they 've found a bargain .
The other morning as I prepared my lunch , I heard a new Cablevision Optimum Online commercial .
Stopping to watch , I noticed that it was n't one of those catchy ones , with the guy singing the phone number .
Nor was it one of the beautifully produced ones that show people walking around with multimedia playing all over their bodies .
( They 're supposed to be grist for promoting a better life through broadband use , but I think they 're the basis for a horror film .
Whatever . )
This commercial was different .
It featured a woman against a white background Optimum 's preferred color when it wants to be serious trying to set the record straight about what you get from Optimum versus " the phone company " Verizon .
Whenever cable companies want to take on Verizon , or other telcos that are homing in on their broadband and TV business , they invoke the seemingly derogatory " phone company " slur .
Ooh , that 's scary .
I would never want a " phone company " delivering my broadband and TV , would I ?
Obviously , as a Verizon FiOS customer , I would , but back to the commercial .
In this 30 - second - or - so spot , the Optimum lady spends a lot of time talking about all of the hidden fees you incur as a Verizon customer and how , even after you sign up for what that company is touting as a great deal , prices will go up .
And she says horrors !that if you try to get out of the deal before your contract is up , you play cancellation fees .
A lot of this is true .
It was also true when I was with Cablevision , but the great thing about the battle going on between Cablevision and Verizon is that Cablevision has been forced to offer better service and more competitive prices since Verizon started cutting in on its business .
Cablevision will still jack up prices after an initial honeymoon period , too .
That period can last a year or two .
And here 's the kicker :
The Optimum lady said that Verizon would deliver your broadband on its plain old copper lines .
At first I thought , " Well , that 's a bald - faced lie ! "
I watched the Verizon FiOS tech install both my and , and I can tell you in no uncertain terms that the company delivers a fiber line right to a box attached to the side of my house .
It 's fiber all the way back to the company 's switching office .
But wait .
The Optimum lady said Verizon 's broadband service .
She never actually mentioned fiber or FiOS .
That 's when I realized that she 's right .
If you buy Verizon 's other broadband service , DSL , it will be delivered to you via good , old - fashioned copper wires .
Of course , DSL runs at a fraction of the download speeds you get through either fiber or Cablevision .
On the other hand , no one is getting TV through DSL .
I do n't think anyone can say ( or is saying ) that DSL is directly comparable with Optimum 's Triple Play ( broadband , TV , and phone ) or even Optimum 's Internet service by itself .
Yet , if you 're not paying attention , Optimum 's tiny bit of misdirection leaves you with the impression that Verizon 's FiOS service is a lie and is fiber in name only .
At the same time , Cablevision is touting its 100 - Mbps , .
It even got most of the major national media to name it the fastest cable in the country .
This could lead people to think it's the " fastest broadband in the country . "
Yes , Cablevision 's offering is , for now , twice as fast as Verizon FiOS 's current fattest residential pipe , and Verizon charges a whopping $ 144 a month for just 50 - Mbps download speeds .
Still , Cablevision 's new 100 - Mbps service is simply a carrot to lead people to the rest of its more affordable , non DOCSIS 3.0  based ( and therefore slower ) offerings .
Just as hardly anyone is actually paying $ 144 a month for Verizon 's 50 Mbps ( since cheaper , though slower , FiOS packages are available ) , no average consumer is going to pony up almost $ 100 for home broadband service regardless of speed .
It is a brilliant marketing ploy , though .
These superhigh speeds will roll out across the country , but only a handful of well - heeled customers will pay for them .
Those users will inadvertently become foot soldiers in Cablevision 's efforts to battle FiOS in the more affordable broadband space .
Cablevision is not lying about anything ; it 's just doing a bunch of hand - waving to make you look at it , instead of at the other options out there .
The other commercial I 've taken notice of lately is NetZero's .
Company CEO Mark R. Goldston stands there and explains how you can get online for less and save tons of money in the process .
Who would n't want to pay $ 9.99 - a- month for , as the ad puts it , the " same Internet " .
I want it .
Look at all the money Goldston says I 'll save .
It 's amazing .
In these tough economic times , it 's an idea that really resonates with a lot of people .
Here 's the problem :
It is INSANE .
Mr. Goldston is offering dial - up as an alternative to broadband .
Dial - up !
No matter how much pre-fetching and artificial boosting you do , it 's still dial - up .
Not that long ago , I watched the semi-classic You 've Got Mail .
The 1998 film starts with someone dialing onto America Online .
The sound track you hear is the old modem dialing , probably at a 14.4 - baud rate , then connecting and handling the connection with the then - well - known set of toots and whistles ( we used to call it a " handshake " ) .
This is the world that NetZero wants us to return to the only - on - when - you - dial connectivity , with all its worries about sending too - large photos , trying to view too big a video online and giving up , and wondering how you can slice up files so they 're small enough not to choke your narrow dial - up pipe .
I get that people are hurting , but if that 's the case for you , save up your Internet activities for , say , a once - a - week visit to Starbucks , McDonald 's , or your local library .
Do n't suffer through dial - up again .
The thread of connection among all these things is fact versus obfuscation and sometimes outright fiction versus fantasy .
Broadband is not available to everyone everywhere , but that should be the goal .
And the broadband we get should be on the fastest , most reliable pipes out there .
I 'm not trying to say whose pipes those are , but if we all want to find out , then we have to demand the facts and only the facts , please from everyone .

Sony Music
I 2004 ble Side Brok kåret til Årets Urørt .
To hele utgivelser ( « Høge Brelle » og « Kar Me Kjøme Frå » ) senere er de her med sine tredje plate utgivelse .
Denne gangen med mindre hjem steds romantikk , og mer all menn problematikk .
Det er veldig mye riktig med Side Brok .
De har en svært gode hjemme side .
De har en sjarmerende selv ironi , og de kan virkelig skrive tekster på sitt eget språk uten å bli patetiske .
Når gruppa i tillegg klarer å levere hit låter av kaliber så er kombinasjonen ganske unik ( « Pow Wow » og « Kald Trekk » ) så skulle det meste ligge til rette for at dette er det endelige ræv sparket til de som mener at hip hop må være urbant og gangsta .
Det er omtrent like idiotisk å melde som å mene at kun svarte kan rappe ( jeg høyner herved med « The Streets » og « Eminem » ) .
Likevel kan det noen ganger bli litt for mye Paperboys for under tegnende , slik som på sangen « Ej ser » , og andre ganger kanskje litt for mye Torstein Hyyl .
Selv om han er en habil rapper så er det noe anstrengt til tider , samt at jeg føler det mangler noe av det sær egne som for eksempel godeste Skinner fra England kommer med .
Alt i alt er Side Broks tredje plate en habil investering for alle med en viss interesse .
De er i hvert fall mye bedre nå enn når de ble hypet for fem år siden .

This old dog
I learned a few tricks this week for working with one of the oldest interfaces since punch cards , the command line .
More specifically , I found a few shortcuts and features of the console UI provided by Windows , also known as “ The Command line ” , or inaccurately as a “ DOS Window . ”
It turned out to be one of those rare gems that you stumble on that immediately make you more efficient .
If you are interested in the trick I found that inspired this post , check out the article I wrote about it , “ Windows Console Tricks and Shortcuts ” .
A Deeper Understanding of Canines
Indirectly , I also learned a lesson about how extreme familiarity with an interface creates blind - spots that inhibit discovery of new features .
If my experience is typical , it appears that over time users settle into an application and tend to stop looking as aggressively for ways to use it more efficiently .
In fact , I would contend that there exists a tipping point in the learning curve with a user interface beyond which the idea of changing the way a user performs a task in the interface , even if it is simpler , creates anxiety and consequently resistance .
Another possible explanation for how these features are so effectively hidden in plain sight is the tendency of a user ’s UI pattern memory to fade quickly when it is n’t reinforced .
If a standardized technique falls into disuse , it ca n’t easily be resurrected to encourage users to discover features in places that used to be familiar .
This is particularly evident in Raymond Chen ’s recent eulogy for the obscure Windows affordance of left - click menus on system tray icons .
I ’m not sure exactly what the take - away is from this epiphany except perhaps that adding new UI elements to accomplish existing tasks in a mature product is unlikely to create many converts among veteran users .
As a corollary to that , there seems to be a discrete window of time during which it is safe to make extensive modifications to existing UI elements without stressing ( e.g. pissing off ) your existing user - base .
Once that window has elapsed , it is probably safest to keep the old UI available and find a way to encourage new users indoctrinated on using the updated UI .
Applying the Lesson
Several years ago , I found myself on the other side of the discussion .
During my routine debriefings from the sales team , it was communicated to me that some of our competitors were using advanced search functionality as an effective differentiator against our flagship product , a Web - based document repository for litigators .
Naturally , we endeavored to close the gap in the search - UI arms race and quickly began to conceptualize an upgrade to our software .
The application had already been in use for years and had accumulated a loyal following of veteran users who could rightfully claim to be experts on it .
Also , the search interface had changed very little since I originally designed and built it back when I was still bootstrapping our product development team .
The search interface was simple , but functional , and more importantly the venerable UI was very familiar to the existing user - base .
Key issues indicated in the user stories and requirements .
Advanced Searching : Need the ability to run more complex Boolean queries like “ Letters dated May 5th , or Reports from any day in 1993 ” More Sorting Options :
Need the capability to sort on more than one field and specify the sort direction .
Optimization : Avoid querying the contents of the drop - down controls until it is clear that the user intends to use them .
The first requirement had the greatest potential to be disruptive to the familiar layout of the existing search screen .
It would require significant rework to enable users to group search terms and specify an AND or OR operator .
As you can see below , the new version was indeed markedly different visually .
Oops !
During beta testing , existing customers were appreciative for the new capabilities , but were hesitant to accept the new screen layout .
They found the new version confusing and expressed concern about the number of clicks required to do single - field searches .
Some could n’t express exactly what they did n’t like about the new screen , they just felt uncomfortable with it .
Interestingly , users unfamiliar with the old search screen did not register any complaints .
Back to the Drawing Board
Ultimately , I drew the conclusion that the problem was n’t so much that it was a badly designed UI , although I have since reconsidered the layout , but rather that I was effectively devaluing the time investment that longtime users had made to learn how to use the software .
Recognizing this , we took the following approach to keep our loyal customer - base happy , but encourage the gradual transition away from the old interface .
Add an updated version of the existing screen ( shown below ) that addressed as many requirements as possible without a major visual change .
Label the new screen in the UI as “ Advanced ” ( powerful ) to encourage its use .
Label the old screen in the UI as “ Classic ” ( Outdated ) to discourage its use .
Add a toggle link to enable easy switching between the screens ( indicated by red arrows in the screen - shots ) .
Add a setting to allow the user to specify their default search screen .
Configure existing users to continue using the old screen by default .
Configure new users to default to the new screen .
Retrospective
Pop Quiz !
Consider Microsoft ’s decision to scrap the most familiar group of UI elements for most Windows users , the toolbar / menu interface , and replace it with the new “ Ribbon ” control .
Should the negative reaction it engendered have been predicted ?
What do you think MS could have done differently to honor the investment of their customers in learning their “ classic ” interface assuming that they had valid usability research showing that the new UI was superior ?

Channel 4 has won a US libel case against a woman who sought $ 800,000 ( £ 550,000 ) in damages after her name was used in a comedy routine by Sacha Baron Cohen .
In a landmark decision that Channel 4 said would benefit comedy writers , performers and broadcasters in the US , a California judge threw out the claim by the woman , who sued under the name " Jane Doe " , saying it was obvious Baron Cohen 's Ali G skit was not serious .
The woman launched the costly legal action after claiming her name was used in an interview by Baron Cohen 's comedy creation with the historian Gore Vidal for the US version of Da Ali G Show , which was screened on cable network HBO and in the UK on Channel 4 .
In the interview , Ali G asked Vidal why there was any point in amending the US Constitution as the spoof character had a girlfriend - who shared a name with the plaintiff - who was constantly " amending herself " but to no avail .
The woman was also described as a " bitch " and a " minger " .
HBO , which first broadcast the programme in 2004 , had twice settled out of court over the item .
But Channel 4 , which has the international licence for the series as well as handling all foreign sales , took the case to court after the plaintiff pursued charges relating to the show 's wider distribution .
Los Angeles superior court judge Terry Friedman threw out the lawsuit , ruling : " No reasonable person could consider the statements made by Ali G on the programme to be factual .
" To the contrary , it is obvious that the Ali G character is absurd , and all his statements are gibberish and intended as comedy .
The actor , Sacha Baron Cohen , never strays from the Ali G character , who is dressed in a ridiculous outfit and speaks in the exaggerated manner of a rap artist .
" Ali G's statements are similarly absurd .
Altogether , the programme is obviously a spoof of a serious interview programme .
No reasonable person could think otherwise . "
Channel 4 said the decision was only the second of its kind in the US , after a New York court ruling in favour of NBC comedy show Saturday Night Live .
The action was fought by SDD Global Solutions , the Indian arm of Channel 4's US counsel SmithDehn LLP .
Channel 4 described it as a groundbreaking case where " outsourcing " was a " creative solution to running a robust defence " .
Channel 4's controller of legal and compliance , Prash Naik , said it was an " important ruling " for Channel 4 and sent out a " clear signal that we will not hesitate to fight unmeritorious claims of this nature " .
He added : " US court actions are extremely costly to run and even where a defendant wins , little if any of their costs are recoverable from the plaintiff .
As so often happens in cases like this , the ' chilling effect ' of the threat of substantial damages and significant legal costs forces defendants to settle with plaintiffs who have no justifiable claim .
" However , combining the skills and expertise of US attorneys with US law - trained Indian attorneys has proved to be an innovative and cost - effective way for Channel 4 to fight and win the suit . "

[ Jchat ] More APL ( was : No More APL )
I have no doubt that J is growing faster in terms of numbers of users who " take a look at it " and enjoy playing with it .
It 's free and the training materials are excellent .
The discussion forum is much livelier than ours , though PART of that may be because our users are busy making money and do n't necessarily want to ( or have time to ) talk about how they do it ;-)
I can only easily measure our revenues , which have tripled since 2005 , while the number of employees has gone from about 5 to about 15 ( maintaining reasonable profitability ) .
Our existing customers are generally buying more licenses and we have some new customers as well ( sadly mostly through gaining APL marketshare at the moment ) - but we 're only just getting into some real marketing again ...
I salute the army of enthusiastic volunteers who have produce a wonderful language and lots of excellent training materials ( we 're trying to catch up and will have a new book and substantial on line tutorials by the end of this year - and we now have the revenue to invest more in this , which is nice ) .
However :
And this is something that I think the J community should rethink ( and then DO something about if it really cares ) :
Unless its users find a way to start paying substantial amounts of money to jsoftware so that this company can hire some apprentices and start growing , I really do n't see how it can survive in the long term .
The " open software " model is a beautiful idea , but I do n't personally think that it can work for a tool which is most valuable to " domain experts " - people who will pick it because it means they can solve problems using a computer without learning " software engineering " .
The kind of people who can develop a J interpreter are not the people who get the biggest benefit from using one , except for a very small group of exceptionally talented people who we all know by name .
" open source " works fine for the educational materials and tools that ACCOMPANY a J or APL interpreter , because here the overlap between users / contributors is significant .
But NOT for the core product .
There have been many free APL systems over the years but not a single one of them ever gained any significant following .
In terms of pricing , it may be true that there have been companies that rejected APL due to run time pricing being too high , but as far as I know it has n't happened to us .
The price can obviously be set too high but we try to be sure that we 're creating a win / win situation for our customers and building a partnership - we are flexible about the basis upon which runtime fees are computed and do not want to jeopardize the business of our customers .
But we do insist that they make a decent contribution to the ongoing development of the technology , if they are making money by using it .
If YOU want to give YOUR software away , sign up for a 2 % royalty license and pay us 2 % of your revenues - no problem !
My experience is that FAR MORE BUSINESS IS LOST by APL and J folks because the price is TOO LOW - they just do n't get taken seriously .
In fact , this is possibly the biggest threat to the technology , as it is dominated by " geeks " who write software for pleasure and are embarrassed to ask for money .
I 'm still a geek too - but only on every other day .
Because I have come to realize that " commercial folks " are SCARED TO DEATH of people who do n't ask for money for the work that they do , because ( in their eyes ) one of the following " must be true " :
1 ) The software is free because it is no good 2 ) The people who wrote this did it for fun and who knows when they will decide that something else is more fun 3 ) The people who wrote this simply have no idea what they are doing or where they want to go 4 )
All of the above
It is our DUTY to ask for money so that commercial customers understand the value and feel comfortable that we are driven by motives that they understand .
They want someone to blame when it is not working .
And we in turn are then honor bound to use that money to safeguard the investment that our customers are making .
Putting all the money in your pocket without reinvesting ( most ) of it is dishonest , but allowing a technology to wither by not ensuring that it has a solid foundation is every bit as irresponsible ( IMHO !!! ) .
The first thing we did when we took the reins at Dyalog in 2005 was to significantly increase the amount of money that many of our major customers paid us ( essentially by ensuring that they were all paying us according to a consistent , published price list ) .
We were very open about his , explaining our plans for growing the business and more than doubling the size of the development team .
The reception was ( mostly ) enthusiastic - companies who were in the middle of planning an exit strategy because " APL obviously was n't going to survive in the long term " started hiring new APL developers - our " price increase " was actually going to save them a ton of money ( they could cancel " Plan B " which was going to be very expensive and had a high probability of failure ) .
We removed the free run time license under Windows - but we also introduced ( almost ) free non-commercial licenses and royalty agreements , allowing entrepreneurs to get started with no risk or upfront payments .
There were some moans about this , but mostly from people who were concerned that we were committing suicide - not from people to whom it made any monetary difference .
And these concerns have been proved to be unfounded .
As far as I am concerned , a customer who rejects APL on the basis of price is not likely to ever turn into a significant customer anyway , because either he is n’t focusing on what he is good at , or the benefit that APL provides is marginal .
And I do mean " he " , generally speaking " she " will be a bit more level - headed about these things ;-) .
APL and J are valuable tools that will give you a HUGE productivity boost .
If you do n't understands they are worth enough to you to let us ( or jsoftware ) have a couple of percent of the income that derives from them ( J having given you the mythical 1000 % productivity boost ) , they are n't giving you enough and you should probably use something else .
It should be very inexpensive to get started - but people HAVE to contribute when they get real value from using the tool .

There are several indications that J is growing .
The number of all kinds of texts about J in books and web pages seem to be growing a lot .
The messages in the Forums seem to be growing .
There is a major difference in the possibility to grow J compared to earlier APL and most current APLs as well .
J is free and you can also distribute J for free .
Most APLs you need to pay for your own copy and you also need to pay if you create an application and want to give it to others .
At least it used to be that way and I know of major applications that failed because the APL vendor wanted too much money for the runtime APL to go together with the application .
We have no idea of how many J applications there are because they are so easy to distribute .
Another obstacle for APL was / is the need for special font and j does not have that obstacle at all .
There are people saying that APL is stil growing and it certainly is alive and well after all these years but I am pretty sure that J is growing faster .
BALTIMORE —
A religious cult member accused of starving her 1 - year - old son to death is making an unusual deal with prosecutors — she wants her guilty plea to be withdrawn if her child is resurrected .
Ria Ramkissoon , 22 , also agreed Monday to testify against four other members of the now - defunct religious group known as 1 Mind Ministries .
They are charged with first - degree murder in the starvation death of Javon Thompson .
According to a statement of facts read in court , the cult members stopped feeding the boy when he refused to say " Amen " after a meal .
After Javon died , Ramkissoon sat next to his body and prayed for his resurrection .
Her attorney , Steven Silverman , says she still believes the boy will come back to life .
She pleaded guilty to child abuse resulting in death .
EGLIBC : Not a fork , but a glibc distribution

The GNU C library ( or glibc ) is a fundamental component of the Linux operating system .
It provides much of the user - space interface to the kernel as well as a sizable portion of the utility routines that are used by virtually all Linux applications .
A variant of glibc — known as Embedded glibc or EGLIBC — is not very well known outside of the embedded space , but that looks to be changing with the announcement that Debian will switch from glibc to EGLIBC .
The project is quick to point out that it is not a fork of glibc as it aims for compatibility — both source and binary — with glibc .
Instead , EGLIBC is like a distribution of glibc , adding patches to fix problems as well as making it easier to use for embedded applications .
It also adds support for embedded architectures that are not part of the focus of core glibc development .
The project — started in 2006 — is being spearheaded by CodeSourcery , which provides compilers and other development tools based on GCC to its customers .
Chief Sourceror Mark Mitchell says that CodeSourcery provides administrative support for the project and " leadership , but not control " .
Its customers are embedded Linux distributors along with hardware manufacturers and EGLIBC arose from those customers looking for smaller C library solutions .
Mitchell said those customers were looking at uClibc as an alternative to glibc , but using uClibc has some disadvantages because it takes " real work getting applications that work with glibc to work with uClibc " .
Because of the universal use of glibc , " the Linux that you run on a supercomputer and the Linux that you run on a cell phone are very similar " .
One of the key advantages of uClibc , though , is its customizability , so that embedded developers can turn off features —
Mitchell 's classic example is NIS — that are not needed for the product .
That led to adding " option groups " to EGLIBC , which can be enabled or disabled , more - or - less independently to reduce the size of the library .
There are roughly 30 option groups currently defined , but the project hopes that new contributors will add new ones .
By using the option groups , one can disable things like networking ( or just IPv6 networking ) , math libraries , Sun RPC , Streams , various internationalization / localization options , and more .
Working with glibc maintainer Ulrich Drepper can be difficult due , at least in part , to his blunt manner .
While Mitchell is not one to contrast the EGLIBC development community with that of glibc , it is apparent that EGLIBC is trying to be a more inclusive upstream .
Others , including Debian 's Aurélien Jarno , who announced the switch to EGLIBC , are less reticent , pointing to the difficulty of working with Drepper as a main advantage of EGLIBC .
For his part , Mitchell would like to see a " vibrant open - source community " spring up around EGLIBC , noting that " we welcome all comers " .
While the project is funded by a consortium of companies : Freescale Semiconductor , MIPS Technologies , MontaVista , and Wind River ; one does not need to work for those companies in order to contribute .
Nor do the patches need to be focused only on embedded concerns ; bug fixes and features that are not accepted by glibc will be considered .
Mitchell said that EGLIBC is looking forward to contributions from anyone and , in particular , " are hopeful that Debian will contribute " to the project .
So that any contributions can be rolled back into glibc , EGLIBC requires contributors to assign their copyright to the Free Software Foundation as with a glibc patch .
The intent is that the EGLIBC code never stray very far from glibc ; in fact , changes to glibc are merged back into EGLIBC frequently .
Core glibc development is " focused on x86 and other server - class hardware " , Mitchell said , but if that changes , EGLIBC could be merged back into the upstream project .
" We 'd be happy to see FSF glibc pick up anything we 've done , even to the point of obviating EGLIBC " , he said .
Jarno is clearly frustrated with how glibc development is done , quoting from the EGLIBC mission statement as part of the announcement : " Encourage cooperation , communication , civility , and respect among developers . "
But that is not the only advantage to EGLIBC , he lists a number of others including the configurability , a better test suite , and better stable branch handling that makes important bug fixes available for earlier versions .
In a follow up posting to debian - devel , Jarno lists a few more reasons along with answers to some of the questions he has heard .
For Debian in particular , supporting many different architectures , including multiple embedded architectures , is very important .
He notes that EGLIBC is essentially a drop - in replacement for glibc in keeping with that project 's compatibility goals .
The common request to add strlcat ( ) and strlcpy ( ) — BSD string handling functions that avoid buffer overruns — will likely not be satisfied for just those compatibility reasons .
EGLIBC clearly offers some things that the standard glibc lacks — not just for embedded developers .
The focus on being inclusive will likely expand the pool of C library hackers , which is something that the current glibc development community is not actively encouraging .
With luck , it will also act as a test bed for fixes and features — especially as it gets more exposure and testing via Debian — that may lead to a better glibc down the road .
It will be interesting to see if other distributions take the same step that Debian has , and what that might mean for glibc in the future .

I wonder whether Michael Steele agrees with his own organization on this one ?
Today , Obama gave his national security speech at the National Archives , which houses the U.S. Constitution .
Trying to be clever ( which they ’re not ) , the RNC tweeted an attack on Obama for his belief that slavery was a “ fundamental flaw ” in our constitution , we learned via the Media Matters Action Network .
Apparently the RNC does not believe that the Constitution was wrong to permit slavery :
RNC : as he prepares to deliver remarks in hall that holds the constitution , flashback obama : “ constitution flawed ” http://bit.ly/tFL7O #RNC [ Twitter , 5/21/09 ] FACT : Obama Explains
The Constitution ’s “ Fundamental Flaw ” Was Slavery .
The out of context video the RNC links to contains audio from a September 6 , 2001 program called “ Slavery and the Constitution ” on WBEZ Chicago .
On the show , Obama explained that the “ fundamental flaw ” was “ Africans at the time were not considered as part of the polity that was of concern to the framers . ”
In addition , the framers did not “ see…it as a moral problem involving persons of moral worth . ”
[ WBEZ Radio , accessed 5/21/09 ]
As MMAN notes , George W. Bush , Colin Powell and Condi Rice all said similar things .
But , they might not be considered Republicans anymore .
It ’s hard to tell who is and who is n’t these days .
To be clear , when it was written , the U.S. Constitution allowed slavery and counted slaves as three - fifths of a person .
It took the civil war to remedy that provision .
But , in the warped world of the RNC , Obama is wrong to think of slavery as a “ fundamental flaw . ”
What would the RNC call it ?
I ’m willing to wager that even among the 20 % of the public left in the Republican party , probably only a third at most might agree with the RNC that the Constitution was right about slavery .
NOTE FROM JOHN : Joe ’s criticism is really unfair .
The RNC considers minorities at least 4/5 ths a man nowadays .
So far , all of the swine flu viruses isolated from infected people have been virtually identical , which should simplify the development of a vaccine , an official from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday .
" We are aggressively taking the very early steps that are necessary for vaccine manufacture should a decision be made to go ahead and ramp up for full - scale production , " Nancy Cox , chief of the influenza branch at the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , said at a CDC press briefing .
It takes months to develop and manufacture flu vaccine , so scientists have commenced working on one even though it's not yet clear who , if anyone , should be immunized .
" It 's the right time , " said Anne Schuchat , interim deputy director for the CDC's Science and Public Health Program , " because we wo n't have one if we do n't talk about it now . "
Viruses used in flu vaccines are grown in eggs .
The first step toward a swine flu , or H1N1 , vaccine is to grow enough of the virus , Cox said .
To do that , scientists are combining genes from viruses known to grow well in eggs with H1N1 , ending up with a high - growth virus that has H1N1 antigens , or proteins , on its surface .
" That process is going quite well , " Cox said .
" If the virus cooperates and grows well , we will soon be able to distribute a candidate vaccine virus to the manufacturers , " probably in about three weeks .
Manufacturers then will need eight to 10 weeks to produce pilot vaccine lots , which will be used to determine what dose is need to produce an adequate antibody respone in humans , she said .
A question " that 's been on the minds of many " is whether manufacturers will be able to make sufficient numbers of doses of both seasonal flu vaccine and an H1N1 vaccine , Cox said .
Each year , seasonal flu kills tens of thousands of Americans .
" The seasonal vaccine , as you know , is an extremely important tool , " she said .
Already , Cox said , manufacturers have produced a " great deal " of seasonal flu vaccine for the upcoming season , although some are further ahead than others .
" It 's not an either / or situation , " said Donna Cary , a spokeswoman for Sanofi Pasteur , which this past season made 50 million flu vaccine doses — 45 % of the U.S. supply .
Sanofi Pasteur has a brand - new plant next to its older plant in Swiftwater , Pa. , Cary said .
Once the new plant was fully licensed , the company was going to shut it down for renovations , readying it for the possibility of a pandemic , she said .
But , Cox said , it could be used immediately for the manufacture of an H1N1 vaccine if necessary .
Sanofi Pasteur is in " constant contact " with federal public health officials , Cary said .
" They have n't told us to do anything definitely yet . "
Kevin Colgan , a spokesman for GlaxoSmithKline , said , " Until the health authorities determine the type of vaccine that 's necessary , it 's impossible to speculate how it will affect our seasonal flu vaccine production . "
In a press release today , Colgan 's company noted that the company " is continuing to produce and maximize supply of its seasonal influenza vaccine for use in the Southern hemisphere , as it enters the winter season , and for the Northern hemisphere later this year . "
Now , 18 is fewer than our usual complement of 25 , but it ’s still a significant amount .
When we last tasted pilsners from around the world four years ago , we could come up with only four from American craft breweries .
Why would one of the world ’s leading styles of beer have been so poorly represented ?
My guess is that pilsner ’s popularity was exactly what caused craft brewers to look elsewhere .
With so many other styles of beer and ale that were largely ignored and in danger of disappearing , it was far more exciting to recreate India pale ales , porters and wheat beers than it was to dip into the ocean of wan pilsners and other lagers that dominated the American beer marketplace .
Pilsner presented challenges , too .
Unlike ales , which are ready to drink shortly after brewing , lager beers like pilsner ferment more slowly and require time to mature before they are ready to drink .
Storage space for aging lager beers was not always easy to come by for cash - poor brewery startups .
What ’s more , ales tend to offer a more complex array of flavors , which can sometimes hide a flaw or unintended note in a beer .
Pilsners are stark and exposed , glorious in their lean , pared - down simplicity .
They demand disciplined , precision brewing , which can be initially daunting .
It seems , though , that craft brewers are now embracing the pilsner style .
American brewers have been known to take liberties with classic Old World formulas , but we were all impressed by how closely these beers adhered to the pilsner protocol .
That said , both of our top two beers were livelier and more vivacious than some of the great Czech and German pilsners I ’ve had .
The Victory Prima Pils , which was our No. 1 pilsner four years ago , again came in on top .
It seemed to be alive in the glass , with wonderfully refreshing bitterness to balance the floral and citrus aromas .
Likewise , our No. 2 beer , the Kaiser Pils from Pennsylvania Brewing , was bracing in its refreshment .
Perhaps the Americans are brewing with particular élan , or maybe the American brews have the advantage of freshness as against the imports .
The pilsner flavor profile is a strict one , without a lot of diversity aromatically or in the mouth .
What set apart the beers we liked best from those lower on the list was , for lack of a better term , a sense of liveliness , focus and clarity .
The Lagunitas Pils may have had a bit more obvious malt flavor to it , while the Lakefront Klisch Pilsner had a tropical fruit aroma that we sensed in no other beer .
But by and large few obvious differences separated the beers .
This afternoon Arlen Specter ( R - Pennsylvania ) announced he is joining the Wu - Tang Clan , a prominent , loosely organized group of hardcore rappers that first formed in the early '90s .
At a press conference with all 9 original members , including the RZA , GZA ( pronounced " Rizza " and " Jizza " ) and Method Man , a visibly disoriented Specter read from a prepared statement :
" My life had got no better , same damn ' Lo sweater .
Times is rough and tough like leather , " said the senior senator of his 29 - year membership with the GOP .
" I figured out I went the wrong route .
So I got with a sick tight clique and went all out . "
After Specter finished reading his statement , the members of the Wu took questions .
" We 're just happy to have Mr. Specter on board , " said Ghostface Killa , who because of the room 's low - lying cloud of smoke was barely visible .
" When he contacted my office this morning , what else could I tell him but ' Welcome Aboard ! "
" It 's hard to argue with 29 years of Senate experience , " said the ghost of Ol ' Dirty Bastard .
" In this economy , even a multi-platinum , grammy - nominated super group needs as much help as possible . "
The press conference ended abruptly after Inspectah Deck lambasted the press corps for its overreporting of Somali pirates , Obama 's new dog , and the Swine Flu " pandemic " in the middle of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression .

Star Zach Braff ( right ) will return for six " transitional " episodes Medical comedy series Scrubs has been renewed for a ninth series , despite predictions it had come to an end .
The show , which stars Zach Braff , wrapped up earlier this year with an episode called " My Finale " , which resolved several ongoing storylines .
The series had seen low ratings after moving from NBC to rival network ABC and Braff , who plays Doctor John " JD " Dorian announced he was leaving .
But ABC says the show will continue - with Braff returning for six episodes .
He is expected to hand over to a new line - up , including several regular cast members and some of the medical interns introduced in the most recent series .
According to trade paper Hollywood Reporter , actress Sarah Chalke ( Dr Elliot Reid ) has also been approached to work on the transitional episodes .
Returning regulars include Donald Faison ( Dr Turk ) , John C McGinley ( Dr Cox ) and Neil Flynn , whose character is known simply as The Janitor .
ABC has also commissioned three new comedies , including a new vehicle for Frasier star Kelsey Grammer , who will play the lead in Hank , about a high - flying executive who finds himself out of work .
Sci - fi surprise
Fans have petitioned online for the return of Dollhouse Meanwhile Fox has surprised critics and fans alike by ordering a second series of struggling sci-fi series Dollhouse .
The Joss Whedon - scripted drama stars Eliza Dushku as a secret agent whose mind has been wiped so she can be imprinted with any personality her handlers require .
It suffered near - disastrous ratings , and many assumed it would suffer the same fate as its creator 's previous series , Firefly , which was pulled after just 11 episodes .
But , according to The Hollywood Reporter , executives took into account Firefly 's longevity - it has continued to sell well on DVD and spawned a big - screen movie , Serenity - when deciding Dollhouse 's fate .
Producers are also reported to have promised budget cuts to secure a second series .
The show premieres in the UK this week on the Sci-Fi Channel .

The gadget : Wazabee 3DeeShell , a screen filter that turns your iPhone screen into a 3D photo viewer .
Advertisement
The price : $ 50
The price , again : $ 50 ( seriously ? )
The verdict :
My eyes are now all screwed up .
Seriously .
The Wazabee 3DeeShell is essentially an iPhone case built around one key feature : a 3D screen filter .
Obviously it can't turn the OS into a 3D experience , but the Shell promises to offer glasses - less 3D in the form of stereoscopic images you can take on your iPhone ( with the purchase of their $ 1 3DeeCamera software ) .
Advertisement
I do n't know where to start with the shortcomings of this product .
It 's a train wreck of molded plastic , a product so horridly useless , even amongst novelty gadgets , that it should be banned from sale in the free market .
There 's the issue of the design .
Once you slide the 3D filter onto your screen , you can no longer navigate the iPhone .
Therefore , while using their software ( that 's not free with my $ 50 , otherwise completely useless purchase ? ) you need to continually move the filter up to hit a button , and then down again to see the results .
You can capture " 3D " photos by taking two slightly different pictures of an object and combining them in that $ 1 software I mentioned above .
I was unable to do so without crashing the program ( though to be fair , this might be my firmware 3.0 getting in the way ) .
However , I was able to 3D - ize an existing photo .
The result is not quite as good as any bad hologram I 've ever seen , mostly creating the illusion that the photo was ever so slightly sunken in my display .
It 's a tad better than 2D in terms of depth , but the results are quite blurry , and the extent to which it fucks with your eyesight is not worth the 2 minutes of near - entertainment .
Advertisement
( In case you believe my 3D - izing skills to be lacking , I also tried out their free space shooter title .
I do n't know what to say about it other than the game 's fun level is on par with creating Excel spread sheets and it in no way appears 3D . )
45 minutes after testing , I still can't focus properly with my left eye .
I 'm not sure what a few rusty nails go for these days , but it 's gotta be less than 50 bones .
Advertisement
There 's simply nothing worthwhile about the Wazabee 3DeeShell that can justify either its existence or its please - punch - me - in - the - face cutesy name .
Given the laughable price and ( temporary ? ? ) damage to my vision , I do n't believe that I can recommend the purchase , nor can I recommend any programmer create content for the " platform " when its SDK hits later this month .
Also of note , in some unnecessarily cruel twist of fate , I can't get this shell off my phone .
Thanks Wazabee .
You guys are the best .

At a later time , I was able to remove the shell from my phone

Sen . John Cornyn ( R - TX ) was on ABC’s This Week today discussing the nomination Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court .
Cornyn said that it is possible that Republicans could filibuster the nomination , but that it is too premature to make that determination now .
When asked about a filibuster by host George Stephanopoulos , Cornyn said , “ I think it ’s really premature to say that or to speculate .
I ’m not willing to judge one way or the other , George , because frankly we need to not pre-confirm , and to give Judge Sotomayor the fair hearing that Miguel Estrada and indeed Clarence Thomas were denied by our friends on the other side of the aisle . ”
I think Cornyn is giving lip service to filibuster just in case something comes out in Sotomayor ’s confirmation hearing .
There is also a political angle here .
If Cornyn would come out and say that a filibuster is off the table , the Rush Limbaugh wing of the GOP would have gone ballistic .
In the same interview , Democrat Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) said that Sotomayor is filibuster proof .
Advertisements
In this day and age of American politics , I do n’t believe that any nominee is filibuster proof , but as long as Sotomayor satisfies Republican questions about her judicial philosophy , I do n’t see her having any problems .
What is likely to happen is that the nominee gives a good accounting of herself during the confirmation hearings , a handful of Republicans end up supporting her , and talk radio throws a major hissy fit .
How long does it usually take you to make a hairstyle ?
I doubt that ’s more than 10 minutes in the morning , actually it
takes me around two minutes to make something on my head since my hear is really short .
Can you imagine yourself or your friend making you a hairdo from the early morning till very evening before going to the club ?
Believe me or not , but there were times when this was a reality .
And can you imagine that all the other women around have the same hairstyle ?
Same length of the hair ?
Same color of the hair ?
Sounds like hell right , but if you were in the court in the earlier days you would have to keep to the strong rules of the court etiquette .
The history of the coiffures of the XVIII century is amazing .
The XVIII century is considered to be “ a century of women ” .
That ’s the time of sophistication , mannerism , simplicity and unimaginable complex coiffures at the same time .
Hair has always been a reflection of general trends in fashion and Rococo style defines the accents in the XVIII century .
The history of the women hairstyle of the 18th century can be divided into several stages .
Till 1713 the aristocratic ladies were still wearing the fontage which form and look by itself was a piece of art .
The new era in headdresses began in 1713 , at a ceremonial reception at Versailles , when a Duchess of Shrewsbury appeared before Louis XIV without a fontage with the smooth and slightly curly hair decorated with lace and flowers .
Louis liked that , and since he was the leader of European fashion at that time it was a command for the court to follow this new trend in hairstyles .
This seeming simplicity became a major fashion tendency of Rococo century .
All the ladies from the paintings by Watteau , Boucher , Patera , de Troyes , Chardin of this time have simple and modest yet graceful coiffures , no matter whether this is a luxury marquise de Pompadour , virtuous Maria Theresia or young Fike of Tserbsta .
Just listen to the names of the hair cuts : « Butterfly » , « sentimental » , « secret » , « mollycoddle » .
However somewhere from mid 70 - ies the hairstyle started “ growing up ” again .
It emerged into a complex structure and was was as high and unimaginable as ever before .
Ingenious women used almost everything they could find to make their headdress , including most popular belts , jewelry , fabrics , flowers , fruit .
Of course , their own hair was not enough to make such a piece of art and they used the hair of their servants and even the horse ’s mane .
After becoming a Queen Marie Antoinette spent most of the time inventing new hairstyles and clothes .
Her personal hairdresser Léonard was bringing all her fantasies into life .
Joint work of a hairdresser and the Queen gave the world such masterpieces as « explosion sensitivity » , « concupiscent » , « secret passion » ( just compare with pale « mollycoddle » or modest « butterfly » ) .
The most stylish womеn managed to wear stuffed birds , statues and even a mini-gardens with tiny artificial tree on their heads .
The well known and beloved A - la Belle Poule hair model with the famous frigate also belongs to this time .
Such a design could take the whole day and coiffure itself could be weared for several days and sometimes even a week .
Not speaking about the fact that it was impossible to sleep , such hairdresses were homes for lots of insects and it was allowed to scratch the head with a special stick .
Over time in the beginning of the 80 - ies the bulky and fussy hair models become much more modest .
The fashion for the « sails » and « vases » disappears .
Only tape and muslin fabric are now being used by fashion - mongers , though the hair models still look pompous .
French revolution has changed it all .
New hair cuts were on scene now .
Hope you ’ll like this small historical post .
Cheers and thanks
God we live in the XXI century 🙂
Single - payer health care system touted
150 rally in support of concept at regional forum at UVM
By Nancy Remsen
Burlington Free Press
March 18 , 2009
Dr. John Walsh , a neuroscience researcher from Worcester , Mass. , stood Tuesday with 150 other sign - carrying supporters of government - financed health care outside the building where 400 invited guests would attend a regional health care reform forum sponsored by the Obama White House .
Walsh passed out yellow fliers that denounced President Barack Obama for failing to live up to promises to consider a Canadian - style health insurance system .
“ Single payer is the choice in the polls , ” Walsh declared .
Sandy Eaton of Quincy , Mass. , and a member of the Massachusetts Nurses Association , came to the only forum scheduled for the Northeast to add his voice to those demanding that national policymakers weigh the merits of a government - financed system when they discuss reform options .
“ Let ’s make sure there is a fair and legitimate comparison , ” Eaton said .
Rebecca Elgie , a retired teacher , traveled six hours from Ithaca , N.Y. , because she has made advocacy for a single - payer system her cause .
Three years ago she walked 400 miles across her state to raise awareness about the need for a better way to pay for health care .
Elgie said , “ The employee - based system has outlived its usefulness . ”
The rally greeted the invited guests as they strolled toward the Davis Center at the University of Vermont under a bright blue sky .
“ They need to know there is enough support for people to drop everything and come here to support single payer , ” said Dr. Deb Richter , a Montpelier family physician and prime force in the single - payer movement in Vermont .
“ Barack Obama is with us , ” Richter told the rally participants .
“ President Obama is in a leaky boat out there in an ocean surrounded by sharks .
We ca n’t expect President Obama to stick his toe in the water .
He needs our help .
That is why we are here today . ”
Many at the rally were sure single - payer advocates would be ignored during the forum , even though some , including Richter , had tickets .
But Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts , who co-hosted the forum with Gov. Jim Douglas of Vermont , did n’t duck the topic .
He put a spotlight on it .
“ Is there one way ? ” Patrick asked the audience .
“ Should we have a couple of different ways or should we have a national template ?
Let ’s talk a little about single payer . ”
Richard Slusky , chief executive at Mount Ascutney Hospital in Windsor , described himself as a single - payer advocate , but added , “ It does n’t have to be an absolute , government - run system .
We can have a system that involves the private sector . ”
Susan Baker of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group said , “ People want choice . ”
She said a publicly financed health insurance option should be available to anyone , not just those with low income .
Patrick called on Richter , who sat in a front row in her white coat .
Noting the administrative burden that physicians face dealing with dozens of health insurance payers , Richter asked , “ Why would we even need private insurance ? ”
Jim Hughes , a retired physician from West Fairlee , observed the sky did n’t fall when Patrick , a politician , dared to say the words “ single payer . ”
“ We ought to talk about it , ” Patrick said .
Nancy - Ann DeParle , director of the White House Office of Health Reform , offered a cautionary note about a single - payer system .
She asked how many in the audience had health insurance , and then asked , “ How many people would want to change what they have ?
That is one thing we have to keep in mind . ”
Later at a news conference , Douglas replied to a question about the prospects of the single - payer concept with a warning about the politics of the issue .
“ There are lots of different ideas .
We can move in a significant way without moving so dramatically that it is difficult to gain consensus . ”
Other speakers posed questions for policymakers to consider as they fashion a new health system .
“ What will you do for the next generation ? ” asked Bronwyn Fleming - Jones , a University of Vermont senior worried about how she will pay for health insurance after she graduates in two months .
Will reform consider the importance of home health care ?
asked Gary Sheehan , president of Cape Medical Supply .
Ira Byock , director of palliative care at Dartmouth - Hitchcock Medical Center , urged policymakers to “ focus on people , not patients and think beyond the silo of the health care budget . ”
DeParle and the two governors will report to Obama about the forum .
Three more forums are scheduled in other areas of the country .
DeParle said she was learning information about programs that work , ideas that should be tried and political strategy to win support for change .
“ You have two governors here who figured out how to get that support , ” DeParle said .
“ It took a very broad coalition to come together to design health care reform in Massachusetts and they have stayed together , ” Patrick said .
He added , it also took a realization “ that there were other choices than the two choices on the table — the perfect solution and no solution at all . ”

The US risks being hit by Zimbabwe - style hyperinflation and there are signs that the world 's biggest economy risks turning into a banana republic , Marc Faber , author of the Gloom , Doom & Boom report , told CNBC's " Asia Squawk Box . "
" In the US , we have a totally new school , and it ’s called the Zimbabwe school , " Faber said .
" And it ’s founded by one of the great leaders of this world , Mr Robert Mugabe , that has managed to totally impoverish his own country .
And that is the monetary policy the US is pursuing . "
The government 's increased intervention in the economy is likely to slow down economic growth because history shows that every time the private sector shrinks to make way for the government sector , the economy suffers , he said .
Asked whether the US risked being faced with 200 percent inflation , Faber answered : " Well , not yet .
Not yet .
But I think eventually .
If I look at government debt in the US , and debt in general , I think the only way they will not default physically on their debt is to inflate . "
Credulous wine - sellers in the UK are encouraging their customers to avoid drinking wine on certain days of the month on the grounds that the lunar cycle will alter the taste of the wine .
Horoscopes for wine — now that 's a whole new kind of dumb .
The idea that the taste of wine changes with the lunar calendar is gaining credibility among the UK 's major retailers , who believe the day , and even hour , on which wine is drunk alters its taste .
Tesco and its rival Marks & Spencer , which sell about a third of all wine drunk in Britain , now invite critics to taste their ranges only at times when the biodynamic calendar suggests they will show at their best .
Marks & Spencer has gone a step further and is advising customers to avoid disappointment from the best bottles by making sure not to open them on " root " days …
In other quarters , doubts remain .
Waitrose 's wine department has investigated the idea and cannot see a correlation .
Many scientists have little time for biodynamic wine , pointing out that the movement 's guru , Rudolf Steiner , claimed to have conceived the concept after consulting telepathically with spirits beyond the realm of the material world .
Among his other works are claims that the human race is as old as the Earth and descended from creatures with jelly - like bodies , and a belief that men's passions seep into the Earth 's interior , where they trigger earthquakes and volcanoes .

Akinwale Arobieke was convicted of 16 counts of harassment in 2003
A man has been jailed for 18 months for breaking a ban on approaching young men and touching their muscles .
Akinwale Arobieke , 47 , formerly of Toxteth , Liverpool , and known as " Purple Aki " , was given a Sexual Offences Prevention Order last year .
But two months later he approached a 17 - year - old boy and tried to touch his biceps , Liverpool Crown Court was told .
The order was imposed on Arobieke after he was jailed for six years in 2003 for 16 counts of harassment .
His reputation has spread across north - west England where he is known by the nickname " Purple Aki " and is considered by many to be an urban myth , the jury was told .
Bench presses
His latest victim , now aged 18 , said he was left feeling " frightened and sick " after Arobieke followed him in Birkenhead in June last year .
He asked the boy how many bench presses he could do .
The boy told the court : " He pointed to my arms and asked if he could see .
" He then lifted his hand towards my biceps and I realised who it was .
I backed away and told him I had to go .
" I felt sick and walked away as fast as I could .
I went to a friend 's house and looked back but he had gone . "
Bodybuilder Arobieke had pleaded not guilty .
It was his second breach of the order and his 72nd offence since 1980 , the judge was told .
Dan Akyroyd has been out talking about casting for the long - gesting thirdmovie and apparently , if he has any say in it , he ’d base the cast on the recentvideo game .
Or at least that seems to be what he ’s saying in a new interview with the LA Times
That ’s not necessarily a bad thing .
The game featured the voice talents of super - hotties Alyssa Milano and Eliza Dushku and let ’s face it , if you 're going to hire Milano and Dushku you really ought to use them in a way that let 's your audience see them .
Their physical appearance is generally regarded as extremely pleasant .
Of them Akyroyd says , “ I think they 're amazing , and I 'm excited about the whole idea of getting this done . ”
Does he mean “ getting this done ” as in getting them in the movie or just getting this done as in simply making the movie at all ?
The Times ' somewhat vague piece does n’t say .
Milano was quick to address the rumors on her Twitter feed where she says " ... this is the first I 'm hearing of . "
Dushku followed with another denial on her Twitter saying , " ... it's nuthin ' I know of . "
So Akroyd really was saying he wants them , it must be more of a wishlist than something they 're already pursuing .
Dan did confirm that Sigourney Weaver is now on board for , which is great news for fans .
And of course the rest of the original squad : Akyrod , Bill Murray , Harold Ramis , and Ernie Hudson are all in or it would n’t be happening .
In the past it was Murray ’s reluctance to do it that kept the project from happening .
Not returning is director Ivan Reitman .
Akyroyd confirms “ he ’s too busy ” .
So the whole thing ’s moving forward and maybe they ’re looking for a couple of high - profile , youngish , new female Ghostbusters .
I like it , especially if it ’s Milano .
Dushku hasto keep her busy and besides , Milano ’s better when it comes to over the top comedy .
It does n't hurt that she has more tattoos which , weirdly seems like something a female Ghostbuster needs .
Slime her !
The Wall Street Journal Economics
Blog today featured an update of a chart prepared by Alexis de Tocqueville , author of Democracy in America , comparing the compensation of French and American civil servants , with an update ( click to enlarge ) :
The problem is that this comparison is misleading .
The intent is to illustrate pay disparities over time .
However , while the President and the King were indeed the highest paid “ civil servants ” , the President than as now was almost certainly not the highest paid individual , while the King most certainly was .
And that ’s before we get into the royal perks : the castles , staff , stables , artwork , the list goes on ) .
Plus the idea of a king as civil servant is a bit strained too .
However , this was the Bourbon Restoration , so kings were a bit more mindful of the citizens than in pre-Revolutionary times .
But the King was almost certainly the richest and best paid individual in France .
He made 8,000 times the most menial civil worker .
Our disparity ( minimum wage versus Lloyd Blankfein ) at a mere 5,000 + is n’t quite as bad , right ?
But Blankfein was far from the best paid American .
Forbes told us that the 400 highest earning taxpayers reported $ 105 billion in adjusted gross income .
That averages $ 262.5 million .
$ 262 million versus the minimum wage level of $ 13,100 gives a ratio of over 20,000 to one .
Now some will protest that the $ 105 billion probably includes one time windfalls , like the sale of major businesses .
Does n’t wash .
We are looking for the disparity top to bottom .
I have n’t seen any estimates for 2008 yet , and hedge funds had a rougher year , but the Institutional Investor ranking of top hedge fund managers for 2007 showed John Paulson at $ 3.7 billion , George Soros at $ 2.9 billion , and James Simons at $ 2.8 billion .
So the popular perception is right .
The super wealthy today are better off than royalty of old .
And it ’s not due to indoor plumbing , either .
Special Shit products complete any cook 's kitchen , and they make great gifts too .

Ex -GOP operative Jason Wetherington admitted having sex with Crist
Take Gov. Charlie Crist 's announcement last week that he was seeking the Senate seat being vacated by fellow Republican Mel Martinez .
Within hours , the Republican establishment in Washington -- desperate to save its dwindling number of Senate seats -- threw its support behind him .
That puts Crist in position to reap tons of campaign cash , tap into the party 's other resources and improve his chances for victory .
The only problem is that former GOP Speaker of the Florida House Marco Rubio is also running .
While Rubio has given no indication of pulling out , it 's doubtful other Republicans will jump in .
The more candidates in a race -- and the more level the playing field -- the better .
A large field ignites the strong debates necessary for a healthy democracy to thrive , especially with the serious problems the country is facing .
Strong - arm tactics to freeze out candidates are a disservice to voters and the cause of good government , and increase public cynicism .
Ironically , the national GOP 's decision to back Crist could cause blow - back .
Many Republicans dislike Crist 's moderate policies and may flock to Rubio , who is billing himself as the true conservative .
That could make for the tough primary that Republican leaders in Washington want to avoid , but give GOP voters what they should have :
A wide - open contest with the best candidate winning .
At a time when the Florida electorate is growing increasingly diverse , the Republican party is gearing up to field an all - male , all - white slate in 2010 .
... The Republican front - runners for statewide office include Gov. Charlie Crist for Senate , Attorney General Bill McCollum for governor , Senate President Jeff Atwater for chief financial officer and U.S. Rep. Adam Putnam for agriculture commissioner .
Putnam is the only one of the GOP candidates under 50 years old .
Is the fight between the far right plus nutroots extremists and the Establishment Republicans of the NRSC and the Florida Republican Party over the Charlie Crist / Marco Rubio Senate nomination just a ruse to keep the media from talking about Crist 's closet problem ?
With the release of , which exposes Crist 's hypocrisy on gay issues while he himself was seducing young gay men , it was important to the GOP to point the media in another direction -- any other direction .
So Republican extremists and John Cornyn's NRSC are engaged in a noisy , very flashy topless mud wrestling match about who 's further to the right , the Republican Governor who Inside the Beltway Repugs felt is their only shot of holding onto the Florida Senate seat , or the fanatic Bush - clone ex-Speaker of Florida 's lower house who 's stuck with a job .
Before Crist agreed to jump into the Senate race , he demanded that the Florida Republican Party and the NRSC back him and do their best to discourage a primary .
Mainstream conservatives in Florida are delighted with Crist and smell victory but the extremists are apoplectic because , as governor , he 's veered away from the kind of obstructionism irresponsible members of Congress and Hate Talk radio hosts can easily get away with .
The nutroots campaign is calling on the far right of the GOP to stop donating to the NRSC until they withdraw their Crist endorsement .
Michael Steele and the NRC have already declared neutrality .
Although polls show that Crist would win a general election and that Rubio would be soundly defeated , inside the crazed little GOP whites only pup tent , Rubio is starting to make ferocious headway -- evenplaying the gay hypocrite card against Crist .
Yesterday an editorial in thesummed up why Crist 's support inside the Republican Party has started evaporating .
There is , for one thing , a genuine dislike for the Inside - the - Beltway Establishment trying to dictate to local Republicans .
Sounds lovely but this is one fairy tale with only one winner : the Democrats .
On the other hand , it is keeping the media 's mind off Crist 's closet and away from Crist 's ex-honey , Jason Wetherington , whose Facebook page lists Michelle Obama , Howard Dean , Alex Sink and Robert Wexler as his favorite political figures .
On the other hand there have always been and will always be people who deny men- we - know have sex with each other -- or who manage to find ways to punish them when it just can not be denied .
It 's always awful when these " people , " the deniers and punishers , are , like Crist , gay themselves -- and looking to protect their own asses by screwing someone else 's .
That 's ugly .
And that 's why Charlie Crist is a Republican and why he does n't deserve to be a public servant .
Ironically , the Republican Party can't even get any credit in the diversity arena from Crist 's LGBT status , just denunciations of his hypocrisy .
The GOP got beaten up in today ' sfor being out of touch with Florida 's demographic changes .
It 's hilarious that the , well aware that Crist is a closeted homosexual , refuses to mention it in a story about diversity -- any more than they 'd mention that Adam Putnam is red - headed or a millionaire .
And yet Florida is one of the " gayest " states in America .
Not counting closet cases , like Crist , Florida has the second biggest gay population in the country , 609,219 ( 4.6 % ) , less gay than California ( 5.2 % ) but gayer than New York ( 4.2 % ) .
Miami -Dade has the biggest percentage of gay people of any consolidated metropolitan area in the country ( 4.7 % ) , even bigger than the San Francisco Bay area , and both Tampa and Orlando are among the two - dozen gayest metro areas in the U.S. Asked about the potential lack of diversity in the Republican slate , Crist said , '' I think people ought to elect whoever they want . ''
Of the Republican party in Florida , he said , " Well , I love it .
It looks like it 's doing incredibly well to me .
'' Meanwhile Republicans are desperate to drive Marco Rubio out of the Senate race and they think by persuading him to run for Lt. Gov. under McCollum they can kill two birds with one stone -- make the ticket look less lilly white and give the old ( gay ) white guy a clear shot at the Senate seat without a bloody , divisive primary .
One Republican operative , Ana Navarro , whose job is to lure Hispanics into voting for the GOP , thinks Republicans will regain the political momentum in Florida .
'' The next election is not going to be about change , '' said Navarro , who has already written McCollum a check .
" This is going to be about experience and qualifications , given the dire economic straits that Florida is in right now .
It 's going to be about policy , not personality . ''

Polish Reactions to SPIEGEL Cover Story A Wave of Outrage
Polish media and politicians have sharply criticized this week 's SPIEGEL cover story about Hitler 's European helpers outside of Germany .
They believe the article is part of an attempt by Germans to foist guilt for its own Nazi crimes off on others .
Mr. Bruff is Charles Inglis Thomson Professor of Law , University of Colorado at Boulder .
He is the author of : Bad Advice : Bush ’s Lawyers in the War on Terror ( University Press of Kansas , 2009 ) .
Lawyers for the Bush administration gave their clients very bad advice on a wide range of topics , including domestic surveillance , the detention and trial of terror suspects , and most notoriously , the interrogation of those suspects .
Memos that have just been disclosed reveal the lawyers struggling mightily — and unpersuasively -- to conclude that extremely harsh interrogation methods such as waterboarding do not constitute torture under the law .
The furor that has arisen raises two questions .
First , what limits a lawyer ’s willingness to give advice that pleases a client ?
Second , if the lawyer ignores that limit , what punishment should result ?
At the moment of taking office , each President takes an oath “ to preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution . ”
Each of the President ’s lawyers takes a similar oath .
The lawyers have a second obligation .
In representing any client , a lawyer is subject to an ethical rule that requires him or her to “ exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice . ”
Franklin Roosevelt ’s Attorney General Robert Jackson captured the core idea : “ the value of legal counsel is in the detachment of the advisor from the advised . ”
Detachment is crucial to the quality of the advice .
We expect that distance from professionals of all kinds , our doctors for example .
Independent judgment can be sympathetic .
The incentives and culture within the Executive Branch surely guarantee that it will be .
The hard part for the President ’s lawyers is to preserve their necessary independence .
Moreover , political advisors will reliably be advocates , and only the lawyers are likely to insist on the rule of law .
In their fervor to protect the nation after 9/11 , President Bush ’s lawyers lost sight of their core duties and became unrestrained advocates for actions desired by their clients .
The memos that have caused such outrage were designed to shield investigators from legal jeopardy by providing legal opinions justifying harsh actions that had already occurred in at least some cases .
Ironically , by stretching the law to protect their clients , the lawyers increased their own legal jeopardy .
The Obama administration is disinclined to prosecute interrogators who relied on Justice Department legal opinions , and that decision may be correct .
But what about the lawyers , who should have known better ?
Some have called for criminal prosecution of the lawyers .
Perhaps they were accomplices in actions that they knew were illegal .
I am not a criminal lawyer and do not know how such prosecutions would fare .
I do know , however , who should make that decision : the professional prosecutors in the Department of Justice and not anyone in the White House , where politics suffuses every decision .
When the prosecutors decide whether to charge anyone , they should consider the serious risks that criminal liability would deter desirable behavior in the future .
Much legal advice to Presidents occurs under severe time pressure that limits the opportunity to provide thorough legal analysis .
Many of the legal issues concern topics where there are few clear precedents to guide the lawyers .
The lawyers know , however , that no President lacks enemies who will assert that advice was legally and ethically defective .
And they know that they will be judged with all the unfairness of hindsight .
Therefore , it would be easy to make the President ’s lawyers too cautious for the good of the nation when they are asked to give advice under great pressure of time and uncertainty .
In other words , criminal prosecution may be too blunt a tool to use fairly or effectively .
There is another way to punish the transgressions of the lawyers , one more precisely attuned to their particular sins in the Bush administration .
State bar associations have jurisdiction to impose sanctions on lawyers who fail to give candid and independent legal advice .
There is a wide range of available sanctions , from reprimand to suspension to disbarment .
The Justice Department is about to release a report on the ethics violations of the lawyers , which could help to inform the state authorities .
Because of the problem of overdeterrence , the bar authorities should not take action unless serious and repeated ethical lapses are shown .
Since regulation of lawyers by state bars is usually regarded as rather weak , the overdeterrence problem should be minimized .
At the same time , there is a need to buttress the central obligation to provide independent legal advice against the constant pressure to say yes to anything .
If this is the path taken , it will have the advantage of placing the responsibility to correct the lawyers ’ misconduct in the hands of the profession whose standards have been violated .
Greenwashing : “ when a company or organization spends more time and money claiming to be ‘ green ’ through advertising and marketing than actually implementing business practices that minimize environmental impact .
It ’s whitewashing , but with a green brush . ” –EnviroMedia Social Marketing

Big oil realizes it ’s in big trouble .
The world ’s big oil companies are in a tough position : they source and sell one of the most in - demand products in a world where consumers are increasingly sensitive to the environmental and human rights impacts of oil production and consumption .
Yet the Chevrons and Shells of the world are responding to market demand and making enormous profits , so there ’s little incentive to stop oil drilling .
The oil companies and the consumer public share the responsibility for the consequences of oil dependence on human and physical environments , but big oil is directly on the hot seat .
In order to draw attention away from the catastrophes caused by its activities , big oil has been rolling out new advertising and marketing strategies in an effort to change the public ’s perception of oil companies AND to put the onus of environmental responsibility on consumers .
Chevron ’s recent ad campaign , which revolves around the question , “ Will you join us ? ” , features diverse people in television and print ads making firm , declarative commitments to reducing their own oil dependence :
“ I will leave the car at home more . ”
“ I will finally get a programmable thermostat . ”
“ I will replace 3 light bulbs with CFLs . ”
And so on .
But critics charge that Chevron ’s empowering , “ I can do it ” campaign is little more than the company ’s most recent–and boldest–attempt to greenwash its own activities .
In recent weeks , 11 organizations came together to launch the website , True Cost of Chevron .
In addition to producing the “ Alternative Annual Report , ” the activist groups designed their own ad campaign .
Modeled after Chevron ’s “ Will you join us ? ” campaign , the True Cost of Chevron ads also feature individuals from around the world , making aspirational statements of an entirely different sort :
Burma :
Chevron has refused to acknowledge both the widespread human rights abuses caused by its Yadana project and the destructive effects that revenue from the project has had in Burma .
Canada :
In Canada , the toxic burden on communities near the tar sands is already enormous .
In addition to direct human exposure , oil contamination in the local watershed has led to arsenic in moose meat – a dietary staple for First Nations peoples – up to 33 times acceptable levels .
Drinking water has also been contaminated .
Ecuador :
While drilling in the Ecuadorian Amazon from 1964 to 1990 , Texaco – which merged with Chevron in 2001 – deliberately dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic wastewater , spilled roughly 17 million gallons of crude oil , and left hazardous waste in hundreds of open pits dug out of the forest floor .
Nigeria :
Chevron continues to employ and pay the notoriously brutal Nigerian military to provide it with security services .
Iraq :
In 2007 , Chevron paid $ 30 million to settle charges brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it had paid illegal kickbacks to the Hussein regime to win its Iraqi marketing contracts , after it was revealed that Hussein had established a worldwide network of oil companies and countries that secretly helped Iraq generate about $ 11 billion in illegal income from oil sales .
Kazakhstan :
The surrounding populations began to suffer greatly from an unprecedented variety of illnesses upon development of the [ oil ] fields , including respiratory illnesses , blood illnesses , cardiovascular illnesses , and high levels of stillborn babies , all of which medical specialists have determined to be directly related to the oil industry .
Amazon Watch , one of the organizations in the coalition behind True Cost of Chevron , tried to sell the ads to CBS , which rejected the offer .
Within 24 hours , visitors to the True Cost of Chevron site had downloaded the ads and pasted them around San Francisco .

When Circuit City went kaput in January , I did n't waste my time on the chain 's so - called going - out - of - business sale .
First of all , Circuit City never had anything good in stock , even before it decided to go out of business .
A year ago , I looked at the retailer 's entire selection of laptops , and all I found were these huge , ugly , shiny things festooned with garish stickers announcing that they had " Intel Inside " and were " Vista Adequate " and " Y2 K Ready . "
Also , I had read on the Consumer Reports website that Circuit City 's liquidator had actually raised the price on many items for the going - out - of - business " sale . "
Truth be told , I do n't think I ever bought anything from Circuit City anyway .
On weekends , I would occasionally wander into the local branch , attracted like a moth to the bright wall of plasma TVs .
When I actually needed a new TV , however , I found the Circuit City salesperson to be so aggressively unknowledgeable and remarkably useless that I fled to Best Buy , where I was helped by a cheerful , 20 - year - old twerp who knew everything .
I later learned that in 2007 , Circuit City had fired the chain 's 3,400 most experienced salespeople and replaced them with generic , untrained , near - minimum - wage workers .
So it was no surprise to me that Circuit City failed .
The chain 's CEO , in an e-mail , blamed the demise on " poor macroeconomic conditions " -- an assertion that was repeated by The Associated Press , which cited " the expanding financial crisis " for the liquidation .
You know what ?
I do n't buy the argument that the economy caused Circuit City 's failure .
Take one look at its competitors , and you know that the market for consumer electronics and computer equipment remains strong , even in this economy .
You can walk into any Apple Store and see large crowds of people lining up to buy computers and iPods .
But enough has been said about how wonderful Apple is .
I want to tell you about another first - class consumer electronics retailer -- a much smaller business you probably have n't been to , unless you live in New York City or are a professional photographer or an avid hobbyist .
It 's called B&H .
B&H opened in 1973 , and it's an amazing place .
If you are in Manhattan , you should visit the store , on Ninth Avenue at 34th Street .
The first thing you will notice ?
The place is humming .
Originally a camera store , B&H has grown to carry more than 250,000 items , including all kinds of pro audio , pro video , and computer gear .
The company is closely held and somewhat press shy , so it 's hard to know how successful it is .
" Our business remains strong , particularly considering the overall economic climate , " a spokesperson says .
I suspect that 's an understatement .
The store is always packed with customers , browsing through hundreds of varieties of camera bags with every possible combination of lens compartments ; the room full of telescopes ; and , of course , enough lenses to burn all the ants in the Sahara to a crisp .
The electronic superstores in Tokyo's Akihabara district are the only other places where I have seen so much gear under one roof .
And what a roof it is :
The whole operation is a crazy Willy Wonka factory .
If you want to check out a product that 's not on display , a salesperson orders it by computer terminal from a vast stockroom in the basement .
Moments later , as if by magic , the product arrives at the retail counter , via an elaborate system of conveyor belts and dumbwaiters .
You can try out the gear , see if you like it , and , if you do , the salesperson puts it in a green plastic box and places it on another conveyor belt , which runs , above your head , to the pickup counter .
There , an employee bags your purchase .
Meanwhile , your salesperson gives you a ticket , which you take to a payment counter .
After you have paid , you get a different ticket that you take to the pickup counter to get your merchandise .
At first , this all seemed like incredible overkill to me .
But then , as I thought about it more , I developed a theory as to why B&H operates this way .
With all the expensive electronics and cameras and lenses and laptops floating around the store , the system creates a series of checks and balances -- typically , five employees are involved in every purchase -- in order to reduce shoplifting and employee theft .
That it works at all is not the most amazing thing about B&H , however .
The most amazing thing is that the prices are so low that I do n't even bother to comparison - shop anymore .
No , wait :
The most amazing thing is that the salespeople at B &H really know their stuff .
When I recently bought a portable digital recorder , the salesperson knew that some gear was not compatible with flash memory cards larger than 2GB and spent a few minutes surfing the Web to make sure that the 8GB card I wanted would work with it .
No , wait :
The most amazing thing is that I have often gone into B&H to purchase a specific product , only to be talked into something cheaper .
For example , once I went in to buy a field video monitor to use for some interviews I was conducting .
I expected to pay $ 600 until the salesperson said , " Why do n't you just get one of these cheap consumer portable DVD players ?
They have video inputs , they work just as well , and they 're under $ 100 . "
This was no accident .
" The entire premise of our store is based upon your ability to come in , touch , feel , experiment , ask , and discuss your needs without sales pressure , " B & H 's website says .
But wait :
The conveyer belts , the prices , the smart salespeople , the fact that they recommend cheaper products almost as a rule -- none of these is actually the most amazing thing about B&H .
Really , the most amazing thing is that because the owners of B&H are Orthodox Jews -- Hasidim , in fact -- the store closes every Friday afternoon for the Jewish Sabbath , and on Jewish holidays .
Moreover , B&H 's website , which reportedly accounts for 70 percent of sales , shuts down , too .
Bhphotovideo.com is , to my knowledge , the only major online retailer that closes for 25 hours every weekend .
Even as competitors like Circuit City go bust , B&H remains packed with loyal customers .
And that makes me very happy .
For a business owner , there 's nothing more satisfying than watching honest dealers expand their operations while the schmucks , with their going - out - of - business markups , go down the drain .
It 's inspiring to know that starting with the premise of treating your customers well really does pay off .
The Dutch " artist " who in 2004 turned her pussy into a handbag under the performance art title " My dearest cat Pinkeltje ( 2004 ) " has published personal details of those who emailed her expressing their disgust .
Katinka Simonse , aka Tinkebell , copped a veritable shitstorm of e-abuse for the feline fashion accessory stunt ( pictured ) , and she and fellow artist Coralie Vogelaar decided to track down the senders , sniff out their intimate online secrets and present the whole thing for public consumption .
The result of trawling the net in search of their prey is the pair 's Dearest Tinkebell , which includes the contribution of a 19 - year - old American woman who wrote : “ HAVE A GREAT DAY YOU GROSS DEAD CUNT . "
For her trouble , the missive 's author is now named and shamed , complete with photographs , the name of the town where she lives and her Amazon.com wish list .
This includes " a pedal exerciser " and a " Ladies Cotton Rubber Posture and Tummy Control Fat Burner " .
According to Tinkebell 's Facebook presence , the book ( see pic ) is intended to confront " head on " the " apparent anonymous practice of online threatening of public or semi- public individuals " and " evaluate hatemail as both a social and artistic phenomenon " .
Vogelaar said : “ It was shocking to see how much personal information you can simply find on the internet .
Strikingly , these people who send threats are often quite exhibitionistic , and they have published hundreds of photos of themselves on the internet .
They want to show it all , and think that everybody is interested in everything they do . ”
Nieuws Uit Amsterdam notes that the authors are aware " they may be violating privacy or copyright law " and that legal action could follow .
Tinkebell insisted that anyone attempting litigation would be reported to the police for the original abuse .
The first rumbling of discontent at Dearest Tinkebell came from a " 48 - year - old communications consultant and wife of a controversial plastic surgeon from Amsterdam " who told a local TV station she was n't best impressed with having her details published .
She apparently objected to the artist 's catbag with the email : “ Girl , You do n’t often see a freak as disturbed as you are .
You think you can do this to the animals .
I ’m going to personally make sure that you ’ll stop what you ’re doing .
You ’ll regret this . ” ®
Tinkebell 's other illuminating works include a " radio - controlled hamster and musical - box cat " , which she says are " bound to raise a few eyebrows " . ®

Gain fame and fortune : become an iPhone app mogul

The technique hinges on an ordered spreading of the colours in laser light
The fastest imaging system ever devised has been demonstrated by researchers reporting in the journal Nature .
Their camera's " shutter speed " is just a half a billionth of a second , and it can capture over six million images in a second continuously .
Its " flashbulb " is a fast laser pulse dispersed in space and then stretched in time and detected electronically .
The approach will be instrumental in imaging fast - moving or random events , such as communication between neurons .
What is more , the camera works with just one detector , rather than the millions in a typical digital camera .
Gathering steam Dubbed Serial Time - Encoded Amplified imaging , or Steam , the technique depends on carefully manipulating so - called " supercontinuum " laser pulses .
These pulses , less than a millionth of a millionth of a second long , contain an enormously broad range of colours .
Two optical elements spread the pinprick laser pulses into an ordered two - dimensional array of colours .
It is this " 2 - D rainbow " that illuminates a sample .
Part of the rainbow is reflected by the sample - depending on light and dark areas of the illuminated spot - and the reflections travel back along their initial path .
Because the spreading of the pulse 's various colours is so regular and ordered , the range of colours reflected contains detailed spatial information about the sample .
" Bright spots reflect their assigned wavelength but dark ones don't , " explained Bahram Jalali , the University of California , Los Angeles professor who led the research .
Our next step is to improve the spatial resolution so we can take crystal clear pictures of the inner structure of cells
Bahram Jalali , UCLA
" When the 2 - D rainbow reflects from the object , the image is copied onto the colour spectrum of the pulse . "
The pulse then passes back through the dispersive optics and again becomes a pinprick of light , with the image tucked away within as a series of distributed colours .
However , that colour spectrum is mixed up in an exceptionally short pulse of light that would be impossible to unpick in traditional electronics .
The team then routes the pulse into a so - called dispersive fibre - a fibre - optic cable that has a different speed limit for different colours of light .
As a result , the red part of the spectrum races ahead of the blue part as the pulse travels along the fibre .
Eventually , the red part and blue part separate in the fibre , arriving at very different times at the fibre 's end .
All that remains is to detect the light as it pops out of the fibre with a standard photodiode and digitise it , assigning the parts of the pulse that arrive at different times to different points in two - dimensional space .
The result of all this optical trickery : an image that represents a snapshot just 440 trillionths of a second long .
The researchers used a laser that fired more than six million pulses in a second , resulting in as many images .
However , they say that the system can be improved to acquire more than 10 million images per second - more than 200,000 times faster than a standard video camera .
' Rogue cells '
Instead of the millions of detectors in a digital camera , Steam uses just one Another imaging system known as a streak camera can capture images with an even shorter shutter speed , but they can only capture a fixed number of images and must be triggered to do so for a given event .
The Steam camera , by contrast , can capture images continuously , making it ideal for random events that can not be triggered .
Some applications that may benefit from the approach include observing the communication between cells , or the activity of neurons .
But the perfect example of an application for the Steam camera 's specifications is analysing flowing blood samples in an approach known as flow cytometry .
The imaging of individual cells in a fast - flowing volume of blood is impossible for current cameras , a small random sample is taken and those few cells are imaged manually with a microscope .
" But , what if you needed to detect the presence of very rare cells that , although few in number , signify early stages of a disease ? , " asks Keisuke Goda , lead author of the study .
Dr Goda cites circulating tumour cells as a perfect example of such a target .
Precursors to metastasis , they may exist as only a few among a billion healthy cells .
" The chance that one of these cells will happen to be on the small sample of blood viewed under a microscope is virtually negligible . "
But with the Steam camera , fast - flowing cells can be individually imaged .
The team is working to extend the technique to 3 - D imaging with the same time resolution , and to increase the effective number of " pixels " in a given image to 100,000 .
" Our next step is to improve the spatial resolution so we can take crystal clear pictures of the inner structure of cells , " Professor Jalali told BBC News .
" We are not there yet , but if we are able to accomplish this , then there is no shortage of applications in biology . "

While GameStop , Amazon , and smaller independent stores are duking it out for your game trade - ins , we reported Monday on a kiosk spotted at a Walmart location that automated the act of trading in games .
The gamer who tried to use the kiosk had quite the unhappy experience , and the gaming blogs ran with the story that Walmart may be getting into the used game business .
We caught up with the company behind the kiosk , e-Play , to get all the questions answered .
The first clarification : Walmart is only providing the floor space for the pilot program ; the retail giant is n't getting into buying or selling games directly .
" Walmart is providing vestibule space to e-Play at 77 of its Northeast region stores .
Some stores have Video Game Buy Back only kiosks and some kiosks are full - functioning , but e-Play manages all aspects of kiosk operations for both types , " Alan Rudy , the CEO of e-Play , told Ars .
" While we have over 200 other retail locations , this is currently a pilot program with Walmart , but we are optimistic of its success and future expansion . "
The system also offers a good amount of security .
You scan the game 's barcode , and the machine tells you its trade - in value .
If you decide to sell the game , you have to put the disc into the hardware directly .
" Once a disc is inserted into the kiosk , the disc is spun up , identified and evaluated for damage , " Rudy explained .
" The kiosk is also able to tell if the disc is burned , is a CD or is an old AOL advertising disc and would reject it .
If the disc is unidentifiable or does not match what the user stated , there will be a screen that advises the user that the disc did not match and the disc will be returned .
" If a disc is too badly damaged , we will withhold credit and contact the customer to inform him / her .
In most cases , even heavily scratched discs can be recovered with our refurbishing process at our distribution center .
The discs are inserted into the kiosk , and the empty jewel cases are inserted into the trade bin beside the kiosk . "
The machine then asks for your credit card and driver 's license for record - keeping , and the trade - in is credited to your card in a day or two .
That 's right , you get what amounts to cash , although the possibility of retailer gift cards will also be explored .
These kiosks wo n't just give you credit for games , you 'll also be able to purchase or rent games .
One of the advantages of the kiosk system that Rudy points is the lessening of shrink : there is no product directly on the floor for customers to steal , and no employee needs to be trained to operate the machine .
How is e-Play hoping to combat Amazon ?
" The e-Play trade method does not involve printing shipping labels or waiting on snail mail to deliver your games or to return your Amazon gift card , " Rudy said .
" Soon , e- Play will also post their buy - back pricing online so customers can preview this information before going to a kiosk . "
Rudy wo n't review the " proprietary algorithm " the company uses to determine trade - in value , but by placing the values online and allowing customers to scan the games and see the value before making the decision , they are offering one more data point showing how much used games are worth on the open market .
Also , unlike GameStop , the value does not decrease if you decide you want cash instead of store credit for your games .
So what happened with the gamer in the original report ?
Rudy tells us that if a retailer like GameStop puts their own bar codes on the game cases , the machine wo n't recognize them .
By sliding the sleeve up or down you 're able to reveal the original barcode , allowing the machine to recognize the game .

From the earliest days of Distributism , distributists have exhibited a certain disinterest in economics .
This is a rather odd stance for the adherents of an economic theory .
Distributism was defended generally on moral and social grounds , and only occasionally on economic grounds .
Both Chesterton and Belloc were aware of this problem , but neither was willing to tackle the job in any formal way .
Belloc did produce a brief volume , Economics for Helen , but even the title indicates his disdain for the subject ; “ Helen ” was taken to be an inquisitive high - school student , and all that she needed to know could be expressed in a brief treatment .
And while Belloc ’s volume was correct as far as it went , it did not go far enough to establish Distributism as an economic theory , and did less to establish a program for advancing the proprietary state .
Hence , Distributism remained “ a creed without a dogma , evoking sympathy but lacking support . ”
The distributists never really established a school of economics nor proposed a program of economic research , despite the work or some fine economists such as John Ryan , E. F. Schumacher , Heinrich Pesch , and others .
This was particularly unfortunate because the distributists ’ main antagonists , the Fabian Socialists , insisted on first - class economic research .
Among those who recognized the need for the reform of the Capitalist system , the Fabians had a great advantage because they could put their case convincingly in economic terms .
Distributists were able to produce first - class critiques of both Capitalism and Socialism , but they tended to be somewhat vague about their own economics .
The Fabians had no such problems , and without a “ working ” alternative , ” the tended to carry the day against the distributists .
They won a battle we refused to fight .
Further , there is a certain amount of resignation among distributists , the feeling that they are facing a system that “ works , ” and that our major task is to add a moral dimension to an already fully functioning system .
For example , Daniel M. Bell writes ,
“ The empirical question put to capitalism can not be ‘ does it work ? ’
The obvious answer is “ yes . ”
At first glance , Prof .
Bell ’s statement would appear to be true : we do see a working system around us , however imperfectly .
However , the working system we see is not capitalism , but Keynesianism .
The best one can say from the empirical evidence is that Keynesian Capitalism works .
But to say this is to already destroy the argument of the capitalists , or at least of the pure capitalists .
If capitalism is a system that requires massive government intervention to balance supply and demand , then it ’s purely economic claims must be called into question .
Yet the fact that capitalism fails and Keynesianism works is itself somewhat perplexing .
We would expect the reverse to be true .
And here we come to the real tragedy of the Distributist failure to confront the economic questions in economic terms , because Distributist analysis provides us with the economic and intellectual tools to understand the manifest failure of the one and the apparent success of the other .
Further , Distributism provides the tools to understand the current crises in Keynesian economies and to point the way forward .
Nor do Distributists need to confine their remarks to the merely speculative realm ; on the contrary , we can demonstrate our beliefs with systems that are on the ground and working successfully , and have been doing so for at least 50 years .
And finally , we can note that nearly all of modern economics , whether neoclassical , Keynesian , Socialist or Austrian , is built on a mistake about science ; in the attempt to make their discipline “ scientific ” in the mold of physics , they abandoned the only thing that can make a humane science “ scientific , ” namely the principle of justice and particularly distributive justice .
Thus , distributism can provide what the world now lacks : both a theoretical framework and practical examples .
Capitalism can provide neither and Keynesianism is in crises .
My thesis in this article is that if one wishes to be an economic scientist , one will have to be a Distributist , or something very like it .
Does Capitalism Work ?
The people who argue that “ capitalism works ” are the same people who argue that we should have less government interference in the market .
Now , I am all for less government ; however , the plain fact of the matter is that capitalism cannot function without this interference ; capitalism relies on an expanded state to balance aggregate supply and demand .
Consider this fact : in the period from 1853 to 1953 , the economy was in recession or depression fully 40 % of the time .
Since 1953 , that is , since the economy became fully Keynesian , the economy has been in recession only 15 % of the time .
Moreover , the pre-war recessions were , on average , twice as deep and twice as long as the post - war ones .
There has been an on - going attempt for the last 30 years to return the economy to its pre-Keynesian status .
Since the rise of Margaret Thatcher in 1979 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 , the political rhetoric has been about “ free markets , ” “ lower taxes , ” “ less government interference , ” etc. Both Reagan and Thatcher took Fredrick von Hayek as their economic mentor .
But the more “ Hayekian ” the economic rhetoric became , the more Keynesian the economy has actually become ; the unintended consequence of Hayek ’s policies have been the opposite of what Hayek wanted : larger governments , greater debts , more centralized economic power , and so forth .
Keynes ’s policies are certainly , as Hayek claimed , a “ road to serfdom , ” but Hayek ’s policies have turned out to be a super - highway to that same dismal destination .
Nor is this true just for the United States and Britain .
Since the Reagan administration , the World Bank has forced Hayek ’s economic policies on all the developing economies , and the results have been uniformly dismal .
Indeed , the theories of Hayek have been tested just as much as have the theories of Karl Marx , and with about the same results : more government power , less economic freedom ; under neither did the state whither away , but became an all - encompassing behemoth .
Under the free market rhetoric of “ conservative ” regimes , the government has not shrunk , but expanded , so much so that we now have a government of nearly imperial power and privilege , headed by an imperial presidency that ignores not only the laws of congress and the Constitution , but even basic human “ laws ” such as the law against torture as an instrument of state policy .
Government expenditures as a share of GDP are about the same as they were before the conservative ascendancy , but the cost of government has far exceeded its tax base .
The result has been an increased dependence on borrowing .
At the start of the Reagan administration , the federal debt was about $ 700 Billion ; at the close of the Reagan - Bush era , it had tripled to $ 2.1 Trillion .
It doubled again and then doubled again , and then grew some more and now stands at about $ 11 Trillion and rising rapidly .
This increased debt represents an effective tax increase , since borrowing is taxing too , but a tax shifted on to the next generations .
This leads us to an unavoidable conclusion : capitalism and the free market are incompatible .
History shows , beyond any reasonable doubt , that the growth of capitalism and the growth in government go hand - in - hand .
Big capitalism and big government are not , as in the popular imagination and the economic treatises , things opposed ; rather , the one grows on the back of the other , and the more you get of one , the more you will need of the other .
Distributists will not be surprised at this result , since it exactly matches the predictions that Belloc made in The Servile State .
The capitalist state , Belloc believed , would grow increasingly unstable , and could only stabilize itself by enlisting the power of government .
Belloc wrote before the rise of Keynes , but Keynes ’ methods were no surprise to readers of Belloc .
Keynes indeed found a “ solution , ” but Belloc had already predicted the solution , and the solution is servility .
In Keynesian states , people cease to be citizens and become mere clients of the state , where even their most ordinary needs are the subject of one or more governmental bureaucracies , and where even ordinary local problems are pushed up to be the responsibility of the most distant levels of government .
But as successful as Keynesianism has been at rescuing capitalism from itself , one wonders if this cycle can continue .
Each new business cycle seems to require greater intervention than the last , and this latest crises requires gargantuan efforts .
Can this exercise in gigantism continue forever ?
Most likely not , at least not in a finite world ; sooner or later we come to a point where the system can no longer sustain itself .
We may now be at that point .
Certainly a $ 11 trillion debt at the Federal level alone is daunting enough by itself , and that debt shows no sign of abating .
But even more problematic is the increasingly servile nature of the population , a population easily manipulated by commercial advertising and political “ spin . ”
The servility which Belloc predicted , which Keynes institutionalized , and which Hayek feared on the theoretical level but did so much to advance on the practical level , is now upon us .
Thus our problem transcends the merely economic ; we must deal with a cultural problem as well .
We have saddled our children with crushing debts , just as we have deprived them of the independent spirit which leads a man to pay his debts .
But if Capitalism , Keynes , and Hayek have all failed , then we must search for the roots of their failure .
If capitalist rhetoric no longer describes economic reality ( and has n’t described it for the last 60 years ) , then we must discover a rhetoric more aligned with reality .
In order to do this , we will have to re-examine economic theory from the ground up to discover the flaws and find the cure .
And the cure , I am convinced , is to re-establish economic science on its traditional base , a base that disappeared in the late 19th century .
And the base of economics , as with any humane science ( science that examines relationships between human beings ) is justice .

A burst of light from the star is spreading into space and reflecting off surrounding shells of dust to reveal a multicoloured ' bull 's eye ' .
This sequence of pictures from May to December 2002 shows apparent changes in the circumstellar dust as different parts are illuminated sequentially in an effect called a ' light echo ' .
From the first to last image the diameter of the nebula appears to balloon from 4 to 7 light - years .
This creates the illusion that the dust is expanding into space faster than the speed of light .
In reality it is simply the light from the stellar flash that is sweeping out into the nebula

The Atlas Coelestis ( 1742 ) of Johann Gabriel Doppelmayr
Introduction
Johann Gabriel Doppelmayr ( also spelled Doppelmair , Doppelmaier or Doppelmayer ) was the son of the Nuremberg merchant Johann Siegmund Doppelmayr ( 1641 -1686 ) and was born on 27 September 1677 ( many early sources incorrectly give his year of birth as 1671 ) .
His father had an interest in applied physics and was one of the first to design a vertical vacuum air pump in Nuremberg .
Doppelmayr enrolled at the �gidiengymnasium in 1689 and after completing his studies in 1696 enrolled at the nearby university of Altdorf to study law which he completed in 1698 with a dissertation on the Sun .
He then attended lectures on mathematics and natural philosophy by Johann Christoph Sturm ( 1635 - 1703 ) which he completed in 1699 with his dissertation
De visionis sensu nobilissimo , ex camerae obscurae tenebris illustrato .
He continued his studies on physics and mathematics at the university of Halle where he also learned French and Italian .
In September 1700 , Doppelmayr travelled to Berlin and from there , through Lower Saxony , to Holland where he visited Franeker and Amsterdam on his way to Utrecht where he stayed for a couple of months to continue his studies on physics and mathematics and to master the English language .
In April 1701 , Doppelmayr went to Leiden where he stayed in the house of the astronomy professor Lothar Zumbach von Koesfeld and learned ( probably in the Musschenbroek workshop ) how to grind and figure telescope lenses .
He then travelled to Rotterdam and in May to England where he visited Oxford and London .
After returning to Holland in the end of 1701 , Doppelmayr spent another five months in Leiden , where he followed astronomy lessons from Lothar Zumbach von Koesfeld .
After visiting Utrecht , Deventer , Osnabr�ck , Hannover , Kassel , Marburg , Gie�en , Wetzlar and Frankfurt , Doppelmayr returned to Nuremberg in August 1702 and was appointed professor of mathematics at the �gidiengymnasium in 1704 , a position that he would hold until his death .
In February 1716 , Doppelmayr married Susanna Maria Kellner ( 1697 - 1728 ) with whom he had four children ( three of which died shortly after their birth ) .
In 1723 , he received an invitation to become the professor of mechanics at the Academy of St. Petersburg , but Doppelmayr declined and suggested that they should ask the Swiss mathematician Nikolaus Bernouilli for this position .
Doppelmayr wrote on astronomy , geography , cartography , spherical trigonometry , sundials and mathematical instruments .
He often collaborated with the cartographer Johann Baptist Homann ( 1664-1724 ) , a former Dominican monk from Oberkammlach in Schwabia who in 1688 had settled in Nuremberg and became a map engraver for the publishing firms of Jacob von Sandrart and David Funck .
In 1702 , Homann founded an influential cartographic publishing firm that after his death was continued by his son Johann Christoph Homann ( 1703 - 1730 ) and after the latter ’s death by his friend Johann Michael Franz ( 1700 - 1761 ) and his stepsister ’s husband Johann Georg Ebersberger ( 1695 - 1760 ) under the name “ Hom�nnische Erben ” .
The publishing firm remained in business under different names until 1848 .
Among Doppelmayr ’s many students was Georg Friedrich Brander ( 1713 - 1783 ) from Regensburg , who settled in Augsburg in 1734 and in 1737 founded a renowned workshop for scientific instruments .
Doppelmayr was elected as a member of several scientific societies , including the Berlin Academy of Sciences , the Kaiserlich Leopoldinische Akademie der Naturforscher in Halle ( 1715 ) , the Royal Society of London ( on 6 December 1733 , not in 1713 as mentioned in several sources ) and the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences ( 1740 ) .
Doppelmayr died on 1 December 1750 in Nuremberg , and many later sources claim that his death was caused by the fatal effects of a powerful electrical shock which he had received shortly before while experimenting with a battery of electric capacitors .
Other sources , however , suggest that Doppelmayr ’s electrical experiments were performed several years earlier and were not the cause of his death .
The lunar crater Doppelmayer ( latitude 28.5 � south and longitude 41.4 � west ) , the nearby rille Rimae Doppelmayer ( latitude 25.9 � south and longitude 45.1 � west ) and the minor planet 12622 Doppelmayr are named in his honour .
Doppelmayr ’s astronomical publications
Doppelmayr was responsible for the edition and translation of several important works in astronomy , geography and scientific instrument making .

, containing biographical information on 360 mathematicians and instrument makers of Nuremberg chronologically arranged from the 15th century to the early 18th century .
1742 – Atlas Coelestis ( see below ) .
Together with Johann Georg Puschner ( 1680 - 1749 ) , a Nuremberg instrument maker and copper engraver , Doppelmayr published terrestrial and celestial globe pairs in 1728 ( 32 cm diameter ) , 1730 ( 20 cm diameter ) and 1736 ( 10 cm diameter ) .
The celestial globes were drawn for the epoch 1731.0 , the same epoch which he used for the celestial charts in the Atlas Coelestis ( plates 16 - 25 ) .
These globes were re-issued in the 1750 ’s by Puschner ’s son and , again , in the 1790 ’s , when the copper plates passed into the hands of the Nuremberg publisher Wolfgang Paul Jenig ( 1743-1805 ) .
Although the terrestrial globes were updated in these later re-issues , the celestial globes were left unchanged .
The Atlas Coelestis Doppelmayr ’s best - known astronomical work is his Atlas Coelestis in quo Mundus Spectabilis et in eodem Stellarum omnium Phoenomena notabilia , circa ipsarum Lumen , Figuram , Faciem , Motum , Eclipses , Occultationes , Transitus , Magnitudines , Distantias , aliaque secundum Nic. Copernici et ex parte Tychonis de Brahe Hipothesin .
Nostri intuitu , specialiter , respectu vero ad apparentias planetarum indagatu possibiles e planetis primariis , et e luna habito , generaliter e celeberrimorum astronomorum observationibus graphice descripta exhibentur , cum tabulis majoribus XXX , published in 1742 by the heirs of Homann in Nuremberg .
In this atlas , Doppelmayr collected most of the astronomical and cosmographical plates which he had prepared over the years for the Homann publishing firm and which had appeared in several of their atlases .
These earlier atlases allow us to infer approximate dates for the design and preparation of many of Doppelmayr ’s cosmographical plates .
The earliest ones are plates 2 and 11 as they were already included in Homann ’s first atlas , the Neuer Atlas bestehend in auserlesenen und allerneusten Land - Charten ueber die gantze Welt , und zwar erstlich nach Astronomischer Betrachtung der Bewegung des Himmels in dem Systemate Copernico - Hugeniano , dann auch nach der n�turlichen Beschaffenheit und geographischen Eintheilung der mit Wasser umgebenen allgemeinen Erd-Kugeln in ihre besondere Monarchien , Koenigreiche , Staaten und Laender ( Nuremberg , 1707 ) .
Plates 3 and 7 to 10 were first published in Homann ’s Atlas von hundert Charten ( Nuremberg , 1712 ) , whereas plates 1 , 4 and 15 to 25 can be dated between 1716 and 1724 as they were not included in Homann ’s Grossen Atlas ( Nuremberg , 1716 ) , but are mentioned in Hager ’s list of plates sold by Homann at his death in 1724 .
The plates depicting the constellations ( nrs. 16 to 25 ) were probably prepared and engraved in the early 1720 ’s as the Atlas Portatilis Coelestis , oder compendiose Vorstellung des gantzen Welt - geb�udes , in den Anfangs - grunden der wahren Astronomie ( 1723 ) of Johann Leonard Rost refers to a set of celestial hemispheres drawn by Doppelmayr .
The choice and the style of the constellation figures on these plates is based on the Firmamentum Sobiescianum sive Uranographia ( Danzig , 1687 ) of the Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius , who also avoided the use of Bayer ’s Greek letters for identifying the individual stars , and they were clearly executed before the publication of John Flamsteed ’s star catalogue ( London , 1725 ) and star atlas ( London , 1729 ) .
According to Sandler ( 1890 ) , the other plates ( nrs. 6 , 12 to 14 and 26 to 30 ) date from after 1735 .
The cometary plates ( nrs. 26 to 28 ) can be dated to 1740 or slightly later .
Description of the plates of the Atlas Coelestis ( 1742 )
The following table gives a summary description of the cosmographical plates of the Atlas Coelestis .
The entire Doppelmayr atlas and the individual plates can also be viewed in detail on the Gallica web site of the Biblioth�que nationale de France .
Plates included in later editions of the Atlas Coelestis
Later editions of the Doppelmayr atlas by the same publisher bear the slightly altered title Atlas novus coelestis , in quo mundus spectabilis , et in eodem tam errantium quam inerrantium stellarum phoenomena notabilia [...] secundum Nic. Copernici et ex parte Tychonis de Brahe hypothesin , nostri intuitu , specialiter , respectu vero ad apparentias planetarum indagatu possibiles e planetis primariis et e luna habito , generaliter , e celeberrimorum astronomorum observationibus graphice descripta exhibentur .
Although the year of publication is still given as 1742 on the title page , these editions often contain additional plates of later date .
The following additional plates are known :

[ last updated on 3 October 2006 ]
The unlikely combination of a shaky economy and a city filled with 20 - to 40 - somethings jazzed about contributing to the greater good is putting a new face on how money is raised for some of Denver ’s charities .
The Young Professionals movement , which includes many of the sons and daughters of Denver ’s longtime philanthropists , represents a changing of the guard , the first major leadership shift in 25 years .
They want to do good works , but they also want to have fun , so their parties and causes do n’t resemble the types of events their parents throw .
The new guard is also using social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace to get their message out , and forgoing engraved invitations for quick , free alternatives such as Evites .
“ They ’re young and they have no fear , ” saysbranding expert Erin Yoshimura .
“ It ’s amazing how they get an idea and just run with it .
The smart charities , the ones that will really benefit from YP involvement , are the ones that will let them create something that is uniquely their own .
It might not be an event that you or I would do , but the bottom line is that it works . ”
Established charities recognize the contributions the new guard can make , both financially and in bringing new talent to organizations .
“ Everybody ’s courting them because they can make a world of difference , ” says Jim White , manager of community affairs for Volunteers of America .
For example , White says , at the recent Single in the City party that 5280 magazine did as a benefit for VOA , “ We were hoping for 800 people , but advance ticket sales were slow .
The night of , we were totally amazed when 1,700 - plus showed up .
We finally had to close the doors to everyone who arrived without a ticket in hand . ”
In some cases , the YPs are forming guilds that augment the work of established charities such as Girls Inc .
Two years ago Cissie Megyesy , 31 , a software - program manager , started the Girls Inc. Junior Alliance with two girlfriends , Katie Dark and May Wilson .
“ We have the energy , time and drive to inject new life into things that have grown stale , ” Megyesy says .
The Junior Alliance has grown to 125 members , something Megyesy credits to the opportunities Girls Inc. has for hands - on involvement .
“ It ’s tangible , ” she says .
“ All of my friends like to see the difference they ’re making . ”
Members also like the networking and friend - making opportunities the Junior Alliance provides through monthly happy - hour socials at the restaurant nine75 .
“ Most of us work , so meetings at 10 a.m. are not an option , ” Megyesy says .
“ The Junior Alliance meets at 6 p.m. at a place we might be going to after work anyway . ”
Volunteers of America discovered the power of YPs in 2007 when Monica Owens , the daughter of Frances Owens and former Gov. Bill Owens , rallied friends to take part in VOA ’s signature fundraiser , Western Fantasy .
Frances
Owens was chairing the $ 300 - a- ticket extravaganza and , at her daughter ’s urging , got VOA to set aside a small number of half - price tickets for the YP crowd .
The following year , Monica Owens and a group that included Brandis Becky Pelletier , Donna Crafton , Kasia Iwaniczko and Katie Behnke expanded VOA ’s YP reach by organizing a Brandin ’ Party at artist Duke Beardsley ’s LoDo studio several months before Western Fantasy .
“ Everyone had such a good time that we wound up selling enough tickets to fill five tables of 10 . ”
At $ 150 a ticket , the Western Fantasy admission is steep by YP standards .
Most YP functions top out at $ 50 a pop .
No more cheese cubes
Jim Guttau , a 31 - year - old public - relations firm owner involved with several YP groups , says , “ If you want to get us in the door , you ’ve got to speak loud on the venue — it ’s gotta be someplace cool like EXDO , RedLine or a funky warehouse space — keep the ticket price at $ 50 or below , and have an open bar , imaginative food and good music so everyone feels they ’re getting their money ’s worth .
The days of cheese cubes , olives and lame dance bands are over . ”
Easier said than done ?
Not for well - connected YPs .
At an event to kick off YP support for the National Kidney Foundation ’s Great Chefs of the West , Guttau and Anne Donley spent a grand total of $ 50 to give about 200 guests a night with abundant food and drink .
“ The 50 bucks went for really nice linens to put on the tables ; everything else was donated , ” Guttau said .
“ If you want a younger crowd , you ’ve got to have a theme , a cool location and a reasonable price point , ” says Sean McNicholas , who has helped get YP groups up and rolling for the Alzheimer ’s Association , Mount St. Vincent Home , Rocky Mountain Multiple Sclerosis Center , Kempe Children ’s Foundation and Girls Hope Boys Hope .
The Kempe YPs , for example , have had functions at a local Ferrari dealership and poolside at the Watermark condominiums ; the MS center YPs do an annual Drag Queen Bingo party at Lannie ’s Clocktower Cabaret ; and the Alzheimer ’s YP group hosts a New Year ’s Day Polar Bear Plunge and a pancake breakfast in September as part of the association ’s annual Memory Walk .
The YPs communicate using viral networking rather than mail or phones .
“ About the only thing we print are save - the - date cards , ” Guttau says .
“ For everything else , we get the word out via Facebook or Evite .
Printing is too expensive , and nobody reads their mail anyway . ”
Mike Downey , Adrian Smith and Greg Preston Tyiir , partners in Lead Alliance Media / Music Group , estimate that they reach 100,000 potential ticket - buyers via e-mail , text messaging , and Facebook and My - Space pages they use to publicize and promote at area clubs , many of which involve charitable giving .
Their 10 - week star search , “ Almost Famous , ” which began in January at Herman ’s Hideaway , generates money for Dedicated to Diabetes , a charity begun by Kerry Kinnard , daughter of Junior Leaguer and time - management expert Melly Kinnard .
A music showcase in May , Bands for Lands , benefits sustainability and natural - energy causes .
Some YPs , like Anthony Graves , 32 , an international marketing manager for Sun Microsystems , and Annie Guo , president of Asian Avenue magazine , find their own causes , such as overcoming stereotypes , quality - of - life issues , neighborhood improvement and politics .
Guo , 23 , works for Integer and is director of the Miss Asian American Colorado pageant that was started to dispel stereotypes about Asian women .
She also directs Next Generation Voices , a student - run organization that is hosting RISE , a conference Saturday that will incorporate hip - hop music and spoken word to educate non-Asians about a variety of cultural issues .
The son of a veterinarian , Graves is a mentor to young people struggling to find their way .
He also leads Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity ’s holiday food drives , and last summer he got the members to donate interview - appropriate clothing for Denver Rescue Mission graduates ready to find a job .
Marti Awad , a vice president and private wealth adviser for Merrill Lynch , is the co-founder and chair of Denver Health Foundation ’s Level One Society .
In May , she will be among the honorees at the Denver Health Gala .
She also brings fresh ideas to Project PAVE and the Denver Scholarship Foundation and Denver Hispanic Chamber of Commerce boards .
“ I think the whole focus for YPs is to keep the overhead down and the fun quotient up , ” says Veronica Montoya , a Realtor active with Highland United Neighbors Inc. , North High School and the Denver Center for International Studies .
“ We want people to experience things they might not get to , or that they ’ll want to support in a much bigger way once their careers are established and they make lots of money . ”

It runs in the family
Many young philanthropists are following in parents ’ footsteps
Like Kerry Kinnard and Monica Owens , many of the young philanthropists are from families for whom charitable giving is important .
“ Helping others is what my family does .
It ’s how I was brought up , ” says real estate agent Veronica Montoya .
She has had leadership roles in benefits for Highland United Neighbors , on whose board she serves ; Denver Center for International Studies ; North High School ; and Clinica Tepeyac .
Jordan Bullock , who markets the Jet Companies ’ clubs and restaurants , is the Junior League of Denver ’s fundraising vice president and was on the committee for Confetti magazine ’s 2009 I.CON Awards Gala .
Her mother , Jane Bullock , spent many years in leadership roles for the Junior League , and Denver Center Alliance .
Jordan ’s boss , Geoff McFarlane , became involved with the American Transplant Foundation as a tribute to the memory of his father , buffalo rancher and former Colorado Symphony trustee Will McFarlane .
Rhett Jordan ’s company , Faces of Entertainment , produced the April 1 Thinking Blue party at RedLine Gallery that his mom , Realtor Rollie Jordan , is chairing for the Kempe Foundation .
Auna Jornayvaz was both a debutante and Central City Flower Girl in her teens , and returned to Denver after college to establish her own media career .
Her mother , the former Louisa Craft , was a 9 News anchor / reporter .
Jornayvaz is active in a range of organizations , including the Colorado Ballet Young Professionals that also counts Meredith and Ashley Coors , Abby Perlmutter , Jessica Gonzales Leyba as members .
In May , she ’s joining Monica Owens and Lauren Cannon Davis to chair Fashion Your Future , a dinner , fashion show and mentoring event for soon - to - be graduates of the University of Denver Daniels College of Business .

Amazon Unleashes Final Piece of the Puzzle and is Now the World 's Biggest Publisher ( And Everything Else )
Amazon has unveiled a new service called " AmazonEncore " which moves them right over the line from " world 's biggest bookstore " to " world 's biggest publisher . "
The only thing Amazon was missing to belong to this club was a marketing , publicity , and selection arm .
Now they 've got it " Even great books can be overlooked .
And authors with great potential often struggle to connect with the larger audience they deserve to reach .
We 're fortunate at Amazon.com to have customers who know a good book when they read one , so we 've introduced AmazonEncore to help connect authors and their books with more readers .
" AmazonEncore is a new program whereby Amazon will use information such as customer reviews on Amazon.com to identify exceptional , overlooked books and authors with more potential than their sales may indicate .
Amazon will then partner with the authors to re-introduce their books to readers through marketing support and distribution into multiple channels and formats , such as the Amazon.com Books Store , Amazon Kindle Store , Audible.com , and national and independent bookstores via third - party wholesalers .
" Did you get that ?
They will use marketing and distribution support to get books they have " acquired " into national and independent bookstores via third - party wholesalers , at least as long as these " national and independent " bookstores exist .
That 's basically all a publisher does these days , outside of working with Amazon to get books sold online and formatted for the Kindle .
So here 's how the Amazon publishing system works .
First , you will send them your manuscript in the form of a CreateSpace upload that gets your book up and running in their print - on - demand and ebook databases .
Your books will now be immediately available for purchase through Amazon , on the Kindle , and on the iPhone through Stanza , where Amazon will take a big bite of your profits for their efforts .
Your self - published books may suck .
They probably will .
At this point , however , you are entirely on your own as far as promotion , agitation , and exploitation of your own products .
If your book sells and moves up the chain , Amazon will be hands off , because that money will be going to you , or maybe to you and your publisher , and you will be happy .
This is Amazon 's equivalent of a " slush pile . "
They are still profiting from the slush pile , because to read one of their titles in consideration , you have to buy it .
The difference between Amazon 's slush pile and the slush pile of every other publishing house is that while publishing houses make unpaid interns read their unlikely manuscripts , Amazon will be charging people to read them , and taking a cut .
People 's unsolicited reviews will somehow dictate which books get earmarked for the " Encore " program .
If there are enough glowing reviews of a book that is not selling , then Amazon will swoop down , pick the manuscript up , and move it along this new track where they will try and determine how to market it .
They will talk it up and get it in people 's faces .
They will distribute it to third parties , and I bet they will even clean up the rough parts and get their bitches over at Penguin to give it an edit .
The one thing left -- THE ONE THING -- that Amazon does n't have are editors .
Good editors are still the exclusive province of the New York publishing houses .
You know why ?
Because good editors have to be paid .
Every other aspect of Amazon 's business model relies on the strange and disturbing fact that people love to work for Amazon for free .
Although , soon Amazon will be able to pick up editors for cheap if they keep getting fired from their jobs at Random House , HarperCollins , and Hachette .
The first title that Amazon will publish through their Encore model is some damn fantasy novel called " Legacy " written by a 14 - year - old girl named Cayla Kluver .
No lie !
It 's a very smart play : who wants to pick on a 14 - year - old girl ?
From Publisher 's Weekly " Jeff Belle , v-p of books at Amazon , said the new publishing program , while focused on self - published books with promise , could also target out - of - print titles from major houses .
Belle was vague about both the criteria used in the selection of Legacy and the terms of the deal with Kluver .
( Kluver does have an agent , but Belle would not disclose any details about the nature of the deal Amazon struck with her . )
"
In terms of the criteria used to select Kluver 's title , and future AmazonEncore titles , Belle said the company is relying on a combination of sales data and customer feedback .
When asked what feedback was used , in addition to the customer reviews on the site , Belle said " customers have many ways of interacting with us " and would not elaborate .
And , when asked about the validity of the customer reviews , which in the past had come under question with certain customers ( or authors ) submitting multiple reviews , Belle said " certain controls are built into the process for customer reviews . "
( Kluver currently has 15 customer reviews for Legacy , 12 of which are five - star reviews . )
" The whole " reviews " thing is a smokescreen .
They are going to publish whatever they think they can make money on .
Hopefully , it will be from somebody they can push around , like , you know , a first - time , self - published teenager .
Keep giving Amazon money , publishers .
Go ahead .
I 'll tell you what they are going to do next : next , they are going to announce an exclusive deal with the Internet Archive to make Brewster Kahle 's scans available on the Kindle .
And unless somebody gets there first , then they are going to buy up as many Espresso Book Machines as they can and start plunking them down wherever there is a Starbucks and a Gap so that you can print your books directly from your Kindle if you want a paper copy .
You just watch .
So Google will have all of the literature from the past , and Amazon will have all of the literature from the present .
They will give each other a high five where they meet in the middle , and lets hope that Lord Acton 's old saying holds true and that absolute power makes you magically good .
When iPhone 3.0 comes out later this year , we 'll see iPhone apps tied to special - purpose accessories .
Imagine a universal remote that lets you use your iPhone to control every box in your home - entertainment system .
Or a portable RFID - and barcode - scanning module that turns your iPhone into a tiny store clerk — or comparison shopper — letting you find and buy stuff just by waving your phone at it .
These are just two suggestions from Wired.com readers for accessory - powered iPhone 3.0 applications – or , to use the term we coined , dongleware .
We put up a call for suggestions , and you responded with loads of great ideas .
We figured , what better way to give wannabe - millionaire developers ideas — and get what consumers want in return ?
Win -win .
iPhone
3.0 wo n't be launching until summer , but developers can get plenty done in two or three months .
To help speed up the process , here are your top-voted ideas in a nice and tidy list .
Drum roll , please .
Barcode / RFID / Magnetic - Stripe Reader
This idea got the most votes — an accessory that acts as a barcode scanner and maybe triples as a magnetic - card and RFID tag reader .
Here 's how it could be useful :
It would essentially turn the iPhone into a miniature checkout stand .
The barcode scanner would register a product 's price , and then customers can simply swipe their credit card into the magnetic card reader .
Similarly , the radio - frequency identifier would scan products containing RFID tags , such as library books , and send that information to the iPhone .
In theory , the iPhone app transfers the data via the internet to complete the transaction .
Would n't it be interesting ( and a little weird ) to see iPhones or iPod Touches at the checkout counter of every store ?
This could also make a great tool for consumers to do on - the - fly comparison shopping while they browse brick - and - mortar stores .
*(* Thanks , Jason , for submitting this suggestion ! )
Bluetooth Stereo Headphones
This suggestion is n't mindblowing , but it 's clearly a product consumers demand :
Some wireless Bluetooth headphones for the iPhone so we can finally ditch those crappy earbuds .
This should be easy , because
Apple says iPhone 3.0 will support stereo Bluetooth accessories .
( A hat tip to , er , " Anonymous " for submitting this idea . )
__
Keyboard__
Another predictable gadget in demand : Wired.com readers want an iPhone - compatible external keyboard .
This will be extremely useful for business users to speed up writing e-mails or documents .
This might even come in handy for the procrastinating student , who needs to finish up that essay while riding the bus to class .
( Kudos to Keyboard Guy ! )
Bluetooth Universal Remote
This is one of our favorites .
Wired.com readers are really into the idea of clearing out the e-clutter on their coffee tables and relying solely on the iPhone as a universal remote .
Better yet would be a super - sophisticated universal remote that pairs up with a receiver using Bluetooth .
The receiver would contain infrared blasters to send the signals necessary to control your home entertainment equipment .
Wow !
Quite clever .
( Thanks , Allen ! )
__Automobile Diagnostics
__This idea would make life a lot easier for automobile repair workers or car hobbyists .
The accessory would hook your iPhone up to your car engine 's OBD - II port ( which every car sold in the U.S. since 1996 has ) and communicate with an app that performs a full engine diagnosis .
Sounds intense .
Anyone up for the challenge ?
( Nice one , Steve Dy ! )
__
Light Switch Controller
__Hmmm — dongleware to control the lights in your house ?
Z- Wave already has a similar product , but it requires owning electronics embedded with
Z - Wave 's wireless technology .
This suggestion is an iPhone accessory that simply communicates with your lights , but it would require installing receivers on the lighting systems throughout your home .
For the time being , we do n't view this as a very practical product .
*(* Thanks , ROCKERIMANMANAIFJ !)

Passing through a drug checkpoint in Bolivia ’s mountains
Along a major highway in the Yungas forest of the eastern Andes , Bolivian troops stop about 500 vehicles per day looking for cocaine and the chemicals that help process it .
Families , commercial trucks and busses all make their way through this checkpoint , allowing troops to inspect their vehicles .
I ’ve been a fat guy since I was in elementary school .
I had a growth spurt around 10th grade that thinned me out a lot , but then I regained all of that weight in college , and then some .
One day I hit 290 , which became something of a wake - up call for me .
I really did n’t want to break the 300 barrier , but I had been steadily gaining weight for the past few years and I was well on my way to being over 300 pounds .
Combined with my father ’s increasing problems due to his diabetes , I had become worried enough about my future that I decided to do something about my weight in 2007 .
I have tried a number of different things over the course of my life , though I never tried any fad diets like South Beach or Atkins .
I tried limiting my food intake , I tried riding my bike to work to get exercise , but I remained steadily creeping toward 300 pounds and a future as a diabetic .
To make a long story very , very short , exactly one year later I weighed 200 pounds , having lost 90 pounds .
No surgeries , no fad diets .
There were a number of things I did that I consider to have made the difference between an unsuccessful attempt at losing weight and a successful one .
I ’ve decided to share these things on the intarwebs , in hopes that they might motivate or help someone else struggling with their weight .
# 1 See A Nutritionist
Talking to a professional nutritionist made a huge difference .
I was able to tell her exactly what I ate during the day and exactly what kind of exercise I got regularly .
I ran her through a typical day and a typical week , and she figured out exactly what my problem areas were .
As it turned out , my main problem was n’t sugar intake , but carbohydrate intake , and she gave me helpful guidance for how to control my carbs in my diet .
She told me what foods I ate that I needed to stop eating , which foods I needed to cut back on , and which kinds of food I needed to start eating .
She illustrated portion sizes for the foods I eat , and gave me a number of extremely helpful guides .
She did n’t put me on some crazy fad diet , or give me suggestions that I ’d be unable to follow because I ’d be miserable following them .
She catered her advice to me specifically , which made it far more useful advice than what I could pick up on the internet in blog posts such as this one .
In the end , making adjustments to my diet and exercise routines based on her suggestions wound up making a critical difference in my ability to lose weight .
# 2 Seriously , See A Nutritionist
I really ca n’t stress it enough .
The combined impact of every single other item on this list did n’t even come close to the impact made by just talking to a nutritionist .
The visit was covered on my insurance plan and it only took about an hour out of my life .
Absolutely nothing I did over the course of the year helped me as much as talking to a nutritionist .
Do it .
# 3 Set Goals and Rewards
My goal for the year was 90 pounds .
I never , EVER thought I ’d actually pull it off .
90 was my “ boy would it be nice ” goal .
I set intermediate goals of 30 and 60 pounds .
30 I knew I could hit , 60 would take work , 90 was basically impossible .
At each goal , I gave myself a reward .
This reward was something I did n’t allow myself to get without hitting the goal .
At 30 , I got a second monitor for my computer .
At 60 , an XBox .
At 90 , a Macbook .
Each reward was larger than the last .
Focusing on just the thirty pound increments made my goals seem more doable , and whenever I wanted to bail on a workout early I could say “ come on , 10 more pounds to the XBox ” to keep myself going .
Every time I wanted a piece of cake , I knew it moved me further away from my Macbook .
Manageable goals make a big difference in motivation , and I ’d say that this item combined with seeing a nutritionist were the biggest difference makers without question .
# 4 Timebox The Effort and Commit
When I first started , it was very helpful , just from a mentality standpoint , to set a limit for how long I was going to make this effort .
The idea of “ I ’m going to watch what I eat and work out for the rest of my life ” was intimidating to me , to the point where it felt like I did n’t even want to bother .
It was a miserable future in my mind , and it made me want to give up instantly .
In contrast , this time I said to myself “ Okay , I ’m going to watch what I eat and work out and commit to that for exactly one year , to the day .
I ’ll decide what to do after that at the end . ”
Time boxing the effort gave me a reason to try , and every time I wanted to give myself an excuse to get out of the gym or eat a giant pizza by myself , I ’d just say “ No , not now .
You ’re sticking with this for one year . ”
It seems small , but it made a big difference .
Feeling like there was a limit to the work kept me motivated to stick with the plan whenever I was tempted to deviate .
In the end , however , I feel so much better now than I did when I was 90 pounds heavier , and I actually ENJOY the gym as well as how I feel when I eat healthy .
I do n’t have the temptation to eat a big pizza any more because I know how I feel afterwards and how different that is from how I feel normally .
Eating junk food makes me lethargic and tired , but I never knew that until I ate healthy and was able to really observe the difference .
Even though my year is up , I have n’t fallen back into old habits ; I still eat well and go to the gym , but now I ’m happy to do so .
However , it helped a great deal to to limit myself to a specific period of time from the outset .
# 5 Track Progress , Adjust as Needed
During the year , I weighed myself every day , at the same time every day , wearing the same amount of clothing .
I wrote down my weight , and I used the results to course correct when I needed to .
I found that my weight fluctuated quite a bit during the week , and there was nothing as frustrating as working my ass of at the gym and then weighing myself the next day and finding I had gained weight .
In actuality , I had n’t gained weight , but my weight fluctuated .
Weight fluctuations are completely normal and depend on the time of day , the time of year , how hydraded or dehydrated you happen to be , when you last ate , and many other factors .
You ca n’t let yourself get hung up on day to day weight changes .
Instead , what I did was kept track of my weight for the week .
I had a spreadsheet ( stored in Google docs ) that had one week per row , 7 columns each .
The only column I ever really looked at was the “ Week Average ” and I compared that to the previous week .
If I had , overall , gained during the week , I needed to make a change .
If I had lost weight , I was on the right track .
This let me ignore daily fluctuations .
I entered my data every day , but I evaluated only at the start of the week .
When I decided to change my plan , I committed to the change for one full week , even if it did n’t look like it was working as the week started out .
For example , if I decided to have a different kind of breakfast , I would commit to that new breakfast for the full week , no matter what .
At the end of the week , I ’d decide if that did or did n’t work .
It also helps to buy a decent scale and weigh yourself at the exact same time every day .
I always weighed myself in the morning , right before showering .
The scale was in the bathroom , next to the shower .
I also tracked myself at the gym .
I did n’t go running or bike riding for aerobic exercise - I used machines that allowed me to enter my age and weight , then told me how many calories I was burning .
When I was first starting out , this was critical in figuring out what kind of changes I needed to make .
One thing I wish I had done was taken a picture of myself at 290 .
I never thought I ’d actually be able to lose even 30 pounds , let alone 90 .
So I was n’t willing to take a photo of myself at 290 .
When I hit 260 , I wished I had taken a picture of myself 30 pounds heavier , because , having lived my life as a fat guy , it was really hard to actually see that I was losing weight because of my own perceptions .
Only the scale told me I was losing weight .
If I had a picture at 290 and one at 260 , I would have seen the difference that others were seeing and mentioning .
Of course , at 260 I never thought I ’d hit 230 , so I still did n’t take a picture .
And , you guessed it , at 230 I never thought I ’d hit 200 so I still did n’t take one .
I wish I had a picture of myself 90 pounds heavier without a shirt on , but I do n’t .
Do it , or you ’ll regret it .
# 6 Do n’t Make A Resolution , Start Right Now
Resolutions do n’t work .
Do n’t make weight loss a “ new years resolution . ”
And do n’t say things like “ alright , I ’m going on my diet starting the first of this month . ”
Start next week .
Whenever I would pick a specific time to start , or do something like have “ one last hurrah ” at a buffet during the month prior to “ getting serious , ” I would fail .
Any time I drew a line between my “ old diet ” and my “ new diet ” it did n’t work .
I ca n’t really explain why , but for some reason this never worked out .
I ’d miss a workout day and all of a sudden the “ new diet ” had been blown and I ’d wind up skipping another day , and then another , until I was n’t doing it anymore .
Or I ’d eat a slice of pizza and just give up on the whole thing .
**
Creating a hard line between “ old ” and “ new ” made me feel like a failure if I screwed up during the “ new ” phase .**
Instead , I got into it gradually .
My first day at the gym was n’t some hour - long thing , it was about 30 minutes .
My first day of my new diet was n’t carrot sticks and salads , I just cut back on some bad foods and tried some new ones .
I experimented .
I replaced my morning muffin with a morning yogurt .
I added half an hour to my workday by going to the gym immediately after work ( before going home ) for a little while .
Then I ’d simply track how helpful these efforts were .
Quite honestly , a small change was actually enough to lose some weight in the beginning , but eventually it was n’t enough , and I had to add more gym time or cut back more in my diet .
I started with baby steps and then course - corrected as time went on .
This means I did n’t ever have a distinct “ old life ” and “ new life ” with a line drawn between them .
I did n’t start “ first thing next Monday ” .
I started immediately and changed the plan as I went along .
Start tomorrow .
Another benefit of starting without making it a New Year ’s resolution is quite simple : just after New Year ’s , the gym sucks .
The place gets packed with “ New Year ’s Resolutionists ” .
You have to fight for a machine that you want to use , and if you ’re new to the gym , you feel like everyone is watching your fat ass jiggle around on the treadmill .
The gym blows when it ’s crowded , especially when you ’re starting out .
Starting out in January is a guaranteed way to abandon the gym .
I started in October , so I was comfortable enough in the gym by January that I did n’t mind the sudden surge in attendance ( in fact , I felt like they were n00bs ) .
The resolutionists all give up by March , so after that it ’s safe .
# 7 No Fried Food , No Soda - Cold Turkey
There were two exceptions to the “ slow start ” mentioned above .
Two big changes that were , in fact , immediate and drastic .
I stopped drinking regular soda , and I stopped eating fried food .
Completely .
In a restaurant , if my food came with fries , I ’d ask to replace it with steamed Broccoli or something similar .
I did n’t buy or drink any regular soda , ever , no exceptions .
Diet soda was fine , however .
I did n’t listen to any of the crap about how diet soda is bad for me and causes cancer , or how Mexican coke with real sugar is better for me , blah blah blah .
It ’s all horseshit .
Calories are calories , and diet soda does n’t have any .
Diet soda is n’t GOOD for me , but it did let me drink something with some flavor with my lunch .
Quite honestly I ’d have gone insane if I only drank water for the year , so I ’m glad diet soda had my back .
That said , I did n’t guzzle the stuff .
Soda , because it ’s carbonated , expands your stomach , so it makes you feel less full than you otherwise would .
This encourages you to overeat .
I also started ordering only water when I went out to eat , which had the bonus of saving me more money than I expected .
I generally had water or diet iced tea ( no carbonation ) with dinner , and I allowed myself to drink a diet soda at lunch .
I could get away with this because I always brought my lunch from home , so there was a limit to the amount of food I could eat at lunchtime , reducing the risk of overeating because of soda .
I ’d occasionally steal a couple fries from my fiancee if she had some , but eventually I found that having two fries made it extremely difficult not to have a third fry , and a third made it very hard not to have a fourth , so I stopped doing that for the most part .
Diet soda and veggies instead of fried food , immediately .
Starting right away .
It helps .
# 8 Get What You Need , But Do n’t Let It Stop You
At the gym during the first week with my iPod nano .
Holding it while I work out is a pain .
“ You know what , ” I think to myself , “ I really need an arm strap .
I ’ll get one tomorrow and then start working out . ”
You have no idea what kind of excuses you will invent to get out of the gym until you start going .
It ’s staggering , the human brain ’s ability to concoct reasons to get out of the gym .
My foot is kind of hurting .
I need a water bottle to really get started .
My iPod battery is dead , I should charge it first .
My gym shorts are too tight , I need new ones .
The little plastic thing on my shoelace came off and now I ca n’t tie them as tightly .
Seriously , you will think of every possible reason under the sun to get out of the gym .
GO ANYWAY .
Even if the reason is completely valid , like the armstrap for my iPod , make yourself go anyway and live with the problem for the one time , then fix it tomorrow .
The HABIT of going to the gym is almost as important as the actual going .
If you skip a day that you planned on going , you break your habit .
Once you build the habit of going to the gym , you find that you do n’t have to convince yourself to go anymore , it ’s just part of your day , like brushing your teeth .
Building the habit is crucial , so do n’t let little things derail you from developing the habit .
I now find that I actually feel shitty when I do n’t go to the gym , it takes more effort for me to skip than to go .
That ’s because I built a habit out of it , the same way that if you skip brushing your teeth for a day your teeth feel all grimy and disgusting .
Even if you need something before you can really get a lot out of a gym trip , go anyway and deal with the problem tomorrow .
# 9 Drink More Water
Water is good for you .
It increases your metabolism , and it helps you feel full .
Very , very often when you think you are hungry , you ’re actually thirsty , your brain just ca n’t tell the difference .
If you find yourself craving food , go drink a glass of water and wait a few minutes .
You very well may not actually have been hungry .
Your brain sucks , deal with it .
When I go out to a restaurant , I order water , and I drink a ton of it .
This ensures I do n’t overeat at the restaurant ( food in restaurants is usually served in a 3 x or more portion .
If you ’re not taking home a box when you leave , you ate too much ) .
I try to drink an entire glass of water before the waiter or waitress comes back to even take my order , and another before the bread arrives .
If I ’m not annoying the server , I ’m not drinking enough water .
How much water should you drink ?
At the risk of being crass , your piss should be almost clear .
If your urine is yellow , you need to drink more water .
It ’s that simple .
# 10 Slow The Fuck Down
You eat too fast .
Trust me , you do .
Fat people eat way faster than skinny people .
Huge bites , gone in seconds , then a plate full of more food .
I found it very helpful to fill my dinner plate with what I felt was the correct amount of food , then to eat the food on it as slowly as possible .
If I was still hungry when I was done , I forced myself to wait 20 minutes .
Only if I was still hungry after 20 minutes would I let myself have more food .
It almost never happened .
I only got a second plate if I broke the 20 - minute rule ( which I ’d always regret )
It takes about 20 minutes for your stomach to tell your brain it ’s full .
That means , once you ’re COMPLETELY FULL , it will be twenty minutes before your brain even has an idea that you should stop eating .
The slower you eat , the more time you give your brain to find out it should stop eating before you cram more food down your cramhole .
Take tiny bites .
Your mouth does n’t need to be full to enjoy the taste of your meal .
The smaller the bite , the more food you ’ll think is on your plate , and the less likely you will be to feel like you did n’t get enough food .
Chew .
Turn it into mush before you swallow .
You ’re on a diet , so you have a much more limited number of bites .
Taste those bites as long as you can before you swallow them .
Once the food is out of your mouth , you ca n’t taste it anymore , and you need to stuff a whole new bite into your face to enjoy the taste of your food again .
Leave the bite in longer , and you can enjoy your food longer without the need to shove more food into your gullet .
Try to chew until there ’s no flavor .
I still stuggle with this one , it ’s a big adjustment , but it ’s worth it .
# 11 Do n’t Kill Yourself
The worst thing you can do to completely derail your diet is to make yourself so miserable that you hate it .
If your company orders pizza for your group and you decide you eat your lame little salad while everyone else is eating pizza , you ’re just going to sit there focusing on delicious pizza and how pissed off you are that you ’re on this stupid diet .
If you hate it , you ’ll quit .
Indulge every so often .
Have that slice of pizza .
Steal a few fries from your spouse .
Just order the cheeseburger if you ’re going to be pissed off all night after ordering a bowl of soup .
Just do n’t make a habit of it .
They ’re indulgences for a reason , they should be the exception , not the norm .
If you love chocolate more than life itself , depriving yourself of it is going to end one way : with you shoving fistfuls of Hershey bars into your face while screaming “ screw the diet ! ”
The trick is not to deprive yourself , it ’s to introduce moderation .
Eat a kit -kat , but spend an extra 15 minutes at the gym to balance it out .
Eventually you ’ll start looking at a slice of pizza not as a delicious , cheesy piece of bread , but as an extra 20 minutes on the treadmill .
Then you wo n’t even want the damn thing ( usually ) .
Yeah , that snickers bar sure LOOKS good , but the fact of the matter is that you ’ll have eaten it in 30 seconds and you wo n’t even remember what it tastes like 10 minutes from now , but if you eat it you ’ll have to spend an extra half hour at the gym working it off .
Possibly an extra 6 hours the next day being all pissed off at yourself for eating it , blaming it for the fact that you gained weight yesterday in spite of working your butt off at the gym .
Your relationship toward these kinds of foods changes when you start living healthier , and you desire them less and less .
But if you completely deprive yourself of them , you ’ll want them more and more .
Give in when you absolutely have to , just do n’t make it a regular occurrence .
Conclusion
Losing weight is not that hard .
Really , it ’s not .
It ’s more about commitment than anything else .
Make a plan , stick to it , and the pounds come off .
You do n’t need a fad diet , you do n’t need a special book , you do n’t need to subscribe to some online service .
If you burn more calories during a day than you eat , you lose weight , it ’s that simple .
Stop telling yourself “ I ’ve tried everything and nothing works ! ”
You know damn well you have n’t tried everything , stop kidding yourself .
Losing 90 pounds is , without a doubt , the most significant accomplishment I ’ve ever made in my entire life so far .
I ca n’t even describe in words how much better I feel now , how much more energy I have now , and how much happier I am .
I feel comfortable in a suit .
I can buckle my seatbelt in a car without feeling like the strap is making my bitch tits stick out .
I can shop for clothes in a regular department store , and it does n’t take me 5 hours .
I can wear t- shirts instead of fat - guy Hawaiian shirts .
I can dance or ride a bike without feeling like a fridge .
The little things make a big difference .
I feel alive , confident , and energetic .
My brain feels like it works better , and I enjoy how I feel when I ’ve eaten well for the day .
I enjoy my time at the gym , it gives me time to think about whatever I want or listen to an audiobook .
200 - pound - me is so much happier than 290 - pound - me that I can barely even understand how I was able to live my life before .
Having someone I have n’t seen in a while say “ holy shit , you look great ! ” makes my week .
It ’s not that hard once you build habits , I promise .
I did it .
You can too .

Austria has announced plans to pull out of CERN , the international science alliance which runs the world 's most powerful particle - punisher - the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) - and whose people invented the world wide web .
" I feel bad about every membership that we cannot keep up , " said Science Minister Johannes Hahn on Friday , announcing Austrian plans for the pullout .
He added that CERN membership currently absorbs 70 per cent of Austria 's funding for international projects , and the withdrawal will allow various other initiatives to be funded .
Hahn also sought to characterise the Austrian move as a " pause " rather than a permanent break with CERN , and said that he hoped for " a new kind of cooperation " with the Franco - Swiss based collider organisation .
Top Austrian particle - smash boffins were n't pleased .
" This is a catastrophe , " famed Vienna physicist Walter Thirring , a major cheese at CERN from 1968 to 1971 , told AFP .
He added that other nations might follow Austria in pulling out of the organisation , perhaps imperilling the LHC .
The Collider should have been operating by now , but following initial switch - on last year it suffered serious damage following a cooling failure .
It 's now expected to start seriously banging hadrons in the second half of this year .
Recent comments by the UK's new science minister and former medtech biz - cat Lord Drayson , to the effect that Blighty might need to refocus its science spending on more lucrative areas rather than LHC - style pure science , met with a robust response from CERN .
Thus far there have been no other signs that the UK intends to follow Austria 's example . ®

McLaren are not having a happy Spanish Grand Prix , with Lewis Hamilton saying new parts on his car have failed to make any difference to its performance , and events on the track bearing him out .
But the Mole has heard a whisper that could make it an even worse weekend for the embattled team .
The Mole has heard from an insider at the Spanish bank Santander , one of McLaren 's major sponsors , that the company is getting ready to announce at the Italian Grand Prix in September that it will be switching to McLaren 's rivals Ferrari in 2010 .
A Ferrari -Santander link - up has long been rumoured within F1 , related as it is to another long - standing rumour - that Fernando Alonso is also on his way to the Italian team .
Politics tests character , often to destruction .
The character of some ministers , their shadows and MPs of all parties has been wrecked by ­exposure of their ­expenses .
How can those caught pilfering from the public purse denounce benefit fraud ?
How can those with state - purchased silk cushions support the cash - limited social fund that denies beds and blankets to families sleeping on bare boards ?
MPs with fingers in the till will blush to justify paying the unemployed £ 60.50 a week to live on .
Nor can they rant convincingly at City greed or tax - dodgers fleeing to Guernsey .
The one character who has been tested to final destruction is Gordon Brown .
The music stopped on his watch , first for the economy and now MPs ' sleaze , for which the government of the day takes most blame .
Labour used to lay claim to higher moral ground , while the right always said greed was the motor of growth .
When he first talked of his moral compass , Brown should have cleaned up party funding , MPs ' expenses and honours – and linked these reforms with curbs on the power that money breathes over the nation 's affairs .
The expenses mess would not be fatal if the prime minister were upright and strong .
But Labour is already ­dangling over a cliff , and this affair prises its fingers off the edge .
It 's all over for Brown and Labour .
The abyss awaits .
As long as he remains leader , there is nothing that wretched Labour candidates can plausibly say on the doorstep at next month 's European elections .
They are struck dumb .
Why should people vote for them ?
The horse manure bought on expenses is garnish for a decomposing government .
The heart of the matter is the economy , and Brown 's responsibility for the bubble years .
He personally is to blame for Labour 's failure to ensure that ordinary people on median incomes and poor people at the bottom received a bigger share in national growth : it turns out that they fell back and only the wealthy prospered .
Labour made the rich richer and the poor poorer : growth for the few , not the many .
That is a failure so fundamental to Labour 's purpose that the party can't go into the next election led by the man responsible .
His other failings as leader pale beside this one monumental fact .
While he is there , Labour cannot claim " fairness " or " social justice " , so what is left to say ?
What is Labour 's offer ?
Gordon Brown has been tested and found in want of almost every attribute a leader needs .
Squalid dealings by his poisonous inner circle were exposed to the light of day ; yet at the same time he lacks a leader 's necessary political cunning .
Many hoped that the end of the rivalry with Blair would see Brown cast off his myrmidons .
He did n't .
In the tussle between his better and his worse selves , too often the lesser man won .
That he was no great public orator or warm telegenic talker would never have mattered had he gained a reputation as a gruff , unspun man of honour , vision and purpose .
I thought it an asset after Blair 's glibness and Cameron 's suavity .
It was n't the medium that did for him , but the message .
There was n't one .
What was Labour for ?
He may be the best - read prime minister in decades , but his learning seems to hamper instead of illuminate his path .
His indecision is legendary , every department awaiting answers that linger on his desk for months as he agonises sleepless but indecisive into the early hours .
But then the decisions he takes are too often tactical , not purposeful or strategic .
Trident , the third runway or post office privatisation are mere positioning in some illusory business - pleasing ploy , their long - term damage far outweighing one day 's headlines .
Blair people warned of Brown 's dark side , his rages , obstinacy and inflexibility .
Labour MPs who voted him in ­unopposed hoped he would grow in stature .
They needed to believe the best of him as there was no alternative .
Any serious attempt to stop him would have led to an internal feud of such ferocity it would have shipwrecked the government .
Besides , back then the economic boom years were his crowning laurels .
I was among those looking for the best in him , celebrating his undoubted concern for Africa , foreign aid and child poverty – but no one can know a leader 's mettle until too late .
His leadership of the G20 championed a measure of Keynesianism to counter the worst effects of the crash .
But an essentially neoliberal ideology coupled with timidity prevents him taking this once - only chance to reform the City , demand more of bankers and separate high street from casino banking .
Despite the crash , he harbours the same old reverence for , or fear of , the money - men who wrought this global mayhem .
The morning after the 4 June ­election a majority deputation from the ­cabinet , bearing a long list of MPs ' names , should knock on the door of No 10 to tell him his number 's up .
Plot it now , do it fast .
The Tories are lethal with their failed leaders : Labour MPs facing annihilation must find the bottle .
There is nothing to lose .
Once the credit crunch began , I thought assassination might make ­matters worse , precipitating a ­downward spiral from which Labour could fall into total collapse – Brown at least had the gravitas of experience .
But Labour now faces an imminent collapse anyway , with Brown hitting polling depths below Michael Foot 's , lower than for 70 years .
There is all the difference between losing by a few points and crashing out so badly it takes ­another three elections to ­recover .
The one person around whom the party could gather speedily would be Alan Johnson .
It 's nonsense that another unopposed leadership would mean disaster : a general election is coming soon enough .
Orphan boy , genial postman , self - made , clever but modest , he has the grace and charm to match his perfect backstory .
He was always the one the Cameroons feared .
His political talents turned the NHS from a danger with closures and denials of drugs into an asset for Labour .
Good to work with , good in public , he inspires considerable admiration .
This time I will not say I know he would be a good leader – that 's unknowable until too late .
I doubt that he can win for Labour .
But , goodness knows , Cameron is still there for the taking .
The only question now is whether Labour ministers and MPs are so shell - shocked by the last year and so shamed by their expenses that they lack the will to live .
Ordinary party members , you valiant few , get up and tell your MPs that Gordon Brown must go .

Advertisement Cameras have revealed how " armed " chimpanzees raid beehives to gorge on sweet honey .
Scientists in the Republic of Congo found that the wild primates crafted large clubs from branches to pound the nests until they broke open .
The team said some chimps would also use a " toolkit " of different wooden implements in a bid to access the honey and satisfy their sweet tooth .
The study is published in the International Journal of Primatology .
Crickette Sanz , from the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , said : " The nutritional returns do n't seem to be that great .
" But their excitement when they 've succeeded is incredible , you can see how much they are enjoying tasting the honey . "
Honey monsters Chimps ' love of honey and their ingenuity at accessing it are well known amongst primatologists - previous studies have revealed how the great apes can fashion sticks to dip into or prise open nests .
The chimps will go up there and hang at all sorts of precarious angles to get to the honey
Crickette Sanz
But until now , nobody realised how prevalent the beehive - bashing behaviour was amongst chimpanzees in the Goualougo Triangle in the Congo Basin .
Dr Sanz said : " It seems these chimps in central Africa have developed more sophisticated techniques for getting at the honey than populations in eastern and western Africa - maybe it is some kind of regional feature . "
Perhaps for obvious reasons , the chimps avoided bee species that sting , targeting the hives of stingless bees instead .
The chimps can spend hours trying to access the honey Dr Sanz told the BBC : " But these nests are tough to get into - they can be at the top of the forest canopy , at the end of a branch - and the chimps will go up there and hang at all sorts of precarious angles to get to the honey , using these clubs in any way that they can to access it . "
The video footage , which was filmed by the researchers over four years , revealed the chimps ' sheer determination to get at the sweet stuff .
Dr Sanz explained : " Nobody knew they would pound over 1,000 times to get to the honey .
" Sometimes it could take several hours - they would start in the morning at around 1000 , then take some rests , and then finish up at about 1400 or 1500 in the afternoon .
" It is quite physically challenging - in the videos you can see how large those pounding clubs are - some weigh over a kilogram . "

The primatologists also found that the Congo chimps ' tool use was more sophisticated than previously thought .
David Morgan , a co-author on the study from the Wildlife Conservation Society and Chicago 's Lincoln Park Zoo , said : " One of the most exciting aspects is that they are using multiple tools to access the honey that is in these hives .
" They have a tool kit ready when they go for honey .
Chimps craft ultimate fishing rod " They will have large pounding clubs and they 'll use those to hammer the hives .
" And if that does n't do , if the holes are too small , then they 'll access them using smaller , thinner dipping wands .
And they are also using smaller sticks for leverage to get better access to the hive . "
The researchers also said that once the chimps had spotted and then crafted a suitable club from a branch , by pulling off unwanted twigs and leaves with their teeth or hands , they would set it aside for later use .
Dr Morgan said : " They cache them in the canopy . "
Last week , the same team also reported how Goualougo Triangle chimps were crafting fishing rods with a brush - tipped end to fish for termites , and the scientists say there is still much to learn about tool use in these chimps .
However , they told the BBC that the chimps ' future was uncertain , as the primates and their habitat were under threat .
Dr Morgan said : " These beehives are found in tree species that are exploited for logging , so this could be a direct affect we have on their behaviour , their feeding and their conservation . "

al hakawati ( the storyteller ) zaabeel park , dubai image courtesy visiondivision
the thyssenkrupp elevator award was a competition which asked architects to develop an iconic tall emblem structure for zaabeel park in dubai .
for their proposal visiondivision designed a statue based around al hakawati – a storyteller , whose profession that goes way back in ancient arabic times and still is performed in the arabic world today .
the statue will be a home of stories ; a children ’s library in its base and various spaces for performance and reading inside of the statue .
in every part of the park , small speakers will be set up so people can gather around them and listen to the statue when he recites stories ; perhaps great legends from one thousand and one night , historical anecdotes from the city itself and future speculations , all this performed with an animated body language .

the statue the walls in the base are stairs on the outside which leads to the platform where the storyteller begins to rise .
windows punctuates various stairs for a bright indoor environment without any direct sunlight .
the statue also has big rooms inside of it for reading , relaxing and other social activities .
each big room has its own theme , be it a gold room , a crystal cavern , a green room or a room full of fish tanks , or the night views of dubai .

technical aspects the statue can move its arms and head ; this demands an articulate joint between the elevators and the floors on these critical points .
the joints are similar in function to those seen in joint buses , and will guarantee an uninterrupted movement inside of the statue , even if he slightly tilts his head .
the arms and head movement is controlled by computers and can mimic a prerecording of an actor for example .
the rigid parts of the statue are made out of a steel frame structure with a cover of sheets of steel .
the movable parts must be flexible , thus a material like rubber or silicon with a coating that mimic the glossiness of the steel is preferable .

I do n't have a problem with it at all .
Like most fields of science , it has some gaps - which is why scientists have jobs !
However I keep seeing people say things like " it does n't explain everything , therefore there must be something else ... " .
So many people can't seem to cope with " I do n't know " - they have to presume something untestable instead .
However , going by some answers here , there is a huge lack of understanding of how science works .
Typical is @ Incommunicado :
<< A couple of centuries ago , men in white collars told us what to believe .
Now men in white labcoats tell us what to believe .
I do n't realy see the difference , if you can't retain some objective scepticism about science then you 've missed the point rather badly . >>
Well , the men in white collars were unaccountable .
They were not challenged , or even challengeable .
Their pronouncements were fixed , meant to represnt absolute truth .
Compare that with science , which is 100 % challengeable .
The whole underlying principle is permanent open - mindedness , knowing that whatever we think today could be overturned by new evidence tomorrow .
The process is a rigorous way of putting any new idea through a meat - grinder ( peer review ) , poring over it for the slightest flaw or inconsistency .
When published , any work is open to anyone to scrutinise , whether by doing the same experiment , carrying out the same observations , or even applying simulations to theoretical work .
Everyone wants to find fault .
Hence if work gets through this , it is accepted - for the moment .
There is never a presumption that current findings are absolutely correct or permanent .
Science embodies the very essence of objective scepticism .
Hence these two are poles apart .
The theory of evolution makes predictions , and evidence keeps validating these predictions , not refuting .
Some things get changed significantly - for example , Darwin's ' Tree of Life ' , based on inheritance , has been radically altered by the recently discovered Horizontal Gene Transfer , where genetic material is transferred between species by some vectors , not just downwards by inheritance .
As science goes , evolution is good science .
Anyone can question it and try to refute it .
Of course , any such challenge must itself face peer review , and so far nobody has come up with a better theory to explain the observations .
The issue is not really one of people objecting for scientific reasons - it ;s about religion .
This theory ( and others ) conflict with certain religious dogma , so it 's no accident that some ( not all ) religious people just refuse to accept it .
They look for ways to refute it , including inventing myths about entropy and conservation of energy , and their ' flock ' who do n't understand science blindly accept their explanations .
They even try to denigrate science itself , describing it as ' faith ' based !
However , scientists do n't .
They see these flimsy or outright disingenuous explanations for what they are , and demolish them easily .
Hence the two camps of accountable science aimed at questioning people , and blanket statements aimed at those who will just accept them .
In short , it plays on ignorance , an unquestioning acceptance of faith , and even a strong emotional irrational will to ' want ' to believe certain things .
More proper education needed .
Police in Durham Region have arrested 62 people in a sweep aimed at busting up the high school marijuana trade in Clarington , a largely rural region east of Oshawa , police announced today .
Starting in late April , undercover officers staked out high schools in the area , which includes the town of Bowmanville .
They observed numerous drug transactions and arrested both drug buyers and a few dealers , and seized their drugs and money .
During the investigation , they raided a house and found two illegal handguns .
All but two of the people arrested are under 18 .
Most of the charges were simple possession for small amounts of marijuana , but a few people faced trafficking and gun charges .
WASHINGTON --
The recent approval of a new device to treat knee injuries followed a lobbying campaign that overcame repeated rejections by scientists within the Food and Drug Administration , agency documents show .
The FDA 's internal dissent over Menaflex , which targets the most - common knee injury afflicting everyone from high - school athletes to baby boomers , is straining a government agency that oversees a quarter of the U.S. economy .
Some senior FDA staff members complained in documents that the handling of Menaflex , made by ReGen Biologics Inc. , shows how political and industry pressure can influence scientific conclusions .
At issue is n't just the efficacy of the device -- that remains in dispute -- but the nature of the FDA 's own approval process .
In one instance , emails show the FDA 's integrity office excising language from a draft letter an FDA lawyer said would " document special treatment for ReGen . "
( Read the emails . )
Menaflex was approved under fast - track rules that do n't require clinical trials needed under a full review .
" There 's something wrong with how that decision [ to go the fast - track route ] was made , " said Andrew von Eschenbach , who was head of the FDA in December , when Menaflex got the go - ahead .
" We fumbled that process . "
Prototypal chaining ( aka inheritance ) is something that toke me a couple of years to really understand , simply because you usually do n’t use it directly ( because a library / framework does it for you ) or you do n’t need it .
I failed a job interview question on that one year ago .
And when I recently explained prototypal chaining to a friend of mine , he suggested that I should write something about it .
To make it very simple and easy .
I got introduced to Object - oriented programming ( OOP ) using the C++ and Java languages , with the very infamous Animal class .
JavaScript is a prototypal language , so is a little bit different than Java , C++ or C# .
For the next 5 minutes , try to forget what you already know and dive into what follows .
Let ’s start by altering the prototype of Object .
( Code tested running SpiderMonkey or inside the Firebug console . )
>>> Object.prototype.foo = " bar " ; >>> var a = {} ; // or new Object ( ) >>> a.foo " bar " >>> // with Firebug : console.log >>> for ( var key in a ) { ... print ( key ) ; ... } bar >>> " foo " in a true >>> a.hasOwnProperty ( " foo " ) false
a is an Object that as prototype .
The prototype of Object do n’t have any prototypes , Object is the root element .
But the key foo is a String that has a prototype that is an Object .
Yes there is a loop .
( Almost ) everything in JavaScript is an object and every Object as a prototype .
>>> a.foo.foo.foo.foo.foo " bar " >>> new Date ( ) .foo " bar " >>> 3.14.foo " bar " >>> ( 42 ) .foo " bar " >>> true.foo " bar " >>> ( function ( ) {} ) .foo " bar " >>> " spam " .foo " bar " >>> /^[ rR ] ( ?:e[ gx ] ) {2}p$/.foo " bar " >>> // almost everything >>> undefined.foo TypeError : undefined has no properties >>> TypeError.foo " bar "
I hope this shows that you should never alter Object .
prototype .
Another ( evil ) example with different native types .
>>> Object.prototype.foo = " bar " ; >>> var now = new Date ( ) ; >>> now.foo " bar " >>> Date.prototype.foo = " spam " ; >>> now.foo " spam " >>> new Object ( ) .foo " bar " >>> delete Date.prototype.foo >>> now.foo " bar "
This shows how the language walks from prototype to prototype looking for a key .
It ’s basically a chain .
How to get the prototype of any thing in JavaScript ?
Usually any object has a constructor attribute , but try to use duck - typing instead .
>>> new Date ( ) .constructor == Date true >>> .1.constructor == Date false >>> .1.constructor == Number true
Gecko ( the engine powering Firefox ) offers a very handy property on any element __proto__ that returns the prototype .
I ’ll not use it here to avoid any confusions .
It ’s the only way I know to get the prototype of a prototype .
Let ’s forget this quickly and start doing something interesting , something that looks like inheritance but relies on prototypal chaining .
>>> function Shape ( name ) { this .
name = name } ; >>> Shape.prototype.toString = function ( ) { ... return " < Shape \ " " +this.name + " \ " > " ... } ; >>> new Shape ( " blob " ) ; < Shape " blob " > >>> function Circle( radius ) { ... Shape.call ( this , " circle " ) ; ... this .radius = radius ... } >>> Circle.prototype = new Shape ( ) ; >>> Circle.prototype.constructor = Circle ; >>> Circle.prototype.area = function ( ) { ... return this .radius * this .radius * Math .
PI ... } ; >>> var circle = new Circle ( 1 ) ; >>> circle < Shape " circle " > >>> circle.area( ) 3.14159
The tricky thing here is those two lines :
>>> Circle.prototype = new Shape ( ) ; >>> Circle.prototype.constructor = Circle ;
The first one says that the prototype of a Circle is a Shape .
It ’s an instance of a Shape .
And the constructor is set back to enable testing instances as you ’ve seen previously .
As the graph shows , an instance of a Circle has two elements name and radius , the function area belongs to its prototype .
This prototype is a Shape so it has a name too , its value is undefined here .
This is one way of doing prototypal inheritance , another way would have be by doing a copy of the methods of one object ’s prototype to the other one .
And because everything is an object , this is not a real copy , just another reference pointing to the same values .
In the previous example , calling the function toString will have to walk up two levels of prototypes in order to find it .
Let ’s us an alternative way .
>>> for ( var key in Shape.prototype ) { ... if ( Shape.prototype.hasOwnProperty(key ) && ... key !== " constructor " ) ... Circle.prototype[key ] = Shape.prototype[key ] ... }
By doing so , let ’s look at the result graph .
The graph is more flat that before , it keeps everything at the same level , which is good because walking up prototypes might take time but you cannot monkeypatch a whole chain of prototype by touching only one of them .
It ’s a tradeoff .
To conclude , let ’s compare two ways of doing ( apparently ) the same thing .
>>> function Foo( ) { ... this .toString = function ( ) { ... return " Foo " ; ... } ... } >>> new Foo( ) ; " Foo " >>> function Bar ( ) {} >>> Bar.prototype.toString = function ( ) { ... return " Bar " ... } ; >>> new Bar ( ) ; " Bar "
Calling new Foo( ) .toString ( ) will be very direct , the function belongs to the instance .
So doing new Bar ( ) . toString ( ) will have to look into the prototype to find the function to call .
Foo is faster but will take more memory because toString will be duplicated in every instances and Bar will be a little slower but creating many instances wo n’t duplicate toString because it lives into the prototype and not the instance .
And you can modify ( monkeypatch ) the toString method of a Bar for all the instances at once .
I ’ve made a little test that creates a huge chain of prototypes and count how many time is spent walking up ( or down ) it .
It takes some time but only when the chain is insanely long .
So do n’t ( premature ) optimize on that .
Run the test .
An underwater volcano exploded near Tonga in the South Pacific to stunning effect this week .
The pictures of gas and steam erupting out of the surface of the water captivated the world .
Here at Wired Science , we love volcanoes — so we decided to use the Tongan eruption to round up some of our favorite volcano eruption pics and present them as big .

Mt. St. Helens , located about 50 miles north of Portland , Oregon in southern Washington state , experienced the most catastrophic eruption of recent memory .
In 1980 , the mountain literally blew its top .
In one day , Mt. St. Helens lost more than 1,000 feet of elevation .

This underwater volcano , Brimstone Pit , was caught erupting by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Submarine Ring of Fire program .
You can see the same volcano erupting in the video below .
" If we were observing this type of eruptive activity on land we would have to run for our lives ! " the researchers note .
" At Brimstone Pit the pressure of [ 1837 feet ] of water over the site reduces the power of the explosive bursts . "
The Tavurvur volcano in Papua New Guinea experienced a major eruption in 1994 .
Though it forced the evacuation of most of the area , it was n't nearly as bad as a 1937 eruption , which killed over 500 people .

The Kamchatka province is a highly geologically active area in far Eastern Russia , near Sarah Palin 's house .
On March 29 , 2007 , the peninsula 's Shiveluch Volcano erupted , sending an ash cloud more than 30,000 feet into the air .
NASA 's Earth Observatory caught the action .
Mt. Stromboli , located on an Italian island , is famous for its fountain - like eruptions , as captured by Wolfgang Beyer .
It 's one of the few volcanoes that exists in a state of permanent ( and thankfully ) moderate eruption .
It 's been bubbling for more than 2,000 years .

Something about his lips repulsed her .
A slight taste of something familiar ; so commonplace that when in a different setting it becomes unplacable .
He was nice enough , but it seemed that he knew more than he should .
That and he made her thoughts wander to horrible things .
That taste .
Sulfur ?

The corpse pulsed with potential .
It called to the young man .
“ Take me , ” it said .
“ Use me , ” it cried .
“ I can aid you in your quest . ”
The young man tried to resist .
“ This is wrong , ” he thought .
“ Someone might see . ”
“ … what happens in Vegas … stays in Vegas . ” said the corpse .
**
“ Think we lost ’em ? ” Mike said to the old man .
“ Huh ?
Oh , I do n’t know , ” was his reply .
Mike continued , “ I knocked over a garbage can to block their path … ”
The old man turned to Mike and looked him in the eye .
“ Wait a moment … who the hell are you ? ”
**
His stomach sank into his shoes when he saw what she was holding .
She found his stash .
He had told her that he stopped , but it was just so hard .
Instead , he cut back to three a day and never around her .
“ Comics , ” he thought , “ are ink - and - paper crack . ”
**
Her beautiful dark hair had been pulled back in a loose ponytail .
“ Well ?
What do you think ? ” she said , turning back to the house .
“ I love it , ” I said .
“ I ’ll get started on a fence . ”
“ Wait .. we need to buy it first . ” she chuckled as he walked away .
“ Honey ? HONEY ! ”
**
He did n’t want to lose her this way ; cast aside like an old pair of pants that , though once were favorites , no longer fit properly .
If she was going to dump him , it would be on his terms .
At least when he sold her dog she ’d have a real reason .
**
He emptied the clip into the slowly advancing mob , unaware of the irony of the situation .
He had been in torpor for a little over a decade , so there was no way for him to know that he was not , in fact , killing zombies .
Emo -kids really should count , though .
**
Thomas rolled the unconscious man onto his back .
“ Hey , ” he shouted , “ this guy does n’t look too shabby , think he ’ll do ? ”
The amorphous entity to which he was speaking drifted over .
“ No , ” it intoned .
“ His nose is too large … we must find another .
Think more ‘ Michael Jackson ’ and less ‘ Dustin Hoffman ’ . ”
**
“ Duck … duck … duck … ”
Shirley said , skipping .
“ Duck … GOOSE ! ” she laughed , patting Nick on the head .
As she spun to run away , he was standing in front of her , scowling , the golden mist surrounding him already beginning to dissipate .
“ We run clockwise , here . ” he said , his eyes narrowing slightly …
“ Now …. run . ”
**
There was too much oxygen on this planet , but that was n’t so bad if he did n’t breathe too often .
Worse than that , though , was figuring out what was normal and what was n’t .
So he did n’t tell the police his car was stolen .
Or his insurance company .
He told his cats .
**
“ Well , obviously you did n’t check the possible side effects ! ” the man in the lab coat shouted .
Enraged , I grabbed him by the throat and slammed him into the wall .
“ Your pills , ” I screamed , punching him in the side .
“ Turned my son , ” another punch .
“ Into a lemur ! ” The scientist sighed .
“ Really ? ”
**
“ Turn left at next stop . ” said a pleasant , monotone , female ’s voice .
I turned , as instructed , slightly annoyed .
“ Continue for two - hundred - yards . ” the voice continued .
I started to grumble .
“ Turn right at ne… , ” it started , just as I screamed “ Knock it off or you ’re walking ! ”
The hitchhiker frowned , feeling dejected .

Greentech Media broke news today of a prototype rooftop solar system made for simplicity , shipability , and affordability .
The system is being developed by Armageddon Energy and is aptly called a " clover . "
The clover includes three hexagonal solar panels , a micro-inverter , and a triangular frame .
It 's lightweight ( check out the regular folks below doing installation work ) and can generate roughly 400 watts .
The company just finished early stage testing and is readying a beta program for further testing .
Although installation appears simple , the rack still needs to be mounted to the roof , panels need to be positioned , and everything needs to be plugged in .
But the no-frills design should ease the costs of installation , which typically runs about 30 - 50 % of the cost of the total solar system .
The panels are light — roughly 10 - 12 pounds per hexagonal panel — because the glass is replaced with a Teflon coating from DuPont .
The panels may not last as long as their glass counterparts , but in any event , a clover is rumored to cost about $ 6,000 once the company starts prefabbing and shipping commercial volumes about a year from now .

An IKEA for Solar ? by Greentech Media

An incredible new technology has led to the development of potentially some of the thinnest speakers in the world .
They are wide , flat and very flexible .
They remind me of the carbon nanotube speakers that we wrote about a few months ago .
OK , maybe they are n’t the thinnest speakers in the world , but darn close .
0.25 mm tick material
At only 0.25 mm thick , the material is both lightweight and very inexpensive to manufacture .
Speakers made out of this material could be used in cars , in homes , in ceiling tiles and even made into posters or pictures that hang on the wall .
Because of its large , flat surface area , the speakers produce sound waves that are planar and directional and can project further than normal speakers .
This means that they could be very useful in airports or passenger terminals where conventional speakers can be very hard to hear .
Warwick Audio Technologies
The company that produces both the material and the speakers believes that these speakers could replace conventional speakers in cars and homes and anywhere where space is at a premium .
Steve Couchman , CEO of Warwick Audio Technologies says :
Another great application would be in PA systems for public spaces .
The sound produced by [ these speakers ] can be directed straight at its intended audience .
The sound volume and quality does not deteriorate as it does in conventional speakers , which means that public announcements in passenger terminals , for example , could be clearer , crisper , and easier to hear .
The speaker material is assembled from layers of very thin conductive and insulating materials , resulting in a flexible laminate structure .
This laminate operates as a perfect piston , with the entire surface resonating exactly in - phase .
This results in a very directional , coherent sound wave .
The material was first developed by Dr Duncan Billson and Professor David Hutchins from the University of Warwick .
The proof - of - concept early prototype was as simple as two sheets of tinfoil and an insulating layer of baking paper .
The two worked with new materials to evolve the design to the point of where it could be used in a commercial application .
It sort of reminds me of the tin foil / paper plate speaker .
The first commercial speakers using the technology are expected to launch later this year .
I ’m imagining gig posters that play the music of the band when I walk by them , wearable speakers and shower curtains that play music !
The latest trend in lucid dreaming is the prescribed use of supplements to increase dream recall and trigger more dreams where you become aware you are dreaming .
These supplements , which include herbs , enzymes and Flintstone vitamins , can greatly increase your chance to go lucid .
But they will not do the trick alone .
In a nutshell , these supplements are worthless if not taken with the right mindset , as well as more traditional forms of lucid dreaming induction .
At best , a supplement taken without mental preparation will increase the chances for a beginner lucid dreamer to be jolted into lucidity – but the lucid dream scene that emerges may be difficult to handle due to the beginner ’s own inexperience with juggling the rawness of lucidity .
However , taken with intention , respect , and as part of an ongoing mind - training program , these supplements may enhance the opportunities to work with self - awareness in the dream .
OK , that said , lucid dreaming supplements can make your mind go pow .
Here is a break - down of the most effective lucid dreaming supplements , also known as oneirogens .
Calea zacatechichi : Known as “ the dream herb , ” Calea Z. is from Oaxaca , Mexico and has been used for centuries by Chontal shaman / dreamers as a cure - all and a “ voyaging ” aid .
The scientific studies on Calea Zacatechichi suggests that it heightens the vividness of imagery in hypnagogia and the non-REM periods .
Ingestion of the plant may also temporarily decrease deep slow - wave sleep and REM periods .
Lucid hypnagogic dreams may be experienced in these non-REM states , but because the herb also increases micro-awakenings and disturbs sleep , there are more chances to promote lucid dreaming from sleep onset .
This can then create a REM rebound effect leading to more vivid and memorable dreams in the morning as well .
I ’ve got to admit — this herb is really bitter .
You can take it as a tea ( with lots of honey ) or use it as a smoking blend .
Or — pro tip — you could take Calea in capsule form .
This gets around the bitterness issue and also ensures you take a specific amount .
Mugwort :
This gentle herb in the sage family ( Artemisia vulgaris ) is used to help remember dreams .
It has a gentle aromatic effect .
It has a long European history of use also as a midwife ’s herb due to its ability to stimulate blood circulation ; in ancient Greece it was associated with the power of the moon .
Traditionally mugwort is enjoyed as a tea and an incense .
Silene Capsensis :
This root from South Africa has considerable anthropological evidence as a lucid dream aid , but its active compounds have not been discovered yet .
Historically , Silene Capensis has been used by the Xhosa people during initiation rites .
Women initiates take the root , and then report their dreams to diviners .
In the West , it has had a mixed reputation , with many reporting no effects whatsoever .
Choline :
This is an amino acid that also promotes acetylcholine , therefore enhancing the expression of REM sleep .
It ’s cheaply found as a Lecithin supplement , but is also present in some common foods such as bananas , onions , soybeans , potatoes and plantains .
Choline is believed to elongate dreams , as well as help with remembering them .
Many people have found that choline and galanthamine taken together are a solid cocktail for promoting lucid dreaming .
Galantamine :
This has become known as the “ lucid dreaming pill . ”
Galantamine is an alkaloid synthesized from a couple plants , including the red spider lily and common daffodil bulbs .
The natural compound has been used for centuries in Europe ; its memory - enhancing properties are hinted at in Homer ’s Odyssey .
It appears to increase lucidity by promoting an important neurotransmitter , acetylcholine .
Galathamine is also being tested to treat symptoms of Alzheimer ’s disease .
Stephen LaBerge is also testing galanthamine on seasoned lucid dreamers , and his initial reports are very positive .
Read my in - depth review of galantamine for lucid dreaming here .
Other brain supplements :
In general , many report increased lucid dreams by loading up on amino acids ( like choline ) and vitamins before bed .
Some safe ones , as long as the dosage is controlled for , are arginine , ornithine , phenylalanine , and the B vitamins .
All of these , as well as your average multi-vitamin , may also enhance dreams though the work of antioxidants and by providing the raw material for neurotransmitters associated with the waking / sleep cycle .
Indeed , it is the " respectable " votes of people like Ms Karsai , who do not consider themselves bigots in any way , that is likely to do most to boost the showing of the Far Right in the elections .
Far from signalling a new wave of Neo - Nazism , many analysts say it shows how mainstream parties have simply dismissed understandable concerns about racial problems and future immigration from Africa and Asia .
The nuclear explosion set off by North Korea this week is bad news for would - be nuclear nations .
The network of blast detectors intended for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty , which has not yet come into force , seems to have perfectly identified the explosion as a nuclear test , despite its small size .
The timing is critical .
President Obama wants the US Senate to ratify the 1996 treaty , which bans all explosive nuclear tests , to demonstrate US commitment to nuclear non-proliferation ahead of crucial international meetings next year .
However , in 1998 , the Senate rejected the CTBT partly over fears that countries could cheat , by claiming small covert weapons tests were earthquakes .
The detection of the North Korean test raises hopes that the Senate will no longer be able to object .
North Korea ’s test was no secret – Pyongyang announced it shortly afterwards .
But it demonstrated that the CTBT ’s only partly built monitoring system could alert member states to a test within 90 minutes , says Tibor Tóth , head of the CTBT secretariat in Vienna .

The last time North Korea set off a nuclear explosion , in 2006 , 22 CTBT seismographs tracked it .
This time 39 pinpointed the blast to “ a couple of kilometres away from the 2006 test site , ” Tóth says .
Bigger blast
“ The seismographs were in a variety of countries , so there was good geopolitical saturation ” – a key factor for the system ’s political credibility , he says .
In 2006 , it took 12 days for tell - tale radioactive elements to reach a CTBT detector in Canada .
Now the system has more than twice as many in place and detection might take only a few days , says Tóth .
The signal from the closest seismograph at Mudanjiang , China , “ is obviously very similar to the signals of the 2006 test , and different from the signals of earthquakes ” in the same region , says seismologist Paul Richards of the Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades , New York .
The signal was also bigger than the 2006 test .
Richards says that if you compare the signal at seismic stations that measured both blasts , this one appears to be “ about 5 times stronger ” .
The 2006 test was estimated at only 0.6 kilotonnes ( TNT equivalent ) , which would make this week ’s blast only about 3 kt .
However , definitive yield estimates require further analysis , says Richards .
By comparison the 1945 Hiroshima bomb yielded about 15 kt .

Ashes stolen
Eighty eight years of the day Trotsky directed the suppression of the anarchist uprising in Krondstadt , a group of bandits scaled the walls of his former house in Mexico City during the late hours at night .
We broke the lock on his mausoleum and we expropriate the content inside it : a silver large vase that bears the inscription of his name , wrapped in the red scarf that he carried around the neck , containing the ashes of the corpse inside .
We replace with care the lock in the monument with a reproduction that was similar in the appearance and escaped into the night .
The vase along with its content then was taken far away to a place where the vase was discarded and the content ( a combination of ash and bone ) were baked in cookies .
These cookies then were sent , along with a letter that explains our actions , to newspapers , to organizations of Trotskyists , and to the groups of anarchist around the world .
While we will not repeat everything of our full letter , briefly we propose to give new light to the idea that history does not end with the past and still a small group of bandits can give new direction to fights thought long to be frozen in the time .
We want to expand the fight to include dead objects of the past that hold hostage us in the present .
Nevertheless , if Trotsky is right about the history , we do not determine anything , but we are only characters whose actions were written in the revolution of October .
As was his destiny , coincidentally , to come to be a cookie .
The ones that receive these cookies have a decision .
Through time , the act to consume enemies have been seen as a way to absorb their powers .
On the other hand , consuming the body and the blood of the dead person as a sacrament have also been a form of worship .
We would want to indicate that , at any rate , the result is always shit .
For those a little delicate , we have tried them , and although they be a little sandy , they are delicious .
The green dots , by the way , they are just candies .

Have you ever thought about what 's going on in your brain when you look at a painting that you like a lot ?
While Neuroscientist Dr. Edward Vessel has and he 's done brain imaging experiments to figure it out .
What happens in your brain when you have a pleasurable experience -- for example , when you see at a painting that you like very much .
Scientists describe this as an aesthetically pleasing experience .
They want to know if simply seeing a painting that you enjoy engages an emotional response and triggers the emotion circuits in your brain .
Neuroscientists have shown that our brain responds fastest to what a painting is about , is it a portrait or a landscape .
And a bit slower to recognize the style of the painting , is it abstract or impressionism .
But Dr Ed Vessel a Neuroscientist at New York University 's Center for Brain Imaging asked a different question .
He wanted to know how seeing a painting makes us feel .
What 's going on in our brain when we have a strong emotional response to seeing a painting ?
This is a very old question and one that artists ask all the time .
Will my painting evoke an emotional response when someone looks at it ?
This week at the Vision Science Society meeting in Naples Florida , Dr Vessel reported the results of his brain imaging study designed to find out what goes on in our brain when we look at an aesthetically pleasing piece of art .
He showed subjects paintings and asked them to rate the paintings from 1 to 4 .
Subjects were told that they were helping an art curator decide which paintings to include in an art exhibit and to rate a painting as 1 if they did n't like it , and 4 if they liked it a lot .
The subjects looked at the different paintings and gave the ratings while in an MRI machine so that the responses in their brain could be imaged .
An interesting thing happened when the subjects saw a painting that they liked a lot .
Those painting evoked a different response in their brains .
There was a very strong response in multiple areas -- the left medial prefrontal cortex , left substantial nigra , and left hippocampus .
Brain areas that span regions involved in higher order cognitive processing , emotion , and memory .
A large and diverse array of neural areas .
Each subject picked different paintings as the most pleasing .
But the responses in the brain were the same .
The same set of regions in the brain responded to the paintings that they liked the best .
This means that it is how the paintings made the subject feel rather than something simple like the colors in the paintings , that drove these response in the brain .
Dr Vessel said " a rating of 4 really engaged our subjects a lot " .
For Ed Vessel , these systems are engaged when he sees one of his favorite paintings , the Chinese Restaurant by Max Weber .
The meaning of the painting is the most important factor for the response in the brain .
When subjects saw a painting that they thought was beautiful there was a very strong response .
Vessel said " the prefrontal cortical areas seem to integrate the emotional and aesthetic reaction to looking at these paintings " .
These studies give us a new appreciation for what 's going on in the brain when we see something that we like .
And show that just seeing something beautiful engages a wide range of cognitive , emotion , and memory circuits in the brain .
For more information you can look at Dr Edward Vessel 's website .
Far from suffering for its shoddy military contracting in Iraq , Congressional investigators have found that KBR Inc. was awarded $ 83 million in performance bonuses .
Even worse , more than half came after Pentagon investigators linked faulty KBR wiring to the electrocution of four soldiers intent on relaxation .
One soldier died taking a shower and another in a swimming pool .
How such settings became part of harm ’s way for the military was the question put to an electrical engineer hired by the Army who reported finding that 90 percent of KBR ’s wiring work in Iraq was not done safely .
Some 70,000 buildings where troops lived and worked were not up to code , according to the engineer , who told a Congressional hearing of “ some of the most hazardous , worst - quality work I have ever inspected . ”
Officials of KBR , the offshoot of the Halliburton conglomerate once run so lucratively by former Vice President Dick Cheney , deny responsibility and say the work met the British code used in the war zone .
Flat denial is an all - too - familiar refrain from this most favored and most questionable of military contractors .
The electrical engineer found most wirers were not experienced in the British code and many were third - country nationals with no electrical training at all .
Confronted with the airing of these lethal findings , the Pentagon at least had enough sense to tell Congress last week that KBR bonuses were suspended pending a full review .
Senator Byron Dorgan ’s description of the Pentagon ’s performance as “ stunning incompetence ” is an understatement for such tragic profiteering .

I make it clear that everything I write is freely available under the Woody Guthrie public license : “ Anyone found using our content without our permission will be considered mighty good friends of ours . ”
I refuse to enable the distributors of my work to behave abusively toward my readers , by stealing content they ’ve previously paid for , or in any other way .
And as it turns out , if Amazon suspends your Kindle account ( say , because you returned stuff too often ) , your reader becomes an inert chunk of plastic suitable for use as a doorstop or paperweight .
All the e-books you ’ve already bought and paid for can no longer be read .
If you fall afoul of Amazon ’s good graces , they ’ll destroy your reader by remote and make the e-books you already “ own ” utterly worthless .
This is just another example of the general rule that , when it comes to digital content , you do n’t ever own anything .
As Cory Doctorow put it :
“ in the name of protecting ‘ intellectual property , ’ big media companies are willing to do … violence to the idea of real property — arguing that everything we own , from our t- shirts to our cars to our ebooks , embody someone ’s copyright , patent and trademark , that we ’re basically just tenant farmers , living on the land of our gracious masters who ’ve seen fit to give us a lease on our homes . ”
If only somebody would figure out how to hack the Kindle ’s DRM so you can duplicate e-book files and distribute them online .
The good news is that DRM is the biggest motivating force behind piracy .
The DRM ’ed stuff you buy “ legally ” seems deliberately calculated to be an affront to your convenience .
You ca n’t switch from one platform to another , despite the fact that you supposedly “ bought ” it , because that would make it easy to lend to other people who might not pay for it .
And it ’s illegal to circumvent DRM so you can use the content you published in a way that ’s easy for you .
The traditional copyright doctrines of “ fair use ” and “ first sale ” that apply to printed material go out the window when it comes to digital content .
But if you download a DRM - free version via a file - sharing network , you can do with it whatever you damn well please , without paying for the privilege of being kicked in the teeth .
The totalitarian lockdown society that the DRM mentality leads to , if pursued to its logical conclusion , was brilliantly illustrated by Richard Stallman in “ The Right to Read ” ( just Google it — it ’s free ) .
To repeat , DRM generates demand for pirated content .
And as it happens , Hugh D’Andrade of the Electronic Frontier Foundation claims Kindle ’s DRM has already been cracked .
Peter Sunde , one of the founders of Pirate Bay , last September expressed interest in the Kindle ; he requested third party assistance in purchasing a reader and setting up a dummy account .
Sunde was one of recently convicted The Pirate Bay defendants , but when it ’s “ hack Kindle ’s DRM ” time cracking down on particular individuals is like standing on the beach and commanding the tide to halt .
So please , somebody — hack the Kindle .
The real pirates are at Amazon .
Network Appliance , a California computer storage and data management vendor , has agreed to pay the U.S. government $ 128 million to settle contract fraud charges brought by the U.S. General Services Administration ( GSA ) .
GSA accused NetApp of overcharging U.S. government customers by failing to give agencies the same discounts it gave to commercial customers .
The U.S. government paid " far more " than it should have for NetApp products , the U.S. Department of Justice said in a news release .
[ Your source for the latest in government IT news and issues : Subscribe to InfoWorld 's Government IT newsletter . ]
GSA alleged that NetApp " knowingly failed to meet its contractual obligations " to provide the agency with accurate and complete information about its sales practices , including discounts offered to other customers , the DOJ said .
NetApp also made false statements to GSA about its sales practices and discounts , the DOJ said .
A NetApp representative was n't immediately available for comment .
The settlement relates to contracts by NetApp to sell hardware , software and storage management services to government agencies through the GSA 's Multiple Award Schedule ( MAS ) program .
The MAS program provides GSA - authorized purchasers with a streamlined process for procurement of commonly used commercial goods and services .
MAS gives vendors access to hundreds of government customers , but the program requires that contractors disclose commercial pricing policies and practices .
The settlement resolves a whistleblower lawsuit filed on behalf of the U.S. government by former NetApp employee Igor Kapuscinski , who will receive a $ 19.2 million share of the recovery in the case .
Under the U.S. False Claims
Act , private citizens can bring suit on behalf of the U.S. government and share in any recovery obtained by the government .
" Especially in these difficult economic times of stretched government budgets , we will ensure that government contractors provide the government with the price it has been promised and all of the discounts to which it is entitled , " Jeffrey Taylor , U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia , said in a statement .

Sunday Mar. 1 , 2009
6:46 PM ET -
We did a live report Saturday evening on CNN , the last day of February .
I made an omelet and some green beans .
It was supposed to be my last meal on the food stamp budget but I decided to run though Monday March , 2nd since we will be doing some more stories on that day .
For the record , I have $ 3.24 left .
And ... a wealth of knowledge .
I think the greatest lessons I am going to take away from this project have very little to do with the actual diet .
I was amazed at how the social aspect of your life is turned upside down when you can't eat out .
Secondly , I constantly found myself doing math , " how much can I spend at this trip ? " and " If I eat this for dinner , what will I have tomorrow night ? "
It is draining .
And , mind you , I only have to fend for myself .
I do n't have to worry about putting food on a table for an entire family .
I took this effort on to try to find out how 31 - million Americans live each month .
That 's the number of people on food stamps .
Part of the recently approved stimulus package calls for increasing the amount of funding for people on food stamps .
The increase is an effort to offset rising food prices , and help keep farmers , distributors , and grocers at work .
I really got much better acquainted with my kitchen .
I rediscovered grilled cheese sandwiches , and I have to say for the most part the food I prepared was fine -- even pretty good at times .
I did make a ton of mistakes shopping .
The first time out I should have purchased a lot more fresh fruits and vegetables , and I should have stayed away from those pre-packaged items ( especially instant mashed potatoes - what was I thinking . )
A lot of folks keep asking , " what did you miss the most ?
What are you going to eat first ? "
I 'll be honest , I really do n't have a craving for anything .
And I feel an obligation to build on what I learned .
So , I think it 's safe to say my eating habits have changed for the foreseeable future .
We had a lot of emails , again I have to apologize for not getting a blog out Friday .
Still dealing with the pick - pocketing fiasco and spent the day at the DMV replacing my driver 's license .
Jenni writes in and says as a teen her family was on food stamps and had very little insurance coverage .
The series of stories hit home for her and brought back some pretty tough memories .
Jenni writes , " We 've done the whole dumpster diving thing getting deli sandwiches out of the dumpsters at the back of the groceries , we 've taken handouts , we have never gone to Chucky Cheese 's , we were lucky to get a fast food meal more than once every four months . "
The juxtaposition of some emails was interesting as well .
For example , Joe writes in saying he was " appalled " at the stories .
He thought I made it look much tougher than it was .
Joe says , " The reason I find this so upsetting is it is actually slightly more than I typically spend on food each month for my own consumption .
Please note that I am a 6'3 215 pound boxer / body builder that burns many more calories than the average person . "
He adds , " What has happened to our society ?
Are we so obsessed with sipping $ 8 lattes and chugging super sized diet sodas that we have overlooked the simple foundations of nutrition ? "
Ok , then the very next email comes from S , in North Carolina who writes in , " I would like to know how someone can really survive on $ 176 a month when the food prices keep going up and you do n't get a raise in your food stamps when food goes up ... it is really hard to live like that . "
Pretty polarizing views .
John was n't happy with any aspect of the stories .
He says , " I was outraged at your segment on CNN covering Food Stamps .
$ 176 per month for one person to live off of is more than sufficient .
Poor you .
You actually had to live off what many middle class families live off everyday . "
Well , at least he watched .
This final comment , from Bridget was interesting to me .
Bridget writes in , " Your month is over , but as you say , the learning is forever .
Now that the public experiment is over , what is the private Sean going to do , how is he going to be true to his fellow humans ?
You do n't have to give anything to anyone - this blog is a pretty good legacy .
But a blog is fleeting in the world of instant media and your work here is n't done . "
A lot to chew on , and I hope I can build on these stories and do more stories in the future .
Thanks for all the emails , it really was a great experience for me .
Thursday Feb. 26 , 2009
11:38 AM ET : I am down to a handful of random cans of vegetables , one large can of clam chowder I bought for a dollar , some bread , lunchmeat , a couple of chicken breasts .
In short , all the things I did n't eat at the start of the month .
So , the menu the next few days is going to be ... limited .
That said , I had a great day yesterday .
I had cereal and yogurt for breakfast .
Lunch was a can of veggie soup and some left over rice from the night before .
For dinner , I made grilled chicken , rice , and green beans .
Oh , I am almost out of milk , juice , and the little packets of knock - off Crystal Light that I have been using .
I still have $ 16.10 left .
I know I am going to have to buy more milk and perhaps a couple of other items to tide me over .
I will make it through the month .
I actually feel pretty good about that .
I know I have received a lot of email from people saying , $ 176 I started with was a lot of money for one person .
But , I had to totally overhaul the way I have always eaten , and I will remind you the folks at the Department of Social Services here in Louisiana did n't think I would make it through the month .
I will write more on my lessons learned in the final monthly blog .
I really must say the response has surprised me .
I thought this would be an interesting topic , the fact 31 - million Americans need food stamps to eat each month .
But the emails have been somewhat overwhelming .
People sharing their personal stories , how they went from a good job , a comfortable living to having to wait in line and apply for government assistance .
I also appreciate the wealth of advice people have offered .
Everything from recipe ideas , to meal plans , to recommendations about who I should profile for our various stories .
With that in mind , here are some more emails we just received .
Jean writes that she grew up poor , and remembers pulling an apple out of her lunch box , the same time other kids were retrieving much more tasty treats .
Jean says , " We all take food for granted unless its not there and people on food stamps have to consider every penny they spend .
I am glad you realized what a mom with kids goes thru trying to make things stretch , trying to give variety and nutrition .
The fun extras are not there , treats are scarce as they are expensive and not necessarily the best value for the buck . "
She goes on to say she just lost her job , and in her words , " ... I am not on food stamps ... yet . "
Sue has been following the blog this month .
She 's someone who has never had to worry about food stamps , or where the next meal will come from , but like so many people , she is shopping a bit differently these days .
She writes in : " Thank you for taking the time and energy to give the rest of us a bit more of an awareness of side of life most Americans can't even begin to comprehend .
I have had lean times in my life , but never have I felt the crushing burden of not knowing whether I would eat today , or whether I would be able to find shelter for myself on a cold night . "
I got a kick out of this next response , in large part because of who it came from .
Jessica , she says she is the oldest of three children and has an amazing awareness of her family 's monthly budget .
She says the family of five has a food budget of $ 440 each month .
Jessica says , " At best , we each eat for $ 3 a day .
I think it 's awesome that you are showing people what much of the world is going through , and I hope that people are stirred to action , even if that action is only to save more of their own money for when things get tough for them ! "
We have heard from a lot of folks who have had to tighten their belts , people who have had the bottom drop out .
This email really kind of jumped out at me .
It comes from Michael .
He says he and his wife both make a good income , so clearly food stamps have never been a concern .
But , he did a little research .
Michael writes , " I wanted to see how much we spent and tried to not change anything .
On food stamps we would get $ 393 for the month and I wanted to know how close we would get to that .
With just a couple days left we have spent $ 600 and some change on food for us two and our 9 month old . "
A couple of notes .
Our final segment will air on American Morning this coming Monday .
We are also scheduled to do a couple of stories for Campbell Brown Friday night and then a segment on the weekend with Don Lemon .
So , let me know what you think .
It has been a very informative month for me .
Wednesday Feb. 25 , 2009
12:20 PM ET - First , I want to apologize for not filing yesterday .
I am a little bit lighter today .
Not because of the diet , but because I was pick pocketed this weekend in the French Quarter .
My own stupidity .
Yesterday I had to stay home and wait for new credit cards to be shipped to me , and did n't have a laptop with me .
Again , a rookie mistake .
Ok , on to life on a food stamp budget .
I think for the first time , I am physically noticing I have been affected by the diet .
I am not eating nearly as much meat or chicken and have n't had any fish this month .
I was running between four and five miles several times a week .
The last ten days , when I got to three miles I was just running out of gas .
I talked to a friend of mine who is a nurse and she said it is probably a combination of two things .
One , eating carbs ( rice , pasta , and such ) will give me a blast of energy -- then it runs out .
I am not getting as much protein as I had in past , and that she suspects , is having the negative impact .
I know , I know , I could be eating beans , peanut butter , tofu , and other items -- but like I said I am new at this and I made mistakes shopping .
A lot of people have said if I want to experience the hardship I need to extend the experiment .
Try living on food stamps for two months , or three months .
There are so many things that have changed in the way I eat .
I am constantly thinking about what I have left in the fridge and on the shelf .
I think about how much money I have left .
I think about ways of making my meals more diverse with the limited items I do have .
In short , it just wears on you having to constantly worry there may not be enough , or it simply is n't what I want to eat .
And mind you , I am just one person .
I can't imagine how agonizing it must be for families to have to deal with this stress day in and day out worrying about how they are going to feed their children .
Remember , here in Louisiana one in six receives some kind of assistance in the form of food stamps .
And , 31 - million people across the country do the same .
A lot of emails built up over the last couple of days , I want to get to them .
Liz , a student in Maine says she has to be incredibly tight with her money to make ends meet .
She says I am making a big mistake by not taking offers of food from friends , " handouts " as she calls it .
Liz says , " Handouts are how we get by most weeks .
Our breakfast comes from the leftover bagels from a local shop that would otherwise be thrown away because they are stale .
Often lunch comes from presentations on campus that serve food to entice more students to attend .
When mountains of food were being thrown away due to the salmonella in peanut butter scare , we were digging the unopened products out of the trash and taking it home .
There has n't been a day since that I have n't eaten at least one " contaminated " food item . "
That is a bit scary .
Here is one from Beverly on a subject I should have brought up long before now .
She writes , " I have not seen you mention the time spent on prep and clean up .
Just the time alone cuts into your free time and most of those on food stamps do n't have luxuries like dishwashers . "
I was thinking of this last night .
I cooked ground beef ( I meant to thaw out chicken , but since I wrapped everything in foil I grabbed ground beef instead of chicken ) rice , and corn .
By the time I had everything all prepared and sat down to eat , it had taken 45 minutes or so .
The dishwasher was full , so I washed the three pots , plate , utensils and such - taking another 15 minutes .
It does take more time .
It is just me , but I imagine if you have a hungry brood watching you that hour or so can be tough .
I thought this was a great idea by Nathan , " It would be nice to see communities and volunteers pick up Victory Gardens from years past .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_garden
It 's rather minimal effort , and could help folks ( that need it the most ) to eat healthier .
The wife and I are trying to find a suitable area in downtown Indianapolis for our effort . "
Something like that would be great for New Orleans .
Here is another reply I sort of expected to receive .
At the start of this experiment , Sam's and other big discount stores did n't accept food stamps .
Wal - Mart , ( parent company of Sam's ) has since changed its policy .
This email comes from Brenda , " thanks for getting Sam 's club to accept the EBT cards , now find a way to afford the membership fee . "
I do n't think it was necessarily us that got Sam's to change to its mind , but it is nice .
The company however has made it clear they are n't going to cave and eliminate the fee .
Only a few more days left on the diet .
I think I am going to keep eating this way for a while .
It has been quite eye opening .
Monday Feb. 23 , 2009
12:13 PM ET - Less than a week to go and I am now down to $ 16.10 .
I am pretty sure I am going to be able to cruise through the next weekend without having to purchase anything .
I made a lot of mistakes shopping and preparing meals early on .
I was convinced I would n't have enough money to make it through the month so I was very frugal the first ten days .
I skipped having some kind of meat or chicken each day .
Looking back , I do n't think I needed to do that .
That is n't to say this has been easy .
My lifestyle has always been one of eating lunch with colleagues , whether we are traveling or at home .
Evenings usually are spent picking up something prepared and at best warming it up .
I like the fact I have gotten into a routine and doing more cooking .
I think I do have an appreciation for what millions of people go through daily .
As I look at the food I have for the remaining days , I realize it is the stuff I did n't want to eat early on .
Or , as Karlena Allen said , in the story that ran on American Morning today , " odds and ends . "
Early on in this project I received a lot of emails from people saying $ 176 was actually a lot of money to live on for a month .
THOSE are people who know what hardship is .
I think a lot of us working jobs we have had for a long time , who may be tightening the belt a little , should have a great appreciation for what so many people are dealing with .
The reason I started this project , is the fact there are now 31 million people in the United States on food stamps .
That represents a big spike .
At the same time part of the recently approved stimulus package calls for increasing benefits to food stamp recipients by 13 % .
One thing that I have not had a lot of response about is the amount of fraud that goes on .
I have n't touched on that in my stories , but when I spoke with Department of Social Service ( DSS ) representatives in Louisiana they told me fraud is big problem .
It is one reason states began using the EBT card , instead of " stamps " .
The government knows where shopping is being done and what people are buying .
For example , if someone in New Orleans suddenly starts using his or her card in Shreveport ( hours north of Nola ) , state DSS workers will check to make sure everything is on the up and up .
In today 's emails , German writes in wondering how to qualify for food stamps .
You really need to check with a state agency , but the guidelines are pretty much carved in stone .
If you are at 130 % of the poverty level you qualify .
German 's story is like so many out there , saying , " I live in Rockland County , NY .
I lost my job three months ago and still searching for a new one .
I have extended my search to other states and willing to relocate , but nothing yet . "
Gigi writes in and says , " some of our local supermarkets sell hot food made daily -- most close around 7 or 8 pm .
They cannot sell the food the following day since everything is made fresh , so approximately 15 or 20 minutes before closing they put the leftover food on sale . "
Yea , it happens here in New Orleans too , or the food is donated to a food bank .
Sunday Feb. 22 , 2009
6:00 PM ET - I am entering my last week in the food stamp experiment .
I started out with $ 176 .
I am at work now and need to buy some milk , veggies and other items on the way home , so I figured that will leave me with about $ 20 until the month ends .
I went into a convenience store after running the other day and realized it was the first time in several weeks I had stepped inside one .
In times past , I thought nothing about buying a cold drink and some kind of snack , tossing three dollars on the counter and walking out with a bit of change .
This time I thought , " the three dollars is about half of what I spend every day on food right now . "
By the way , I needed toothpaste , so it did n't come out of my food stamp money .
I am making jambalaya tonight .
It will be the first time I have ever tried to make it , so it could be an adventure .
It also represents one of the many mistakes you readers have pointed out this month .
I bought a pre-packaged mix .
One thing I know if I want to save money ( and to be honest , make food taste better ) I need to avoid those prepackaged items .
In my defense , I did it in case I was sent out of town on a story , so I would be able to pack up items and eat in the hotel .
Monday , the latest installment of our stories about food stamps will air on American Morning .
I will talk about the mistakes I made , and how my food supply is dwindling as the end of February moves in .
I am also going to introduce you to the Allen's , who live just outside of Houma , Louisiana .
Jimmy
Allen works two jobs and makes about $ 500 dollars a week .
The have four children of their own , and are the legal guardians of two of Jimmy 's sister 's children .
They 've been on food stamps for years and even receiving about $ 580 dollars in food stamps each month is n't enough .
They use Angel Food Ministry .
Tune in to watch .
A lot of email over the weekend , Lana writes in and asks if I am spending more on movies , clothes , workout gear - since I am not spending a lot on food .
She says as a student , the economy makes her count every penny .
Lana writes , " I guess the most depressing thing about it is watching money in every category : food , clothing , furniture , movies , etc .
Again , thank you for doing this piece and showing everyone what it really is to struggle and still survive . "
By the way , I am not spending more on those items .
From Tennessee , Julie is critical of the notion that food stamps are supposed to be a supplement .
She says , " I read about food stamps supposed to be a ' supplemental ' program and not the only way people buy food .
That is a joke .
People who truly need food stamps are using them as the ONLY means of food purchase ( Unless they use food banks ) . "
We have heard that a lot over the past month .
And this post , from Lee Ann who says she had a high - powered job at a college .
Lee
Ann says she had enough money to put her daughter through an expensive private school , and a private college .
In her words " everything has changed . "
Lee Ann writes , " As you ( and I ) near the end of the month we have two things going for us .
Your life will once again be yours - and I have money to buy ahead , buy the sales so I can go on living on Six Bucks a Day . "
Very sobering .
I have thought a lot about what I am going to do at the end of the month .
I do n't think I will go back to spending like I did before , eating out whenever I felt like it , hitting up Whole Foods for simple things I can make .
Lee
Ann also says she went out to eat for the first time since December 2nd .
Some people have written in and asked me why I do n't take food from friends , or grab a bite when there is free food floating around .
I think since I took the maximum allowed for one person , I wanted to live this month as if I did n't have any income and so I made the pledge to just eat what I purchased .
It 's been a tremendous learning experience .
Thursday Feb. 19 , 2009
3:47 PM ET - Getting ready for the weekend .
Mardi Gras will be going full tilt in New Orleans .
The parades run every day until Fat Tuesday .
That means people lining the streets , grilling out , makeshift concession stands selling every kind of culinary treat known to the big easy .
I will watch ... at a respectable distance .
I am still doing well at not accepting items from friends , no matter how much I may want a piece of King Cake .
If you do n't know what King Cake is , now is a good time to google .
Last night I made a salad with tuna fish and had an apple and a banana .
Pretty light dinner .
I did n't get home until late and then went running so I really did n't feel like getting involved in the kitchen .
Tonight , I plan to have baked chicken , some red potatoes , and corn .
We are working on the third installment of our series .
We are planning to go to a rural community and speak with people there to see how they are faring .
It 's estimated that 65 - million Americans live in rural communities .
Given the information the government has given us , that means about six - million people in rural areas depend on food stamps to help put food on the table .
That leads me to one email question we received .
It 's a very long , very thoughtful question / statement that comes from D'edra .
She 's a social science researcher with a Master 's in Social Work who works for Rutgers University .
D'edra writes , " While I believe your primary endpoint to be essential , I am quite disappointed in the stereotypic images that have been portrayed in both of your video segments . "
She points out we selected an urban area with a large African American population to do our story .
I have written about this before and I hear what D'edra is saying .
I live in New Orleans , this is where we had planned to do the story all along .
I reached out to a state representative Juan LaFonta , former head of the state black caucus and a gentleman I have done a number of stories with .
I was trying to find someone to take me shopping who had lived on food stamps .
It was n't easy .
As Juan said to me , " Sean , this might be a news flash for you but people on welfare do n't like to talk about it . "
That is how we found Arkesha , who took me shopping .
By the way , it was noted in the story , she has n't been on food stamps for several months now .
We then went to a food bank and Dynel wanted to talk to us .
We are trying to show a slice of life in Louisiana .
We are working to be fair to everyone AND sensitive to the fact a lot of people do n't want to have their picture taken or talk about this issue .
D'edra also points out Hurricane Katrina may have led to a lot of people in Louisiana needing federal assistance for food stamps .
True , this area has n't rebounded from Katrina , but it 's actually Hurricane Gustav that caused somewhat of a spike in the number of people needing foodstamps .
But , in talking to state DSS workers , the sluggishness of the economy and job loss are really forcing a lot of people who never thought they would need assistance to turn to the government .
D'edra included her phone number and we had a nice discussion about this issue .
Her points were all good and the kind of questions I am sure a lot of people out there have been wondering .
I also got an email from someone asking how much I am spending on sugar , salt , condiments and such .
I have n't used any sugar .
I have just skipped using ketchup and what not .
I am using the salt that I have had around my house since I moved to Nola .
Again , I am down to less than $ 34 .
But I feel good about things .
I have a lot of food and think I will be ok .
I made a lot of mistakes , again , I will be talking about those in the next segment that will air on American Morning this Monday .
Went running last night and had a bit more energy .
I am going to chalk up Tuesday 's sluggishness to the fact I am old and was tired .
Wednesday Feb. 18 , 2009
2:54 PM ET - Last night I went running and I had absolutely no energy .
When I finished , I wondered if it was my diet .
I did n't eat much at all on Sunday and Monday so I tried to get more protein .
I had chicken and peanut butter and I am hopeful the run goes a bit better .
Who knows .
It could be because I am getting older every day .
I was talking on the phone with a friend of mine just before running and she said I sounded exhausted .
I had an easy day at work so this is really the first time I wondered if it was a lack of calories or bad dietary decisions on my part that led to the rundown feeling .
I will find out more tonight .
Looking at this month long project like a marathon , I would say I am hitting the wall .
10 more days to go .
We are working on a couple of stories right now .
One will air this coming Monday on CNN's American Morning .
We have gotten a lot of emails about Angel Food Ministries , a non-profit that delivers 100 - million dollars worth of food to the needy every year .
Well , it seems the FBI searched the Ministry office in Georgia last week .
The FBI wo n't tell us why or what they were looking for .
A spokesman for the Angel Food Ministries says the FBI was investigating an individual with ties to the ministry and maintains the non-profit entity is rock solid .
AFM provides a box of food it sells through churches for $ 30 dollars each .
Those boxes , Angel Food says , have enough food to last a family for a week .
We will keep you updated on AFM .
I now have $ 33.96 left from the $ 176 I started the month with .
I went shopping last night and really stocked up .
Once again , I pull out the line a reader sent in ... " the freezer is your friend . "
I have a lot of chicken , lean ground beef , apples , juice , lettuce , and of course pasta , rice , and beans .
I think I am doing very well in terms of getting through the month .
Some people have said there is a big difference buying food for 28 days , as in February , as opposed to the 31 days in other months .
Point taken .
Now some emails .
Amy from Rochester has this sobering message for people out there worried about the economy .
She says , " With the focus on the middle class , and it needs to be for now , the poor are overlooked and forgotten .
The thing is , from middle class the next stop down is poverty so people had better wake up and have some human compassion in our nation .
Again I applaud you , and soup and beans are a large part of my diet and you seem to be doing a fine job for a novice . "
Yes , I am a novice and I made some mistakes the first go round when I was shopping .
Kelly writes in and says she and her husband have jobs and are very thankful for what they have .
But , she says the series has made her look at shopping in a different light .
Kelly says , " listening to how you 've been able to manage on $ 176 / month is very enlightening .
I 'm a lot more cognizant of food waste , watch the newspaper inserts every week , use coupons as much as possible . "
Marg also weighs in on the fact that a lot of lower income folks do n't have transportation so they are forced to buy whatever they can at convenient stores .
She says , " I 'm guessing a can of Chef Boyardee could be upwards of three bucks at your local Wawa or 7/11 .
That 'll shoot the budget in no time .
Nutrition is secondary if you 're trying to fill your tummy - think trans fats , high sodium levels , empty calories , etc . "
Some have been writing in , asking what I miss the most in terms of food and beverage and what do I look forward to once this over .
I have thought a lot about that , and will tell you more in the coming days .

2:05 PM ET - I 'm back in New Orleans , looking over my food stock .
Things are going well .
I have a lot of canned vegetables , pasta , jambalaya mix , a couple of large chicken breasts and half a pound of lean ground beef .
For breakfast , I had cereal and some tea .
Lunch is one of the pre-packaged food items that I bought .
I did n't spend a lot on it , it is n't very filling and if I had to do it over , I probably would n't invest the $ 2 or so in it again .
I have $ 68 left .
I think that is plenty of cash .
There have been a few inquiries from people wondering how I am doing on weekends and asking if I am accepting food when it is offered to me .
On the weekends , I eat pretty much just like Monday through Friday .
I try to get a somewhat filling breakfast , a light lunch , then eat pasta , rice and some chicken or other meat for dinner .
I usually run at night , so that is when I find I am most hungry .
I have n't taken any offers of food so far and I have been offered a lot .
Well , I take that back , I took my son to the movies last week and I did reach into his bag of popcorn three times or so .
It is brutal to sit next to someone at a theater for two hours and have them snacking , sipping sodas and not think about eating .
New Orleans is in Mardi Gras fever right now .
A week from today marks Fat Tuesday , which will mean something totally different to me this year .
Believe me , it is n't hard to find people handing out drinks and food this time of year but I have resisted temptation .
I will write more about that over the weekend .
We will probably be shooting some Mardi Gras elements , so my self - restraint will be severely tested .
One thing people receiving government assistance for food should watch today is the signing of the stimulus package bill into law .
It will mean billions and billions of dollars will be funneled into the food stamp program , raising allotments people receive by 13 - percent .
The argument is that it will help farmers , producers , wholesalers and grocery stores keep employment where it is at and offer much needed assistance to people struggling to put food on the table .
Now for some emails .
Sue writes in from South Bend , Indiana saying , " I just want to thank you for reminding me how fortunate I am .
I had been taking my blessings for granted .
I read your blog every few days and have actually become more conscious of my food spending and more importantly food waste . "
I am right there with you .
I am curious what this is going to be like for me once this project ends .
I can't watch people walk in and out of Whole Foods without doing quick arithmetic in my head , " let 's see broiled chicken , bread , energy drink , salad , oh , he 's easily dropped $ 24 . "
Jodie suggests a new twist to my diet . " ... I thought I might recommend tofu .
Tofu is the cheapest form of protein per pound .
It is also very versatile , so you can make it taste like anything . "
Esther says she was skeptical of this program at first .
She writes she 's read up on a few other people who have entered a similar project .
Esther says , " the worst one was a lady who bought salmon filets for her family on week three because her kids had been so deprived , but then complained about not having enough money left for the rest of the month . "
Like I have said before , I think I can get through this month and have money left over .
However , if it went on and on I seriously do n't know how I would cope .
I miss a lot of things and will write more about that in the final week .
Michele writes in with a different take on people who say they could easily live on $ 176 a month .
She says , " I think if you grow up in a family that has for generations struggled financially , you just learn how to make the money stretch .
For myself and my husband , $ 176 would be huge and we could live REALLY well off that much .
We now eat much better than we both did growing up . "
Monday Feb. 16 , 2009
1:46 PM ET - I 'm entering the third week of this food stamp project and my budget is holding up pretty well .
I 'm still running , maybe not as much , but that has more to do with the weather than my energy or my desire to get out and exercise .
I was on vacation and stopped by CNN's Atlanta headquarters on my way back to New Orleans .
I got the usual questions , " Are you sticking to the diet ? "
" How do you feel ? " " Are you gaining weight ? "
" Are you losing weight ? "
It 's odd that this one month experiment has gone ok and really once you get into a groove , things seem to go relatively well .
By that , I do n't miss things now as much as I did early in the month .
Secondly , I have grown used to eating a certain portion of food at certain times of the day .
BUT , I am only doing this for one month .
There are times it hits me , and I think , " I do n't know if I could do this for six months , a year , or longer .
I am still getting a lot of responses from people via email .
I find it interesting the number of people who tell me that $ 176 for the month is actually plenty of money to buy food for one person .
I would n't want to spend month after month doing this .
In my mind , as I eat , I am always thinking about what else I have in the fridge , or in the cupboard .
I have 70 or so dollars left .
But , wait , before you say the month is only half over I still have a lot of food on hand .
People have asked if is there a place people can receive education or diet plans as they prepare to go on food stamps .
Simple answer is yes .
The USDA , which oversees the food stamp program , has a site " Eat Right When Money 's Tight "
If you wonder if you qualify for food stamps , here is a link .
The way it was explained to me , if your income is 130 - percent of the poverty level or below , you qualify .
Here are some emails I 've received in response to the project ..
Stacee says in the summer you do n't have to buy all your groceries .
She recommends buying some seeds and trying to grow vegetables .
Great idea , if you have a yard and some time to work there .
Also ,
Cathy writes in recently asking why I wrote that it stinks going to bed early .
That was somewhat of an overstatement .
Usually I have plenty to eat .
I just did n't buy a lot of snack items .
Cathy points out there are plenty of cheap snacks .
I could also have some oatmeal or cereal .
Good point .
The shame factor .
Zach writes in saying he was working as an intern with urban youth and their families .
He wound up on food stamps and said when he went to the store he " did n't want to look at anybody in the eye . "
Zach said , " I would have rather let myself starve .
Friday Feb 13 , 2009
8:20 AM ET - Friday the 13th .
Not a bad day to discuss the issue of temptation .
People who know me often ask , " are you really trying to live on food stamp money for a month ? "
The second question they ask , " are you ever tempted to sneak something ? "
Simple answer is absolutely .
Firstly , I am not a small guy .
6 '3 " and recently 222 pounds .
So , three meals a day is enough to live on but quite frequently I am hungry .
Also , I have made no secret of the fact I like to snack and I like a diet coke .
In the spirit of trying to understand what it is like for first - timers on food stamps , I have stuck to my guns and really lived this well .
The first few days were tough .
I think out of sympathy the CNN photographer who works with me in New Orleans , Ken Tillis , decided he was going to live his month eating only the food left in his house .
No shopping .
No snacking .
Traveling makes it hard .
I have been in New Jersey with my son this week and while my son eats what he would normally eat , I am living on what I brought up and the $ 30 worth of food I bought when I got here .
Good news is I will be taking stuff home .
I am not trying to make this sound easy ; it is n't .
And it stinks being hungry when you go to sleep .
One thing I want to re-visit .
I did not actually get an EBT card , or food stamps .
That would be fraud .
I went to DSS in Louisiana , and officials there figured out the maximum amount I would qualify for was $ 176 .
So , I got a gift card and have been living off of that .
That was for Abby , whose boss wants to know how a reporter gets food stamps .
In other e-mails , Bobbi an Extension Agent in South Dakota writes in saying yes it's true that food stamps are supposed to just be a supplement .
However , she says a lot of people she deals with , " .. are relying 100 % on SNAP for food ( SNAP is government name for food stamps . )
Bobbi says there are a lot more of her neighbors in the Midwest who would qualify for assistance , but " ... refuse to apply for pride . "
Pat writes in saying income and putting food on the table is n't a concern right now but says " kudos " for the stories and the blog .
Pat says , " Your blog has opened my eyes about how wasteful I am in general and with food specifically . "
Pat also is concerned about potential loss of community and writes " I spent an entire day with women from my son - in - law 's side of the family , a family of Mexican descent .
We made over 2,000 tamales .
It took all day but we had fun . "
And Pat says it 's enough to fill the freezer for some time .
Briana has some information for people critical of where and how people using food stamps shop at times .
She points out some people living in " ... poor urban centers like ( parts ) of Chicago live in so - called ' food deserts . ' "
Meaning there are no large grocery stores in a convenient distance so sometimes people shop where they must .
Early on I told you about Dennis who felt inspired to attempt to live on $ 176 after our story started .
Dennis was over in week one , but now back on track .
And , like me , he says his diet is carb heavy .
Dennis says he burns off calories playing basketball two or three times a week .
Keep it up and keep me informed .
Thursday Feb. 12 , 2009
2:21 PM ET -
For days now , we have been getting emails from people who tell us that some of the big discount stores do n't honor food stamps , SNAP , EBT .
My producer , Jason Morris , called Wal - Mart headquarters the parent company of Sam's Club to find out if this was true .
He just heard back from Wal - Mart and we have some good news .
Sam's Club is going to roll out a nationwide operation by mid-March and will start accepting food stamps .
Their press release states , " As a service to our members during the current economic environment , we have recently started accepting government issued EBT cards for the purchase of products within our clubs in select locations . "
It goes on to say it 's their intention to accept the EBT cards nationwide very soon .
All I can say is ... it 's about time .
People still have to cough up $ 40 for the Sam's Club membership card .
We have calls into other large discount stores , still waiting to hear back .
For the life of me I cannot understand why a store would not accept the EBT card .
But , I applaud Wal - Mart for stepping up to the plate and doing this .
Maybe go one step further guys , if people are on food stamps , why not give them free membership for a year -- a little kindness could go a long way in this environment .
Just a thought .
I received an email from a social worker , who works with low - income single parents .
She 's glad the stories started airing on American Morning and follows the blog .
Beth writes , " your blog has done a stellar job of bringing light to the issue surrounding poverty and hunger .
You have touched on the social taboos , the challenges , and the logistic of living on food stamps . "
I got this response from d.
" I just find it ridiculous that for $ 176 for yourself , you 're essentially living off peanut butter sandwiches and mac and cheese .
I feel like anyone with some basic cooking skills ( or internet connection to a few good recipe sites ) can easily eat better . "
Come on dude .
I have n't eaten peanut butter or mac and cheese in a week .
And this one from Paul , a psychology professor at Clemson who writes , " I discussed your experiment with my colleagues in the Psych dept .
at Clemson , my students , even my personal trainer -- none have thought they could would be able to eat an entire month on your budget . "
He says , " it 's amazing that a group of highly - educated people would n't be able to do what millions of Americans must -- thanks for raising the issue . "
Paul , you guys could do it .
Trust me .
When this is over I should come up to Tiger country and chat with you guys .
I am getting emails asking how I am feeling .
I feel fine , plenty of energy , sleep well .
And wow , I am getting slammed about diet coke .
I have more than two weeks to go , I will deal with diet coke on March 1 .

Is your software budget pipeline filled with rust ?
Do your customers , vendors and friends have to save their files in a different file format so you can open them ?
If your software cabinet looks like it would be a better fit in a software museum , there is hope  hope in free software .
There are free software alternatives to most of the commercial ones that you use , and they 're compatible with their commercial counterparts .
Still using Microsoft Office 97 because you can't justify an upgrade ?
Check out the free alternatives to that and other commercial software .
These free alternatives cover the gamut of desktop and server software from word processing to graphics to high - end web application services .
There 's no need to dip into your life 's savings to equip your business with high - quality software .
Office Suite
A typical office suite consists of a word processor , a spreadsheet , a database system , a presentation program and some miscellaneous other utilities .
OpenOffice.org ( OO.o ) is a full office software suite and is compatible with Microsoft Office through version 2003 .
The 2007 suite formats are still not compatible , but Office 2007 users have the option to save in " compatibility " mode ( Office 97-2003 ) for those that do n't have the latest version .
OpenOffice.org is as compatible with Office 2007 as any other non-2007 versioned products .
OpenOffice.org 's familiar interface perfectly suits those who've worked with Microsoft Office .
It has all the familiar menu choices , icons , fonts , shortcuts and formatting options .
If you 're productive with Microsoft 's Office products , you 'll feel right at home with OO.o .
Internet Browser
The most used of all desktop applications is the Internet or web browser .
Internet Explorer is the default choice on all Windows operating systems but you do have a choice  although Internet Explorer is free and not necessarily a bad Internet browser .
If you use Windows , Firefox , Opera and Google Chrome are not your only options .
You have at least 10 browsers from which to choose .
Linux users , by default , have Firefox and Konqueror .
Most of the other browsers listed above are also available for Linux and Mac OS X .
Server systems , Windows or Linux , rarely need Internet browsers since direct downloads to those systems present security risks .
Software delivery to server systems should be handled by some other method , such as a network file share or software distribution system .
E-mail
Perhaps the second most used computer program is the e-mail client  the software that allows you to download , read and send e-mail .
For many users , web browsing and e-mail are the Internet .
If you use Microsoft Office , you know about Outlook and Outlook Express as e-mail clients , but there 's still hope for those who wish to use something different .
You have choices .
Evolution ( Windows version - Linux ships with Evolution by default ) , now maintained by Novell , is an e-mail client compatible with Microsoft Exchange Server , Novell 's GroupWise and all standard Internet e-mail formats ( i.e. , SMTP , IMAP and POP3 ) .
Evolution provides Microsoft Outlook users with a comfortable replacement for the heavier and more accident - prone Outlook .
Mozilla 's Thunderbird is an excellent substitute for Outlook Express but with added features and benefits such as anti-phishing , calendaring and anti-spam filters .
Accounting
Accounting software is a major pain point for those who wish to switch to free alternatives .
Certain commercially available software programs are so good that even well - written , free competitors pale in comparison .
Intuit 's Quickbooks is one such commercial program that 's hard to beat for usability , support and widespread adoption .
However , there are some contenders that deserve consideration .
Nola Pro is such an option available for Windows and Linux .
Nola
Pro is multi-user , web - based , easy to install and use and is secure .
There 's also an online version that requires no installation ( Nola Pro On - Demand ) and is available for a monthly fee .
GnuCash is another free accounting program for business or personal use that is a replacement for Microsoft Money , QuickBooks and Microsoft 's Office Accounting Express .
If Nola Pro or GnuCash do n't fill your needs , FreeByte compiled a list of free financial and accounting software for you to check out for yourself .
Server Software
Everyone knows about the Apache web server  the web server that serves more of the world 's web sites than any other free or commercial web server .
You might not know about two other Apache - related projects built to make life easier on your wallet : Tomcat and Geronimo .
Tomcat is a java servlet using java server pages ( JSP ) .
It is the reigning standard for JSP delivery .
Geronimo is a web application framework comparable to commercial the offerings of BEA 's WebLogic and IBM's WebSphere .
If you need an enterprise - level database without the enterprise - level price tag , you must investigate MySQL ( now owned by Oracle ) and PostgreSQL .
Both of these very capable database systems have passionate followings , thus making it difficult to recommend one over the other without rekindling all - out war between the two factions .
Be sure to choose between them based on your needs and their features not individual opinions .
If you 're looking to replace your Microsoft Exchange Server with something a little less pricey and a lot less dicey , do n't get your hopes up  not just yet at least .
There is one promising project to duplicate the functionality of Exchange in a free , open source product called OpenChange that might be available for public use and business adoption in early 2010 .
To successfully replace commercial software with comparable free or open source versions , you 'll have to determine which features are most important to you and which ones you can comfortably live without .
Often the barriers to open source development are proprietary and patented protocols and programming .
Therefore , some of the " nice - to - have " features of your current commercial software will never appear in their open source counterparts .

NEW DELHI — Defying all the conventional wisdom about Indian television viewers — notorious for dogged allegiance to campy soap operas that pitted idealized brides against scheming mothers - in - law — the hottest show on TV today is a progressive , heartwarming drama about a plucky little girl caught up in an illegal child marriage .
Called Balika Vadhu , or “ Child Bride , ” and set in rural Rajasthan , where marrying off daughters before they hit puberty is still a common practice , the show has caught the imagination of urban viewers across the board and throughout India , ushering in a revolution of sorts in cable television programming .
It has helped Colors , an upstart channel launched by Viacom and Network18 in July last year , supplant Rupert Murdoch 's Star Plus as the most - watched Indian television network — a title Star Plus held for nine years running .
And it has unleashed a new wave of progressive programming devoted to issues facing India 's “ distressed daughters . ”
“ What started out as a 0.8 rating on Balika took us about 13 weeks to get to 8 , ” said Rajesh Kamat , Colors ' chief executive officer .
That means 8 percent of the entire television audience is watching the show .
“ Typically an episode that peaks for us would touch about 17 million people , ” Kamat said .
“ If you were to take a monthly average , it would be in the 72 million zone . ”
Development workers are pleased , but skeptical about the impact such shows can have from a cable television platform that does n't reach the poor people depicted on screen .
“ In the rural population very few people are watching this kind of serial , ” said Sharmistha Basu , a consultant at New Delhi's International Center for Research on Women .
“ Hardly any people have a television set , and especially not a channel like Colors that comes only on cable or dish TV .
But in the rural - urban transition zone , people are watching it , and it is starting a dialogue about child marriage .
If migrant laborers from rural areas are coming to work in these areas , they can take back those words to their villages . ”
This is n't the first time Indian television has flirted with shows about serious issues .
In 2005 , USAID helped fund a family drama that focused on the still - pervasive problem of aborting female fetuses to try for sons .
Before that the BBC World Service Trust teamed up with Doordarshan , India 's state - owned , free - to - air television channel , to create a detective series that raised awareness about HIV / AIDS .
But this is the first time such shows are being launched for profit , and the first time that they are striking a chord with such a wide swath of cable viewers who are n't captive to state - owned television .
And it marks a huge change .
For nearly a decade , India 's lucrative cable market was dominated by a single soap opera — " Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi " ( " Because a mother - in - law was once a daughter - in - law , too " ) — and a host of imitators .
Dressed in glam saris and sparkling with jewelry , the women of these shows plotted and schemed , remade themselves through cosmetic surgery and returned from the dead , all the while promoting the regressive message that women's only source of value and power came through marriage and childbirth .
“ Normally we said it was very regressive , and at one level it was , because it was always in a joint family setup where the women never did anything except fight with each other , and were bound by tradition , ” said Shailaja Bajpai , longtime television critic for the Indian Express newspaper .
Because as much as 50 percent of the television audience comprises women , programming can potentially play an important role in inspiring new thinking about the way daughters — and unborn girls — should be treated .
For example , though child marriage is illegal and the average age at which marriages take place is rising in India , its rural backwaters still account for almost half of the world 's prepubescent brides , according to UNICEF .
Apart from taking away their childhoods , these unions also frequently take away their lives , as UNICEF calculates girls between 15 and 19 are twice as likely to die from pregnancy - related complications as women between 20 and 24 — a fact that may contribute to India 's high maternal and neonatal mortality rates .
Girls who give birth before the age of 15 are also five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their 20s .
“ There is a legal measure here and our government is also trying to do a lot of incentive schemes for delaying marriage , ” Basu said .
“ But the main problem is the internalization of these values by the people . ”
In villages , she says , people believe marrying their daughters off before they hit puberty is the only way to be sure they go to their weddings as virgins — which is essential to the family honor .
“ The government is not able to crack this norm . ”
Only time will tell if television can achieve what the government can't .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - From legalizing marijuana and then taxing it , to increasing death certificate fees and charging gentlemen ’s club patrons an extra $ 5 at the door , cash - strapped U.S. states and cities are rooting around for revenue in some unconventional places .

But even those able to scrounge up funds from untapped sources will likely still need federal help or traditional tax increases to recover from a 17 - month recession that has dried up revenue , drained spending capabilities and nearly obliterated the usual last resort of borrowing .
Sin seems most ripe for the taxing in a list of proposed revenue moves compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures last month .
A California state legislator has proposed making marijuana legal and then charging a $ 50 - per- ounce tax on it , along with the state ’s sales tax .
Oregon has considered levying a $ 98 - per- ounce duty on its legal medical marijuana .
Pornography , too , may have to shoulder part of the financial burden of some states .
California lawmakers have proposed increasing sales taxes on sexually explicit content , while Virginia will soon start taxing hotel movie rentals .
Connecticut may reduce the commissions to those who sell lottery tickets and New Jersey could take unclaimed slot machine winnings .
Georgia lawmakers call the $ 5 fee they could charge customers at erotic dancer bars a “ pole tax . ”
“ Many of these kinds of things that they do at the state level raise modest levels of money , ” said Donald Boyd , senior fellow at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government .
“ They want to avoid raising the marquee taxes . ”
Citizens may revolt against income tax increases he said , and not notice smaller fees inching up .
Also , when state governments ultimately raise the larger taxes , they can say they have done so only after tapping all other alternatives .
During the 2001 recession , many wanted to leave income and sales taxes untouched and “ they had a ready source that time , which was tobacco taxes , ” said Boyd , who has also served as director of tax policy and revenue analysis for the state of New York budget office , adding :
“ I do n’t think there ’s a counterpart this time around . ”
CITIES ALSO SEEK HELP
Cities are looking at everyday life for revenues .
Providence , Rhode Island , for example , wants to charge the private colleges in the city , namely Brown University , a “ student - impact fee ” of $ 150 per student per semester .
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has proposed a five - cent fee on plastic shopping bags -- a move that would raise an estimated $ 100 million a year , according to a recent study of big city budgets by The Pew Charitable Trusts ’ Philadelphia Research Initiative .
That comes after the city considered levying an extra tax on sodas .
Washington , D.C. will also tax bags , but the revenue is earmarked for ending river pollution .
The city council recently passed a budget that includes attaching cameras to street sweepers to ticket errant parked cars in the hope of collecting nearly $ 7 million .
The district ’s Chief Financial Officer recently told the U.S. Congress it should be allowed to tax federal buildings and is calling for the law barring local buildings from being taller than the Capitol to be lifted in hopes of garnering more real estate taxes .
But residents may not be on board for new fees , said Larry Eichel , project director for the Pew ’s initiative .
“ There tends to be more resistance to having a new fee than to raising an old fee , ” he said , adding that cities often must receive approval for taxes from their states and states may not be eager to give cities new revenue - raising powers when they are having their own fiscal problems .
Even with unconventional revenue methods in the works , many states are relying on tried and true tax increases along with drastic spending cuts to keep their budgets balanced .
The nonpartisan think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that 19 states have cut public health programs for low - income children and families , and at least 21 are cutting programs for the elderly .
Nearly half of the states in the union are also cutting education .
At least 16 states have raised income , business , sales and excise taxes already in 2009 , and another 15 are weighing taking the same step .

Boston 's 2004 title was a defining moment in the lives of many New Englanders .
Dateline : May 7 , 2014
My son and I have flown from California to spend the week in Boston .
He is a little more than 6 ½ at this point .
He has never set foot in Fenway Park .
The time is right .
He likes baseball .
He likes the Red Sox .
He 's a little sports encyclopedia .
I have brainwashed him .
He is just old enough to understand the significance of his first Fenway game and , more importantly , old enough that he 'll be able to remember the experience decades later .

Enlarge Harry How / Getty Images Manny Ramirez was the best right - handed hitter of his generation .
But now , we 're not sure what that means .
We bring my father with us .
Three generations of the Simmons family taking in a Yankees - Red Sox game for the first time .
This should be a wonderful moment .
A signature moment , even .
We find our $ 1,500 seats in the lower boxes near third base .
We are sitting in Best Buy 's Section 61 , which is right between Bob 's Discount Furniture 's Section 60 and Costco 's Section 62 .
Every section has a sponsor now .
The Green Monster is now called " The Pepsi Green Monster " and has a big Pepsi can painted on it .
Ted Williams ' special seat in right field is now sponsored by Muscle Milk .
Even home plate is sponsored by Dunkin ' Donuts .
Has the logo on it and everything .
That 's just the way sports work now .
We settle into our seats .
I point toward the championship banners over the first - base side .
They go in order : 1903 , 1904 , 1912 , 1915 , 1916 , 1918 , 2004 , 2007 .
Ever since Boston won the World Series 10 years ago , I always imagined pointing to that 2004 banner and telling my little boy , " That 's the team that changed everything . "
So that 's what I do .
I point at the banner and tell him , " That 's the team that changed everything . "
" Is n't that the team that cheated ? " he asks .
My father and I glance at each other .
A few beats pass .
" Well , technically , no , " I stammer .
" I mean ... "
" I thought they had a whole bunch of steroids guys on that team , " he says .
" Well , there have been some accusations , and yeah , some of the power numbers were a little suspicious , but ... "
" I 'd do it again ! " my dad yells happily .
" Dad ! "
I shake my head at him .
He shrugs .
The thing is , he WOULD do it again .
He wanted to see the Red Sox win the World Series in his lifetime .
He worried about it constantly .
So did I .
So did every Red Sox fan .
We worried about living a full life , then dying , without ever seeing them win .
All of us knew people who fit in that category .
None of us wanted to end up in there .
All of us would have made a deal with the devil at the time .
And maybe we did .
We just did n't know it .
" Nothing was ever really proved , " I tell my son , trying to keep up the good fight .
He ignores me and starts rattling through our 2004 lineup with creepy precision .
He points out Nomar Garciaparra 's remarkable 1999 and 2000 seasons , his subsequent tendon injuries and how his career played out so blandly afterward for reasons that remain unclear .
My dad points out the Sox traded Nomar midway through the 2004 season .
Technically , that debate should n't even matter .
Score one for Dad .
" But what about Trot Nixon and Bill Mueller ? " my son says .
" They missed a bunch of games every year with injuries , put on weight when they were skinny guys , peaked quickly and were never seen again .
Same for Mark Bellhorn , right ?
That 's suspicious . "
" Well , " I say , " their names never came up in anything , so that 's not really fair ... "
" And Kevin Millar , he had a few big homer years , then his power numbers went way down once the testing started . "
" That 's true , but it does n't prove anything ... "
" And Johnny Damon , he got bigger and started hitting for more power even though he was a singles hitter , right ? "
" Well ... "

The events of that magical fall of 2004 are now in question .
" And what about Big Papi ? " he wonders .
" Played for Minnesota , did n't hit for power , came to the Red Sox , turned into the best slugger in the league , and as soon as they cracked down on steroids , he stopped hitting homers again .
And he was friends with all the other Dominican players who were linked to performance - enhancing drugs .
What about him ? "
Silence .
Nobody says anything .
Finally , my dad steps in : " He had an inside - outside swing at Minnesota , when he came to Boston , we encouraged him to pull the ball , so ... "
" Come on , Gramps ! " my son says .
" That 's dumb , and you know it . "
We glance out to the field .
Big Papi is one of Boston 's coaches now .
After he hit 54 homers in 2006 , his career was over within four years .
Now he 's just a fat guy in his early 40s coaching first base .
You would never guess this is the same guy who carried us in 2004 , the guy who fueled the Greatest Comeback Ever , the guy who helped convince an entire fan base that , yes , we could believe .
" And what about Manny ? " my son asks .
" He tested positive for performance enhancers in 2009 with the Dodgers .
How do you know he was n't using that whole time ? "
" Well , we do n't , " I say .
" But that was kind of a fluke -- he had a doctor in Florida who prescribed him a banned substance , and ... "
" Come on , Dad , I read your Red Sox book .
You said that at least you knew Manny could n't have ever used steroids because he was too dumb to figure out how to stick to a cycle .
Then he tested positive .
You were , like , his biggest fan .
You wrote a big piece after he got traded that was so long , it took me a week to read it . "
" I told him not to write that column , " my dad says .
" Manny needed to go .
He was a selfish jerk .
Your father had blinders on ... "
" Come on , that 's not fair , " I say .
" I loved the guy .
He was on the team for more than eight years .
He helped us end the curse .
He made our lives as Red Sox fans more fun .
He was like family .
I was n't gonna dump the guy from my life after everything he did just because his agent poisoned him against the team . "
" But you defended him and said he was a good guy at heart , " my son says .
" And then he cheated , right ?
So how does that make him a good guy ? "
I take a deep breath .
" It does n't make him a good guy , " I say .
" You do n't understand what it was like to follow baseball before you were born .
There was a strike in 1994 , and the World Series was canceled .
Everyone hated baseball .
Then Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa started hitting homers , and the balls started flying out of the park , and it was so much fun that everyone looked the other way .
We did n't care that these guys were practically busting out of their skin or growing second foreheads .
We really did n't .
All the cheating made baseball more fun to watch .
We were in denial .
It was weird .
" Then , Barry Bonds hit 73 home runs in a season , and that was like the turning point .
We realized that things had gone too far .
We blamed him for cheating and looked the other way with dozens of other guys who might have been doing the same thing .
Brady Anderson hit 50 homers in 1996 ; we did n't care .
Bret Boone had 141 RBIs in a season ; we did n't care .
Big Papi went from 10 homers to 41 in four seasons ; we did n't care .
Roger Clemens was washed up , but suddenly he could throw 98 miles per hour and win Cy Youngs again ; we did n't care .
Eric Gagne saved 84 straight games and threw 120 miles an hour ; we did n't care .
Good players started blowing out tendons nobody had ever heard of ; we did n't care .
Pitchers blew out elbow tendons and shoulder ligaments routinely ; we did n't care .
This was the deal .
They cheated ; we pretended they did n't .
It 's really hard to explain unless you were there . "
My son tries to soak everything in .
That 's lot to process for a 6 - year - old .
Finally ...
" So when the Red Sox won in 2004 , did you know some of the guys might have been cheating ? " he asks .
" At the time ? " I answer .
" No . Either we were in total denial , or we just did n't care . "
" I 'd do it again ! " my dad yells happily , getting another withering glare from me .
" You have to understand , " I say .
" EVERYONE cheated back then .
You know how I drive 80 on the highway even though all the signs say to go 55 ?
That 's how everyone thought back then -- the signs said one thing , but everyone did the other .
There were so many people cheating that , competitively , you almost had to cheat to keep up with everyone else . "
" So why did n't the people in charge get everyone to stop cheating ? " my son asks .
" I wish I knew .
The players ' union did n't care , the commissioner 's office did n't care , nobody cared .
Until it was too late . "
" So you won the World Series twice because of Manny and Papi , " my son says , " but they might have been cheating the whole time , and so were some of their teammates ?
Dad , your whole book was about how you could die in peace because they won in 2004 .
If they cheated to win , does that make what happened OK ? "
The question hangs in the air .
And hangs .
And hangs .
" I do n't know , " I finally answer .
" I still have n't figured that part out .
Again , you do n't understand what it was like .
Everyone was cheating , so the playing field was kind of even , as weird as that sounds .
You can't imagine how depressing it was to be a Red Sox fan at the time .
Things always went wrong .
We had n't won in 86 years .
We were the whipping boy of the Yankees .
We always expected the worst to happen , mainly because the worst always did happen .
That 2004 title made life easier for everyone .
We could just follow the team without all the other negative crap .
Does that make sense ? "
" I guess , " he says , nodding .
" But Manny was your favorite hitter on that team .
And he tested positive later .
Is he still your favorite hitter ? "
" Yes and no , " I say .
" No , because he cheated .
Yes , because whether he was cheating or not , I can't forget watching him hit baseballs on a daily basis .
I just can't .
You should have seen him .
Perfect swing , perfect balance , perfect everything .
He was a hitting savant .
That 's the funny thing -- he did n't NEED to cheat .
The guy was put on the earth to hit .
" But he did cheat , " my son says .
" He did .
Yes .
He did . "
" So he 's not your favorite player from that team now ? "
" He never was ; Pedro Martinez was .
Manny was my favorite hitter .
I loved Pedro the most . "
I am dreading the next question .
I am dreading it .
I do not want him to ask it .
I know it 's coming .
" Did Pedro cheat ? "
Silence .
I take a deep breath .
So does my father .
You can't describe in a few tidy sentences , off the cuff , what it was like to watch Pedro Martinez pitch in 1999 and 2000 .
To paraphrase Joe Mantegna in " Searching for Bobby Fischer , " Pedro was better at pitching than you or I will ever be at anything .
He had swagger .
He had four A - plus pitches .
He had everything .
He spurred me to buy tickets from scalpers when I was broke .
I would do it again .
I watched Pedro Martinez pitch at his apex at Fenway Park .
I get to brag about this when I 'm old .
He 's the one guy who did n't cheat .
He definitely did n't cheat .
I bet anything , the man did not cheat .
Do I say this to my son ?
No .
He would n't believe me .
" I looked at Pedro 's numbers , " my son says .
" He peaked for like three years right as the steroids era was going , then he battled injuries and never did as well .
Fits the profile , right ? "
" Nah , I do n't see it , " my father says .
" He was skinnier than you are .
Steroids make you bulk up .
Pedro was like a buck - sixty soaking wet . "
" I do n't see it , either , " I say .
" I do n't think he did . "
" But you do n't know ? " my son asks me .
" Honestly ?
I do n't know anything anymore . "
We look at the 2004 banner again .
I always thought that , for the rest of my life , I would look at that banner and think only good thoughts .
Now , there 's a mental asterisk that wo n't go away .
I wish I could take a pill to shake it from my brain .
I see 2004 and 2007 , and think of Manny and Papi first and foremost .
The modern - day Ruth and Gehrig .
One of the great one - two punches in sports history .
Were they cheating the whole time ?
Was Pedro cheating , too ?
That 2004 banner makes me think of these things now .
I wish it did n't , but it does .
This makes me sad .
This makes me profoundly sad .
My son can read it in my face .
I am sad .
He can see it .
" That 's OK , Dad , " he says , rubbing my shoulder .
" Everyone cheated back then . "

FOR those who believe that climate change is a serious problem , the decisions that America makes now are of momentous importance .
In Copenhagen in December , the world will decide whether to reinvigorate or abandon its effort to avert serious climate change , and what America does between now and then will in large part determine the outcome .
So the fact that Barack Obama clearly intends to turn America from being a laggard into a leader in this task is therefore encouraging .
Good intentions , however , are not enough .
Moves in Washington over the past week have indicated the shape of America 's policy .
And although impressively far - sighted by the standards of the Bush era , it looks disappointing when measured alongside what is probably needed to insure against the real - though - hard - to - quantify threat of serious climate change .
A price that pinches
“ Oil lost and coal won , ” was an insider 's verdict on the two big developments in Washington this week ( see article ) .
The oil industry got hit by the administration 's decision to tighten vehicle fuel - efficiency standards .
Though hardly punishing by international measures — China has already adopted similar targets — the new rules will at least bring America within hailing distance of Europe 's fuel - efficiency standards .
If America insists on using fuel - efficiency standards to cut vehicle emissions , then tough ones are better than weak ones .
Yet such standards are a poor way of reducing emissions .
They discourage companies from innovating and encourage them to game the system .
The existence of different standards for cars and light trucks — an anomaly that continues — encouraged the rush into pickups and SUVs , overproduction of which ultimately helped sink America 's car industry .
Far better to have a carbon price high enough to pinch , and then let companies and consumers decide where to cut emissions .
But that , unfortunately , is unlikely to emerge from the cap - and - trade bill now in the House of Representatives , the details of which have been revealed by its promoters , Henry Waxman and Edward Markey .
They have , it seems , granted some rather generous concessions to Midwestern Democrats from states dependent on coal or heavy industry .
As a result the bill is now too weak in three crucial ways .
First , it envisages America cutting carbon - dioxide emissions by 17 % below 2005 levels by 2020 ( down from 20 % in the original draft ) .
Europe , by contrast , is aiming to cut its emissions by 20 % below 1990 levels by 2020 ( and by 30 % , if the rest of the world makes similarly serious efforts ) .
Second , the purpose of a cap - and - trade system is to introduce a carbon price .
But the bill sets a ceiling of $ 28 a tonne on the price of carbon — too low to change behaviour enough .
Third , under a cap - and - trade system , the government issues permits to pollute .
The administration had wanted 100 % of permits to be auctioned , but the bill would hand most of them out free ( a third to electricity companies , which is nice for coal ; only 2 % to oil companies ) .
When that happened in Europe , power - generation companies passed the cost of buying permits on to consumers and pocketed the value of the ones they had been given free .
In order to avoid such an outcome , the bill specifies that the value of free permits must be passed on to consumers .
But if consumers are protected from price increases , they will have no incentive to cut back on carbon consumption — which is one of the goals of the scheme .
The weakening of this bill illustrates one of the central problems with cap - and - trade systems .
They are complex , obscure and therefore susceptible to horse - trading .
A chunk of allowances can be handed out to one lobby , a sliver to another , and soon the system 's effectiveness has been sliced away .
The corresponding attraction of a carbon tax , which this newspaper has always supported , is its simplicity .
The government sets the rate .
Everybody can see what it is .
Voters get transparency .
Businesses get certainty .
And the government gets a large chunk of revenue — not to be sniffed at in these difficult times .
This is an important moment .
Thanks to much effort on the part of many well - intentioned people , America is prepared to legislate to control carbon .
The country needs to seize this opportunity and introduce a simple carbon tax .
Sceptics will howl about the initial cost , but it will be transparent and far , far cheaper than the impact of serious climate change .

A socialist view of the capitalist crisis , by Resistance Books .

The current economic crisis is a fundamental crisis of the world capitalist system .
British socialist Phil Hearse calls it the “ third slump ” in the history of the capitalism ( the other two being the Great Depression of the 1930s and the 1974 - 75 sharp downturn ) .
And the levels of mass distress may yet come to rival the 1930s .
We certainly already have the anti-human irrationality of that period .
Some time ago I came across a TV program about Las Vegas and the crisis .
Casino business was down , it said .
But Las Vegas also has normal suburbs , full of struggling , financially stressed homeowners .
Across the city the sheriff ’s department was conducting 3500 - 4000 home evictions each month !
And the US has dozens of cities the size of Las Vegas .
But it is not the desperate homeowners who are being bailed out , but the very bankers and speculators whose insatiable greed caused the crisis .
In a November 26 article on counterpunch.org Kevin Zeese wrote :
$ 7.6 trillion .
That is what [ financial information agency ]
Bloomberg reports has been committed on behalf of the American taxpayer to bail out America ’s finance system .
This includes spending by the Treasury , Federal Reserve and FDIC .
The amount is equal to half the value of everything produced in the United States last year .
It is $ 24,000 for every man , woman and child in America , that is , nearly $ 100,000 for a family of four .
It ’s nine times what the US has spent so far on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It is enough money to pay off more than half the country ’s mortgages , but bankruptcies have continued despite the bailout .
We do not even know where all of those funds have gone .
The taxpayer is putting up a king ’s ransom and not being told who is receiving it .
We guarantee the debts of banks and are not being told what collateral is provided or who is receiving the funds .
Before receiving the bailout funds , Treasury Secretary Paulson promised transparency .
But Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke says that such transparency would be “ counterproductive ” .
All of this money and yet foreclosures , bankruptcy and unemployment are all up ; the stock market , consumer spending and housing prices are down .
Pouring tax dollars into banks is not working …
You ’d think for $ 7.7 trillion we ’d get health care for all , tax relief or free college education !
But Americans got none of that .
And , of course , no matter how hard the crisis hits ordinary people in the West it will be massively worse in the Third World .
What does all this mean for us ?
We are entering into a new period .
Unemployment is likely to rise significantly and there will be further deep cuts to welfare and social spending — all against the backdrop of the looming threat of climate catastrophe .
Along with the growing social dislocation we can expect increasing political turmoil .
The last time this happened in Australia was in the Great Depression of the 1930s .
And while we should n’t expect a carbon copy of that period , we can learn a lot from the experience of the Communist Party of Australia ( CPA ) in those turbulent years .
Much of the factual material in this talk is drawn from the 1983 book The People Stand Up by longtime CPA activist and leader Ralph Gibson .
1
While this work is firmly in a Stalinist framework , it nevertheless provides a very interesting picture of the 1930s crisis in Australia and the work of the CPA .
Gibson gives a vivid sense of the depth of the suffering of the masses , the rottenness of the ALP leaderships , and the passionate struggle of the communists fighting for something better .
The Great Depression
The Great Depression of the 1930s began with the October 1929 crash of the US sharemarket .
This rapidly developed into a crisis of world capitalism — the most severe in its entire history .
From the end of 1929 to the end of 1932 , industrial output fell 46 % in the USA , 47 % in Germany , 31 % in France and 16.5 % in Britain ( already in a severe slump ) .
Agricultural production dropped by a third over 1929 - 33 .
International trade contracted to one - third of its previous level .
Unemployment reached at least 35 million ( 12 million in the US ) .
In the US , only the mobilisation of World War II really put an end to the decade - long slump .
Workers , means of production , people ’s needs — everything was still there but due to capitalist ownership of the economy the whole mechanism had seized up .
To keep up prices , milk was poured down coal mines , oranges and coffee were dumped in the ocean , livestock were slaughtered , cotton fields were ploughed under .
Mass misery reigned amid plenty .
In the Soviet Union , however , Stalinism notwithstanding , the economy was forging ahead under the first Five - Year Plan .
The contrast could not have been clearer to millions of people suffering in the capitalist world .
In Australia the impact of the crisis was extremely severe .
The economy was heavily dependent on exports of primary products and world prices of these fell by over half .
In the 1920s large - scale federal and state government public works had been financed by loans from Britain .
With the crash , these stopped but the banks ( the “ British bondholders ” ) still demanded payment of the interest .
In the years 1930 to 1934 , an average of nearly a quarter of the workforce was unemployed , existing on a miserable pittance .
Misery , hunger , homelessness and dire distress gripped the country .
ALP helpless in face of crisis
Some basic facts of political history are necessary here .
Australia went to the polls in October 1929 .
The hated anti-worker Nationalist government of PM Stanley Bruce was defeated ( Bruce lost his seat to a trade union official ) and the ALP under James Scullin took office ( but with the Nationalists still controlling the Senate ) .
However , the euphoria was short - lived .
A few days later the Great Depression began …
In the two short years it was in office , the Scullin government showed itself to be completely incapable of protecting the interests of working people .
It abandoned its modest election promises and was completely subservient to the bosses .
Worried about getting their pound of flesh , the British banks sent out an emissary , Sir Otto Niemeyer , to lay down the law to the Scullin government .
Neimeyer demanded drastic cuts in wages and pensions — Australian living standards were too high , he said .
At a Premiers ’ Conference held in May - June 1931 , the notorious Premiers ’ Plan was adopted .
It called for slashing all adjustable government expenditure by 20 % — including all wages , salaries and pensions .
In NSW the ALP under J.T. ( Jack ) Lang won office in October 1930 .
Lang had presided over a modestly reformist state government in the mid-twenties .
He put forward his own plan for the crisis .
It called for a moratorium on interest payments to the British banks and a renegotiation of terms ( actually not without precedent in the times ) .
However , this was rejected at the February 1931 Premiers ’ Conference .
Despite all the demagogy surrounding Lang , the truth is that he later voted for the infamous Premiers ’ Plan .
Lang was expelled from the Federal ALP in May 1931 .
There were then two ALPs in NSW : Lang Labor ( by far the larger ) and the rump Federal Labor .
Five MHRs and two senators in Canberra were Lang supporters .
In April 1932 Lang announced that the NSW government would suspend its interest payments to overseas bondholders .
In response to this , in May the governor , Sir Philip Game , sacked Lang and he was defeated in the subsequent elections .
When a group of ALP defectors led by former Tasmanian premier Joseph Lyons withdrew support , the Scullin government was forced to the polls in December 1931 .
It was defeated by the new Lyons - led United Australia Party , a fusion of the Nationalists and ALP turncoats .
Labor would remain out of office in Canberra until the Curtin government in 1941 .
CPA and the ‘ Third Period ’
The CPA was formed in 1920 , inspired by the victorious Russian Revolution .
It took some time before a united communist party was consolidated .
Through the twenties the party struggled to find the correct strategic and tactical orientation toward the ALP .
Then , in 1929 - 31 , under the pressure of the Comintern , the old leadership around Jack Kavanagh was forced out and a new Stalinist team installed , led by Lance Sharkey and J.B. Miles .
Under this leadership the party adopted the policies associated with Stalin ’s ultraleft “ Third Period ” schema and a much more top - down form of party organisation and control was implemented .
According to the Comintern analysis , adopted at its Sixth Congress in 1928 , after the crisis of World War I and the immediate turbulent aftermath , and then the stabilisation of the 1920s , world capitalism was now in its third period .
This was one of decisive crisis , in which revolutionary situations were on the immediate agenda just about everywhere and the task of the moment was to organise for the socialist revolution .
The problem with the “ Third Period ” line is that it confused real possibilities of development with the actual situation .
And the tactical prescription which flowed from it was disastrous .
The Comintern argued that not only were the pro-capitalist social - democratic leaders holding back the masses and preparing the ground for reaction and fascism — which was absolutely true — but their rank - and - file followers were also “ social - fascists ” .
Left social - democrats — “ left social - fascists ” in the Stalinist categorisation — were even worse because they could more readily mislead the masses .
When the Great Depression came and capitalism did enter a period of tremendous dislocation and political turbulence , the Comintern ’s ultra-sectarian “ Third Period ” line prevented the communist parties from being able to correctly relate to the situation .
For example , in Germany in the later 1920s and early thirties , this sectarian line prevented the potentially formidable labour movement from uniting its forces to check Hitler ’s rise to power .
Instead , the working class remained divided between social - democracy and communism .
As Trotsky tirelessly stressed , whatever their differences it was necessary for the workers ’ movement to unite for self - defence against the growing fascist menace .
If it did not do this it would suffer a catastrophic defeat .
Trotsky also pointed out that a successful campaign against the Hitlerite threat would open the way to a socialist revolution in Germany .
The social - democratic leaders certainly did n’t want to fight but the sectarian CP line made it easy for them to avoid the struggle .
How different would world history have been had the Marxist - Leninist policy advocated by Trotsky been followed !
In Australia , the Third Period schema meant a crazy sectarianism toward the ALP and its mass base .
At a time when the faith in the system of large numbers of workers was being shaken as never before , when they were groping for a way out of their misery , the CPA line made it so much harder for them to cross over to the revolutionary camp .
Of course , the ALP leadership was loyal to the capitalist system , just as they are today .
But the most fruitful way to expose them in the eyes of their followers was not just through general propaganda but by constantly trying to achieve unity in action in fighting for the interests of the masses .
Only in the struggle will the masses lose their illusions .
Criticism is certainly not excluded but it must be relevant to the issues at hand and formulated in relation to the struggle as it unfolds .
In his book Ralph Gibson is critical of the CPA ’s tactics toward Langism .
Yes , Lang was a capitalist demagogue but he had attracted a mass following precisely because he appeared to offer an alternative to the Premiers ’
Plan .
The CPA called for a repudiation of the overseas debts .
OK .
But the actual struggle was developing around Lang ’s proposal to suspend interest payments and renegotiate the terms of the loans .
When Game sacked him ( probably an unconstitutional act ) an enormous meeting was held in Sydney ’s Moore Park in June 1932 under the slogan “ Lang is right ” .
The place of revolutionaries was to be part of that movement , demanding that Lang be reinstated — and then actually carry out his plan .
But the CPA ’s Third Period schema closed off this possibility and this whole promising development passed them by .
Similarly , the CPA played a negative role in regard to the Socialisation Units which arose in the NSW Lang Labor Party in 1930 - 33 .
The outlook of the leaders of the units was utopian and they were unclear in their understanding of the nature of the Labor leadership around Lang but here was a movement embracing scores of thousands of workers looking to “ socialisation ” as the answer to the misery of the depression .
The CPA denounced the leaders and supporters of the units ( as “ left social - facists ” ) .
And when a few communists did operate inside the units , they sought to commit the movement to an abstract revolutionary program .
Work among unemployed
Ralph Gibson explains that when he joined the CPA in the early thirties it was largely a party of the unemployed : “ Its members were not just talking about poverty .
They were among the multitude who were deep in it . ”
2
When the Great Depression first hit Australia and a great wave of unemployment engulfed the country , there was no unemployment insurance for eight months .
A national Unemployed Workers Movement ( UWM ) was set up in Sydney in July 1930 .
CPA members played the key role in setting it up in Sydney and Melbourne .
In the big cities there were repeated demonstrations of the unemployed .
These actions won the dole and the first payments were made in June 1930 .
The CPA played the decisive role in leading these struggles .
In mid-1931 the UWM claimed 31,000 members , in 1934 the figure was 68,000 and the organisation continued to grow until 1936 .
In response to the success of the UWM , the ALP and trades hall councils formed their own unemployed organisations but the CPA - led UWM outstripped them in numbers and militancy .
Not surprisingly , the UWM was a major source of recruits for the CPA .
The UWM often spearheaded struggles against evictions .
Some of these actions were veritable battles against the police attempting to evict people from their homes and throw them onto the street .
The UWM also fought for improved conditions for the unemployed .
These struggles were successful in winning higher dole payments and in gaining a rent allowance for the unemployed to stop people being evicted from their homes .
In 1932 the government tried to introduce “ work for the dole ” .
Previously there had been short - term relief work for which wages were paid .
But work for the dole made the unemployed work for their pittance .
In Melbourne , the Shrine of Remembrance ( that icon of bourgeois patriotism and militarism ) and the Yarra Boulevard were the two main projects .
The unemployed organisations were unable to prevent the introduction of this scheme , but in mid-1933 an heroic eight - week strike of the jobless in Melbourne succeeded in winning a substantial increase in the amounts paid .
Growing influence in trade unions
Alongside the Unemployed Workers Movement , the other key organisation through which the CPA attempted to lead the working class in the first part of the 1930s was the Militant Minority Movement ( MMM ) .
It was first established in 1928 with CPA leader Jack Kavanagh as its first secretary .
Ralph Gibson points out that : “ The economic crisis , while it stimulated struggle among the unemployed , on the whole dampened it among employed workers . ”
Strike activity declined as did trade union membership ( due to loss of faith in unions along with an inability to pay union dues ) . “… there was no real strike movement till the ice broke with the Wonthaggi mining strike of 1934 ” 3 ( depicted so well in the movie Strikebound ) .
However , the CPA was able to advance its industrial work , especially in traditionally militant sectors like the miners .
This was despite its overall Third Period sectarian line .
In his 1969 history of the CPA , Alastair Davidson summarises its gains in the first years of the Great Depression :
In early 1933 the MMM usually captured only low positions in militant unions , gains which were basic successes , but did not become news .
In late 1933 and 1934 it started to capture militant unions at the state level .
It also spread its activity throughout the entire Australian union movement .
In 1933 , through good organisation as well as essentially “ pork chop ” policies , the MMM captured the presidency of the Victorian Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen ’s Association as well as several positions on the Victorian Tramways Union executive .
It also consolidated its hold on positions in the WWF and was only narrowly defeated in the Amalgamated Engineering Union elections .
In [ January ] 1934 it captured its first union at the federal level , [ when Bill Orr became secretary of ] the Miners ’ Federation , and throughout 1934 and 1935 it captured positions at the state level .
By 1935 it decisively influenced a number of unions in various states : the ARU , the Leather and Tanners ’ , the Federated Ironworkers ’ Association , the Tramways and Engineering unions , and the Miners ’ unions .
It also led a militant minority which included about 20 % of Australian unionists .
It was winning influence in the Victorian , New South Wales , and New South Wales South Coast labor councils once again .
Nearly all its successes at this stage were limited to traditionally militant unions , but it was also building its influence in the lower units of unions which were not traditionally militant .
4
The Militant Minority Movement is a very interesting phenomenon .
One thing we should be clear about is that this was not just a “ rank - and - file ” movement .
Yes , it aimed to organise the ranks of the unions but it also aimed at winning leadership of unions and as it had success in this regard , the concept of the militant minority became somewhat anachronistic .
Whole unions were won by militants and followed a militant line .
Free speech
The CPA engaged in numerous free - speech fights through the 1930s , often through the Unemployed Workers Movement .
One hard - fought campaign took place in Brunswick in Melbourne in 1933 .
A state law banning “ subversive ” gatherings was used by the police — under the command of the reactionary police commissioner , General Thomas Blamey — to break up meetings of radicals and the unemployed .
The struggle was at its fiercest in Brunswick .
Dozens of members of the UWM were arrested in repeated protests during Friday late - night shopping .
A celebrated incident took place on May 16 at the corner of Sydney Road and Phoenix Street in Brunswick .
CPA member and artist Noel Counihan had himself locked inside an old steel mesh lift cage bolted onto the back of a horse - drawn cart which was securely chained to a verandah post .
From the safety of his improvised fortress he spoke to a large and growing crowd — one estimate put it at 10,000 — for 15 or so minutes on the situation of the unemployed , the right to free speech , war and the rise of Hitler .
The police were beside themselves .
Earlier that evening in Brunswick a free - speech activist had been shot in the leg by the cops .
With the police smashing at his cage with an improvised battering ram , Counihan eventually came out and was duly arrested .
After three months , the campaign was finally successful .
The Nationalist state government backed off and brought in a new , less restrictive law and street meetings were generally allowed to proceed without police harrassment ..
Then there was the famous case of Egon Kisch in late 1934 - early 1935 .
Menzies , the attorney - general in the UAP federal government , banned the Czech communist writer from entering Australia to address a congress of the CPA - led Victorian Council Against War and Fascism .
When Kisch courageously jumped from his ship in Melbourne — breaking a leg but briefly touching Australian soil — the whole government effort to exclude him backfired .
He eventually made a triumphal tour of Australia , speaking to large crowds and gaining enormous publicity for his message .
New Guard threat
In response to the rise of working - class militancy a semi- fascist New Guard formed in NSW , led by ex-army officer Eric Campbell .
Its slogan was “ King and Country ” and its aim was to break up CPA , Socialisation Unit and Lang Labor meetings .
At its height , its numbers reached some 50 - 100,000 .
The CPA was forced to set up a defence guard to protect its meetings .
But in February 1932 the New Guard met its match in the “ Battle of Bankstown ” when 200 of its thugs in dozens of cars attacked a workers ’ meeting and were driven off in complete disarray .
After Lang ’s dismissal the New Guard went into sharp decline .
Conclusion
According to Alastair Davidson , at the end of 1928 the Communist Party had 249 members .
By April 1931 membership was in excess of 1100 .
In 1934 , the figure was almost 3000 and in 1935 probably greater still .

What can we conclude from this very brief sketch ?
In the early 1930s , in the context of a global crisis of capitalism and a consequent profound crisis of Australian society , a small revolutionary party built itself into a formidable force in Australian political life .
It remained small compared to the ALP but its influence was much greater than its mere numbers would suggest .
All this was achieved despite a fundamentally wrong political line ( its Third Period ultraleftism ) .
Many things are different today .
But we can be sure that one thing at least will not be different this time around .
Its Stalinist framework notwithstanding , the CPA grew because of the commitment , drive , energy and will to struggle of its membership .
This time too success will go to those who are prepared to fight and make sacrifices for their cause .
In the period ahead of us the socialist movement will have increasing opportunities .
We can learn a lot from the experience of the CPA during the Great Depression , while hopefully avoiding its mistakes .

Linux only : Back In Time , a Linux backup app inspired by Macs ' Time Machine and offering the same kind of no-worry , space - saving snapshot protection , is worth adding to your must - install list .

Why ?
First off , the user interface and documentation at its home page beat out similarly Time - Machine - inspired backup apps like previously mentioned Flyback , at least for my money .
Second , it 's smart about being friendly with non-developer Linux users — it rewrites all the rules of the underlying rsync command in plain English in its settings , installs a " root " launching shortcut for when you want to back up your core system files , and adds itself to your cron automation engine automatically at the intervals you set it to , no crontab -e or other terminal jobs required .

More than anything , though , the settings just make sense .
You set a custom automatic backup wait in hours , days , months , or even years , and set Back In Time to forget about backups that are however old with the same kind of dialog .
Because it 's creating multiple snapshots with only the newest stuff in each , it saves you a good deal of space , but if you 're running out — and you can set a limit on how much should be left — the Smart Remove function starts killing out old stuff , but keeps a good roster of backup points , as pictured at right .
Just as important as the backup , Back In Time 's restore functions are pretty easy to activate and understand — select a snapshot from the left - hand menu , choose folders from it , and hit " Restore . "

The Obama administration on Thursday released controversial memos outlining the legal rationale for interrogation techniques the Central Intelligence Agency used against terror suspects apprehended overseas , and vowed not to prosecute those that carried out what the administration described as " torture . "
" It would be unfair to prosecute dedicated men and women working to protect America for conduct that was sanctioned in advance by the Justice Department , " Attorney General Eric Holder said .
Thursday 's developments underscore a quandary of sorts the administration finds itself in -- even as President Barack Obama is to be commended for his transparency in his bid to distance himself from the policies of the Bush administration .
Even as the new president has renounced those Bush administration practices , Justice Department lawyers are defending the previous administration 's top officials already accused of authorizing and carrying out those policies .
Bruce Fein , former deputy attorney general under Reagan and frequent critic of Bush policies :
President Obama has embraced the national security psychology of the Bush - Cheney duumvirate not only in matters of secrecy , but the entire range of civil liberties abuses justified by a purported global and endless war against international terrorism .
Indeed , Obama has invoked state secrets in litigation to conceal torture , extraordinary rendition , illegal surveillance , or arbitrary detentions that have given rise to private damages litigation against former government officials .
He has claimed that Bagram prison in Afghanistan is a sanctuary for United States lawlessness .
He has asserted that the entire world is a battlefield against terrorism ; thus , drones can be fired without a judicial warrant to kill persons suspected of Al Qaeda membership on the President 's say - so alone .
Like President Bush , he has issued a presidential signing statement claiming plenary power over the use of the American military .
He has claimed authority to detain United States citizens as " enemy combatants " indefinitely without accusation or trial .
In sum , on national security and the war on terrorism , Obama has shown that the more things change , the more they stay the same , despite his adept semantical juggleries .
Glenn Greenwald has a far more generous reading :
I 'll have more details as soon as these memos are available .
One can certainly criticize Obama for vowing that no CIA officials will be prosecuted if they followed DOJ memos ( though that vow , notably , does not extend to Bush officials ) , but -- assuming the reports about redactions are correct -- there is no grounds for criticizing Obama here and substantial grounds for praising him .
dday has more at Hullabaloo .
The South Carolina Attorney General has threatened Craigslist with a criminal investigation if it does not remove prostitution listings and pornography on the site by May 15 , 2009 .
AG Henry McMaster sent a strongly worded open letter ( PDF ) to Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster yesterday , accusing Craigslist of not instituting the appropriate safeguards to fight unlawful activity , despite an agreement from last November between Craigslist and the Attorneys General of more than 40 states to do so .
Meanwhile , Craigslist is keeping a cool head and maintains that there 's no legal basis for such a threat .
" Recent national events , along with ongoing law enforcement efforts in South Carolina , indicate that craigslist has not installed sufficient safeguards since November to prohibit the Internet site from being used as a vehicle to advertise or solicit prostitution , " McMaster wrote in his letter .
" Also of concern is the unrestricted manner in which graphic pornographic pictures are posted and displayed by users on the craigslist site and their accessibility to minors . "
Note that these " graphic pornographic pictures " are being posted by users of the site and not Craigslist itself , just like those posted by people with questionable judgement on MySpace or Facebook .
These photos are also limited to parts of Craigslist that are meant for adults — these sections require the same " Yes I am over 18 and I understand this will contain adult content " clickthrough disclaimer as do most adult sites on the Internet .
But graphic images are hardly the biggest of Craigslist 's worries .
The site has been battling its growing reputation for facilitating prostitution for some time now , resulting in an agreement with the attorneys general of 40 states late last year to take steps to reduce illegal activity on the site .
Those steps included instituting a phone verification system for listings in the Erotic Services section , as well the charging of a small listing fee to help discourage those who do n't want to be identified .
Craigslist claims that these changes have resulted in a 90 percent drop in Erotic Services listings , but they apparently are n't enough to satisfy some members of law enforcement ; the Cook County Sheriff 's Department in Chicago recently decided to sue Craigslist for continuing to enable prostitution .
McMaster 's legal threat comes as a 23 - year - old Boston University student has been charged with murdering a " masseuse " ( or a stripper ?
No one seems to know exactly ) that he found in Craigslist 's ( you guessed it ) Erotic Services section .
The minutia of that case are n't relevant so much as the fact that it has drawn mainstream attention to Craigslist as a place for women and their killers to meet — just like how MySpace became the de facto destination for pedophiles to find victims in previous years — and the Erotic Services section is n't helping .
In fact , Craigslist 's lawyers are currently meeting with the AGs of several states in New York this week to discuss the possibility of blocking access to that section of the site .
Still , Craigslist has n't allowed itself to be bullied into closing Erotic Services just yet ;
Buckmaster and gang must know that those listings would just disperse into other adult sections of the site and , if that happens , the level of prostitution on Craigslist might even go back up .
In a blog posting ( hat tip to TechCrunch ) made yesterday , Craigslist stated that it planned to speak with McMaster about his concerns and find ways to address them " without compromising the utility of craigslist for South Carolinians , or anyone ’s Constitutional rights . "
The company reiterated that misuse has been decreased dramatically over the last six months and that it continues to work with law enforcement to make improvements to the site .
" However , we see no legal basis whatsoever for filing a lawsuit against craigslist or its principals and hope that the Attorney General will realize this upon further reflection , " Craigslist wrote .

Digby :
Can I just say what a bunch of whining little wimps these Republicans all are ?
They love to present themselves as stoic , manly warriors , loving heir country above all else , willing to lay down their lives for it .
Until something happens they do n't like and then they want to blow the thing up .
We 've been polling the question .
In Texas , 48 percent of Republicans ( and 35 percent overall ) would prefer Texas to be an Independent nation .
In Georgia , 43 percent of Republicans ( and 27 percent overall ) want independence .
We decided to ask that question in our national weekly poll last week .
Do you think the state that you live in would be better off as an independent nation or as part of the United States of America ?
US Independent All 79 5
Northeast 90 2
South 61 9
Midwest 86 4
West 84 4 Would you approve or disapprove of the state that you live in leaving the United States ?
Approve Disapprove Unsure All 4 82 14
Northeast 1 94 5
South 8 63 29
Midwest 3 89 8
West 3 87 10
In most of the country , the 9 out of 10 people love America .
But in the South , less than two - thirds would disapprove of their state leaving the US .
And sure , while the " approve " contingent in the South is just 8 percent , 29 percent are n't sure .
Are n't sure ?
There 's a debate as to whether leaving the US is good or bad ?
Is their love of America so shallow , so skin deep , that leaving the country is even an option ?
And check this out :
Would you approve or disapprove of the state that you live in leaving the United States ?
Approve Disapprove Unsure All 4 82 14
Dem 2 95 3
Rep 9 63 28
Ind 3 83 14
This is objective evidence that Democrats love America more than anyone else .
95 percent of them want their states to remain as part of the union , while only 63 percent -- less than two - thirds -- of Republicans similarly love their country .
Hence we 'll continue to see wingnutty " sovereignty " resolutions and proclamations made in the South , and you 'll continue getting wingnuts like Pittsburgh cop killer Richard Poplawski motivated to defy the authorities .
As his friend said , " We recently discovered that 30 states had declared sovereignty .
One of his concerns was ,
Why were these major events in America not being reported to the public ? "
There 's a lot of crazy out there , and it 's mostly percolating among Republicans .
Those bumper stickers that say " these colors do n't run " ?
Well , they 're running .
America , love it or leave it ?
Well , they clearly do n't love it as they yearn to leave it .
And those flag lapel pins ?
They attacked liberals who wore them when in reality , it was THEM who needed to be pledging allegiance to a flag they 'd apparently rather tear up and burn .
Personal Quote :
[ on his love for the Turner Classic Movies channel ]
My antidote to a cold , hard , really cruel world is to go back and watch old black and white movies and go " Oh , Oh ...
Oh , Humphrey !
Oh , Cary !
Oh , Burt ! " .
That 's it , man .
I mean , you know it 's just another time and place .
It seems like there was a little order to the universe back then .
This week saw some notable apologies and makings of amends .
“ Padre Oprah , ” as the Rev. Alberto Cutié is known to his fans in Miami , got caught canoodling with a female companion .
Consenting adults in love ?
Great .
Not so cute thought the church .
To them it was a violation of its medieval dictate .
So , he apologized .
It was reported that last year Oprah herself called James Frey , fabulist of “ A Million Little Pieces , ” whom she had dragged on her show and ripped into a million little shreds .
What did she say ? : “ I felt I owe you an apology . ” ( Wording according to Frey anyway . )
Michael Steele , who I am convinced suffers from some sort of diarrhea of the larynx , apologized for saying that religious bigots in the Republican base rejected Mitt Romney in part because he ’s Mormon .
( That ’s probably true , but really Michael , just be quiet , or chillax , or whatever dated slang you prefer . )
One major exception to this trend of mea culpas : Dick Cheney .
When CBS ’s Bob Schieffer asked Cheney if he had any regrets about the detestable torture tactics used during the Bush administration ( which may not have even worked ) , Cheney , channeling Mr. Burns from “ The Simpsons , ” responded : “ No regrets .
I think it was absolutely the right thing to do . ”

Four of Saturn 's moons parade by their parent
A new Hubble image shows four of Saturn 's moons circling the ringed planet
On 24 February 2009 , the NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope captured a photo sequence of four moons of Saturn passing in front of their parent planet .
The moons , from far left to right , are the white icy moons Enceladus and Dione , the large orange moon Titan , and icy Mimas .
Due to the angle of the Sun , they are each preceded by their own shadow .
These rare moon transits only happen when the tilt of Saturn 's ring plane is nearly " edge on " as seen from the Earth .
Saturn 's rings will be perfectly edge on to our line of sight on 10 August and 4 September 2009 .
Unfortunately , Saturn will be too close to the Sun to be seen by viewers on Earth at that time .
This " ring plane crossing " occurs every 14 - 15 years .
In 1995 - 96 Hubble witnessed the previous ring plane crossing , as well as many moon transits , and helped to discover several new moons of Saturn .
Early 2009 was a favourable time for viewers with small telescopes to watch moon and shadow transits crossing the face of Saturn .
Titan , Saturn 's largest moon , crossed Saturn on four separate occasions : 24 January , 9 February , 24 February and 12 March , although not all events were visible from all locations on Earth .
Italian Galileo Galilei — often referred to as the father of astronomy — was the first to observe Saturn through a telescope in 1610 .
Dutch mathematician and astronomer Christian Huygens discovered Titan in 1655 and , 350 years later , the ESA probe named for him touched down on Titan ( on 14 January 2005 ) , giving the world its first views of the surface of the mysterious , icy world .
Giovanni Domenico Cassini , a French / Italian astronomer , discovered Dione ( in addition to others ) and the German - born Englishman , William Herschel , discovered Mimas and Enceladus .
These pictures were taken with Hubble 's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 on 24 February 2009 , when Saturn was at a distance of roughly 1.25 billion kilometres from Earth .
Hubble can see details as small as 300 kilometres across on Saturn .
The dark band running across the face of the planet slightly above the rings is the shadow of the rings cast on the planet .

Mr Mackay is married to a fellow Tory MP Conservative MP Andrew MacKay has quit as parliamentary aide to David Cameron over what the party said was an " unacceptable " expenses claim .
Mr Cameron has said all Tory MPs must be able to defend their allowance claims after a series of damaging allegations about MPs ' claims .
Several senior
Tory figures , including Michael Gove and Alan Duncan , have agreed to repay money they claimed .
Mr MacKay , MP for Bracknell , is married to fellow Tory MP Julie Kirkbride .
' Unacceptable ' HAVE YOUR SAY
To simply hand this stolen money back and expect that to be the end of the matter is totally unacceptable .
James , Oldham The Conservatives said Mr MacKay had voluntarily submitted his expense claims to party officials and these had revealed " an unacceptable situation that would not stand up to reasonable public scrutiny " .
Mr Cameron said Mr MacKay had made " unacceptable " claims , adding : " He will go before scrutiny to determine how much of that money needs to be repaid . "
It is understood that Mr MacKay and his wife claimed second homes allowances on two separate properties .
" Although Mr MacKay maintains that those arrangements were agreed by the Fees Office , he resigned this morning with immediate effect , " said a party spokesman .
The party said Mr MacKay had agreed to appear before a new committee , announced by Mr Cameron on Tuesday , set up to scrutinise MP 's expense claims .
It said the panel would discuss " how much of the allowance should be paid back " .
The BBC 's political correspondent Reeta Chakrabarti said Mr MacKay was paying a heavy price for the public backlash against MPs ' behaviour over their expenses and the strong action party leaders were now taking over the issue .
Mortgage claims Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit said Mr MacKay was a " good guy " but said he had done the " right thing " in stepping down given the nature of the situation .
" It ai n't right , " he said of the claims details .
" I am glad he has recognised it is so . "
Tories are complaining to me about what one calls " summary mob justice " in which all are judged guilty so that the good are punished while the real bad guys escape lightly
Nick Robinson 's blog
It comes as Westminster is rocked by the seventh day of revelations about MPs ' expenses in the Daily Telegraph .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown is said to be " very concerned " about former minister Elliott Morley claiming £ 16,000 for a mortgage he had already paid off .
Mr Morley has said it was a " mistake " and has paid the money back but Mr Brown is holding talks with Labour 's chief whip about his future .
The newspaper also alleges Mr Morley rented out a London flat designated as his main residence to another Labour MP , Ian Cawsey , a close friend and former special adviser , who named the property as his second home , allowing him to claim £ 1,000 a month in rent , which he paid to Mr Morley .
In November 2007 , the newspaper claims , Mr Morley " flipped " his designated second home from his Scunthorpe property to his London home and for four months the two men claimed expenses on the same property .
The Commons fees office stopped the arrangement .
Mr Cawsey said he had not been aware of Mr Morley 's financial arrangements .

There 's no denying that the world 's a little crazy right now , and nowhere is this more visible than in the auto industry .
Thanks to the global economic meltdown , car makers have been streamlining and downsizing , wheeling and dealing , with brands changing hands faster than bets at a Shanghai cockfight .
With one exception : Pontiac .
Despite the old adage that " everything has its price " , General Motors seems unwilling to slap a " for sale " sign on the beleaguered brand like it has with Hummer , Saturn , and Saab .
This had n't been fully articulated until late last week when Jim Waldron --a Pontiac dealer in Davison , Michigan - - got together with several of his well - heeled friends and offered to buy the brand from GM .
GM 's response ?
Pontiac is n't for sale .
Now to be fair , that came from Tom Pyden on GM 's communications team , and it is n't GM 's official response to Waldron 's offer .
( That should come in a few days . )
So GM may say " yes " in the end .
But as of today , the party line is that GM 's restructuring plan does n't include a provision for selling Pontiac , only phasing it out by the end of 2010 .
Which begs the question : is GM up to something ?
Why would the ailing automaker want to hold onto a brand -- and it 's just the brand in question here , no factories or other physical items -- when they 've got someone offering cash on the barrel ?
Are they hoping to resuscitate Pontiac when things improve ?
Are they being spiteful ?
Could this be the basis of ( yet another ) dragged - out conspiracy theory film with Nicholas Cage and an unsuspecting , career - starved starlet ?
We 'd love to hear your take on things , ' cause we 're as confused as we were after watching National Treasure : Book of Secrets .
Seriously .

The assault on American traditions and freedoms led by the current congress and the Agitator - in - Chief has not gone unnoticed .
The Tea Party movement is one such reaction .
A popular movement to study and understand the original meaning of the Constitution is another ( also see here ) .
And finally , means to strengthen the original meaning of the Constitution , enforcing the original meaning with structural changes in the government , are being widely considered .
Last week Randy Barnett , Carmack Waterhouse Professor of Legal Theory at Georgetown University , inspired by the originalist vision of the Tea Parties , wrote an op ed in the Wall Street Journal that argued for the enactment of a federalism amendment limiting the powers of the federal government .
Ilya Somin at Volokh and others have been sending their learned feedback to Barnett , who revised his proposal from the single amendment with five sections in his WSJ op ed to Ten Federalism Amendments .
PJTV has a thorough discussion by Barnett and Tea Party organizers on the merits of the proposed amendment that is worth listening to if you have an hour to invest .
If you do n’t have the time , I ’ll summarize what I think are the most important points from the discussion .
First , some may ask why ten ?
Barnett got so many comments and suggestions , from other constitutional lawyers and other smart people , that he had to re-conceptualize and rewrite his proposal .
The initial amendment was broken into ten pieces for two reasons .
If there are weaknesses in individual sections of a single amendment it scuttles the whole amendment .
If there are ten amendments and one turns out too contentious then it can be thrown out and the rest kept .
Some of the initial language was legally insufficient to achieve its goals .
So it had to be reworded .
Some of this rewording pointed out additional amendments that were necessary .
Barnett got so many comments and suggestions , from other constitutional lawyers and other smart people , that he had to re-conceptualize and rewrite his proposal .
The initial amendment was broken into ten pieces for two reasons .
Second , many will say that passing amendments is a political impossibility .
Even the Enumerated Powers
Act is unlikely to happen .
The response is that it is obvious the federal legislature will never agree to limit its powers unless it is forced .
The way forward is to go through the states .
Several states have recently been passing laws that make an explicit claim against the federal government ’s encroachments against the 10th Amendment .
For instance , the Montana legislature passed an act nullifying the federal Real ID Act within its borders .
And more to the point of the 10th amendment and the federalism issue , a number of states have recently considered state sovereignty resolutions .
As of the date of this writing , the list is 35 states long : Alabama ( 2nd Resolution , HJR403 , introduced 03-24-09 ) Alaska ( 2nd resolution introduced 03 - 19-09 ) ( HJR27 Passed 37- 0 on 04-06-09 ) ( Senate Passed HJR27 , 19 - 0 , on 04 - 19-09 – Awaiting Transmittal to Governor ) Arizona ( Committee voted Do-Pass on 04/14/09 ) Arkansas ( failed in committee on 03-04-09 passed committee 04-01-09 failed House vote , 54 - 34 ) Colorado ( 04-27-09 : Postponed by committee ) Georgia ( Senate Version – Passed 43 - 1 on 04/01/09 ) Idaho ( Passed House 51 - 17 , on 03-23-09 , Passed Senate on 04-07-09 ) Illinois Indiana ( 2nd Senate Resolution Introduced 03-19-09 ) ( SR0042 Passed Committe 8 - 0 on 04-01-09 ) ( SR0042 Passed Senate 44 - 3 on 04-09-09 ) Iowa Kansas Kentucky ( 2nd resolution introduced on 02/24 ) Louisiana Michigan ( senate version introduced 03-03-09 ) Minnesota Mississippi ( senate resolution introduced 03 - 10 - 09 ) Missouri ( passed house on 03-23-09 ) ( senate public hearing 04-07-09 ) Montana ( Failed 51 - 49 on 02-24-09 ) ( Resolution reintroduced as HR3 ) ( HR3 Passed House Committee on 04-21-09 ) ( HR3 failed to pass in house , 50 - 50 ) Nevada ( Committee 04-11-09 : “ No Further Action Allowed ” ) New Hampshire ( resolution killed in house on 03-04-09 : 216-150 ) New Mexico ( tabled in committee ) North Carolina North Dakota ( passed house 52 - 40 on 04-07-09 ) ( passed senate 25 - 20 on 04-20-09 – returned to house , amended ) ( passed House by voice vote on 04-27-09 ) Ohio Oklahoma ( passed house on 02/18/09 , senate version passed 25 - 17 on 03-04-09 ) ( Joint version passed Senate , 29 - 18 on 04-15-09 – awaiting signuture of governor ) ( Vetoed by Governor on 04-24-09 ) Oregon Pennsylvania ( senate resolution introduced 03 - 19-09 ) South Carolina ( passed house on 02- 26-09 , senate – referred to subcommittee ) South Dakota ( passed house on 03-03-09 by a vote of 51 - 18 , passed senate on 03-05- 09 by a vote of 20 - 14 ) Tennessee Texas ( senate resolution introduced 03-02-09 – senate ’s 2nd resolution introduced on 03-04-09 ) Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin
State sovereignty resolutions have n’t yet passed in all 35 states , but if they did that would be 70 % of the states , which is more than the 2/3s requirement for constitutional amendments ( though less than the 75 % required for ratification ) .
The fact they are being considered at all in 35 states including such heavily Dem states as Wisconsin and Iowa is an indication that federalism is more popular than the statist ideological echo chamber of the media would have us believe .
The point of this explication was that there is sufficient interest in the states to indicate that a raft of amendments limiting the power of the federal government have a chance of passing in the states , even if the federal legislature opposes them .
Assuming the Constitution has any power left at all , this change cannot be stopped by the federal government !
That is the strategy .
Even the Enumerated Powers
Act is unlikely to happen .
The response is that .
The way forward is to go through the states .
Several states have recently been passing laws that make an explicit claim against the federal government ’s encroachments against the 10th Amendment .
For instance , the Montana legislature passed an act nullifying the federal Real ID Act within its borders .
And more to the point of the 10th amendment and the federalism issue , a number of states have recently considered state sovereignty resolutions .
As of the date of this writing , the list is 35 states long :
Though these changes are never going to be popular with the political classes , they are popular with the grassroots , as demonstrated by the people ’s Tea Party movement .
It is impossible to force any centralized agenda upon the Tea Parties , but if conservatives can articulate the concerns of the movement they can use the momentum to reform the Republican Party as a winning conservative party rather than a bunch of feckless go - along - to - get - along Democrats lite doomed to always sabotage real conservatives and lose every contest to real Democrats ( also see RMSP , RLC , Benedict Arlen Specter , the Gang of 12 , and DeMint ’s “ Big Party ” op ed ) .

Israel destroying Gaza 's farmlands Eva Bartlett A farmer holds crops destroyed by Israeli troops .
May 22 , 2009
On the morning of 4 May 2009 , Israeli troops set fire to Palestinian crops along Gaza 's eastern border with Israel .
The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights ( PCHR ) reported that 200,000 square meters of crops were destroyed , including wheat and barley ready for harvest , as well as vegetables , olive and pomegranate trees .
Local farmers report that the blaze carried over a four - kilometer stretch on the Palestinian side of the eastern border land .
Ibrahim Hassan Safadi , 49 , from one of the farming families whose crops were destroyed by the blaze , said that the fires were smoldering until early evening , despite efforts by the fire brigades to extinguish them .
Safadi says he was present when Israeli soldiers fired small bombs into his field , which soon after caught ablaze .
He explained that " The Israeli soldiers fired from their jeeps , causing a fire to break out on the land .
They burned the wheat , burned the pomegranate trees ...
The fire spread across the valley .
We called the fire brigades .
They came to the area and put out the fire .
But in some places the fire started again . "
According to Safadi , he lost 30,000 square meters to the blaze , including 300 pomegranate trees , 150 olive trees , and wheat .
In the border areas it has long since become nearly impossible to work on the land due to almost daily shooting from the Israeli soldiers .
The crops that were burned on 4 May were dried and ready to harvest , meaning that they were extremely flammable .
" It took only three minutes for the fire to destroy 65,000 square meters , " said Nahed Jaber Abu Said , whose farmland lies a few kilometers down the road from Safadi .
He added that " It was nearly 9am .
I was here when the Israeli jeeps came .
An Israeli soldier at the fence shot an explosive into our field of wheat .
It went up in flames immediately . "
Safadi said that the arson attack was the third major time his farm has suffered from an Israeli attack .
In previous attacks over the last decade , he explained , Israeli soldiers bulldozed his land , razing his lemon , olive and clementine trees as well as demolishing greenhouses .
" We 've suffered great losses .
The Israeli soldiers have destroyed so much of our land , trees and equipment .
They 've cost us a lot of money , " he said , citing cumulative losses of $ 330,000 since 2000 when the heightened invasions began .
In the last attack , Safadi said that $ 130,000 worth of crops , trees and irrigation piping was destroyed .
A wheat field destroyed by fire .
On top of the destruction , Safadi complains of not being able to replace destroyed items like the plastic hosing used to irrigate his fields .
These , along with fertilizers and machinery replacement parts , are banned from entering Gaza due to the Israeli-led and internationally - backed whole - scale siege of the territory .
Abu Said reports losses of $ 2,000 on one patch of his land alone .
" This is n't including the land closest to the border fence , " he said .
" I 'm so sad now , what can I do ? "
His experiences also extend beyond the 4 May attacks , and beyond the loss of land .
In 2008 , Israeli soldiers shot and killed 11 of his sheep and seriously injured a 15 - year - old cousin , Jaber , by shooting him in the mouth .
Attacks by Israeli soldiers occur on a near - daily basis along Gaza 's borders with Israel .
Nearly a decade ago , Israel unilaterally imposed a " buffer " or " no - go " zone solely on the Gaza side of their shared borders .
According to the Food and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) and the Palestinian Agricultural Relief Committee , the initial 100 - meter " off- limits " area has now extended to one kilometer across much of Gaza 's eastern border and two kilometers along the Strip 's northern border .
FAO further reports that roughly one - third of Gaza 's agricultural land lies within the confines of the " buffer zone . "
Since the 18 January ceasefire , three Palestinian civilians , including one child , have been killed in the " buffer zone " area from shooting and shelling by Israeli forces .
Another 12 Palestinians have been injured , including three children and two women , due to Israeli fire along the border .
In addition to the physical threat and the destruction of agricultural land and equipment , Gaza 's farming sector is further devastated by the destruction of what is believed to be hundreds of wells and sources of water and the contamination of farmland due to Israel 's invasion of Gaza at the beginning of the year .
As reported by the Guardian newspaper in February 2009 , these attacks have left nearly 60 percent of Gaza 's agricultural land useless .
The consequences of the active destruction of Gaza 's farming sector are amplified within the context of Israel 's siege and the stagnant state of rebuilding efforts since the ceasefire .
With only a trickle of aid entering Gaza and poverty and malnutrition rates soaring , the ability to produce food is all the more vital to Palestinians in Gaza .

Where is Everyone ? [ via Digital Inspiration ]
Do n't look now but the shopping mall , those air conditioned nowheres that have supplanted downtowns all over America for the past half century , may well be dead .
The Wall Street Journal has a story this morning about the large numbers of them likely to succumb to the recession , and the piece contains this remarkable paragraph :
Developers , in fact , have been moving away from the enclosed - mall format in favor of big - box centers anchored by free - standing giants such as Wal - Mart or open - air shopping centers with tiny parks and outdoor cafes sprinkled among fashion stores .
Only one enclosed mall has opened in the U.S. since 2006 : The Mall at Turtle Creek in Jonesboro , Ark .
It 's a big change , although the alternative - - a big box in a sea of asphalt - - is n't anything to write home about .

Barack Obama appeared this week with health - industry bigwigs , proclaiming light at the end of the health - care tunnel .
Among those gathered were executives from HMO giants Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Health Net Inc. , and the health - insurance lobbying group America ’s Health Insurance Plans ; from the American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association ; from medical - device companies ; and from the pharmaceutical industry , including the president and CEO of Merck and former Rep. Billy Tauzin , now president and CEO of PhRMA , the massive industry lobbying group .
They have pledged to voluntarily shave some $ 2 trillion off of U.S. health - care costs over 10 years .
But these groups , which are heavily invested in the U.S. health - care status quo , have little incentive to actually make good on their promises .
This is beginning to look like a replay of the failed 1993 health - care reform efforts led by then - first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Back then , the business interests took a hard line and waged a PR campaign , headlined by a fictitious middle - class couple , Harry and Louise , who feared a government - run health - care bureaucracy .
Still absent from the debate are advocates for single - payer , often referred to as the “ Canadian - style ” health care .
Single - payer health care is not “ socialized medicine . ”
According to Physicians for a National Health Program , single - payer means “ the government pays for care that is delivered in the private ( mostly not - for - profit ) sector . ”
A February CBS
News poll found that 59 percent in the U.S. say the government should provide national health insurance .
Single - payer advocates have been protesting in Senate Finance Committee hearings , chaired by Democratic Montana Sen. Max Baucus .
Last week , at a committee hearing with 15 industry speakers , not one represented the single - payer perspective .
A group of single - payer advocates , including doctors and lawyers , filled the hearing room and , one by one , interrupted the proceedings .
Protester Adam Schneider yelled : “ We need to have single - payer at the table .
I have friends who have died , who do n’t have health care , whose health care did not withstand their personal health emergencies .
… Single - payer now ! ”
Baucus gaveled for order , guffawing , “ We need more police . ”
The single - payer movement has taken his words as a rallying cry .
At a hearing Tuesday , five more were arrested .
They call themselves the “ Baucus 13 . ”
One of the Baucus 13 , Kevin Zeese , recently summarized Baucus ’ career campaign contributions :
“ From the insurance industry : $ 1,170,313 ;
health professionals : $ 1,016,276 ;
pharmaceuticals / health - products industry : $ 734,605 ;
hospitals / nursing homes : $ 541,891 ;
health services / HMOs : $ 439,700 . ”
That ’s almost $ 4 million from the very industries that have the most to gain or lose from health - care reform .
Another of the Baucus 13 , Russell Mokhiber , co-founder of SinglePayerAction.org , has been charged with “ disruption of Congress . ”
He was quick to respond : “ I charge Baucus with disrupting Congress .
It once was a democratic institution ; now it ’s corrupt , because of people like him .
He takes money from the industry and does their bidding .
He wo n’t even diffuse the situation by seating a single - payer advocate at the table . ”
As I traveled through Montana recently , from Missoula to Helena to Bozeman , health - care activists kept referring to Baucus as the “ money man . ” Montana state Sen. Christine Kaufmann sponsored an amendment to the Montana Constitution , granting everyone in Montana “ the right to quality health care regardless of ability to pay , ” or health care as a human right .
It died in committee .
Wisconsin Sen. Russ Feingold , a single - payer advocate , said his position will not likely prevail in Washington : “ I do n’t think there ’s any possibility that that will come out of this Congress . ”
That ’s if things remain business as usual .
Mario Savio led the Free Speech Movement on the UC Berkeley campus .
In 1964 , he said : “ There comes a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious , makes you so sick at heart , that you ca n’t take part , you ca n’t even passively take part , and you ’ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels , upon all the apparatus , and you ’ve got to make it stop .
And you ’ve got to indicate to the people who run it , the people who own it , that unless you ’re free , the machine will be prevented from working at all . ”
“ Unless you ’re free , ” the Baucus 13 might add , “ to speak . ”
The current official debate has locked single - payer options out of the discussion , but also escalated the movement — from Healthcare - NOW ! to Single Payer Action — to shut down the orderly functioning of the debate , until single - payer gets a seat at the table .

Ruby Proxies for Scale and Monitoring
Lift the curtain behind any modern web application and you will find at least a few proxy servers orchestrating the show .
Caching proxies such as Varnish and Squid help us take the load of our application servers ; reverse proxies such as Haproxy and Nginx help us partition and distribute the workload to multiple workers , all without revealing the underlying architecture to the user .
In the Ruby world , Rack middleware and Rails Metal are sister concepts : both allow the programmer to inject functionality in the pre or post - processing step of the HTTP request .
However , nobody said that we should limit ourselves to HTTP , or that the proxy server has to be transparent to the user !
After all , there is a great number of other potential use cases which we can use in our infrastructure : intercepting data , validating requests , benchmarking , logging , etc .
In fact , a proxy server can be a powerful swiss - army knife in the right hands .
Want to intercept SMTP traffic to detect spam ?
Maybe encrypt or decrypt a datastream on the fly ?
It ’s all surprisingly simple with Ruby .
Proxy language : Transparent , Intercepting , Cut - through …
Proxy servers can be placed in numerous places between the user and the destination , they can be chained and they can even alter the data at will .
A transparent proxy will not modify the request or response and is commonly used for load balancing , authentication , or validation .
On the other hand , an intercepting proxy is often used to modify the request or response to provide some added service to user or architect : transform data on the fly , encryption , extending a protocol , etc .
Needless to say , intercepting proxies are a wonderful tool !
Ruby Proxy : Duplex Benchmarking
With minimal overhead , a proxy server can allow us to duplicate a request to multiple servers , for example to production and staging .
Instead of the “ record and replay headache ” we can instrument ourselves with a real - time performance debugging and monitoring tool : a request gets forked but only the production response is forwarded back to the client .
From there , we can analyze the response time in realtime , compare the response bodies , or even alter the data at will :
options = { : proxy => { : port => 9000 , : host => " 10.2.1.0 " } , : production => { : port => 9000 , : host => " 10.2.1.1 " } , : benchmark => { : post => 9000 , : host => " 10.2.1.2 " } } EventMachine . run do EventMachine :: ProxyServer . new ( options ) . start end
em -proxy - Ruby EventMachine Duplex Proxy
EM - Proxy is a barebones proxy implemented with Ruby EventMachine which uses the reactor pattern for handling network connections .
The performance overhead in the simplest proxy implementation is roughly 3 - 5 % in the latency - a very low cost for the added functionality .
Best of all , it is only ~300 lines of Ruby start to finish , and easily extensible .
Take a look through the source , it ’s a powerful and wonderful hammer !
Updated slides from RailsConf 2009 and updated code for EM - Proxy on Github .
Let me explain .
I go to a private school that is rather strict .
Recently , the principal and school teacher council released a ( very long ) list of books we 're not allowed to read .
I was absolutely appalled , because a large number of the books were classics and others that are my favorites .
One of my personal favorites , The Catcher in the Rye , was on the list , so I decided to bring it to school to see if I would really get in trouble .
Well ... I did but not too much .
Then ( surprise ! ) a boy in my English class asked if he could borrow the book , because he heard it was very good AND it was banned !
This happened a lot and my locker got to overflowing with the banned books , so I decided to put the unoccupied locker next to me to a good use .
I now have 62 books in that locker , about half of what was on the list .
I took care only to bring the books with literary quality .
Some of these books are :
> The Perks of Being a Wallflower
> His Dark Materials trilogy
> Sabriel
> The Canterbury Tales
> Candide
> The Divine Comedy
> Paradise Lost
> The Godfather
> Mort
> Interview with the Vampire
> The Hunger Games
> The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy
> A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court
> Animal Farm
> The Witches
> Shade 's Children
> The Evolution of Man
> the Holy Qu'ran
... and lots more .
Anyway , I now operate a little mini-library that no one has access to but myself .
Practically a real library , because I keep an inventory log and give people due dates and everything .
I would be in so much trouble if I got caught , but I think it 's the right thing to do because before I started , almost no kid at school but myself took an active interest in reading !
Now not only are all the kids reading the banned books , but go out of their way to read anything they can get their hands on .
So I 'm doing a good thing , right ?
Oh , and since you 're probably wondering " Why ca n't you just go to a local library and check out the books ? " most of the kids are too chicken or their parents wo n't let them but the books .
I think that people should have open minds .
Most of the books were banned because they contained information that opposed Catholisism .
I limit my ' library ' to only the sophmores , juniors and seniors just in case so you can't say I 'm exposing young people to materiel they 're not mature enough for .
But is what I 'm doing wrong because parents and teachers do n't know about it and might not like it , or is it a good thing because I am starting appreciation of the classics and truly good novels ( Not just fad novels like Twilight ) in my generation ?
Harajuku style
The outrageous outfits of the Japanese boys and girls witch they often make themselves by mixing different styles , use a variety of fabrics , colors and accessories are typically for Harajuku style .
Find out what kind of different styles you can spot in the Harajuku district in Tokio and how to dress like these Japanes boys and girls .
Harajuku became famous in the 80s because of the street performers and imaginatively attired teens who gathered there on Sundays when the street with the upscale fashion boutiques and cafes , Omotesando , was closed for traffic .
This became the perfect meeting point to have fun , play music , and to show off .
Gothic Lolita , Visual Kei , Cosplay , Decora style and Kawaii are all variations of style in the Harajuku district .
Japanese boys and girls with their outrageous and flamboyant outfits walking in the area Harajuku in Tokyo .
They drawing their inspiration from Eastern and Western designers and fuse these cultures with their own individual style .
The nice thing about Japanese fashion is that not the brands but the teenagers dictate what the people will wear and the shops will start selling .
The teens are not afraid to customize and accessorise their own clothes , and to wear crazy outfits with a sense of humour .
Gothic Lolita
This style often is meant to make the wearer look doll - like , sweet and elegant .
It emphasizes Victorian - style girl ’s clothing and often aims to imitate the look of Victorian porcelain dolls .
On the other hand Gothic Lolita clothes have sometimes a very dark look .
Visual Kei
Visual Kei refers to a movement among Japanese rock musicians and is characterized by the use of elaborate costumes and eccentric looks and hairstyles .
The Visual Kei look usually involves striking make - up .
Kawaii
This means “ cute ” or “ pretty and generally relates to someone wearing clothing that appears to be made for young children or clothes that accentuate the cuteness of the individual .
Ruffles and pastels or bright colors may be worn , and accessories often include oversize toys or bags featuring animated characters .
Decora
This style is also known as “ Decoration ” .
Decora consists of bright colors and hair clips with bows .
Lots of layering and the accessories include plastic and furry toys and jewelry , which stick together and make noise as the wearer moves .
Cosplay
It is a Japanese subculture based on dressing like characters from manga , anime , and video games and is sometimes very extreme .
1.Mix and match
The most important thing about Harajuku style is to Mix and match different fashions .
They mix different styles and mismatch colors and patterns .
You can do anything you want , as long as your outfit is a thoughtful expression of your individuality .
2. Dress in layers .
One of the hallmarks of Harajuku is layering .
Sweaters , vests , or jackets over blouses over t- shirts , dresses worn with leggings , and so on .
Layering clothes ( or giving the appearance of layering by wearing ruffled dresses , for example ) adds more volume to your outfit .
3.Customize your clothes .
Secondhand clothing and do - it - yourself styles are popular ingredients in a Harajuku outfit .
Do you like a skirt but think it would look cuter with a ribbon pinned on it or with a more uneven , angular hemline ?
Get out the scissors and glue and make your clothes uniquely yours .
Or , go even further and make your own skirt .
4.Accessorize .
Add any wild accessories you have , such as belts , earrings , hair clips , jewelry , and handbags .
Remember , accessories can be colorful and loud , and they do n’t have to match your clothes .

Living with Jenny McCarthy must have infected Jim Carrey 's brain , because yesterday he posted an astonishingly fallacious antivaccination propaganda piece for the Huffington Post screed .
Carrey is the boyfriend of Public Health Threat Jenny McCarthy and has been an antivaccination advocate for some time .
He is a funny guy and a movie star , but I do n't think either of those things should give him a public voice wherein he can mislead people about vaccinations .
The article Carrey wrote has so much wrong in it that it almost qualifies as self - satirizing .
His very first paragraph is a textbook example of spin .
Basically , a few months ago a special court looked at three cases of potential damage due to vaccinations , and found no evidence of any connection .
About this , Carrey says :
... a ruling against causation in three cases out of more than 5000 hardly proves that other children wo n't be adversely affected by the MMR , let alone that all vaccines are safe .
This is a huge leap of logic by anyone 's standards .
That last line comes dangerously close to an out - and - out lie on Carrey 's part , and it 's certainly dead wrong .
The three cases that were presented to the special courts were chosen by the people presenting the cases themselves as the strongest of all their claims .
And the courts did far more than simply find no link between between vaccines and autism ; they called the antivax claims " speculative and unpersuasive . "
One of the special masters ( the judge , essentially ) in the cases also said that the parents of one child had " been misled by physicians who are guilty , in my view , of gross medical misjudgment . "
So that " huge leap of logic " Carrey complains about is actually a carefully reasoned and literally judicious step .
His case gets worse from there , and in fact contains this whopper : " We have never argued that people should n't be immunized for the most serious threats including measles and polio . "
I suppose that all depends on who he means by " we " ; if it includes Jenny McCarthy and their autism organization , well then it's not exactly the truth , as that is precisely and exactly what they been advocating .
I wo n't go into anything more Carrey says ; you can read the smackdowns at Skeptic Dad and Left Brain Right Brain [ edited to add : and Opposing Views ] to see many other things he says which are completely wrong .
More will come , no doubt .
It bothers me greatly that people with no scientific training and who are indeed ignoring and distorting scientific results have such a loud voice in the media , especially when it comes to the health of our children .
I for one will never watch another Jim Carrey movie again , ever .
I will make sure not a single dime of mine will go into his pocket , money that he will use to ultimately put the children of our nation and the world at risk of preventable diseases .
Vaccines do n't cause autism .
But what Carrey and McCarthy are advocating will certainly cause more outbreaks of diseases like measles , Hib , pertussis , and mumps .
The real health threat here is not vaccines , it 's the antivaccination movement .
The latest GoodReads newsletter is staring balefully out at me from my inbox , bolded and unread .
Below it is an invite from a semi- friend to join them on LibraryThing .
My Google Reader is stuffed with feeds from litblogs , and I 've just finished synching my iPod with the latest Podularity podcast .
But at the end of the day I 'll log off , pick up the dog - eared novel that was lent to me by an old , Facebook - phobic friend , put my phone on silent , shut my door , and read .
Just as I always have .
Online book clubs such as GoodReads promise to " connect people through reading " and of course that 's what social networks do : connect us , be it through a shared passion for reading , ponies , or the pre-1989 oeuvre of ELO .
But unlike other activities where people collaborate online in real time – gaming , writing , filmmaking , designing , throwing virtual sheep – it's pretty difficult ( and unsatisfactory ) for a community to " share " the act of reading , unless you 're Tweeting every time you turn a page , or lifestreaming a video of yourself curled in your chair .
Even if the novel in your hand comes in the smooth shell of a Kindle 2 , the actual act of reading whole books tends towards the private and offline .
During one tedious temping job I did consume Project Gutenberg 's Daniel Deronda at my desktop in a day , but the result was anaesthesia rather than enjoyment .
Last week , David Barnett wrote about the Guinness World Records Gamers Edition , which cyber - pimps the printed text to reassure youngsters weaned on the web that reading is as interactive and sociable as their favourite pursuit .
The design looks , of course , ridiculous .
Books create their own communities , and readers are invited to participate purely through their singular minds .
Social media have undeniably changed the way many of us talk about books , and encouraged us to do it more .
Whereas in the physical world there may be only certain contexts in which you 'd dive into a deconstruction of Dostoevsky 's metaphors , the virtual world provides round - the - clock opportunity to indulge your literary mores .
Personally , I have found this makes me form opinions about what I read more quickly and strongly , in the knowledge that I will be able to share them instantly , and have to defend them rigorously , online .
This is both good – in the sharpening of my critical faculties and confidence in my beliefs – and bad , as I can find myself jumping to premature , self - consciously entertaining or harsh conclusions for the sake of a scrap or a soundbite .
Social media have also changed the way many of us choose books ; blogs , forums and networks can be excellent places to discover old and long - forgotten , or new and little - publicised works ; Mark Sarvas 's The Elegant Variation and Dan Wickett 's Emerging Writers Network are two of the best .
But even acknowledging these shifts , I tend to cling on to more traditional behaviours with books than I do with other media such as music or film .
Online , I still rely heavily on reviews from paid professionals I respect - essentially old - fashioned , top - down outlets wrapped in pixels and podcasts .
And I still seek the majority of my literary recommendations and debates offline .
Maybe it is because literary taste is such an unpredictable and idiosyncratic beast that the " you liked that so you 'll like this " principle rarely works .
Maybe it is because my feelings about books are better articulated through the amorphous , halting mutations of physical conversation than the bald clarity of written words .
And when it comes to reading itself , I remain quietly relieved that it provides a fragile refuge where I can do something I do n't have to " share " .
I do n't have to mash up the themes to create something new or re-tweet a great passage .
There is real pleasure in consuming a finished product – self - contained and offered by an author unafraid to present themselves as a single authority , sans invitation to comment on the back pages or play with the novel 's open API .
Do n't get me wrong .
I love social media , I work in social media , and I think that its chaotic , democratic , irreverent connectivity and creativity is the great evolution of our times .
But books are wonderful because , in some way , they will always belong to each one of us , alone .
John Austin has held the sought - after seat since 1997
A tax investigator has been chosen to fight for a Labour seat in the next general election after a contest marred by allegations of vote tampering .
Party members in Erith and Thamesmead , south - east London , chose former councillor Teresa Pearce .
There had been complaints the daughter of Tony Blair 's polling guru Lord Gould was being favoured centrally ahead of local candidates .
In the event Georgia Gould came third in the selection process .
The seat is being vacated by MP John Austin , who is retiring at the general election .
Ballot box seal
Mr Austin , who had a majority of more than 10,000 at the last election , had complained the contest was " hijacked " by the national party .
In April the Olympics minister Tessa Jowell had to apologise to him for not saying she was visiting his seat to attend a meeting organised by Ms Gould .
After the seal on a ballot box was broken in April , all postal votes already cast were cancelled .
The Labour Party 's National Executive is continuing an investigation into the way the contest was conducted .
The eight candidates were interviewed by party members on Saturday and a ballot was held .

During an appearance of the Sue Jeffers show , Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - MN ) claimed that the recent expansion the Americorps program is a dream comes true for those who want to rid America of capitalism because the Americorps program is really reeducation camps for young people .
Here are the main quotes from the interview courtesy of Dump Bachmann :
Advertisements
Bachmann said that Americorps is really “ re-education camps for young people – and get trained in a philosophy that the government puts forward . ”
She continued , “ It is a dream come true for people who want to transform our country from a free - market economy to a centralized government planned economy .
It is completely different and antithetical to what our founders gave us and I think people should be shocked , they should be stunned with what is happening and the speed at which it ’s happening and in particular , what is happening with the G - 20 and the transnational aspects of what our President is committing our nation to . ”
Americorps is a national service program open to people of all ages .
Here are some of things that Americorps members do , tutor and mentor disadvantaged youth , fight illiteracy , improve health services , build affordable housing , teach computer skills , clean parks and streams , manage or operate after - school programs , help communities respond to disasters , build organizational capacity .
I know people who have served in the Americorps , and it is a great way to earn some extra money for school , or to pay back student loans .
There is no reeducation camp , and no ideological requirement to be involved .
I have Democrats and Republicans who have volunteered .
It is deplorable that Bachmann and many other Republicans would distort a good program that does important work in many underserved local communities just for the purposes of making a political point and feeding right wing paranoia .
Bachmann is obviously wrong , and she seems to know nothing about what the program really does .
These daily paranoid ramblings from members of the GOP are putting the United States on the verge of becoming a one party country .
When Republicans make outrageous claims like Bachmann does , it makes them look crazy , and turns the choice voters in a contest between a party of the sane , and a party of the insane .
Apparently , people have been receiving these calls over the past two days all across the country : similar calls are happening in New York , in Miami , in Denver , in Eugene , in Portland and elsewhere .
Kossack ban nock north of Denver reports getting a call from the same ( 210 ) number as mine .
Several individuals at Democratic Underground have reported receiving these calls -- some even twice in a single day .
Even more perplexing , many of the Kossacks and DU participants receiving these calls are unlisted , and their numbers not registered with any organizations .
Perhaps most importantly , these calls are illegal .
They do not violate the Do Not Call registry calls , as political calls remain exempt from the law .
However , it is required that all such robo calls mention the name of the organization sponsoring the call , and provide a callback number .
From FactCheck.org :
Federal law requires that groups making automated calls identify themselves at the beginning of the call and provide a call - back number .
The FEC says that a disclaimer must accompany public communication made by political committees or individuals .
However , specific regulations for political robo-calls vary from state to state .
J.Crosby at Texas ' Burnt Orange Report notes that Texas law ( where my robocall orginated ) clearly states that robo calls that fail to properly identify the entity behind the calls within 30 seconds are illegal .
None of the teabagger calls received across the country have identified their source , or provided a number to call back .
Thus , they are illegal , and at risk of heavy fines imposed for every single illegal call they have made , to the tune of thousands and thousands of dollars .
If you have received one of these illegal robo calls , I urge you to contact your state 's attorney general and complain .
A list of attorneys general state by state be found at the National Association of Attorneys General .
Perhaps more disturbingly , these robocalls appear to be going out completely at random , and without prior targeting of any kind .
They are going out to cell phones and landlines , progressives and Democrats and conservatives and Republicans , listed and unlisted numbers .
There appears to be little rhyme or reason to the locations of the calls , except that they appear to be in medium or large cities where teabaggers are getting together to do their thing .
It is possible that all these calls are the work of one or a few idiot miscreants with autodialers ( though that would n't explain the calls to unlisted numbers ) ; if this is the case , the culprits need to be found out , arrested , jailed and fined .
If , however , it is the work of a broader organization with significant funding , it demonstrates not only a foolish disregard for the law that should be punished accordingly , but also exactly the sort of political panic I described yesterday .
If the best the Right has to come up with against Obama is the worst sort of self - marginalized irrelevant protests that have been the hallmark of the most extremist elements of the Left , their goose is truly cooked .
Adding nation - wide non-targeted illegal robo calls is just worth one more guffaw at their expense .
Still , these violations should be taken seriously .
I urge every Kossack who has received one of these calls to complain to your Attorney General today .
And please post your experiences in this diary in as much detail as you feel comfortable , especially regarding your location , the nature of your phone number ( cell / landline , listed / unlisted , etc. ) and the source of the call .
If you have Caller ID info to share , please do so .
Best yet , if you have a recording of the call , please upload it in this diary .
Whoever is behind these illegal calls , let 's expose the bastards .

Right Wing Talk Radio Exploits Swine Flu to Trump Torture Prosecution Concerns [ Quotations from Media Matters ]
Michael Savage stated : " Make no mistake about it : Illegal aliens are the carriers of the new strain of human - swine avian flu from Mexico . "
Savage also stated , " If we lived in saner times , the borders would be closed immediately . "
Savage went on to theorize that the outbreak might be part of a bioterrorism threat : " [ C ] ould this be a terrorist attack through Mexico ?
Could our dear friends in the radical Islamic countries have concocted this virus and planted it in Mexico knowing that you , [ Homeland Security Secretary ]
Janet Napolitano , would do nothing to stop the flow of human traffic from Mexico ? "
Savage continued : " [ T ] hey are a perfect mule -- perfect mules for bringing this virus into America .
But you would n't think that way , would you ?
Because you are incapable of protecting America 's homeland , Napolitano . "
Savage also stated : " How do you protect yourself ?
What can you do ?
I 'll tell you what I 'm going to do , and I do n't give a damn if you do n't like what I 'm going to say .
I 'm going to have no contact anywhere with an illegal alien , and that starts in the restaurants . "
He added , " I will have no any illegal alien workers around me .
I will not have them in any of my properties , I will not have them anywhere near me . "
During the April 27 edition of his nationally syndicated radio show , Neal Boortz asked : " [ W ] hat better way to sneak a virus into this country than give it to Mexicans ?
Right ?
I mean , one out of every 10 people born in Mexico is already living up here , and the rest are trying to get here .
So you give -- you give -- you let this virus just spread in Mexico , where they do n't have a CDC . "
Boortz went on to say : " So if you want to get that epidemic into this country , get it going real good and hot south of the border .
And , you know , then just spread a rumor that there 's construction jobs available somewhere , and here it comes .
Because we 're not gonna do anything to stop them from coming across the border . "
In an April 25 blog post titled " Hey , maybe we 'll finally get serious about borders now , " syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor Michelle Malkin suggested that the outbreak was due to the United States ' " uncontrolled immigration , " writing : " I 've blogged for years about the spread of contagious diseases from around the world into the U.S. as a result of uncontrolled immigration .
We 've heard for years from reckless open - borders ideologues who continue to insist there 's nothing to worry about .
And we 've heard for years that calling any attention to the dangers of allowing untold numbers of people to pass across our borders and through our other ports of entry without proper medical screening -- as required of every legal visitor / immigrant to this country -- is RAAAACIST . "
Malkin added : " 9/11 did n't convince the open - borders zealots to put down their race cards and confront reality .
Maybe the threat of their sons or daughters contracting a deadly virus spread from south of the border to their Manhattan prep schools will . "
Contrary to Malkin 's suggestion , an April 27 Associated Press article reported of the New York City high school students infected with swine flu to whom she referred : " Officials think they started getting sick after some students returned from the spring break trip to Cancun . "
Institutionalized Racism at Fox News
Additionally , on the April 27 edition of his nationally syndicated radio show , Fox News host Glenn Beck stated : " Gee , it would be nice if we had border security now , would n't it ? "
Beck went on to assert : " But if you are a family and you 're down in Mexico and you 're dying and those in America are not , why would n't you flood this border ?
Why would n't you come across this border ?
It 's exactly what I warned of -- different scenario , different reason of -- I was talking about economic collapse .
People start to come and rush this border , then what happens ?
Gee , it would be nice if we had some border security . "
Media Matters for America has previously documented that CNN host Lou Dobbs repeatedly defended the false claim by CNN correspondent Christine Romans that the United States has seen a dramatic increase in leprosy cases , which Dobbs said was caused in part by " unscreened illegal immigrants coming into this country primarily from South Asia . "
Media Matters also noted that Fox News host Bill O'Reilly replied , " You might be right , " to a caller on his radio show who claimed that with the numerous diseases " the illegals " purportedly bring to this country , " each one of those people is a biological weapon , " and that the impact of illegal immigration " equals and surpasses the impact of 9 - 11 .

Twenty - three years ago , Chernobyl 's nuclear reactor # 4 exploded in the world 's worst nuclear accident to date .
Radioactive material was scattered across the surrounding countryside , and the authorities evacuated the nearby town of Pripyat , which remains a ghost town to this day .
However , nature has not evacuated the scene , and all manner of plants and animals continue to inhabit the area .
" There are no dogs with two heads , " says Martin Hajduch of the Slovak Academy of Sciences – although birds , insects and humans have all been affected to a greater or lesser extent by radioactive fallout [ New Scientist ] .
Hajduch and his colleagues wanted to study how plants had adapted to the radioactive soil , so they grew a plot of soybeans just three miles from the remains of the nuclear power plant , well within the restricted zone that extends 19 miles from the reactors .
They grew another patch of soybeans 60 miles from the power plant in uncontaminated soil , and analyzed the resulting beans .
Their findings not only illuminate the hardiness of life , they also suggest ways to genetically engineer plants to make them resistant to radiation .
In the study , published in the Journal of Proteome Research , Hajduch found that the beans grown in radioactive soil weighed half as much as the normal beans , and also had molecular abnormalities .
When compared with normal plants , beans from the high - radiation area had three times more cysteine synthase , a protein known to protect plants by binding heavy metals .
They also had 32 % more betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase , a compound found to reduce chromosomal abnormalities in human blood exposed to radiation ....
The plants seem to be protecting themselves from Chernobyl 's low - level radiation , says Hajduch , but no one knows how these protein changes translate into survival , or if they 'll be passed on to the plants ' offspring [ ScienceNOW Daily News ] .
By boosting levels of these proteins in other plants , scientists could theoretically
engineer radiation - resistant plants , Hajduch says .
While few farmers are eager to cultivate radioactive plots on Earth , future interplanetary travellers may need to grow crops to withstand space radiation [ New Scientist ] .
If astronauts are growing soybeans on Mars one day , they may have these Chernobyl researchers to thank .

Sanjaya Baru , former media adviser to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , says left - wing parties were far closer to agreeing a nuclear deal between India and the US last year than previously realised .
In the end hardline left - wingers scuppered the compromise and the Left withdrew from the ruling coalition , Mr Baru says .
He also reveals the anxiety surrounding Mr Singh 's visit to Kashmir in 2005 .
Here he shares details of key moments during Mr Singh 's time in office .
NUCLEAR DEAL
Even on the nuclear agreement - by which American companies can sell nuclear reactors , fuel and technology to India - the prime minister was willing to let the Left front take credit for securing a final agreement that was in the nation 's interests !
Officially , the communists opposed the nuclear deal
This was a compromise formula communicated to the prime minister by a senior Left leader .
When the final 123 Agreement between India and the US was made a public document , one view within the Left front was that they should take credit by claiming that they had helped secure a better outcome than what the prime minister was capable of securing from the Americans .
" We will say that it is our stand in parliament that forced the government to negotiate a better agreement , " they were saying .
" This way we can support the agreement and at the same time be seen distancing ourselves from the Congress and the prime minister . "
If this view had prevailed in the higher councils of the Left front , Mr Singh 's government would have served its full term with no problem .
At least one senior Left leader - who had said to Manmohan Singh when he took charge as prime minister , " I assure you of our support for a full five - year term " - wanted to go along with this compromise formula so that he could keep his word .
Clearly , Mr Singh was willing to stoop to conquer .
But when this compromise formula was rejected by the hardliners in the Left , he had no option but to show the iron fist in his velvet glove .
Never under -estimate the determination of a self - made man !
KASHMIR BUS
As we prepared to leave for Srinagar ( the summer capital of Indian - administered Kashmir ) , where he would inaugurate the first Srinagar - Muzaffarabad passenger bus service , news broke of a terrorist attack on the tourist complex in Srinagar .
The encounter between terrorists and security forces took its toll .
Mr Singh was determined that the bus route should go ahead
The rest of the day and evening was spent trying to assess the situation and decide whether the prime minister and Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi would fly next morning to Srinagar or not .
It was possible that an even bigger attack had been planned for the next day .
In the evening the home minister and all senior security officials , including the national security adviser , chiefs of intelligence agencies and others gathered at the official home of the prime minister .
The consensus was that the bus service launch should be postponed .
Even as the meeting progressed the prime minister received phone calls from senior cabinet colleagues and some chief ministers expressing their concern for his safety and that of Mrs Gandhi .
She called the PM and told him that she would go by his advice and decision .
Advice against going ahead with the programme kept pouring in - almost no one in authority could guarantee the 100 % safety of the PM .
After landing at Srinagar airport he would have to travel to the venue of the public meeting either by road or helicopter .
Terrorists could attack anywhere .
The weather was playing truant .
It could rain .
Which meant the helicopter ride would be difficult .
Going by road would require a security clampdown of an order that the PM did not favour .
Deeply worried " I can not impose a curfew in Srinagar and then go to launch a bus service ! " an angry PM said when someone suggested that option .
At the end of a long evening the official advice was , " postpone the event " .
One by one all the ministers and officers left .
The PM was tired and looked deeply worried .
I sat with him alone for a few minutes in complete silence .
The TV in the room was on , showing the day 's destruction in Srinagar .
Fire , gun shots , a building burnt , people crying .
We stared at the TV without a word .
After what seemed like ages he spoke .
" I will go , " he said , and asked his secretary to connect him to Mrs Gandhi .
" I do n't want to postpone tomorrow 's programme " he told her , " I will go . "
She agreed , and said she would go too .
I rushed out to inform the media .
SINGH'S CONSENSUAL STYLE
More often than not Mr Singh would get his way through patient consultation .
Mr Singh would ' keep everyone in the loop '
There is no major decision I am aware of on which he had not consulted his senior colleagues and senior coalition leaders .
There is of course the institution of the weekly Friday meeting of the Congress Party 's " Core Group " .
The group included the PM , the Congress president and a handful of senior party leaders .
It would meet every Friday .
But apart from this formal consultation , he would be on the telephone with leaders like Karunanidhi , Sharad Pawar and Laloo Prasad to keep them informed on every major decision and get their concurrence before acting .
His is a classic cabinet style of functioning .
On major policy issues he would even keep the Left in the loop .
The downside of such a consultative process is , of course , that decision - making takes time and tough decisions do n't always get taken .
But that is the price we pay for having diverse coalitions .
There is a paradox in the liberal angst about politics and policy in India .
On the one hand we celebrate coalitions as a mirror of our diversity , on the other hand we want " tough " leaders who will impose their will .
Manmohan
Singh 's style of functioning reflects the genius of consensual policy - making in the era of coalitions when leaders stoop to conquer and soften their blows with velvet gloves !

Oh !
God , now I know it is serious .
The Health Protection Agency has sent me an algorithm to tell me how to deal with swine flu .
It arrived today in an email with one of those red exclamation marks at the side .
An algorithm , for those who do n't know , is a " finite sequence of instructions , an explicit , step - by - step procedure for solving a problem " .
It is very complicated .
I do not understand it .
Fortunately the primary care trust has also sent me a red exclamation mark email with instructions I can understand : " The main message remains : always use a tissue to catch coughs and sneezes , throw away used tissues and regularly wash your hands . "
I can relate to that .
Trouble is , it makes me giggle .
I can't get that old jingle , from somewhere in early childhood , out of my mind .
" Coughs and sneezes spread diseases , trap your germs in your handkerchief . "
It has rhythm .
It is best recited in a " Mail train " monotone .
Lovers of Tony Hancock will want to sing it to the tune of Deutschland , Deutschland über alles .
Doctor , you 're not taking this seriously .
Actually , I am .
We have all read our way through the mountains of circulars that have arrived .
We are having a daily practice meeting .
We have one partner designated to take all the " flu " - related calls so our advice is consistent .
Yesterday we had two such calls : a patient just returned from Turkey who had diarrhoea and wondered if it could be flu , and an elderly lady wanting advice about her husband who has respiratory problems .
Should he be started on Tamiflu ?
Simple answer : No .
Today , so far , there have been no calls at all .
We have 15,000 patients and are close to one of the larger airports in England , but have not seen a case of flu .
We have not had a single patient worrying that he or she might have flu .
It feels like a phoney war .
We have seen two patients with heart attacks , three acute asthmatic attacks , and a child who had swallowed an implausibly large piece of Lego .
Such is general practice .
We met at lunchtime , not to talk of heart attacks and Lego , but of flu .
There have been deaths in Mexico .
There has been one in the US .
Our Indian partner said : " There were 2,000 deaths , mainly children in Africa and Asia , yesterday . "
Our medical student looked shocked : " I did n't know swine flu had reached that part of the world . "
" It has n't , " said our partner .
" I 'm talking of deaths from malaria .
But that is n't news , is it ? "
We were silent for a while .
Time to get things in proportion .
College students ' views about evolution and creationism are often shaped by what they learned in their high school biology classes , according to a University of Minnesota study published in the May issue of BioScience , the journal of the American Institute of Biological Sciences .
Co-authors Randy Moore and Sehoya Cotner , professors in the College of Biological Sciences , surveyed 1,000 students taking introductory biology classes at the University of Minnesota to learn how biology majors view evolution compared to non-majors .
Results showed that the two groups ' views were similar and revealed that high school biology teachers influence whether majors and non-majors college students accept evolution or question it based on creationism .
About two thirds of students from both groups said their high school biology class included evolution and not creationism .
Only 1 to 2 percent of classes covered creationism and not evolution .
And 6 to 13 percent of classes did not cover either evolution or creationism .
But 29 percent of majors and 21 percent of non-majors said their high school biology class covered both evolution and creationism .
Students whose high school biology class included creationism ( with or without evolution ) were more likely to accept creationist views as entering college students .
Similarly , students exposed to evolutionism but not creationism were more likely to accept evolution in college .
For example , 72 to 78 percent of students exposed to evolution only agreed that it is scientifically valid while 57 to 59 percent of students who were exposed to creationism agreed that it can be validated .
" I 've long known that many biology teachers teach creationism , but was surprised to learn they have such a strong impact , " said Randy Moore , professor of biology and lead author .
" It 's unfortunate that so many teachers think their religious beliefs are science .
Teachers who do n't teach evolution deny students the understanding of one of the greatest principles in history . "
" I was shocked that there were n't bigger differences between majors and non-majors , " said Sehoya Cotner , associate professor of biology .
" Evolution is the foundation of the entire discipline .
It leads me to believe that these students are probably interested in biology for reasons besides gaining a full understanding and appreciation of the science . "
The article included a review of previous studies that explain why so many high school biology teachers endorse creationism .
The studies say that more than 25 percent of biology teachers do not know it is unconstitutional to teach creationism .
One third did n't major in biology in college and never studied evolution .
One fourth believe that creationism can be proven scientifically .
Administrators , parents or colleagues may pressure them .
There are usually no consequences for teachers who do not cover evolution or who teach creationism .
The authors are interested in working with high school biology teachers -- and particularly with college students who plan to teach biology -- to improve their understanding of evolution and develop best practices for covering sensitive topics such as human evolution and life 's origins .

President Barack Obama signed new credit card rules into law Friday , starting the clock ticking on the advent of a host of consumer protections slated to start as early as August .
“ With this bill we ’re putting in place some common sense reforms , ” the president said during signing ceremonies at the White House .
As he signed the law , he was flanked by key Congress members who helped usher in the legislation .
The Credit Card Accountability , Responsibility and Disclosure Act ( or Credit CARD Act ) of 2009 includes the most sweeping changes in how credit cards are marketed , advertised and managed in decades .
The law limits when credit card interest rates can be increased on existing balances and allows consumers whose interest rates have been increased to reduce their annual percentage rates ( APRs ) to previous levels if they ’ve been good and paid their bills on time for six months .
Read the act .
45 days ’ notice starting Aug. 20
Consumer protections will be phased in over the next 15 months with the earliest starting Aug. 20 , 2009 .
By that date , all card issuers must begin giving 45 - day advance notice of significant changes in card terms .
That is also the deadline for giving consumers at least 21 days ( instead of the current 14 ) to pay their monthly credit card bills .
( See an interactive timeline of how the bill became law and when its provisions take effect . )
The bulk of the consumer protections — limiting when interest rates can be increased , banning universal default and double - cycle billing , and restricting credit cards for minors , among others — take effect Feb. 22 , 2010 .
The timing of the law was a major point of contention during Congressional debate on the bill .
Consumer advocates argued families struggling in the recession needed help sooner while banking lobbyists pushed for more time to implement changes in billing , operations and computer systems required by the law .
Provisions for restoring interest rates to previous levels if cardholders show six months of good behavior do not start until Aug. 22 , 2010 .
Making gift cards valid for at least five years and requiring that fees are reasonable also take effect by August 2010 .
Federal rules approved by regulators in December 2008 overlap with the new law and cover many but not all of the same practices .
Those federal rules take effect July 1 , 2010 .
Other provisions of the bill include :
Fines of up to $ 5,000 for card issuers that violate the act .
Banning universal default and double - cycle billing .
Prohibiting over - limit fees unless consumers agree to allow transactions that exceed their credit limits to go through rather than be denied .
Fees for late payments , over - limit charges or other penalty fees must be reasonable and related to the violation .
Extending the life of gift cards and gift certificates so that they cannot expire within five years of activation .
Banning dormancy or inactivity fees on gift cards unless there has been no activity in a 12 - month period .
Banning credit cards for people under the age of 21 unless they have adult co-signers or show proof that they have the means to repay the debts .
College students must get permission from parents or guardians to increase credit limits on joint accounts they hold with those adults .
The new law will ban those free pizza and T - shirt giveaways — popular on many college campuses — if students sign up for credit cards .
Colleges , universities and alumni associations would have to disclose the nature of contracts they sign with credit card marketers allowing access to student and alumni contact information .
Requiring that card issuers disclose how long it would take to pay off credit card balances if cardholders make only minimum payments each month and how much users would have to pay each month if they want to pay off their balances in 36 months .
Obama said the law is for “ people who found out that credit cards are a one - way street .
It ’s easy to get in but almost impossible to get out . ”
He warned , however , that the law does n’t give consumers an easy pass :
“ We expect consumers to live within their means and pay what they owe , ” the president said .
U.S. Sen . Carl Levin , a Michigan Democrat who has been holding hearings on credit card abuses since 2007 , attended the signing along with Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York and Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut .
Both are credited with ushering the legislation through the House and Senate , respectively , leading up to this week ’s passage .
“ Credit card companies have crossed line after line with outrageous practices that hurt American families and businesses , ” Levin said .
“ They underestimated the ability of Congress to turn public outcry into public policy .
We faced powerful forces against this effort , but we prevailed .
Millions of Americans will benefit now that some balance of power is being restored between cardholders and card issuers . ”
Said Dodd : “ Gone are the days of gouging hardworking families with ‘ any time , any reason ’ rate increases and unreasonable fees and penalties .
With the signing of this bill , President Obama has ushered in a new era where consumer protections will be strong and reliable , rules transparent and fair , and statements clear and informative …
Today is the day we finally make credit card companies accountable to their customers and responsible for their actions . ”
Not covered
The new law does not cap how high interest rates can go .
Nor does it limit when APRs can be hiked on future purchases .
People with business or corporate credit cards will not have the same protections as people with personal credit cards because the new law and the federal rules apply only to consumer credit cards .
The banking industry has said the new law would mean higher interest rates for all customers — including those who pay their bills on time and have good credit — and lowered credit limits or no credit cards at all for high risk customers with bad credit .
Annual fees would also return as a routine component of many cards , according to issuers .
“ Credit cards provide access to credit for millions of Americans and small businesses every day , ” Kenneth Clayton , senior vice president for card policy for the American Bankers Association , said after the senate Banking committee approved a previous version of the reform bill .
“ Making this credit available is a very risky business and the committee ’s action today will unfortunately make it harder — not easier — for banks to continue doing so .
Credit card lenders of all sizes will likely have to pull back on providing reasonably - priced credit to a wide range of consumers and small businesses .
It is hard to see how that makes good policy sense . ”
Opponents of the law say the majority of Americans manage their credit well and the new restrictions will hurt those consumers more than help card users who default on payments .
Opponents also objected to the timing of the law , saying it will restrict credit at a time when the economy needs more consumer spending to pull out of the recession .
Many of the major banks have received federal tax dollars to help bail them out of the Wall Street meltdown .
Credit industry analysts have projected those banks will struggle to make profits into 2010 as credit card defaults rise to record levels .
Some industry estimates are that the new law could cost banks tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue from interest charges and late fees and penalties .
Credit industry analyst R.K.
Hammer estimates that credit card companies will generate $ 20.5 billion in fees in 2009 — up from $ 19 billion in 2008 .
“ Who are they kidding ? ” Maloney asked in a newsletter sent minutes after the signing to her supporters .
“ They ’ve already been cutting credit lines and raising rates as a result of the overall financial crisis . ”
She added : “ It was a long and bumpy road .
Some credit card issuers fought these reforms every step of the way — and they were still at it as recently as Tuesday , claiming these reforms will hurt consumers and result in increased interest rates and reduced credit availability . ”
Guns at national parks
Asked about an unrelated provision in the bill allowing visitors to U.S. National Parks and refuges to legally carry licensed , loaded firearms , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters during Friday ’s press briefing , just before the signing ceremony , that Obama would sign the bill with the gun provision included : “ Overall , the credit card reform bill is important for consumers and should be signed , ” Gibbs told reporters .
The gun clause takes effect Feb. 22 , 2010 .

AMID the hubbub over a few less - bad - than - expected statistics , America 's economic debate has turned to the nature of the recovery .
Optimists expect a vigorous rebound as confidence returns , pent - up demand is unleashed and massive government stimulus takes effect .
Most observers , including this newspaper , are bracing for a long slog , as debt - laden consumers rebuild their savings , output growth remains weak and unemployment continues to rise .
There is , however , something that eventually will have a much bigger impact on Americans ' prosperity than the slope of the recovery .
That is the effect of the crisis on America 's potential rate of growth itself .
An economy 's long - term speed limit ( its “ trend ” or “ potential ” rate of growth ) is the pace at which GDP can expand without affecting unemployment and , hence , inflation .
It is determined by growth in the supply of labour ( the number of workers and how long they toil ) along with the speed with which productivity improves .
The pace of potential growth helps determine the sustainability of everything from public debt to the prices of shares .
Unfortunately , the outlook for America 's potential growth rate was darkening long before the financial crisis hit .
The IT - induced productivity revolution , which sent potential output soaring at the end of the 1990s , has waned .
More important , America 's labour supply is growing more slowly as the population ages , the share of women working has levelled off and that of students who work has fallen .
Since 1991 the labour supply has risen at an average annual pace of 1.1 % .
Over the next decade the Congressional Budget Office expects a 0.6 % annual increase .
According to Robert Gordon , a productivity guru at Northwestern University , America 's trend rate of growth in 2008 was only 2.5 % , the lowest rate in its history , and well below the 3 - 3.5 % that many took for granted a few years ago .
Without factoring in the financial crisis , Mr Gordon expects potential growth to fall to 2.35 % over the coming years .
That alone is grim news .
But has the Great Recession made things worse ?
In theory , it could do .
Slumping investment may slow the pace of innovation .
Soaring government debt could raise interest rates .
Higher taxes , designed to reduce the debt , might dull incentives to work and invest .
More regulation , in finance and beyond , could deter innovation .
Workers ' skills may atrophy as a result of joblessness .
On the plus side , well - targeted government spending on , say , infrastructure or education could boost potential output , while the huge wealth that Americans have lost may induce more of them to work for longer .
History sends mixed signals about how much these effects matter .
Surprisingly , the 1930s bode well .
Despite the deep slump in growth and investment , America 's potential growth rate is reckoned to have risen smartly during the decade , as innovations from nylon to synthetic rubber proliferated , while business processes were fundamentally overhauled .
Alexander Field , an economist at Santa Clara University , has called the 1930s the “ most technologically progressive ” decade of the 20th century .
In the modern era Sweden offers grounds for optimism .
Its productivity growth accelerated after the early 1990s financial crash , in part because the government dealt swiftly with the banking mess .
Japan , in contrast , saw productivity growth shrivel in the early 1990s .
Several studies pin blame for that on Japan 's unwillingness to tackle its banking mess .
But the process was not irreversible ; Adam Posen of the Peterson Institute has argued that by the late 1990s Japan 's potential output had risen modestly , thanks to financial reform and broader deregulation .
Nor is there much sign that Japan 's gaping budget deficits have crowded out private investment .
Yields on long - term Japanese bonds slumped from 7 % in 1990 to 1 % in 2003 , and are still only 1.45 % , even as gross public debt is heading for 200 % of GDP .
Is this cause for optimism about America ?
Possibly not .
Compared with the 1930s , America 's workers are more specialised , which makes it harder to shift occupation ; they are also more cushioned with social protection , which reduces the urgency to adapt .
Workers are less flexible because the housing bust will prevent many from selling their houses to move to where the jobs are .
JPMorgan estimates that America 's natural rate of joblessness may have risen from 4.75 % to closer to 6 % .
Today 's investment slump may have particularly pernicious effects on productivity because , unlike Japan's , it does not follow a capital - spending binge .
During the recent bubble years , America 's housing investment boomed , but corporate investment was laid low by the dotcom bust .
Debt burden
Most important , even if Americans become thriftier , soaring public debt may crowd out private investment more than in Japan , which , unlike America , is a creditor country .
Already American bond yields are starting to rise .
Academics differ about just how much bigger budget deficits and higher public debt affect interest rates , but most agree that they do .
A 2004 study suggests that interest rates rise by 0.03 % for every 1 % increase in the debt / GDP ratio .
That ratio is set to rise by 30 percentage points between 2008 and 2011 , which implies a 1 % higher risk - free interest rate , and commensurately lower private - sector investment .
Even if higher private saving blunts the effect , some crowding out is eventually all too likely .
All of these effects can be mitigated by good policies , or exacerbated by bad ones .
Sensible approaches to reducing America 's long - term deficit , by tackling entitlement spending or reforming the tax code , would minimise the rise in long - term yields and might even boost potential growth .
Misguided efforts to prop up declining industries or dictate lending decisions would add to the damage .
America is heading for an era of slower growth .
Just how much slower is still up for grabs .
With markets and the media riveted by China ’s hunt for natural resources in Australia , Africa and Latin America , the Middle East story has perhaps been underplayed .
That ’s the view of Ben Simpfendorfer , an economist in Hong Kong for Royal Bank of Scotland , who seeks to redress the balance in his new book , “ The New Silk Road : How a Rising Arab World is Turning Away from the West and Rediscovering China . ”
For Mr. Simpfendorfer , who speaks Arabic and Chinese , the world is witnessing nothing less than two historical powers simultaneously reclaiming their economic and cultural primacy in the world .
“ The stories often appear unrelated , but they are in fact part of a larger global rebalancing that represents the rise of the East after centuries of Western dominance , ” he writes .
These are grand claims .
Do they stack up ?
Xu Changwen , a researcher at the Chinese Ministry of Commerce , said a complementary trade structure had fueled the boom : China needs oil from the Middle East , which is an avid buyer of Chinese clothes and other consumer goods .
Talks on a free - trade deal with the Gulf Cooperation Council underlined the scope to develop ties , but one should keep a sense of proportion , Mr. Xu said .
“ Market demand from the United States and Europe is huge and will recover when the financial crisis is over , so it ’s still too early to say anything like ‘ The Middle East will replace the U.S. and Europe , ” ’ he said .
Ninety - three children and 25 adult women are among a list of 140 names of Afghans who villagers say were killed in a battle and U.S. air strikes last week , causing a crisis between Washington and its Afghan allies .
The list , obtained by Reuters , bears the endorsement of seven senior provincial and central government officials , including an Afghan two - star general who headed a task force dispatched by the government to investigate the incident .
Titled " list of the martyrs of the bombardment of Bala Boluk district of Farah Province " , it includes the name , age and father 's name of each alleged victim .
The youngest was listed as 8 - day - old baby Sayed Musa , son of Sayed Adam .
Fifty - three victims were girls under the age of 18 , and 40 were boys .
Only 22 were men 18 or older .
The U.S. military continues to dispute the toll and a military spokesman said some of the names could be fake .
The dispute over the number of dead has worsened tension between Washington and Kabul , despite apologies President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made during a visit to Washington by President Hamid Karzai last week .
The Afghan government has endorsed the list , and Karzai went on U.S. television to call for an end to all U.S. air strikes , only to be rebuffed by Washington .
Afghan officials say the issue helps insurgents by turning the public against foreign forces .
Since last year , U.S. officials adopted new procedures for investigations of civilian casualties designed to ensure their statements agree with those of the Afghan government .
Nevertheless , Washington has continued to dispute the death toll .
U.S. military spokesman Colonel Greg Julian said villagers had an incentive to invent names of dead relatives in the hope of collecting compensation .
U.S. SAYS NO PROOF" Well I could give you 140 names too .
The problem is there is no evidence of that number of graves ...
Are those real people ?
Did they ever actually exist ?
I can give you a list of 53 girls names with their ages , " he said " There are no birth certificates and there are no death certificates . " " Conditions exist that encourage exaggeration , " Julian added .
"
If you say that the Taliban killed your family you 'd get nothing .
If you say the Americans killed your family , you might get assistance , whether they existed or not .
" Julian said investigators had been shown 26 individual graves at the site and one mass grave , which he said was not large enough to contain so many bodies .
He estimated the overall toll could not exceed 80 .
Because of cultural sensitivity , there were no plans to dig up the graves to determine how many were buried inside , he said .
The U.S. military blames the Taliban for causing the deaths deliberately by herding civilians into houses it knew would be targeted by U.S. troops sent to rescue Afghan police and soldiers from an ambush .
It also says the Taliban may have killed some of the villagers with grenades .
" Do n't forget about who is responsible for this whole thing .
This was a deliberate plan to create human sacrifices and then blame us , " Julian said .
Karzai told CNN last week that Washington needs to rely on other tactics besides air strikes when it is facing Taliban fighters in villages where civilians might be present .
"
The air strikes are not acceptable , " Karzai said .
" Terrorism is not in Afghan villages , not in Afghan homes .
And you cannot defeat terrorists by air strikes .
" But White House National Security Advisor James Jones said on Sunday that U.S. forces need air power to protect themselves : " We can't fight with one hand tied behind our back . "
With Los Angeles Cardinal Roger Mahony prominently among them , many of the nation ’s senior Roman Catholic bishops are nearing mandatory retirement , offering the Vatican a significant opportunity to reshape the American church .
In Los Angeles , home to the country ’s largest Catholic archdiocese , the shift could open the way for a bishop to become the first Latino cardinal in the United States .
Three Latinos , two from California , already are rumored to be possible successors to Mahony , 73 .
Nationwide , the retirements will provide Pope Benedict XVI a chance to put his stamp on a church that is struggling to serve growing ranks of immigrants and recover from clergy sexual abuse scandals .
Nearly one - third of 265 active U.S. bishops must submit letters of resignation to the pope within five years because they will have reached the mandatory retirement age of 75 .
More than half the bishops will reach the milestone within 10 years .
Advertisement
The roster of upcoming resignations includes several of the country ’s most influential prelates , including Chicago Cardinal Francis George , 72 , the current president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , and Philadelphia Cardinal Justin Rigali , 73 , who sits on a powerful Vatican panel that recommends bishop candidates to the pope .
Also on the list is Cardinal William J. Levada , 72 , the former archbishop of San Francisco who is now the Vatican ’s chief theologian and point man on cases of sexual abuse forwarded by bishops worldwide .
Most of the retiring bishops will probably remain on the job for a year or more after their 75th birthdays while successors are found .
The pope ultimately decides when to accept the resignations .
Church scholars say the departures of so many high - level prelates -- a coincidence as well as a rarity -- will open the door to a new generation of leaders unencumbered by the U.S. Catholic Church ’s sexual abuse crisis , which has led to more than $ 2 billion in legal settlements .
Advertisement
“ So much of that fresh start depends on how the successor handles the problems ” in each diocese , said the Rev. Anthony Pogorelc , a sociologist of religion at the Catholic University of America .
“ It will depend on transparency . ”
The impending change in leadership comes as the U.S. church confronts a serious shortage of priests and demographic changes that are dramatically altering the composition of the nation ’s Catholics , an estimated 64 million .
The number of Catholics is shrinking in the Northeast , leading to the closing of parishes and schools , even as Catholic populations balloon in the southern and western parts of the country because of Latin American immigration .
Latinos make up more than one - third of the U.S. Catholic population and will probably become a majority in the next decade , according to figures provided by the Conference of Catholic Bishops .
Immigrants from Asia , Africa and Eastern Europe are adding to the ethnic and racial mix .

“ The future of American Catholics is one of rich diversity , ” said Matthew Bunson , editor of the Catholic Almanac .
Responding to that diversity , Bunson said , “ is going to be one of the major strategic pastoral questions for the church in the 21st century . ”
Nowhere are these forces more evident than in Los Angeles .
The three - county archdiocese has more than doubled in size over the last 30 years , now surpassing 4 million Catholics , according to the Catholic Almanac .
That ’s nearly twice the size of the next largest archdiocese , in New York .
L.A. 's phenomenal growth has been driven largely by Latinos , who make up 75 % of the archdiocese ’s population , a spokesman said .

During more than two decades as head of the Los Angeles archdiocese , Mahony has earned scorn for his handling of sex abuse scandals but praise for integrating Latinos and other immigrant communities into the church and for his advocacy of immigrant and migrant rights , issues he has embraced since his days as a priest .
Many Latinos see the Spanish - speaking cardinal -- who is of German - Italian ancestry -- as one of their own .
Mahony declined to comment .
But church scholars say it is only a matter of time before a Latino is named archbishop , and eventually cardinal , in Los Angeles , long considered the second - biggest prize in the U.S. Catholic hierarchy , after New York .
Although decisions about bishops are made secretly in Rome , the names of at least three possible Mahony successors have begun to circulate : Sacramento Bishop Jaime Soto , 53 ; San Antonio Archbishop Jose Gomez , 57 ; and Monterey Bishop Richard John Garcia , 61 .
The three come from a slim field .
Just 26 of the nation ’s active bishops are Latino , according to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate .
The number of U.S. Latino priests -- who can eventually join the ranks of bishops -- is even thinner : Roughly 3,000 of approximately 41,000 , or 7 % .

The Vatican ’s ambassador to the United States , Archbishop Pietro Sambi , declined to comment .
Church experts say Benedict ’s recent appointments suggest that he is concerned more with orthodoxy than ethnicity and with putting a positive public face on the church .
His aim , scholars say , is to see the church grow and move beyond the sexual abuse crisis of the last decade .
The analysts point , for example , to the recent naming of Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan to succeed Cardinal Edward M. Egan in the Archdiocese of New York .
Dolan will be installed April 15 .
A theological conservative who has won praise for his warmth , openness and sense of humor , Dolan is credited with helping to heal a shaken archdiocese in Milwaukee after he took over as archbishop in 2002 .
He followed Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland , who resigned at 75 after acknowledging that the archdiocese had paid a $ 450,000 settlement to a man who accused Weakland of sexual assault .

Dolan “ was seen as restoring confidence , ” said John Allen , a senior correspondent with the National Catholic Reporter .
“ He brought a new burst of energy . ”
Dolan ’s appointment , though warmly greeted in general , did prompt some grumbling from Latinos , who noted that yet another Irish American was named to head an increasingly Latino archdiocese .
“ The challenge for the future of U.S. Catholicism is integrating Anglos and Hispanics into something that is inclusive , that is truly one church , ” said Rocco Palmo , whose blog , Whispers in the Loggia , chronicles church hierarchy .
One symbolic changing of the guard was on dramatic display last month at the ordination ceremony for an auxiliary bishop , Cirilo Flores , 60 , in the diocese of Orange , one of the largest in the country .

Twenty - two Catholic bishops , virtually all of them white , attended the ceremony at St. Columban Catholic Church in Garden Grove .
The dignitaries included Mahony and Archbishop George Niederauer of San Francisco , as well as several Protestant , Eastern Orthodox , Coptic , Jewish , Mormon and Islamic leaders .
During the ceremony , the Catholic bishops strode in front of Flores and placed their hands on his head , one at a time , to confer the Holy Spirit on him .
Bishop Tod D. Brown , the diocese leader , also anointed Flores on the head with holy oil and offered a homily filled with words of encouragement .
“ A bishop is to be like a shepherd who knows his sheep and is known by them , and who does not hesitate to lay down his life for them , ” he told the nearly 2,000 people packed into the church .
“ In this service , bishops are those who make statements , take stands against injustices -- particularly of late , in the protection of the most vulnerable : those in the womb and immigrants . ”
It ’s Flores ’ job to help Brown run the Orange County diocese with one other auxiliary , Dominic M. Luong , the nation ’s only Vietnamese American bishop .
More change is in the offing as Flores assumes his duties .
Advertisement
Brown is 72 , and his diocese , with 1.2 million Catholics , continues to attract Latinos , Filipinos , Chinese and Vietnamese .
Although Brown spoke in an interview about his diocese , he could have been talking about the U.S. church when he observed that cultural sensitivity and bilingual skills will be key for priests and bishops serving diverse populations .
“ Anyone sitting in that chair must be able to identify with different groups and serve them , ” Brown said .
“ If he can ’t , he ’s not the right person for that job . ”

Child Witches : Accused in the Name of Jesus Christian pastors in Congo are paid to perform violent exorcisms on children .
KINSHASA , CONGO , May 21 , 2009  --
In a dirt - floored , back - alley church , 8 - year - old Bobby and his 6 - year - old brother Henock were made to kneel before a pastor wearing a white , flowing robe adorned with pictures of Jesus .
Looming over the boys , Pastor Moise Tshombe went into a trance , during which he claimed the Holy Spirit took over and the voice of God spoke through him .
" I see that witchcraft is in these two , " Tshombe said .
" The threats inside of them are very strong . "
These young brothers were the latest victims in an epidemic of accusations of child witchcraft here in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
It is raging in the name of Jesus .
It continues seemingly unabated despite flags raised by organizations such as the United Nations , Save the Children and Human Rights Watch .

Bobby and Henock were brought to this pastor by their stepmother , who said she believes her stepsons are witches and claimed the boys were stealing their stepsister 's blood and using it to fly at night .
Pointing to Henock , whose left arm is covered in bandages , she said that , in the " spirit world , " he is an elderly man who injured himself while trying to kill his father .
The boys ' father was not present ; he was out of town on work and apparently unaware of the ceremony .
In a small , squeaky voice , Bobby said that family members had told him he and his brother were infected with witchcraft after eating bread and green beans their older brother gave them .
Tshombe 's denunciation appeared to have traumatized the boys , who were barely responsive .
Their fear was not unwarranted ; the fate of children accused of witchcraft in the Congo is often nothing short of horrific , critics say .
ABC News ' " Nightline " gained exclusive access to four churches , where we saw scores of children -- including toddlers -- who were denounced as witches .
The accusers were powerful and often politically connected pastors , who some say get paid to perform so - called " deliverance ceremonies , " or exorcisms , which can be unimaginably brutal .
Arnold Mushiete , a social worker for " Our House , " a small , Catholic organization funded entirely by donations , which helps children accused of witchcraft , was our guide into this frightening world .
He said a new breed of Christian pastors are manipulating the faith .
" Our work is to repair what they have destroyed , " he said , " and to give another image of Jesus , not one who tortures children . "
Unwanted Children Accused of Witchcraft , Abandoned
Accusing children of witchcraft is a relatively new phenomenon in the Congo .
Experts say it 's the result of a toxic combination of causes , including decades of war , an economy in collapse , and a new breed of Christian pastors who profit by telling impoverished parents that all of their problems -- economic , medical and emotional -- are caused by the family 's weakest members .
Unwanted children are often accused of witchcraft as a pretense for abandoning them .
Save the Children estimates 70 percent of the estimated 15,000 street children in the capital city of Kinshasa have been accused of witchcraft .
Why would a parent ever believe their child is a witch ?
Mushiete says in a culture where death and divorce have destroyed families , parents are easy prey for greedy , ruthless pastors .
On our tour of Christian churches in Congo 's capital city of Kinshasa , we saw Pastor Ngoma Madilu Orlain accuse two sisters , Sarah , 13 , and Lufuakenda , 9 , of being witches -- with their father , Albert Kanza , looking on .
As the terrified sisters begin to cry , their father remains silent .
" I believe she is a witch , " Kanza told ABC News .
He told us that he trusts the pastor and that in his mind , there can be no other explanation for his money and health problems .
Pastors Perform Gruesome Exorcism to Cast Out Demons
Once a child is accused of witchcraft , the next step is often exorcism -- a casting out of demons .
The ritual can be tantamount to torture .
We watched as Tshombe poured hot candle wax on the stomach of a clearly emaciated , 11 - year - old girl named Noella .
Kneeling in front of a wooden cross , the pastor and his aides held the girl down as the pastor pretended to pull demonic flesh out of her .
Noella was screaming in pain .
It appeared to be a cheap , cruel magic trick , but the crowd , including the girl 's mother , appeared to believe .
" It had to happen this way because the child is accused of witchcraft , " she told ABC News .
Exorcisms Scar Children for Life
The ceremony does not come cheap .
Tshombe was charging $ 50 -- an exorbitant cost in a country where the average annual salary is $ 100 .
He insisted to us that Jesus Christ would approve of his actions .
" I do n't do it for money .
I do this because the Holy Spirit gave me the gift to cure , " he told ABC News .
" If I were a liar , you would n't see so many people here .
That proves that I am not a charlatan . "
As cruel as Tshombe is with the children in his church , exorcisms can purportedly be exponentially worse .
There are reports of children being beaten , burned , starved and even murdered -- sometimes by members of their own family .
When we find Orlain forcing a little girl to expel evil spirits through an enema , involving a potion made by boiling a supposedly magical wood , he , like Tshombe , is unapologetic .
" Christ chased away evil spirits .
That 's what we today would call witchcraft , " Orlain said .
Even after a child endures an exorcism , the ordeal is often far from over .
Many are said to be permanently tainted in the eyes of their family that they 're kicked out of the house .
Life for girls accused of witchcraft is especially horrific .
Critics say they are often raped , abused and forced into prostitution .
Many of these girls now have children of their own .
We saw them leaving the babies on the side of the road to sleep at night while they went off to turn tricks .
Government Fails to Take Action Against Abuse
While there are dozens of organizations working to help kids accused of witchcraft , many activists complain that the Congolese government is not doing enough to address the problem .
ABC News took our evidence directly to a senior government official , Theodore Luleka Mwanalwamba , who heads a special commission to protect children , including those accused of witchcraft in the Congo .
He said it 's illegal to accuse a child of witchcraft -- unless you have proof .
The government official explained that witchcraft is part of the country 's traditional belief system .
He says it 's possible for a child to be a witch , " if a child has big eyes , black eyes or a bulging tummy . "
While the government does not condone physical abuse of children , he told ABC News that the effort to protect children from mistreatment by pastors is problematic since " important people " attend some of the churches in question .
Happy Endings Rare for Accused Child Witches
Because of people like Mushiete , there are sometimes happy endings for accused child witches .
Mushiete has adopted two brothers , Reuben and Joseph , who were kicked out of their homes after they were accused of being witches .
They now live with Mushiete , his wife and their two biological sons .
Reuben , 13 , told ABC News how he was whipped and beaten by his old family .
When we asked if he was still angry , he cried and said , " No , because my father , Arnold , told me not to be .
It 's the past .
It 's over . "
Jacob wove a tapestry of thread he spun himself in his chamber in the pedestal of the statue of Taweret during his many years on the Island .
Ilana found a fragment of the bottom - left corner of this tapestry pinned by Jacob 's knife in the cabin .
On the fragment , a picture of the statue of Taweret had been woven .
This was a sign for her to go looking at the statue .

Description
Pictorial images
A fanon re-composition of the tapestry
Jacob 's tapestry depicts a pair of wings outstretched from an encircled Eye of Horus , and what appear to be seventeen long arms emanating like rays out from the eye .
The hands at the ends of the arms grope for nine human figures who appear to be at the mercy of the hands , while on either side a king sits in a throne and observes .
In the row below , seven human figures dance to the music of a lone harpist on the right , for eight figures total .
Four water jugs sit on the floor amongst the dancers .
Several rows below that , figures labor to harvest wheat .
The row beneath that depicts three heavily crewed Ancient Egyptian sailboats debarking from the Island , with the statue of Taweret in view on the Island 's shore .
( The portion of the tapestry showing the statue was at some point cut from the tapestry , and a fragment was left behind in Jacob 's cabin , pinned to the wall by Jacob 's knife . )
The position of the tapestry as it hangs inside the statue of Taweret pedestal
Greek lines
Across the top of the tapestry is emblazoned a quote from Homer 's Odyssey in upper case ancient Greek : ΘΕΟΙ ΤΟΣΑ ΔΟΙΕΝ ΟΣΑ ΦΡΕΣΙ ΣΗΣΙ ΜΕΝΟΙΝΑΣ .
The original sentence , modified to lower case , is σοὶ δὲ θεοὶ τ όσα δοῖεν ὅσα φ ρεσὶ σ ῇσ ι μενοινᾷ ς ( transcribed as theoi tosa doien hosa phresi sēisi menoinas ) , belongs to Book 6 , line 180 and means , " may the gods grant thee all that thy heart desires " . [ 1 ]
Another passage is woven into the middle of the tapestry .
In full , it reads , ΘΕΟΙ ΔΕ ΤΟΙ ΟΛΒΙΑ ΔΟΙΕΝ .
The original sentence , modified to lowercase , is θεοὶ δέ τοι ὄλβια δοῖεν ( transcribed as theoi de toi olbia doien ) , which means , " may the gods grant thee happiness " .
It occurs twice in the Odyssey : Book 8 , line 413 and Book 24 , line 402 . [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
The most complete view of the tapestry
A third passage is at the bottom of the tapestry .
The part that can be seen reads , ... Σ ΜΟΝΟΙ ΤΟ ΤΟΥ ΠΟΛΕΜΟΥ ΤΕΛΟΣ ΕΟΡΑΚΑΣΙ ( sic ) .
In lower case , it should read ...ς μόνοι τὸ τοῦ πολέμο υ τέλο ς ἑ ω ράκασι ( transcribed as " ...s monoi to tou polemou telos eōrakasi " ) which seems to be the following quote misattributed to Plato : " Only the dead have seen the end of war . "
If so , the word missing could be ΘΑΝΟΝΤΕΣ or ΤΕΘΝΗΚΟΤΕΣ , in lower case , θανόντε ς ( transcribed as thanontes ) or τεθνηκ ότε ς ( transcribed as tethnekotes ) , meaning " those who have died " .
Hieroglyphs
The tapestry has various series of hieroglyphs .
These hieroglyphs can be found at the tips of the wings extending from the Eye of Horus , in two lines in the middle of the tapestry , and in three clusters near the bottom of the tapestry .
The hieroglyphs near the Eye of Horus make reference to certain " lords " or " masters " .
The two lines of hieroglyphs contain words that are also shown on the Cerberus chamber pillars .
The bottom three clusters represent the three Egyptian seasons : Inundation , Winter , and Summer , respectively .
Loom
In ancient times , Jacob 's Mother had a similar loom .
Jacob learned the trade from her .
( " Across the Sea " )
Destruction
In 2007 , the Man in Black , disguised as John Locke , entered Jacob 's chamber with Ben , who killed Jacob .
Shortly afterwards , Bram entered with his men and opened fire on the imposter Locke , who vanished and returned as a billowing cloud of black smoke , killing Bram 's men .
Bram himself was hurled through the loom where another tapestry was just begun , destroying the loom .
The original tapestry was unharmed in the confrontation .
( " LA X , Part 1 " )
Trivia
The commentary of the enhanced episode uses the same translation of the Greek lines as given above .
The first line is similar to the start of Psalm 20:4 , " May He grant you your heart 's desire ... " , and Psalm 20:1 starts out " May the Lord answer you in the day of trouble !
May the name of the God of Jacob protect you ! "
The commentary also gives this description :
“ The eye is surrounded by a sun disc
representing the sun god Aten
a symbol of life and prosperity ”
The hands ending from the lines were used in the Egyptian art of the Cult of Aten , created by the Pharaoh Akhenaten .
The cult represents one of the earliest known examples of monotheism .
The Pharaoh and his wife Nefertiti are seen in reliefs receiving the blessings of the Aten ( the sun ) in hands , usually , but not always accompanied by ankhs .
The tapestry depicts a similar scene ; the sun disk is shown showering blessings onto the people below .
In the case of Akhenaten only he and his direct family could receive these blessings , making it a very exclusive religion , other people could only receive blessings from the Aten via the royal family .
In the scenes where the tapestry is being woven and Jacob is alone in the chamber , the epsilons " Ε " are incorrectly written as xis " Ξ " and the final letter of the first line should be a sigma " Σ " rather than a zeta " Ζ " .
This error has been corrected in the scenes where Ben and Locke visit Jacob and the tapestry is finished .
The last word in the bottom row has an omicron " Ο " where there should be an omega " Ω " .
The Fates of Greek and Roman mythology are depicted as spinning , measuring , and cutting thread to create a web , or tapestry , of humanity 's fate . ( " The Incident , Part 1 " ) ( " Across the Sea " )
Intel 's Linux - based Moblin platform , which is designed to run on Atom - based netbook devices , has gained the backing of numerous Linux distributors .
Novell jumped on the Moblin bandwagon last year and has participated in the development effort .
In an announcement on Thursday , Novell revealed that it has signed an agreement with Intel and plans to boost its involvement with the project .
In an effort to make the project more inclusive and transparent , Intel recently invited the Linux Foundation to host ongoing Moblin development .
Novell was a vocal supporter of this move and expressed enthusiasm for Moblin and the project 's potential capacity to accelerate the advancement of Linux in the mobile space .
As part of the company 's new agreement with Intel , Novell has committed to build its own Moblin - based distro to offer to hardware makers .
Novell will also establish its own Linux labs in Taiwan to collaborate with a Moblin development facility that Intel launched in the country last year as part of a partnership with Taiwan 's Ministry of Economic Affairs .
Intel is building a very strong presence in Taiwan , where the company is investing in both Moblin development and a major WiMAX rollout .
" We are extending our involvement with Moblin because we believe that it provides a richer mobile Internet experience , " said Ron Hovsepian , Novell president and CEO .
" The emergence of such mobile computing platforms as netbooks presents a significant growth opportunity .
We believe that Moblin - based Novell software on Intel - based platforms will offer OEMs and ODMs exceptional solutions for delivering a full Internet experience on such devices . "
Novell is no stranger to the netbook market .
Its SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop ( SLED ) distribution ships on some MSI Wind netbooks .
The SLED - based Wind devices were not well - received by consumers and experienced a high return rate as a result of serious configuration problems .
We discussed this issue with Novell last year when we explored the challenges and opportunities for Linux in the netbook market .
We concluded that one of the key difficulties faced by Linux in the netbook space is that hardware vendors are largely unaccustomed to handling Linux integration issues .
Moblin could help Linux overcome that hurdle because it will provide a preintegrated stack that is designed specifically for netbook environments and will require hardware makers to perform significantly less tailoring and customization in order to deliver a top - notch user experience .
Early releases of Moblin show promise , and Intel has some very ambitious plans for the platform .
Novell 's commitment to Moblin is yet another sign of the platform 's growing relevance within the Linux community .
Intel 's effort to make Moblin the cornerstone of mobile Linux development is clearly gaining some traction .

W.M. Bond spent 85.6 % of his non-sleep work day focused exclusively on Lehman and Lehman alone ... or at least so he billed .
If this does not blow the lid on the thousands of teaparties held in the U.S. , then likely nothing will .
Weil Gotshal , which is doing nothing more than liquidating the bankrupt estate of Lehman Brothers ' non-brokerage operations ( the brokerage was stolen by Barclays for pennies on the dollar while Weil stood by the sidelines and gave its blessing to this daylight robbery ) , has demanded that the wifebeater ( aka James " Stella " Peck ) approve a $ 55 million payment for its fees and expenses .
Alvarez & Marsal will likely follow suit shortly with another comparable fee demand .
I will discuss this filing in detail tomorrow , but in the meantime I present the compensation application in all its scandalously greedy glory tomorrow .
In the meantime , if there is any lawyer at Weil whowork on the Lehman liquidation , please raise your hand .
Curiously , how pissed must W. Michael Bond 's wife be , after he worked 1,284 billable hours in the 100 work day period between Sept 15 and Jan 31 ( exclude 5 holidays and use networkdays on excel ) on this mother of all liquidations .
As a reference , there are 2,400 hours in that same interval , and assuming 7 hours of sleep a day , 1 hour of assorted bathroom functions , and 1 hour of meals ,

Falling into a black hole would be a one - off sightseeing trip , so this simulation , calculated by Andrew Hamilton and his team at the University of Colorado , Boulder , is a safer option
Falling into a black hole might not be good for your health , but at least the view would be fine .
A new simulation shows what you might see on your way towards the black hole ’s crushing central singularity .
The research could help physicists understand the apparently paradoxical fate of matter and energy in a black hole .
Andrew Hamilton and Gavin Polhemus of the University of Colorado , Boulder , built a computer code based on the equations of Einstein ’s general theory of relativity , which describes gravity as a distortion of space and time .
They follow the fate of an imaginary observer on an orbit that swoops down into a giant black hole weighing 5 million times the mass of the sun , about the same size as the hole in the centre of our galaxy .
As you approach , a dark circle is bitten out of the galaxy containing the black hole , marking the event horizon – the point beyond which nothing can escape the black hole ’s grip .
Light from stars directly behind the hole is swallowed by the horizon , while light from other stars is merely bent by the black hole ’s gravity , forming a warped image around the hole .
Advertisement
Horizontal ring
To distant observers , the horizon has a size of one Schwartzschild radius – about 15 million kilometres for this hole – but as you approach , it recedes from you .
Even after you cross this radius , there is still a point in front of you where all light is swallowed , so from your point of view , you never reach the horizon .
Hamilton and Polhemus have painted a red grid on the horizon to help visualise it ( as the horizon is spherical , the two circles on the grid represent the north and south “ poles ” of its central black hole ) .
And as you pass one Schwartzschild radius , another artificial visual aid pops up .
The white grid that loops around you marks where distant observers would place the horizon – this is where you ’d see other people falling in if they followed you through the horizon .
The strangest sight is reserved for your last moments .
So close to the centre of the black hole , you feel powerful tidal forces .
If you ’re falling in feet first , gravity at your head is much weaker than at your feet .
That would pull a real observer apart , and it also affects the light falling in around you – light from above your head is stretched out and shifted to the red end of the spectrum .
Eventually it gets red - shifted into nothingness , so your whole view will be squeezed into a horizontal ring .
Information paradox
This process might shed some light on a black hole puzzle .
Quantum calculations seem to show that there is too much complexity within a black hole – in earlier work , the researchers calculated that it should be possible to create much more entropy ( a measure of disorder ) inside the black hole than is measured by outside observers .
This is like a supercharged version of the old black hole information paradox , which pits the apparent destruction of objects – and information – that falls into a black hole against quantum mechanics , which states that quantum information can never be lost .
The problem may be that we have a naive view of space , which breaks down inside the black hole .
To calculate total entropy , Hamilton and Polhemus assumed that you add up all the possible states that matter and energy could take at different points in space .
But along with other theorists , they suspect that this usual assumption , called locality , does n’t work inside a black hole .
Somehow , different points in space seem to share the same states – but it ’s not clear how .
That ’s where visualisations like this might just help .
“ Close to the singularity , it appears that the entire three - dimensional universe is being crushed into a two - dimensional surface , ” says Hamilton ( see Our world may be a giant hologram ) .
But whether it hints that a 2D view is more fundamental is not yet clear .
“ Does it have any profound significance ?
I do n’t know , ” says Hamilton .

McMahon has small kneecaps and no thumbnails and suffers from severe pain , muscle spasms and nausea .
In his 59 years , he 's been hospitalized repeatedly , undergone nearly 20 major surgeries and has had five " near death " experiences .
Few would consider this Iowan fortunate in matters of health .
But he has been fortunate to get the medical treatment he needs : marijuana .
McMahon is a participant in the Compassionate Care IND ( Investigational New Drug ) program .
Created by the federal government in 1978 , it has allowed people with certain medical conditions to use marijuana for treatment .
In 1992 , after many AIDS patients suffering from wasting disease and appetite loss sought use of the drug through the program , the George H.W. Bush administration closed it to new applicants .
McMahon is now among only a few Americans allowed medically supervised marijuana therapy through the program .
Each month , he receives 300 marijuana cigarettes , grown and sent to him by the federal government .
Smoking it alleviates his painful , debilitating muscle spasms .
It helps him sleep through the night .
McMahon knows he 's fortunate to be able to use a stigmatized drug for medical treatment .
" I'm in the best position , " he said .
Other sick people should be able to use the drug too , he said .
That 's why he signed on as a plaintiff in a recent lawsuit about the classification of marijuana in Iowa .
This state considers marijuana a Schedule I controlled substance - putting it among the most tightly regulated drugs under state law .
The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa filed a lawsuit arguing the drug was incorrectly categorized because it did not meet the statutory requirement of having " no accepted medical use treatment in the United States . "
The ACLU noted that at least 13 other states allow people - including those with AIDS , cancer and glaucoma - to legally use the drug for medical purposes .
On April 24 , a Polk County judge ruled the Iowa Pharmacy Board must examine whether the drug is properly classified .
According to Randall Wilson , the attorney who handled the case for the ACLU , after the board makes a determination , it must then recommend proper categorization to the Iowa Legislature .
The ruling does n't legalize marijuana for medical use in Iowa .
Even the findings and recommendations of the Iowa Board of Pharmacy wo n't have any impact on the legality of its medical use .
But the ruling opens the door for this state to have a serious conversation about allowing ill Iowans access to marijuana for medical treatment .
The Legislature would have to pass a law - as other states have done - to decriminalize its use for medical treatment .
Sen .
Joe Bolkcom , D - Iowa City , tried to do that earlier this year .
He proposed legislation calling for creating " compassion centers , " nonprofit organizations that would cultivate and distribute the drug to approved patients .
The bill died due to lack of support .
Next session it should be revived - and passed .
Just as lawmakers and voters in other states have done , Iowa should allow sick people access to what may be the most effective drug to help them .
Even state approval would not make the drug " legal " by federal standards , according to Wilson , but the Obama administration has said it will not go after sick Americans using pot for treatment .
For McMahon , that treatment means smoking about half a joint an hour - a total of about 10 marijuana cigarettes a day .
It helps more than any drug he has been prescribed , and it allowed him to work as a laborer in his younger years .
He said he does n't have to use it if he does n't need it .
But if he wants to garden or pain wakes him up in the middle of the night , he may smoke a little more .
" It depends on the night and the symptoms , " he said .
And when shipments have been late , he knows what it 's like to go without the drug .
The pain is bad , starting in his joints and spreading : " It overwhelms me , " he said .
What he finds equally difficult : hearing from people who suffer from " every kind of unimaginable pain " and do n't have the option of using marijuana for treatment .
He 's met people with multiple sclerosis and neurological problems who are " scared to death " of breaking the law .
Their doctors are scared to recommend pot , too .
Iowans should n't have to be scared .
They should n't have to choose between breaking the law and getting a treatment that may help them .

Giant Lego Nintendo DSi made with 51,324 Bricks
This giant Lego Nintendo DSi is definitely bigger than life and is more than enough to be a source of inspiration for gamers , geeks , Lego fans and all Nintendo freaks out there .
Good thing we got some personal answers ( below ) from the maker Sean Kenney , because such a project could raise a lot of questions .
I do n’t know if to call this huge Lego creation a Nintendo DS mod or simply take it as an artist ’s commission to make a gaming console look like a giant child ’s toy .
Either way , it is a beautiful masterpiece that deserves more than a few looks , pictures , and hats to be taken off .
Made by the artist Sean Kenney , this Nintendo DSi creation is made up of 51,324 colorful bricks to bring the handheld game to an oversized toy sculpture .
Overall , it took over 200 hours of work , weighs at approximately 250 Pounds and is just about 7 feet wide … you can see the fast motion video of it being built below .
Talking about big games !
We were able to reach Sean personally and ask him a few questions about this project :
Was this project your idea which was later commissioned or vice versa ?
The project was the brainchild of Nintendo of America , who first thought up the idea , then sought me out and commissioned me to create the sculpture .
We worked together to come up with the basic presentation ( they liked the idea of it standing nearly upright , and they like the idea of featuring the camera application ) and then I took over by designing the whole sculpture by hand .
They liked the way it came out so much that they commissioned four small “ life - size ” DSi ’s which will also be on display inside the store .
Was Lego your first choice to use and what inspired Lego and not other materials ?
I am a full - time artist who creates sculptures exclusively with LEGO bricks .
I am licensed by The LEGO Group as a LEGO Certified Professional to do projects like this and have created LEGO sculptures for TV , celebrities , museums , galleries , major corporations , schools , stores , and more .
A sculpture made with LEGO bricks is fun and bright and something everyone can relate to !
When you look at a LEGO sculpture you understand how it was put together , and maybe even can imagine doing it yourself .
It ’s great to watch kids get excited and start creating things themselves .
You do n’t see that same thing happening when people view bronze sculptures or oil paintings .
How Long will it be showing in New York ?
The LEGO sculpture will be on display at the Nintendo World Store , Rockefeller Center ( 48th Street between 5th & 6th Avenues ) throughout April .
Other personal comments from Sean :
The sculpture took about 200 hours to design and build , which was done over the course of about 2 weeks together with two of my assistants .
In designing the sculpture , I gathered as many photographs of the DSi as I could , and then used graph paper to plan out the basic shape and size and all the visual elements like printed lettering , buttons , slots , and so on .
Eventually Nintendo mailed me a real DSi and I took hundreds of measurements , from the depth of the buttons to the width of the tiny bevel around the edges .
I had to rush - order an enormous supply of LEGO pieces directly from The LEGO Group ’s production facilities in Europe , since the entire sculpture is built in a hard - to - find “ light blue ” LEGO color .
That said , there are only about 10 different types of LEGO pieces used in the sculpture … all basic rectangles , and all available commercially in regular retail LEGO products .
( Yes , kids , you too can do this at home ! ) 🙂
The final sculpture has giant - sized versions of every detail , from the screws on the battery cover to the pickup contacts in the power port .
The tiny SD card slot is over a foot tall !
With the launch of the new Nintendo DSi , Nintendo World Store has decided to add a little extra for all the visitors , children , gamers and others that want to get their hands on the new portable handheld .
It is no wonder that such an art project was made for the launch and adds more than just little publicity .
I do wonder if once the big hype behind the DSi will cool down , if this Lego statue will remain there for a long duration or perhaps move to Lego Land as an ongoing exhibition .
It will work for the fans this way or that .
Thank you very much Sean for taking time to answer our question about this project and make such a great combination with Lego and the Nintendo DSi .
As with any movement , there are political tensions inside the struggle for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) rights today .
On the one hand , many mainstream LGBT rights groups are attempting to rein in the street heat and radicalism of activists who continue to organize and protest in the wake of the victory of California ’s anti-gay marriage Proposition 8 referendum last November .
On the other , a far smaller , yet vocal , number of left - wing activists express indifference or even contempt for the same - sex marriage movement and the growth of new groups forming in cities across the country .
How should socialists approach these challenges ?
The largest and best - funded organizations in the country such as the Human Rights Campaign and statewide equality groups are looking to “ Obamify ” the same - sex marriage movement .
As the San Francisco Chronicle explains , “ Obamification ” is :
[ M ] ore than just connecting supporters through social networking sites such as Facebook and building mile - long e-mail lists .
It would involve pairing new media technology with old - fashioned , door - to - door outreach — two tactics that were not used well in the unsuccessful opposition to Proposition 8 in November , according to a report by Marriage Equality USA , an Oakland - based organization that supports gay marriage .
The leading advocates of this sort of organizing , such as Torie Osborn and Rick Jacobs , are Democratic Party campaign activists who worked in the Obama and Howard Dean campaigns , respectively .
They are critical of the failed conservative methods used in the No on 8 campaign in California , and argue for tactics such as “ online , grassroots activism . ”
Yet activism should never be reduced to clicking a mouse .
While they do , in fact , push for LGBT people to tell their own stories in some door - knocking actions — rather than hide behind euphemism - filled ads with straight couples , as the No on 8 campaign did — their use of progressive language to press for lobbying and online networking masks a narrow vision of genuine grassroots activism .
There is an occasional verbal nod toward protest and collective organizing efforts — that is , genuine grassroots organizing .
But the focus is primarily on conventional legislative lobbying to appeal to state and national officials .
Currently , attorneys are attempting to repeal Prop 8 ’s reversal of gay marriage rights in the courts .
Activists across the country are planning Day of Decision actions — either celebrations or protests , depending on the outcome .
These are actions activists should aggressively promote and participate in .
Because President Obama and party leaders continue to define marriage as between one man and one woman , despite their opposition to statewide gay marriage bans , groups that remain inside the Democratic Party are more concerned about not embarrassing politicians than winning rights .
Thus , Equality California is already raising hesitations about attempting a 2010 pro-gay marriage ballot initiative in the event that Prop 8 is upheld — out of fear that LGBT activists would “ look bad ” or suffer another “ defeat , ” according to their director Marc Solomon , speaking at an April meeting of the activist group Love Honor Cherish in Los Angeles .
It appears that as with the 2004 elections , when Democrats like gay Congressman Barney Frank told activists not to press for equal marriage , the folks they are really concerned about “ looking bad ” are the Democrats .
In addition , while newly formed local groups such as Seattle ’s Queer Allies Coalition , New York ’s Civil Rights Front and the Chicago chapter of Join the Impact have widened their agendas to include support for employment non-discrimination for LGBT people and active solidarity with labor and immigrant rights organizing , many mainstream groups assert an exclusive focus on statewide gay marriage legislation .
They are tepid or silent about demanding that Obama and Congress repeal the Defense of Marriage Act that denies all federal marriage benefits , even to married LGBT couples in states where their marriages are legal .
But activists such as Harvey Milk ’s collaborator Cleve Jones argue that broader issues for LGBT rights must be fought for today .
At a Camp Courage training weekend in late January — organized by the advocates of Obamafication — Jones enthusiastically called for a national LGBT civil rights movement :
It ’s got to be not just marriage .
It ’s got to be marriage and housing and public accommodation and adoption and immigration and taxation and Social Security and military service .
We want nothing less than full equality in all areas governed by civil law in all 50 states , and eventually in every country of this world .
That is what we are fighting for .
Still , while thousands are taking to the streets for gay marriage and raising larger questions about LGBT oppression and how to fight it , some on the left are surprisingly dismissive .
One panel discussion at the Left Forum in New York City on April 19 — on which I spoke — was typical of this sort of ultra - left approach to the question of equal marriage rights .
Called “ Gay Marriage : Should the Left Care ? ” committed activists from Queers for Economic Justice and the LGBT youth group FIERCE attacked the gay marriage movement for making such a conservative demand .
Without acknowledging the evidence to the contrary–and there is quite a bit–they assumed that given the mainstream nature of marriage , marriage activists must not care about racism , economic injustice or taking on the systemic causes of LGBT oppression .
They are both theoretically and factually mistaken .
First , gay marriage is a reform .
Like all reforms under capitalism , it leaves the structure of the system intact while alleviating a grievance — in this case , the denial of both material benefits and the desire to have LGBT relationships acknowledged as equal to those of heterosexuals .
Like the demand for unionization , under which the terms of workers ’ exploitation are renegotiated — with workers gaining higher wages and benefits , but not eliminating the power of bosses — equal marriage would end some discrimination without eliminating oppression altogether .
Second , to challenge the demand for same - sex marriage for not delivering sexual liberation is a bit like disparaging the civil rights sit-ins to desegregate lunch counters in the early 1960s for not eliminating racism .
It sets up a false expectation for a reformist demand , and then assails it for not delivering revolutionary transformation .
At the Left Forum meeting , one married gay couple with HIV / AIDS hammered home what ’s really at stake in this struggle .
Vinny Allegrini and Mark de Solla have been living with HIV / AIDS for 20 years , and were married 15 years ago in Canada .
In many concrete and emotionally compelling ways , their daily struggle to keep alive and take care of each other — and have medical and state authorities respect their health care wishes — is codified by their marriage license , which they must carry with them everywhere to prove that they are not legal strangers , as they lead lives that are shaped by health care crises .
Socialists and other progressives must engage with the genuine struggle to try and shape a course that is independent of the Democratic Party establishment and inclusive of broader civil rights for all LGBT people .
EnerNoc ( NSDQ : ENOC ) says it has come up with a first in the demand response business –treating every piece of equipment like a modern American teenager .
That way , they can keep their parent – EnerNoc , in this case – up to date on their minute - to - minute activities , no matter how boring or histrionic .
In any case , it 's easier than trying to round them up for a family conversation .
That 's the idea behind EnerNoc 's PowerTalk , software that brings " presence " to the air conditioners , motors , light banks and other devices that it pledges to turn down on demand to help utilities get through peak loads .
Until now , that meant building a virtual private network at each customer 's site , EnerNoc President David Brewster said .
It also meant that every device must be asked how it 's doing , so to speak -- it does n't let you know unless you ask .
PowerTalk fixes that by hooking up every device with the equivalent of an instant message service , using Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol ( XMPP ) , an open instant messaging standard .
" We now have what are the industry 's first presence - enabled smart grid devices , " Brewster said .
In fact , PowerTalk is already being used by about 200 of the company 's 5,000 or so customers , the company said Thursday .
EnerNoc and competitors such as Comverge ( NSDQ : COMV ) , CPower , EnergyConnectand Constellation NewEnergy aggregate customers who agree to cut their power when utilities demand it , usually with a day 's notice or so .
But those that can provide power on minutes ' notice can command higher prices , if they can promise technology fast and reliable enough to make the new deadlines .
With PowerTalk delivering much richer and more frequent data , " it 's no longer going to be a separate computer in the utility control room reporting data every five minuets , " Brewster said .
Instead , " Now it 's going to be feeding into their operations center at the same frequency as their central generation , " he said – an important consideration for an industry that wants to be taken as seriously as the peaker coal - and gas - fired power plants they aim to replace .
Keeping devices in constant contact with control centers also could provide richer data and faster responsiveness to services like energy efficiency optimization , which EnerNoc now offers customers ( see EnerNoc Expanding Into Carbon Management , Energy Services ) .
Brewster said he'd like to see PowerTalk eventually adopted for broader smart grid functions , like outage detection and voltage and frequency regulation .
EnerNoc has about 2.2 gigawatts of power under management , putting it in the top tier of demand response providers .
If PowerTalk delivers on lower installation costs and added efficiency , it could help it compete in that field , said Ben Schuman , analyst with Pacific Crest Securities .
But the real breakthrough would be " software licenses , or pay - for - performance efficiency contracts , versus than just selling megawatts into a demand response program , " he said .
While demand response as it is organized today is limited to utility or grid operator contracts , saving energy is valuable to everyone .
Other demand response companies are looking at new markets .
In Jaunary , Comverge released software to help utilities manage its demand - response network as well as data from smart meters ( see Green Light post ) .
Constellation NewEnergy is piloting a program based on using demand response to hedge its own power purchase contracts against moment - to - moment demand and sharing the savings with participating customers .
CPower raised $ 10.7 million earlier this week ( see Green Light post ) , underscoring the fact that demand response can deliver power savings at a fraction of the cost of adding new generation , renewable or otherwise ( see EnerNoc Harvests Power in Maryland ) .
[ Template - haskell ] New TH features in the HEAD
I added some new language features to Template Haskell in the HEAD repository : * type families , including associated types , * kind annotations , * INLINE and SPECIALISE pragmas , and * bang patterns .
Especially , type families were repeatedly requested < http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/1673 >.
Please give these extensions a spin and let me know of any problems that you may encounter .
Unfortunately , I had to change the Language .

A Buddhist monk believes a suspected arson at a temple in Scarborough is related to the ongoing conflict in Sri Lanka .
The fire sent three monks running for safety from the building on Kingston Rd. just south of Military Trail Rd. , at about 4:30 a.m. after its east emergency entrance was found burning .
Police and the Ontario Fire Marshal 's Office are investigating .
Nalaka , a resident monk , said he believes the incident is connected to the war in Sri Lanka .
He also said the monks have been threatened in the last week .
The incident has caused upset across Toronto 's Sinhalese community .
" Every single Sinhalese person in Toronto is calling each other right now , " said a man who attends the temple but did not want to be named .
" It 's very alarming . "
Fire investigator James Gillespie estimates damage at $ 20 - 30,000 .
Police are looking at two bottles found near the door which may have been filled with accelerant , he said .
Members of the Sinhalese Buddhist community gathered outside the temple this afternoon said they had no doubts about who was responsible : Canadian Tamil Tigers supporters .
Bundula Jayasekara , Sri Lanka 's Consul General in Toronto , said the Sinhalese Sri-Lankan residents in Toronto have been threatened for years .
" There is a Mafia , " Jaysekara said , speaking of some Toronto Tamils who he said support the Tigers .
" People do n't feel safe here and this is a G8 country . "
Bundara Seneviratne , vice president of the Toronto Buddhist Centre , said the temple has received threatening phone calls for weeks .
A note posted to a door about two weeks ago referred to the ongoing Tamil protest downtown .
" I suspect this may be the beginning of some worse things , " he said .
Senthan Nada , a spokesperson for the Coalition to Stop the War in Sri Lanka , said today Canadian Tamils do support the Tamil Tigers because they represent the " aspirations of the Tamil people . "
But Nada stressed local Tamils have been interested solely in peaceful protests and trying to engage Canadian politicians , not in violence .
" It 's a police inquiry , " he said , adding that any accusations Tamils are responsible for setting the fire would be " false allegations . "
Nada said : " This is not something the community is interested in doing . "
But at the fire scene , Kumar Gunasekera , 32 , said members of Toronto 's Tamil community have been indoctrinated by the Tamil Tigers .
" They 're calling Prabakharn their leader , " he said , referring to the leader of the Tamil Tigers , a wanted terrorist .
The fire comes less than a week after the main Buddhist temple of the Sri Lankan Buddhist community in France was attacked on May 10 .
Extensive damage was caused during the incident .
The Asian Tribune is reporting monks and community leaders believe it was organized by the international network of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam .
Friday night the Sri Lankan government announced it took control of the island 's entire coastline and hoped to end the conflict with the Tamil rebels by the end of the weekend .
Meanwhile , several thousand Tamil demonstrators occupied parts of downtown Toronto for several hours last night prior to a planned candlelight vigil outside the United States consulate on University Ave .
For a time , the demonstrators blocked part of the intersection of Yonge and Dundas Sts. , refusing to move until they could be addressed by a federal Conservative MP .
Police estimate there are about 400 protesters out this morning and have no information as to whether the crowd will grow throughout the day .

Somalia : ein zweites Afghanistan ?
Harald Neuber
Krieg und Piraterie in dem ostafrikanischen Staat nehmen zu. EU reagiert mit militärischen Plänen und erwägt eine Intervention
Wird Somalia der nächste internationale Kriegsschauplatz nach Irak und Afghanistan ?
Während der Bürgerkrieg in dem ostafrikanischen Land eskaliert , drängen mehrere NATO - Staaten und auch der Generalsekretär der Organisation der Vereinten Nationen , Ban Ki Moon , auf ein stärkeres militärisches Engagement .
Die Bundesregierung weitet derweil den Armeeeinsatz gegen moderne Piraterie vor der ostafrikanischen Küste aus .
Andere Mitgliedsstaaten der Europäischen Union fordern eine Truppenentsendung auf das somalische Festland .
Damit droht die EU sich nicht nur in einen weiteren chaotischen Waffengang zu verstricken .
Die außenpolitischen Strategen Brüssels ignorieren auch die Mahnungen von Friedensgruppen , die Gründe des Konfliktes und der Piraterie zu bekämpfen .
Die deutsche Fregatte Rheinland - Pfalz bei der Teilnahme an der Atalanta - Mission im März 2009 .

Unbestritten ist , dass der bewaffnete Konflikt in Somalia dringend beendet werden muss .
Das Internationale Komitee des Roten Kreuzes ( ICRC ) warnte erneut vor einer " dramatischen Verschlimmerung " der Lage in dem von Bürgerkrieg geplagten Land .
Die wenigen funktionierenden Krankenhäuser seien permanent überlastet , sagte ICRC - Sprecher Florian Westphal .
Angesichts der eskalierenden Kämpfe zwischen Truppen der " Übergangsregierung " unter dem Anführer Sharif Sheikh Ahmed ( Somalia : Vom Terroristen zum Retter der Nation ) und islamischen Milizen seien tausende Menschen aus der Hauptstadt Mogadischu und anderen Orten geflohen .
Seit Januar seien alleine in den beiden vom ICRC betriebenen Hospitälern rund 1500 Menschen behandelt worden .
Seit dem Sturz des vier Jahre später verstorbenen Autokraten Mohamed Siad Barre im Jahr 1991 befindet sich Somalia im Bürgerkrieg .
Im Jahr 2000 wurde in Dschibuti eine " Übergangsregierung " gebildet , die international Anerkennung fand , im Land aber kaum Einfluss hat .
Sie sieht sich den erstarkenden Milizen islamistischer Gruppierungen gegenüber ( Abenteuer Somalia ) .
Eine Folge des brutal geführten Krieges ist auch eine Zunahme der Piraterie vor den Küsten Somalias : Verarmte Fischer entern in zunehmendem Maße internationale Handelsschiffe , um an die Fracht zu gelangen .
Deutschland Vorreiter bei Militarisierungsplänen
Die Übergangsregierung forderte in den vergangenen Monaten immer wieder eine internationale Intervention , um die eigene Position zu stärken .
Somalia werde von ausländischen Kämpfern " überschwemmt " , beklagte der Chef der Pseudoregierung , Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , vor wenigen Tagen erneut .
Islamisten wollten das Land zu einem zweiten Afghanistan machen .
Deswegen brauche seine Regierung internationale Hilfe .
In der EU stoßen solche Appelle offenbar auf offene Ohren .
Am Freitag erst beantragte die Bundesregierung im Bundestag eine Ausdehnung der deutschen Marinemission vor der Küste Somalias .
Dies sei notwendig , weil moderne Piraten ihr Aktionsgebiet ausgeweitet haben , hieß es in der Begründung des Antrags , über den Mitte Juni entschieden werden soll .
Schon Ende der ersten Maiwoche hatte Bundesinnenminister Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) von Verteidigungsminister Franz Josef Jung ( CDU ) einen Einsatz der Kommandospezialkräfte beantragt .
Sie sollten dauerhaft auf deutschen Kriegsschiffen im Indischen Ozean stationiert werden .
Schäuble begründete seine Initiative mit der gescheiterten Anti-Piraten - Mission der Elitetruppe GSG - 9 .
Sie sollte in der Nacht zum 1 .
Mai den entführten deutschen Frachter " Hansa Stavanger " befreien .
Der Einsatz war in letzter Minute abgebrochen worden , weil die somalischen Kidnapper ihre Kräfte an Bord verstärkt hatten .

Derzeit ist Deutschland mit zwei Fregatten und rund 650 Mann an der EU - Mission Atalanta vor der Küste Somalias beteiligt .
Nach dem aktuellen Bundestagsmandat vom vergangenen Dezember können die deutschen Kräfte auf maximal 1400 Mann verstärkt werden .
Das Mandat reicht bis zum 15 .
Dezember 2009 .
In Deutschland muss der Bundestag einer Verlängerung oder Veränderung des Einsatzes zustimmen .
Diskussion in Brüssel fortgeschritten
Doch nicht nur in Deutschland ist ein Trend zur verstärkten Truppenpräsenz vor Somalia auszumachen .
Innerhalb der Fachgremien in Brüssel wurden in den vergangenen Tagen mehrere Vorschläge zu einer Verstärkung der EU - Militarisierung in Somalia gemacht .
Die Initiativen unterschiedlicher Mitgliedsstaaten beziehen sich nicht nur auf die Marinemission Atalanta - sie zielen auch auf eine militärische Mission im somalischen Kernland ab .
Derweil bereitet die EU - Kommission offenbar eine so genannte Sicherheitssektorreform vor , ein möglicher erster Schritt hin zu einer Truppenstationierung auf dem Festland .
Nach Angaben aus diplomatischen Kreisen hat die EU bei der Regierung der Seychellen um die Nutzung ihrer Häfen für EU - Kriegsschiffe gebeten .
Auf dem Inselstaat im Indischen Ozean sollen auch etwaige Gefangene interniert werden .
Tatsächlich argumentiert auch die deutsche Regierung in ihrem aktuellen Antrag an den Bundestag mit der notwendigen Ausweitung des Anti-Piraten - Kampfes auf das Gebiet der Seychellen - Gruppe .
Innerhalb der EU drängt nach Informationen aus Brüssel vor allem die spanische Regierung auf eine Ausdehnung der Atalanta - Mission auf das somalische Festland .
Dabei könne Kenia tatkräftige Unterstützung leisten , erklärten Vertreter Madrids in Brüssler Fachgremien .
Frankreich schlug indes die Stationierung einer EU - Einheit in Mogadischu vor .
Ein Positionspapier zu einer möglichen Ausdehnung der EU - Militärpräsenz ist derzeit in Brüssel im Umlauf .
Auch aus diesem Dokument geht hervor , dass die so genannte Sicherheitssektorreform - Mission ein erster Schritt zu einer ausgedehnten Intervention der EU oder einzelner ihrer Mitgliedsstaaten sein könnte .
Kritik von Friedensforschern
Bei humanitären Organisationen und Friedensgruppen stößt diese ausschließliche Orientierung auf eine militärische Lösung des bewaffneten Konfliktes in Somalia auf wachsende Kritik .
Mitte dieser
Woche lehnten fünf führende deutsche Friedensinstitute in ihrem jährlich erscheinenden Friedensgutachten den Rückzug auf militärische Positionen strikt ab .
Bei der Präsentation des Berichtes führte Jochen Hippler von Institut für Entwicklung und Frieden nicht nur den laufenden Kriegseinsatz in Afghanistan als Beispiel für diese Strategie an .
Auch der Einsatz gegen moderne Piraterie vor dem Horn von Afrika führe in eine Sackgasse .
Offenbar ist die Bereitschaft in der Staatengemeinschaft , militärisch zu intervenieren , ausgeprägter als die , sich an der mühsamen Rekonstruktion von Staaten zu beteiligen .
In den seltenen Fällen , wo die Staatengemeinschaft oder der Westen nach einer Militärintervention zu einer langwierigen Konflikttransformation bereit war , stellt sich zudem die Frage , wann und wie die Defacto - Protektorate zu beenden sind .
Trotz mancher Fortschritte sind etwa Bosnien und Herzegowina oder das Kosovo nicht befriedet , solange der Widerspruch zwischen Demokratisierung und Fremdbestimmung besteht .
Aus dem Friedensgutachten
Der Kampf gegen die modernen Piraten vor der Küste Somalias belege dieses Dilemma , weil die Ursachen für die Seeräumerei nicht angegangen werden , so der Friedensforscher , dessen Institut an die Universität Duisburg - Essen angegliedert ist .
Zu diesen Gründen zähle vor allem die Überfischung der ostafrikanischen Gewässer durch internationale Fischereikonzerne und die Giftmüllverklappung " in großem Maßstab " in den betreffenden Gewässern ( Piraten , Flüchtlinge , Fischer ... ) .
Die Piraterie müsse vor diesem Hintergrund als Gesamtkomplex betrachtet werden , so Hippler , nicht aber als isoliertes Phänomen .
Diese Fehlanalyse sehen die Autoren des Friedensgutachtens 2009 im Fall des Anti-Piraten - Kampfes vor Afrika ebenso wie in Afghanistan :
In beiden Fällen werde nur auf militärische Lösungen gesetzt ; die Armee werde zum Politikersatz .

75 % of vulnerable inmates feel unsafe in Parkhurst , the report says Bullying and violence are endemic at Parkhurst jail and it is in many ways a " failing prison " , chief inspector of prisons Dame Anne Owers has said .
Dame
Anne said the jail , on the Isle of Wight , had " slipped back " and lacked basic levels of safety and decency .
Inspectors found a " startling 75 % " of vulnerable inmates felt unsafe and one disabled inmate had not showered for a year because staff had not helped him .
The Prison Service accepted the findings but said change was under way .
Inspectors criticised the jail in 2006 - and Dame Anne sent a team back into the prison in December last year to see if things had improved .
Staff would n't push wheelchairs unless they were trained and staff would n't get themselves trained to push wheelchairs
Dame Anne Owers
The team found a litany of problems and said the prison badly needed support from Prison Service chiefs .
" Safety was now a very worrying issue at Parkhurst , " said the chief inspector of prisons .
" Bullying and violence appeared endemic , with more prisoners reporting that they felt unsafe than on our last visit , and evidence of the under - reporting of incidents . "
" Worries about bullying were compounded by evidence of poor supervision of prisoners on the wings , and of the abuse of prescription medication . "
She said : " In many ways , Parkhurst is a failing prison " .

Dame
Anne said that neither the environment nor the regime were suited to the role of a modern training prison .
' Malign influence '
Relations between staff and prisoners were distant , she said , and the prison was not doing enough to plan resettlements , including forcing the large number of sex offenders to address their crimes .
The report also said " exceptionally poor industrial relations " were exerting " a malign influence " over Parkhurst .
" One of the things that shocked us a great deal and I hope will shock the public was when we came across a disabled prisoner who had not been able to have a shower for a year because staff had not got him into a place where he could do that , " said Dame Anne .
" Another had n't showered for six months .
Staff would n't push wheelchairs unless they were trained and staff would n't get themselves trained to push wheelchairs . "
The report also criticised staff for failing to strike a deal with governors which would have helped the jail 's imam hold religious education classes designed to counter the influence of radical Muslim inmates .
Parkhurst is a Category B prison with a chequered history .
It was a military hospital converted into a prison in 1860 .
It now holds almost 500 inmates .
Phil Wheatley , head of the Prison Service , said he accepted the criticisms of Parkhurst - but said it was now undergoing substantial change after its management was merged with the Isle of Wight 's two other jails .
" I am determined that the creation of the new prison and the associated restructuring will deliver the changes required , " he said .
" I also agree that very poor industrial relations have hampered Parkhurst over the years and this cannot continue if Parkhurst , now part of HMP Isle of Wight , is to progress . "

Article VI , Clause 2 of the US Constitution says :
This Constitution , and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof ; and all Treaties made , or which shall be made , under the Authority of the United States , shall be the supreme Law of the Land ; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby , any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding .
Article VI , Clause 3 says :
The Senators and Representatives before mentioned , and the Members of the several State Legislatures , and all executive and judicial Officers , both of the United States and of the several States , shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation , to support this Constitution ; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States .
There are those on the right who insist that the US should never be bound by International Treaty , but they would be wrong .
When we sign a treaty and ratify it in our Senate , it becomes “ the supreme Law of the Land . ”
To fail to follow it would be to fail to support and defend the Constitution of the United States .
The UN CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment makes it a crime to torture people or to treat prisoners cruelly or inhumanely .
The United States signed this treaty on April 18 , 1988 .
The United States finally got around to ratifying this treaty on October 21 , 1994 .
This means that this treaty was the Law of the Land on January 20 , 2001 , when the Bush Administration came into office .
On August 6 , 2002 , former Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee ( now a federal judge ) , in response to a request from the CIA , signed his name to a memo giving legal cover to the CIA to use a list of interrogation techniques which included waterboarding .
The memo clearly states that the opinion is based on the facts as given him by the CIA , and that if those facts should change , the applicability of the memo could change .
The memo also gives guidelines for how much of these techniques they could legally use .
It appears that even though Bybee told them that a little waterboarding was legal ( he was wrong ) , the CIA exceeded even those guidelines .
Another argument used to justify the techniques was that they were used on military personnel undergoing S.E.R.E. Training .
The argument goes that if it ’s legal to do it to our own people , it should be legal to do with people in our custody .
This argument is wrong because it ignores the fact that the techniques chosen for the S.E.R.E. training were chosen specifically because they were illegal !
They were legal to use in training because undergoing them was voluntary .
The entire point of subjecting people to them was to prepare them for what might happen if they were captured by an enemy that did not follow the law .
How anyone could twist this into a logical argument for saying these techniques are legal to use on people in our custody escapes me .
Believe it or not , despite all the dialog about the subject of waterboarding , about how it is , in the words of one conservative radio talk host , “ absolutely torture ” ; about how it was devised for the purpose of getting people to give false confessions ; about how it does n’t work if you want to gain worthwhile intelligence ( because the person being waterboarded would say anything they thought you wanted to hear to make it stop , as Mancow admitted ) ; and about how illegal it is , there are still people on the right who think it is justified in certain circumstances .
Their primary justification for waterboarding ( or using any other form of torture ) is the “ ticking time bomb scenario ” ( also called the “ Jack Bauer Scenario ” after the main character in a fictional TV show called “ 24 ” , in which Bauer often tortures people to get information to stop a bomb or terrorist attack from going off .
It should be emphasized that this show is a work of fiction .
Real life often does n’t work the way it does on the TV machine . )
This justification , however , could not possibly be applied in this situation because there was no ticking time bomb !
It was only assumed , without any reliable basis , that another attack was imminent and that , therefore , waterboarding could be justified in order to stop that attack .
Yet even with Bybee ’s memo as legal cover , they waterboarded Zubaydah 83 times in one month .
A month of waterboarding and no attacks from al Qaeda happened .
If an attack was really “ imminent ” , would n’t it have happened within that month ?
Since it never happened , nor did one happen during the month they waterboarded Khalid Sheik Mohammad , how could one argue that an attack was imminent ?
Since it is not true that we knew an attack was imminent ( we only assumed it to be the case ) , the primary justification for using the waterboard falls apart .
The treaty we signed stated quite clearly “ No exceptional circumstances whatsoever , whether a state of war or a threat of war , internal political in stability or any other public emergency , may be invoked as a justification of torture . ”
Legal precedent makes it clear that waterboarding is torture .
But even if you want to bury your head in the sand or put your fingers in your years and say “ la - la - la - la - la - la ” when someone tries to say waterboarding is torture , you cannot deny that it is cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment .
Bybee ’s memo answered the wrong question .
As he indicated , he was responding to whether or not the techniques the CIA wanted to use ( the techniques we ’ve all come to know as the “ Enhanced interrogation techniques ” ) were a violation “ the prohibition of torture found at Section 2340A of title 18 of the United States Code . ”
This section only addresses the subject of “ torture ” and does not reference “ cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment . ”
Bybee should have done his homework and looked into whether or not the CIA ’s proposed actions violated Section 2441 of Title 18 of the US Code , which covers War Crimes .
It was , IMHO , poor counseling to tell them that because it did not violate one specific statute , that it was legal .
The treaty we signed also bans the use of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners ( or anyone in custody . )
And performing those acts in the commission of a war constitutes War Crimes .
While we do n’t know exactly what did happen ( thanks to all the people who have been lying on behalf of the Bush Administration ) , we do know enough to be certain that War Crimes were committed , and that they were committed on authorization coming from the White House .
We have to prosecute those involved with this , even if they later claim they only signed documents that others wrote .
A signature has legal meaning .
It is proof of awareness of the details of the item being signed .
They cannot claim ignorance .
They were all knowing participants in the commission of War Crimes .
They belong in prison .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- JPMorgan
Chase reported a better - than - expected profit of $ 2.1 billion in the latest quarter , even as the bank aggressively set aside money to cope with rising loan losses , the company said Thursday .
The New York City - based bank said its net income for the first quarter was $ 2.1 billion , or 40 cents a share .
Profits were down 10 % from a year ago , but still handily beat expectations .
Analysts were anticipating JPMorgan Chase to record a profit of $ 1.38 billion , or 32 cents a share , for the quarter , according to Thomson Reuters .
Bolstering the bank 's results were both its consumer and investment banking divisions , but JPMorgan Chase also logged $ 10 billion in credit costs during the quarter , which included a $ 4 billion addition to its loan loss reserves .
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned that this number could go higher if the recession intensifies , but added that he was comforted by his firm 's robust capital levels .
" These levels of capital and reserves , combined with our significant pre-provision earnings power , enable us to withstand an even worse economic scenario than we face today , " Dimon said in a statement .
As of the end of the quarter , Chase 's Tier 1 capital ratio , a key measure of a bank 's ability to absorb losses , stood at 11.3 % .
Not including the $ 25 billion that the Treasury Department injected into the firm in October , Chase 's Tier 1 ratio was 9.2 % .
A Tier 1 ratio above 8 % is generally considered healthy .
JPMorgan
Chase is among a handful of banks that have hinted at their interest in repaying taxpayer funds they received from the Treasury 's Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , given the increasing restrictions imposed on banks participating in government rescue programs .
Goldman
Sachs announced earlier this week that it would sell new stock to help pay back the government .
During a conference call with analysts and investors Thursday morning , Dimon said that Chase would like to repay TARP money " as soon as possible . "
He added that the company was waiting for the results of the stress test that regulators are conducting on Chase and other big banks , and guidance from the government before proceeding with a return of taxpayer funds .
Dimon also said that , unlike Goldman Sachs , he did not think Chase would have to raise more capital in order to pay back the TARP money .
" I do n't see why a company with [ our ] kind of capital would need to raise capital , " he said .
Dimon added that his firm had no intention of participating in the Treasury Department 's soon - to - be launched Public - Private Investment Program , or PPIP .
That program will allow banks to sell troubled loans or securities to investors partnering with the government .
Dimon told investors Chase was not concerned about whether the program would be effective .
Instead , he said the bank did not want to be any more dependent on the government than it already is .
Banks that have taken taxpayer money have come under intense scrutiny of their compensation practices and overall spending habits in recent months .
" We are certainly not going to borrow from the federal government , " he said .
" We have learned our lesson about that . "
Investment banking bounces back , cards take a hit
Delving deeper into the results , Chase 's investment banking division came roaring back from a loss in the fourth quarter and posted a profit of $ 1.6 billion .
The strong investment banking performance was driven by a revenue surge in its fixed income division , which reported record results in some of its operations including foreign exchange and emerging markets .
Those results mirrored numbers put up by rival Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) , which reported a much - better - than - expected $ 1.8 billion profit earlier this week .
The disappearance of Lehman Brothers and absorption of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America has benefited both firms , but many analysts are already wondering whether their respective investment banks can maintain this pace .
" Both of those banks took market share , " said Richard Staite , a London - based banking analyst with Atlantic Equities who tracks the company .
" The question is how sustainable that revenue source is going forward . "
Also contributing to Chase 's overall profit for the quarter was its retail financial services and commercial banking divisions , but those gains were offset in other areas .
Chase 's credit card division , for example , reported a net loss of $ 547 million , down from a profit of $ 609 million a year ago .
The bank cited a sizable increase in allowances for loan losses and higher charge - offs , or loans the company does n't think are collectable .
" This unit , to no one 's surprise , is showing large losses , " said Bart Narter , an analyst for the Boston - based financial research and consulting firm Celent .
Despite facing the threat of rising credit costs , Dimon maintained that the bank was financially strong enough to weather the current downturn , and is well - positioned for an eventual recovery .
The bank also noted that it was making " excellent progress " with its late September purchase of failed Seattle - based lender Washington Mutual .
Chase has been working hard to integrate WaMu 's assets , including its nationwide retail branch network .
Chase said that it had total branches of just under 5,200 as of the end of the quarter , down from 5 % from late last year as it consolidated some Chase and WaMu locations .
Chase 's encouraging results come on the heels of impressive numbers put up in the last week by two of its biggest rivals - Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) .
Both companies shattered Wall Street 's earnings forecasts , with San Francisco - based Wells Fargo adding last week it expected to book a record profit of $ 3 billion in the latest quarter .
Following Chase 's report , investors ' eyes will now turn to two of the nation 's most embattled banks - Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) .
Citi and BofA are slated to report their first quarter numbers Friday and Monday respectively .
Shares of JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , which are up more than 50 % from lows reached earlier this year , rose more than 3 % in early morning trading .
