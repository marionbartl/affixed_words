ZOMG !
This Christmas tree !
It 's just ... floating !
How in the love of Santa Christ did they do that ?!
Oh , I see , they just hung it from the top .

I will admit that the bottom is pretty badass looking , and it certainly does leave a lot of room for presents .
But you need to have a home setup similar to this to pull it off , and you also need to be cool with your tree dangling from a wire hung from a crane - like apparatus .

But really , if it were my dad who did this , I would tell him to quit fiddling with the tree and to reroute that energy to my presents .
That 's the reason for the season , after all .
[ Instructables ]
By Thomas Adams , at Paykin Krieg and Adams , LLP , and a former managing director at Ambac and FGIC .
In my view , Goldman , and a host of other clever bankers , are deliberately obscuring one of the most important points about modeling , CDOs and sophisticated investors .
One of their defenses against the tremendous losses these products delivered amounts to “ caveat emptor ” : everyone is a grown up and should have known what he was buying .
But that conveniently obscures a critically important fact : for so - called ABS CDOs ( the kind made from asset backed securities , meaning tranches of either residential or commercial mortgage bonds ) , 75 % to 90 % of the deal was rated AAA .
And these ratings did not depend on the insurance provided by AIG or monolines ; those ratings were issued on the CDO as concocted by the packager / underwriter .
The argument that the CDO market blew up because it was so complex and speculative is fundamentally flawed .
Believe it or not , the bonds that caused the damage to AIG , the bond insurers , and banks were not highly speculative , high risk bonds .
They were AAA securities and were supposed to be virtually free of credit risk .
In many cases , they were “ super senior ” bonds – meaning they had another layer of protection above the AAA level to make them even safer than regular AAA bonds .
In return for this high level of safety and large levels of protection , the investors or insurers received a very low AAA level yield .
In addition , because the bonds were heavily protected , AAA rated and presumably safe , the investors and insurers did not ( and were not required to ) allocate very much capital to them .
The bonds were not considered risky , so there was little need to reserve capital against them .
In contrast , the investors and insurers held much more capital against the BBB bonds in their portfolio .
This was fundamental to their business model .
Historically , investors viewed super - safe , high quality investments , such as Treasury securities , as simple , non-sophisticated investments where their money could be placed safely without worry about complex models and detailed review .
In most institutions , a novice portfolio manager starts out by investing in AAA bonds , and works his way up the sophistication curve over time .
Over the past few years , many investors seem to have forgotten this .
But anyone who thought they needed to be super - smart , sophisticated and using “ cutting edge ” models ( the phrase my old boss used ) in order to invest in AAA bonds was either a fool or a fraud .
In retrospect , there were plenty of both types .
In other words , these highly complex products were targeted to buyers who in many cases were the very least sophisticated institutional investors .
And fund managers , both freestanding ones , and ones within larger organizations ( think portfolio managers at insurance companies ) are subject to competitive pressures .
If industry benchmarks for AAA returns start to include complex , manufactured AAA paper , these investors would damage their careers by sticking to what they were sure they understood and shunning the more complex instruments that offer a bit of a yield pickup .
As Keynes observed ,
A sound banker , alas , is not one who foresees danger and avoids it , but one who , when he is ruined , is ruined in a conventional way along with his fellows , so that no one can really blame him .
The whole notion that an investor must do complex , detailed , sophisticated analysis of AAA bonds in order to understand them and not get ripped off is , as a result , completely upside down .
A high yield or a distressed bond requires a lot of analysis to determine if it is safe .
This may involve elaborate models and multiple scenarios .
Investors who pursue these types of risky bonds believe they have the tools to understand all of the considerations that go into the decision to purchase it or not .
This type of investor is sophisticated and is aware that he is either taking risk or making a speculative bet .
To compensate this investor for such a bet , the bonds pay a high yield and , if the bet is right , produce a high return .
Even if the bet eventually goes bad , the yield may be enough to pay the investor so that the loss is offset .
Often , investors in these bonds employ teams of quants and Phd ’s to help them understand their bets .
Investments in AAA bonds are supposed the opposite of this type of high yield investment .
It makes absolutely no sense that a AAA investor should need the same high tech models to make his investments or that if he fails to properly use his models he will be completely blown up and his investment will be worthless .
This “ highly sophisticated investor ” argument has been used by Goldman , other banks and a remarkably high number of journalists ( in my opinion just repeating the crap they have been fed by their sources ) as a way of getting the banks off the hook .
But it is a fundamentally flawed argument .
The CDO bonds that AIG insured were rated AAA .
If you have to be a rocket scientist to understand the investment and if anything short of perfect analysis of the bonds means you will be blown up – then by definition the bonds are not AAA .
AAA = easy and low yield .
BBB = complex , high yield .
This is a pretty simple and bright light distinction .
And yet it has been blurred and ignored throughout the discussion of this asset , as recently as two days ago by Goldman .
A “ super senior ” investment in any asset should , by definition , not require sophisticated analysis .
it should be as safe as , or safer than , Treasury securities from a CREDIT perspective ( ratings do not address market value or interest rate risk – which could be more complex ) .
Neither investors in , nor insurers of , AAA or super senior bonds were compensated with high yields – they were not yield hogs , as suggested by one comment on NC the other day .
If they were getting huge yields they would have been on notice that their risk was high .
I do n’t want excuse the insurers or investors of all of their responsibility .
I was one of them .
We got sucked into the game of “ complex ” AAA bonds and believed that we were sophisticated .
It was part of the cultural experience of the era – even boring old muni people wanted to believe that they were “ special ” and “ sophisticated ” .
An investment that purports to be AAA or super AAA should be obviously of high quality .
There should be “ no ifs ands or buts ” about it .
The investment should not be binary , such that if you are “ right ” it is AAA and if you are wrong it is worthless .
Model sophistication , extreme diligence , the need to have skepticism about potential lies or misrepresentations from sellers and issuers – all of this is completely incompatible with a AAA bond .
Goldman Sachs and dozens of other banks and captured journalists want the story to be about the failure of the investors who were sophisticated and assumed the risk .
They ignore the crucial fact that the bonds that blew up were AAA and were sold as virtually risk free .
The entire environment created by the banks , managers and rating agencies for the AAA CDO market was false and contrary to the definition of what was being sold .
The reason that is most frequently cited as why AAA CDO bonds collapsed in value is that they had extreme cliff risk , or tail risk .
However , the notion of “ cliff risk ” should be incompatible with a AAA bond – by definition .
Any model that obscures or ignores or adjusts this issue away , is a form of sophisticated lying , as it relates to AAA bonds .
The problem with the CDO market , and a good chunk of the financial crisis , is that the participants took complex , highly volatile , highly risky and highly leveraged assets and passed a magic wand over them to turn them into AAA .
Unfortunately , this process did nothing to remove the volatility , risk , complexity or leverage ( in fact , the CDO made all of these worse ) .
From the very start , the market for AAA CDO bonds backed by ABS collateral was a fraud ; the advocates of these bonds used fancy models , flashy Powerpoint presentations , expensive meals and a whole lot of flattery to convince people it was n’t a fraud , but that did n’t change the truth .
The essence of the issue is that these AAAs that blew up and went to zero ( and this is no exaggeration , many former AAA - rated CDOS are utterly worthless ) were hopelessly badly designed and / or fraudulently sold .
As Yves and I will be discussing in upcoming posts ( and Yves covers at some length in her book ) , there is ample reason to believe a lot of the CDO packagers and underwriters knew exactly what they were doing
The rating agencies should have known that this degree of complexity and an AAA rating were fundamentally incompatible , but they were financially incented to ignore it ( they got paid much more money for rating CDOs ) .
The investors and insurers should have known it too .
But I am pretty confident that the biggest responsibility lies with the sellers and the creators of the bonds – they were selling something that was supposed to be super safe but turned out to be worthless – and they knew this to be the case , one way or the other .
Mr Astiz is alleged to have infiltrated a human rights group
An ex-navy captain dubbed the Blond Angel of Death has gone on trial in Argentina with 18 others for kidnap and torture during military rule .
Alfredo Astiz and the other defendants are accused of abuses at the Navy Mechanics School detention centre .
He is accused of involvement in the disappearance of dozens of people , including two French nuns .
Between 10,000 and 30,000 people are believed to have been disappeared during the 1976 to 1983 dictatorship .
Mr Astiz is alleged to have had a central role in the abduction and disappearance of the nuns , Alice Domon and Leonie Duquet , investigative journalist Rodolfo Walsh and several founders of a human rights group , the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo .
He is said to have helped security forces by infiltrating meetings of the Mothers at a church in Buenos Aires .
Leonie Duquet was thrown from a plane during one of the many " flights of death " during which the military disposed of prisoners .
Her body was washed ashore and she was buried in an unmarked grave , until her remains were formally identified in 2005 .
Alice Domon 's remains have never been found .
Mr Astiz denies any knowledge of such flights and argues that he was following orders to protect Argentina from extremist violence .
The Argentine courts have identified 250 navy personnel who worked in the Navy Mechanics school at the time - some 70 have been charged so far .
A 50 - year - old man was shot in the foot Friday night after witnessing a break - and - enter at his next - door neighbour 's home in the Don Mills area .
The victim was standing outside his home near Lawrence Ave. E. and Leslie St. around 10 p.m. when he heard his neighbours call for help .
As he dialled 911 on his cell phone , he watched as two men ran out of the house , one of them carrying a gun .
One of the suspects shot the man in the foot before driving away .
The man was taken to hospital with minor injuries .
The two neighbours , who were at home during the break - and - enter , were not injured .
Staff Sgt. Brian Moorcroft called the incident " a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time . "
The suspects are described as male , five - feet , nine - inches tall , wearing dark clothing and driving a black Honda or Acura .

( AP ) --
A robot powered by a ground - based laser beam climbed a long cable dangling from a helicopter on Wednesday to qualify for prize money in a $ 2 million competition to test the potential reality of the science fiction concept of space elevators .
The highly technical contest brought teams from Missouri , Alaska and Seattle to Rogers Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert , most familiar to the public as a space shuttle landing site .
The contest requires their machines to climb 2,953 feet ( nearly 1 kilometer ) up a cable slung beneath a helicopter hovering nearly a mile high .
LaserMotive 's vehicle zipped up to the top in just over four minutes and immediately repeated the feat , qualifying for at least a $ 900,000 second - place prize .
Video :
In their first run today and their first ever successful run in any of the NASA sponsored Power Beaming Challenge events , Team Lasermotive qualified for at least a share of the 1st level prize money of $ 900,000 .

Russell Lincoln Ackoff passed away October 29 , 2009 .
Ackoff was one of the most controversial researchers in operations research .
A prolific writer , his early work was pure operations research , as it was understood in the early 1960s .
Ackoff was an early ( 1956 - 57 ) president of the Operations Research Society of America ( ORSA , a forerunner of INFORMS ) and co-wrote an influential textbook on operations research with Churchman and Arnoff in 1962 .
By the late 1970s , Ackoff was disillusioned with operations research , penning articles with titles such as “ The Future of Operational Research is Past ” .
Kirby has a nice article outlining his changing views .
I have a number of Ackoff ’s books and enjoy his writing very much .
I particularly enjoy “ The art of problem solving ( accompanied by Ackoff ’s Fabes ) “ , which contains a number of stories that I use in my classes .
I was a teenager when Ackoff split from operations research , and the issues Ackoff brings up do not resonate with me .
There are lots of ways to solve problems .
Not every business problem is a linear program .
But not every business problem can be solved by bringing together a dozen people to draw circles and arrows .
Operations Research has its place , as does the direction Ackoff went in .
Criticism from a source as well respected as Ackoff has been salutary for the field , I believe .
Understanding the limits of what we do is as important as understanding our successes .
While perhaps Ackoff could have headed off in new directions with a little less rancor , our field is richer for having had him both within it , and outside of it .
But I think the best of operations research is still to come .

Something more than alcohol is to blame for the following clip one suspects .
A man visits a convenience store but is unable to meet the challenge of completing a transaction .
In his speech to Congress on the need to overhaul health care , President Obama asserted :
More and more Americans pay their premiums , only to discover that their insurance company has dropped their coverage when they get sick , or wo n’t pay the full cost of care .
It happens every day .
The following week , Health Care for America Now , a group supporting the Democrats ’ health care reform bill , ran a television ad claiming that private health insurance companies : “ Deny 1 out of 5 treatments prescribed by doctors . ”
When fact - checked by PolitiFact.com , it turned out the statistic had been derived by the California Nurses Association , which broadened its definition of “ denial ” to include such administrative non-events as a claim having been sent to the wrong insurer .
Such snafus occur behind the scenes , and the patient never knows about them because his / her claim is , in fact , subsequently paid by the correct insurer .
And the drumbeat goes on —
Every day in cities and towns across the United States , Americans with insurance are denied medically necessary care by a for - profit insurer .
A treatment , test , medication or even a surgical procedure ordered by their physician is denied , all in the name of increasing the bottom line .
— surely leading inexorably to the conclusion that we must take action NOW to pass health care “ reform ” !
But , when you take the “ profit ” out of health care , what do you find ?
According to the American Medical Association ’s National Health Insurer Report Card for 2008 , the government ’s health plan , Medicare , denied medical claims at nearly double the average for private insurers : Medicare denied 6.85 % of claims .
The highest private insurance denier was Aetna @ 6.8 % , followed by Anthem Blue Cross @ 3.44 , with an average denial rate of medical claims by private insurers of 3.88 %
In its 2009 National Health Insurer Report Card , the AMA reports that Medicare denied only 4 % of claims — a big improvement , but outpaced better still by the private insurers .
The prior year ’s high private denier , Aetna , reduced denials to 1.81 % — an astounding 75 % improvement — with similar declines by all other private insurers , to average only 2.79 % .
Maybe there ’s something to be said for the need to keep your customers satisfied in order to make that profit after all .
Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Europe 's largest oil company , said its Nigerian venture is taking advantage of a declared cease - fire to quickly restore 800,000 barrels a day of production lost to earlier militant attacks .
The Soku gas plant , shut down after sabotage , was restarted on Oct. 15 , Ann Pickard , African executive vice president for Shell , told journalists in Cape Town today .
The company is trying to ramp up production following an “ indefinite cease - fire ” declared by the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta , the main rebel group known as MEND , on Oct. 25 .
HAVANA , Cuba —
The sharks , sea turtles and other miscellaneous underwater creatures that roam the Gulf of Mexico could care less about the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba , or the island ’s one - party communist state .
So why should such terrestrial concerns get in the way of marine research ?
That appears to be the logic behind a growing partnership between scientists in the U.S. , Cuba , and Mexico working on a multinational plan to protect the gulf ’s underwater ecosystems .
This week , a delegation of about 30 U.S. researchers and ocean advocates have been in Havana for meetings with their Cuban and Mexican counterparts , and trip organizers said they ’re aiming to create a regional protection strategy that all three countries would enforce .
Similar collaborations exist between the U.S. and Cuba for hurricane tracking and research , but participants said this was the most significant marine science partnership between the countries to date .
The effort is another small but significant example of improving ties between the U.S. and Cuba on matters of mutual concern — in this case a single , shared marine ecosystem .
“ We know our countries have different administrations and points of view , but there ’s only one atmosphere and one ocean , ” said Alberto Vazquez de la Cerda , an oceanographer and retired vice admiral of the Mexican Navy , who hosted two previous meetings for U.S. and Cuba scientists in Mexico .
“ Mother nature does n’t care about borders or politics , ” he said .
The meetings have identified several priorities for the three countries , including research and conservation of coral reefs , sharks , sea turtles and dolphins , as well as the better management of fisheries .
Unlike other parts of the globe where large stretches of open international waters can make enforcement difficult , the Gulf of Mexico is divided almost entirely among the three countries , improving the chances for protection , scientists said .
Politics remain an obstacle to the partnership .
Cuban authorities have traditionally been wary of U.S. scientists seeking to visit remote areas of the island for research purposes out of concern over espionage .
And the U.S. government has routinely denied visas for Cuban marine researchers seeking to travel to the U.S. , though the Obama administration has shown more flexibility lately in granting academic and research visas , according to conference participants .
“ Because of the political relationship between our countries , it takes some stamina to work here , ” said David Guggenheim , the marine scientist who led the U.S. delegation , speaking at Cuba ’s National Aquarium in Havana , where the meetings were held .
A comprehensive effort to study marine ecosystems in the gulf and advocate for their protection is likely to cost tens of millions of dollars , Guggenheim said .
“ Eventually this is going to require the support of governments , and multiple government agencies . "
One factor potentially complicating such a partnership is that Cuba is looking to develop deep water petroleum reserves in its portion of the gulf , having signed exploration deals with nearly a dozen foreign oil companies in recent years .
The U.S. Geological Survey has estimated Cuba ’s potential oil deposits at 5 billion barrels — on par with some of the region ’s biggest suppliers — while Cuban officials claim up to 20 billion barrels lie beneath the ocean floor .
No offshore drilling operations are currently underway , but if Cuba and its partners do strike oil , it would present a serious new environmental hazard for the region .
Prevailing currents would likely push an oil spill into the Florida Keys and up the U.S. eastern seaboard , scientists say , but they recognize Cuba is too pressed for cash to forgo lucrative energy development in favor of strict environmental protection .
That ’s a reason U.S. scientists say they want to form partnerships now — to advocate for the safest and most sensitive drilling practices .
American scientists also said they ’re eager to explore Cuba ’s marine ecosystems , which include some of the region ’s most extensive and intact coral reefs .
Cuba has excellent scientists , U.S. researchers said , but the country has lacked the financial resources to gather much data in recent years .
“ Cuba is the least known corner of the Gulf of Mexico , ” said Guggenheim , director of the Washington - based advocacy group 1 planet1ocean.org .
“ For marine researchers in Flordia , Cuba is a very romantic place , ” said Robert Hueter , director of the Center for Shark Research at MOTE Marine Laboratory in Sarasota .
“ We ’ve often looked south to Cuba from the shores of the Florida Keys and thought ‘ why ca n’t we go there to extend our studies ? ' "
Hueter said the species he studies travel back and forth between the U.S. and Cuba , and that shark populations in the region have declined 50 to 75 percent since industrial fishing for the animals began 30 years ago .
For some species , the decline is more than 90 percent .
That underlines the need for multinational protection , said Hueter .
While he recognizes there are political reasons that make closer cooperation difficult , “ from a scientific basis , it just does n’t make sense for us to treat this area of the ocean as if it does n’t exist . ”

Today I 'd like to introduce you a Perl module I really like and use a lot in my code .
It 's called Perl6 :: Junction and you can get it from CPAN .
Please have a look what it can do for you .
Perl6::Junction comes in when you 're working on Arrays .
For example , if you 'd like to search your array if it contains a defined element , usually your code will look like this :
my @animal = ( ' squirrel ' , ' cat ' , ' catfish ' , ' sausage - dog ' , ' guinea pig ' , ' pig ' ) ; # using a foreach loop to walk trough all array elements
#
foreach my $ animal ( @animal ) { if ( $ animal eq ' guinea pig ' ) { # found my lovely guinea pig in this group of animals !
last ;
}
} # you could also go and use grep to search your array
#
if ( grep ( / ^guinea pig$ / , @animal ) ) { # found it !
}
But especially grep is not easy to use for beginners and one could make many mistakes when using it .
For example , just calling grep like grep ( ' cat ' , @animal ) will match every string in the array because it excepts a BLOCK or regular expression and not a string as first argument and interprets the string as ' TRUE ' which matches everything .
Doing a grep ( / cat/ , @animal ) will match every array element that contains the string ' cat ' .
It would match ' cat ' and ' catfish ' in this example .
Most of the time , this is not really what you want .
When using Perl6 :: Junction it becomes as easy as this :
use Perl6:: Junction qw ( all any none one ) ; my @animal = ( ' squirrel ' , ' cat ' , ' catfish ' , ' sausage - dog ' , ' guinea pig ' , ' pig ' ) ; if ( any ( @animal ) eq ' guinea pig ' ) { # one or more guinea pig's in the list of animals !
} if ( one ( @ainmal ) eq ' guinea pig ' ) { # exactly one guinea pig in the list
} my @herd = ( ' sheep ' , ' sheep ' , ' wolf ' , ' sheep ' , ' sheep ' ) ; unless ( all ( @herd ) eq ' sheep ' ) { # watch out !
}
Pretty nice , right ? :)
If I caught your interest , please have a look at more examples in the modules documentation at CPAN .
The Nor'easter formerly known as Ida has been wreaking havoc at the Jersey Shore , causing flooding , school and business closings , road barricades , bridge closures and island evacuations .
Driving is so hazardous , tolls have been lifted in some areas for the brave souls willing to challenge the elements .
The slow moving storm is creeping its way up the East Coast bringing strong winds , driving rains and high surf .
Sustained winds have been clocked at 30 - 40 m.p.h. with gusts up to 60 m.p.h .
Waves are cresting as high as 19 ft. and floodwaters rose in towns up and down the coast .
Police requested the Department of Public Works to barricade the side streets in the Schellingers Landing area of Lower Township after tidal flooding made the roads impassable .
Tolls have been lifted by the Cape May County Bridge Commission for the Middle Thorofare and Ocean City Longport Bridges until Saturday at 8 a.m .
The George Redding Bridge and West Wildwood bridge are closed .
Officials reopened the Ocean 34th Street bridge and Ocean City Longport bridge Friday , but the Ocean City 9th Stree bridge remains closed .
Authorities made a sad discovery late Thursday , recovering a man 's body floating in thigh - high floodwaters .
They believe his death was accidential .
Ocean City , N.J. lived up to its namesake as water from both the ocean and bay washed ashore Friday .
15 - foot high dunes were reduced to mere hills on the beach .
Businesses and homes along the back bay were under feet of water as the island saw its worst flooding in years .
While 40 or 60 m.p.h. winds may seem tame when compared to what a hurricane may bring , those winds are expected to continually pound the coast for at least the next 12 hours .
NBCPhiladelphia chief meteorologist Glenn " Hurricane " Schwartz gives this explanation :
" In a hurricane let 's say you have a 80 m.p.h. peak wind , you might get that wind for one hour or two , now we 're talking about 24 , 48 , 72 hours worth of wind coming from the same direction and it just keeps piling the water up and up and up and that is what 's causing this big problem . "
And it 's those waters which are especially worrisome to shore community officials , causing them to issue an evacuation advisory for island towns stretching from Ocean City , N.J. to Cape May .
LOCALS : Send in your photos and video of the Nor'easter 's wrath here !
In a press conference Thursday , officials advised residents living on the western side of the barrier islands to leave .
" We are asking everyone if they see water in lying areas to please not drive through it , to secure any outside furniture and anything that could be gone away with the wind , " Cape May County community director Lenora Bonifante said .
Officials signed an emergency declaration at 6 p.m. Thursday giving them access to the N.J. National Guard for additional help .
A state of emergency was also declared for Kent and Sussex counties in Delaware .
Floodwaters had already begun to crest over the sea wall in West Wildwood Thursday evening .
NBCPhiladelphia reporter Ted Greenberg and his crew narrowly escaped stranding as the waters crept upward .
" The water around our live van got so high we were afraid we were gonna lose the van , " Greenberg said via phone .
" The water was actually coming up to the doorways , it was over the exhaust pipe ... and that was not even at the height of high tide . "
Emergency shelters will be opened as needed , officials said .
They continue to stress that while evacuations are n't mandatory , it is better to be safe than sorry .

Four police officers have been shot dead in an ambush at a coffee shop in Washington State , police say .
Officials said at least one gunman walked into a coffee shop in Parkland , near the McChord Air Force Base , and opened fire .
A sheriff 's spokesman said the attack was " like an execution " and it was not believed to have been a robbery .
Other people in the coffee shop at the time were not injured .
Police are searching for the gunman .
Parkland is in Pierce County , 40 miles ( 65 km ) south of Seattle .
Pierce County Sheriff 's spokesman Ed Troyer said the officers , three men and a woman , had been working on their laptops in the coffee shop when the shooting happened on Sunday morning .
This was more of an execution .
Walk in with the specific mindset to shoot police officers .
Ed Troyer
Pierce County Sheriff 's spokesman
He described it as a " flat - out ambush " of the uniformed police , adding that none of the employees or any other people inside the cafe were hit .
" This was more of an execution .
Walk in with the specific mindset to shoot police officers , " Mr Troyer said .
The other people in the cafe were being interviewed by police .
" Some are in shock .
They are very upset , " Mr Troyer said .
" They are the ones who are going to put together for us how this happened . "
First reports said there had been two gunmen but Mr Troyer told the BBC he now believed there was only one .
He said the suspect is a black male in his late 20s or early 30s who was scruffy , wearing a black coat and blue jeans .
He said there was some evidence that one of the officers managed to shoot back , possibly hitting the gunman .
Police are searching the area for the shooter
He said medical staff should be on the lookout for any person who needed treatment for a gunshot wound and claimed it was accidental .
Theron Zahn , of KOMO - TV , told the BBC that a huge police operation involving hundreds of officers was under way .
" Police helicopters are in the air using their infra-red cameras for anyone who may be hiding nearby .
It is a massive manhunt . "
Police are offering a $ 10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the gunmen .
They later said they were looking for Maurice Clemmons as part of an investigation .
They said they wanted the question the 37 - year - old with a long criminal history as a " person of interest " in the case .

At the threshold of a sterile lab at NASA 's Johnson Space Center in Houston , I pull on a white clean - room suit , a surgical cap and mask , booties and latex gloves .
My host , a mineralogist named Mike Zolensky , swabs my digital voice recorder with alcohol to remove flakes of skin and pocket lint .
He does n't want any detritus to contaminate the precious dust in the room .
Once inside , Zolensky retrieves a palm - size glass box from a cabinet .
The box holds a rectangular chunk , less than two inches across , of eerily translucent material .
I lean in and squint at it but can't quite focus on anything .
Zolensky turns off the lights and hands me a laser pointer .
The red beam reveals thin streaks in the chunk that start at its surface and penetrate fractions of an inch , like the traces of tiny bullets .
" Those are the comet impacts , " he says .
" It 's beautiful to look at . "
The tracks were made during the world 's first — and only — attempt to chase a comet and bring a bit of it home .
The NASA mission , called Stardust , sent a spacecraft to Comet Wild 2 ( pronounced " VILT - too " ) on a seven - year journey that ended in 2006 .
It brought back the only material — other than moon rocks — taken directly from an extraterrestrial body .
Scientists expect the comet dust to yield clues about how our solar system and planet were formed .
Earth has been through so much in its 4.5 billion years — volcanoes have erupted , mountains have risen and fallen , heat and water have chemically transformed rocks time and again — that scientists have trouble getting their hands on the earliest possible geologic evidence in what might be called showroom condition .
It has all been buried or altered .
In contrast , comets , which are about the same age as Earth , are pristine relics .
" There 's nothing left on Earth 's surface that 's nearly as old as these bits of crystals and minerals , " says Carlton Allen , astromaterials curator at the Johnson Space Center .
A comet , he continues , harbors the " starting material for our solar system , the stuff that came together to make everything we see . "
Comets originated on the outskirts of a vast cloud of gas and dust that coalesced into our solar system more than 4.5 billion years ago .
Crystals of ice far from the Sun gradually combined with dust to form trillions of comets , which have orbited slowly around the Sun ever since in a deep freeze far beyond Neptune .
Only when gravity from a nearby star or some cosmic disturbance nudges them do they approach the Sun ; then we see streams of gas and dust as the ice vaporizes — the signature tail .
The most famous , Comet Halley , is barely ten miles across , but it produces a beautiful tail tens of millions of miles long when its looping orbit brings it between Earth and the Sun every 76 years .
( Earth will see it again in 2061 . )
Asteroids , too , are ancient , but most orbit between Mars and Jupiter , where the Sun has baked them for billions of years .
Most of them are dense and rocky , some even metallic , shedding pieces that sometimes land on Earth as meteorites .
The travel plan of NASA 's Stardust sounds like a Buck Rogers adventure .
Swing far past Mars to within 150 miles of Comet Wild 2 , which streaks by at 13,700 miles per hour .
Catch fragments without destroying them .
Travel back to Earth and drop a capsule into the atmosphere for a blazing nighttime re-entry over Utah .
Parachute to the ground without crashing .
" We were scared up to the last second , " Zolensky says .
" We still can't believe it really worked . "
For all the impressive rocketry , the mission 's most significant technology may have been the strange substance that caught the comet dust .
Called aerogel , it 's the lightest solid ever created .
A slab the size of an average person would weigh less than a pound .
A scientist once let me crumble some in my hand ; it felt like brittle talc .
Yet aerogel is tough .
It 's made of silica compounds arranged in an elaborate web that can snare particles plowing into it at up to six times the speed of a rifle bullet .
The spacecraft carried two aluminum collecting trays shaped like oversize tennis rackets .
Each tray held about 130 rectangular pockets filled with aerogel blocks smaller than ice cubes .
In the clean room , Zolensky returns the aerogel chunk to the storage cabinet and removes a bolted aluminum case .
Inside lies an entire comet collection tray .
It 's worth about $ 200 million .
" I 'm always nervous about this part , " he says .
" I try not to drop it . "
He places the case on a stainless steel table , unbolts it and lifts the lid .
" Air flows down from the ceiling , so the rule here is that we never stand over the tray , " he tells me .
Even with the mask on , I am acutely aware that I must not sneeze .
The aerogel cubes , tinged lu­minescent blue , look like puffs of breath exhaled on a winter morning and frozen solid .
The laser pointer reveals scores of tracks marring the cubes ' surfaces and interiors , some like sharp pinpricks , others like splaying roots .
A few dozen cubes are missing from the tray .
Zolensky and his colleagues have cut out hundreds of small sections of those cubes .
They remove an entire particle track by poking a pair of sharp glass fibers into the aerogel , a process that takes up to a day .
The extracted piece looks like the clipped corner of a fingernail and has a particle at one end .
Seen through a microscope , the particle Zolensky shows me is jet black .
Astronomers once pictured comets as gently disintegrating " fluffy ice balls . "
Then detailed photographs revealed that comets ' outer rinds are blackened crusts , charred by the radiation of space .
Ice and dust spew through fissures in the crust , eroding the comet 's interior with each orbit .
The Stardust samples — messengers from the inside of Wild 2 — show that comets are dark through and through .
Under higher magnification , the dust particles look like exploded popcorn kernels .
Stardust scientists were surprised to find that some of the comet 's grains are made of minerals that form only at extremely high temperatures .
It appears that these grains arose close to the Sun , inside the orbit of Mercury , in a blast furnace far removed from the calm , cold margins of the solar system where comets now drift .
No one had expected that the hot ingredients of the inner solar system mixed with the cold outer solar system billions of years ago .
" It 's a remarkable result , " says planetary scientist Michael A'Hearn of the University of Maryland .
" It 's causing us to rethink how things got put together . "
It may mean that wind or radiation from the newborn Sun was stronger than expected , propelling the heat - forged grains deep into the solar system , where they merged with ices and frigid dust into comets .
The collection tray also captured evidence suggesting that comets may have helped seed life on Earth .
NASA researchers found traces of glycine — one of the amino acids that make up the proteins in all living things — on the aluminum foil lining the sides of the aerogel cubes .
The discovery , confirmed this past summer , suggests that comets contain some of life 's basic molecules .
Comets and meteorites colliding with the young Earth would have spread such compounds , possibly providing the ingredients for the Earth 's first cells .
Stardust was n't the only comet mission .
NASA 's Deep Impact spacecraft slammed a probe into Comet P9 / Tem­pel 1 in 2005 and found that the crust was rigid but the layers underneath were weak and powdery .
A European mission now en route , Rosetta , will try to land on a comet in 2014 , scoop up some icy dirt and analyze it on the spot .
After we strip off our clean - room suits , Zolensky takes me downstairs to see the mission 's return capsule .
( It is now on display at the National Air and Space Museum . )
The cone - shaped shield that protected Stardust 's cargo during its fiery re-entry is about a yard wide .
There 's some dirt on it , Utah mud from the landing .
The capsule 's surface , a carbon composite mixed with cork , is burned and yields slightly to the touch .
The spacecraft flew three billion miles — the most distant traveler ever to find its way home .
Robert Irion has written about black holes and new planets for Smithsonian .
Barry Bonds ' agent finally acknowledged Wednesday that the home run king is done playing baseball .
" It 's two years since he played his last game , and if there was any chance he'd be back in a major - league uniform , it would have happened by now , " agent Jeff Borris told The Chronicle .
" When 2008 came around , I could n't get him a job .
When 2009 came around , I could n't get him a job .
Now , 2010 ... I 'd say it 's nearly impossible .
It 's an unfortunate ending to a storied career . "
Technically , Bonds has n't retired , and he repeatedly has said he wo n't retire , leaving open the outside chance that some team will call .
Bonds , 45 , last played in 2007 , when he led the National League in on - base percentage ( .480 ) , walks ( 132 ) and intentional walks ( 43 ) .
He hit .276 with 28 homers and 66 RBIs but received zero job offers for 2008 while under an indictment accusing him of lying to a federal grand jury about never knowingly using performance - enhancing drugs .
" I 'm sure if they gave him two weeks in a cage , he'd be hitting amongst the best in the game right now , " Borris said .
" But Major League Baseball will never give him that chance . "
Borris would n't address a possible collusion case against MLB , but the players ' union continues to consider it .
In 23 seasons , Bonds had 762 homers , 1,996 RBIs and a .444 on - base percentage .
" If they would have let Barry play baseball until his on - base percentage dropped below .400 , he probably would 've been playing until he was 56 , " Borris said .

Advertisement Police in Copenhagen in Denmark say nearly 1,000 protesters were detained after a huge climate change rally .
The move came after youths threw bricks and smashed windows as more than 30,000 demonstrators marched to demand action at the UN climate change summit .
A police spokesman said " almost all " of those arrested have now been released with just a few facing charges .
Similar marches have been held in cities around the world , calling for decisive action on global warming .
Meanwhile , ministers have started arriving to join other delegates at the UN summit which runs for another week .
Documents prepared by the conference 's leaders call on developed nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions by between 25 % and 45 % of 1990 levels by 2020 .
AT THE SCENE Matt McGrath , BBC News , Copenhagen
The colourful parade , with some people dressed in polar bear suits , departed Parliament Square amid tight security .
According to reports , police moved in when masked youths threw bricks and smashed windows in the centre of the city .
Denmark 's parliament recently passed controversial laws giving police powers of pre-emptive arrest of anyone they believe is likely to break the law .
According to a source close to the Danish government , those people who were " pre-emptively detained " will be held for up to four hours .
Those arrested will be brought before a judge within 24 hours .
Your photos from the rally EU leaders are offering developing countries a three - year deal that would pay them 7.2bn euros ( £ 6.5 bn ; $ 10.6 bn ) to help cope with climate change .
The exact target for limiting temperature rise is unclear amid disputes between various blocs .
Danish police estimate that some 30,000 people joined the march while organisers put the number at 100,000 .
They marched 6 km ( four miles ) across the city to the conference centre where negotiators and ministers are meeting .
After violence erupted , large numbers of mainly young people were detained .
TV pictures showed the police putting the demonstrators in seated lines on the street with their hands tied behind their backs .
They were later removed on buses .
Henrek Suhr , of Copenhagen police , told the BBC that their intelligence had suggested a small group of people had planned violence .
" We thought ... these people would make a lot of trouble in Copenhagen had we not arrested them , and we arrested them because they had done a lot of things before our arrests .
They smashed some windows at the foreign ministry , " he said .
He rejected claims by climate protesters that some of those being held had been mistreated and denied access to basic needs .
Simon Sheikh , of the Australian social and political network " Get Up " , said he had witnessed the detentions from his apartment in the centre of the city .

In pictures : Climate protests " The police rounded up protesters in a pre-planned manoeuvre , " he told the BBC .
" It was unprovoked .
They rounded up a group , including women and children , and pushed them into a store , before splitting them into groups and handcuffing them . "
A police spokesman said just four or five out of 968 arrested would be charged and appear in court .
He said most of those who had been arrested had been part of an organised group which had been throwing fireworks and stones .
Activists are arguing for an ambitious , legally binding agreement on emissions cuts to be signed by world leaders at the summit 's conclusion at the end of next week .
" This is the right time to shout out and let leaders know this is serious business for us all .
Lets hope they listen , " Lin Che , a 28 - year - old student from Taiwan , told Reuters news agency .
A number of famous figures said they would join the protest , among them Bollywood actor Rahul Bose , model and photographer Helena Christensen and former UN human rights commissioner Mary Robinson .

No detailed framework on carbon markets - " various approaches " will be pursued In Australia , where events were held as part of the country 's fifth Walk Against Warming , the largest protest was held in Melbourne .
The march closed with protesters spelling out the message " Safe Climate - Do It ! " on the ground .
Organisers said aerial photographs had been taken and would be sent to delegates at the talks in Copenhagen .
In Adelaide , activist James Dannenberg told state radio : " We want [ world leaders ] to bring home a treaty , we want them to stand by the Pacific and our neighbours there .
" And we want them to deliver and ensure a safe climate future for us all . "
Thousands of demonstrators also gathered in front of Australia 's parliament house in the capital , Canberra .

Tens of thousands of children have been sexually abused in Zimbabwe in a growing epidemic that has shocked human rights activists .
A single clinic in the capital , Harare , says it has treated nearly 30,000 girls and boys who were abused in the past four years ‑ an average of 20 per day .
Experts believe that the country 's economic collapse under Robert Mugabe has led to widespread family breakdown and left many children vulnerable .
Dr Robert - Grey Choto , a paediatrician and co-founder of the Family Support Trust Clinic , said the increase was alarming .
" In the last four years we have seen over 29,000 cases , and in the last 10 years we have more than 70,000 at this clinic alone , " he told the BBC's Network Africa programme .
" It 's a tip of the iceberg ‑ the problem is enormous .
We need drugs and any assistance we can get . "
A 12 - year - old patient at the clinic , part of the main referral hospital in Harare , told the BBC he had been gang - raped in a township last month .
" Four men waylaid me on my way from school , " he said .
" I was taken to a shop where they showed me pornographic material . "
The boy said he was then drugged and sodomised for more than a week .
His father added : " This is unbearable .
All I want is justice for now . "
Other organisations dedicated to helping victims are on the back foot because of Zimbabwe 's tense political climate .
Betty Makoni , founder of the Girl Child Network ( GCN ) , which has rescued more than 35,000 girls from sex abuse , was forced into exile last year because of threats against her .
Speaking from London , she said the real number of victims was likely to be double that recorded by the Family Support Trust Clinic .
The GCN says 10 girls report rape every day in Zimbabwe and a further 10 victims probably remain silent .
The youngest known victim was a baby of one day ; the oldest was a woman aged 93 .
Makoni told the Guardian : " We have children forced to marry under the age of 13 .
We have children who were held hostage and raped in militia camps during the political violence who are now giving birth to their own children .
We still have children being raped because of the myth that if a man with HIV has sex with a virgin he will be cured of his virus . "
She said men were able to perpetrate the crime with impunity because of 4,000 known rape cases per year , only 500 resulted in a prosecution .
The GCN 's research indicates that on average a man can rape 250 children before his crimes become public knowledge .
" The justice system has collapsed in Zimbabwe .
A syndicate of men uses its economic and political muscle to escape justice .
We also have 10,000 boys going to train as youth militia ; they become vicious and make girls succumb to sex through fear . "
The economic meltdown , political violence and starvation in Zimbabwe over the past decade have driven numerous people abroad , with 3 million fleeing to South Africa alone .
Often they leave their children in the care of extended family or friends and try to send money home .
Many more children have been orphaned by HIV / Aids or other diseases in a country where the average life expectancy has plummeted to 37 for men and 34 for women , among the lowest in the world .
Chipo Mukome , a counsellor at the Family Support Trust Clinic , told the BBC : " Due to the economic situation where we have seen a lot of parents going to neighbouring countries , like South Africa , in search of greener pastures , they are leaving their children to the care of others ‑ uncles and aunts for example .
These people , in the end , are abusing these children . "
Zimbabwe 's fragile unity government has limited capacity to intervene after years of neglect of welfare state structures .
The priority in recent months has been the reopening and maintenance of crumbling schools that were once the envy of Africa .
David Coltart , the education minister , said : " I suspect that a third of households in Zimbabwe have been broken up as a result of the economic chaos .
But the social welfare department has all but collapsed .
There are hardly any social workers left . "
Coltart , a member of prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change , said the child sex abuse statistics were indicative of a wider epidemic .
" In the last few decades we allowed a culture of violence to pervade our society , " he said .
" It 's compounded by the fact that those responsible are generally immune from prosecution .
The breakdown of the rule of law means this culture is all - pervasive .
It is not just intra-political parties .
It spreads to domestic violence and the abuse of children . "
Last month Coltart launched a campaign , Learn Without Fear , aimed at ensuring schools are safe places for children .
It noted that while teachers have been responsible for abusing girls in schools , there has been a developing trend in which girls are abused by senior boys , with some cases going unreported .

Here 's my Spring Controller which , at the moment , receives an email and prints various elements of the message to the log .
The instructions here are very good and I only adapted it slightly for Spring .
Firstly I added the inbound - services section to my appengine - web.xml file .
Next I added a url mapping to my Spring config :
Here is the MailController class : Note that on the Google page it says This does n't appear to be quite true .
If you call getContent ( ) on MimeMessage it returns a ByteArrayInputStream of the raw bytes for the whole message .
According to the documentation here an input stream should only be returned if the content type is unknown .
I think this is a bug .
You can get around this by parsing the content type yourself as I have done in my example .
If message.getContentType( ) returns a string containing " multipart " then I parse it as a multipart message , otherwise I assume it is " text / plain " .
In order to extract a single part of the Multipart content you have to pass through a MimeMultipart object .
It 's here that you can call getCount ( ) and extract the Parts that you want .
In my example I just get the first part .
Calling getContent ( ) on the Part still returns a stream of bytes so you have to convert it with the correct encoding .
You can extract the encoding from the ContentType of the Part .
I added a try .. catch block around the conversion to a string in case the encoding was not recognized - in which case it falls back to the default .
It is vital that you determine whether you have multipart content or not .
If you try to parse a " text / plain " message as a multipart then you may well encounter an error like this :
The readTillFirstBoundary method fails because in a " text / plain " message there are no boundaries !
Note that the development server always sends a multipart message with two parts : text / plain and text / html .
GMail also sends emails in this format but lots of other servers just send text / plain .

Lake sediments contain a record of Arctic temperatures
Arctic temperatures are now higher than at any time in the last 2,000 years , research reveals .
Changes to the Earth 's orbit drove centuries of cooling , but temperatures rose fast in the last 100 years as human greenhouse gas emissions rose .
Scientists took evidence from ice cores , tree rings and lake sediments .
Writing in the journal Science , they say this confirms that the Arctic is very sensitive both to changes in solar heating and to greenhouse warming .
The 23 sites sampled were good enough to provide a decade - by - decade picture of temperatures across the region .
How much energy we 're getting from the Sun is no longer the most important thing governing the temperature of the Arctic
Nicholas McKay , University of Arizona , Tucson
The result is a " hockey stick " - like curve in which the last decade - 1998 - 2008 - stands out as the warmest in the entire series .
" The most pervasive signal in the reconstruction , the most prominent trend , is the overall cooling that took place for the first 1,900 years [ of the record ] , " said study leader Darrell Kaufman from Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff , US .
" The 20th Century stands out in strong contrast to the cooling that should have continued .
The last half - century was the warmest of the 2,000 - year temperature record , and the last 10 years have been especially dramatic , " he told BBC News .
On average , the region cooled at a rate of 0.2C per millennium until about 1900 .
Since then , it has warmed by about 1.2C .
The research shows a long , slow cooling followed by an abrupt warming
Much debate on climate change has centred on the Mediaeval Warm Period , or Mediaeval Climate Anomaly - a period about 1,000 years ago when , historical records suggest , Vikings colonised Greenland and may have grown grapes in Newfoundland .
The new analysis shows that temperatures were indeed warmer in this region 1,000 years ago than they were 100 years ago - but not as warm as they are now , or 1,000 years previously .
" It shows that the Mediaeval Warm Period is real , and is ... an exception from the general trend of cooling , " commented Eystein Jansen from Bergen University in Norway , who was not involved in the research .
" It also shows there 's lots of variability on the 100 - year timescale , and that 's probably more so in the Arctic than elsewhere . "
Professor Jansen was a co-ordinating lead author on the palaeoclimate ( ancient climate ) chapter of the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) assessment .
Arctic wobbles
The root cause of the slow cooling was the orbital " wobble " that slowly varies , over thousands of years , the month in which the Earth approaches closest to the Sun .
Arctic ice shows winter thinning
This wobble slowly decreased the total amount of solar energy arriving in the Arctic region in summertime , and the temperature responded - until greenhouse warming took over .
" The 20th Century is the first century for which how much energy we 're getting from the Sun is no longer the most important thing governing the temperature of the Arctic , " said another of the study team , Nicholas McKay from the University of Arizona .
The recent warming of the Arctic has manifested itself most clearly in the drastic shrinkage in summer sea-ice extent , with the smallest area in the satellite era documented in 2007 .
As the Science study emerged , UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon was telling the World Climate Conference in Geneva that many of the " more distant scenarios " forecast by climate scientists were " happening now " .
Earlier this week , Mr Ban visited the Arctic in an attempt to gain first - hand experience of how the region is changing .
" Scientists have been accused for years of scaremongering .
But the real scaremongers are those who say we cannot afford climate action , " he said in his Geneva speech , calling for world leaders to make bigger pledges of action in the run-up to December 's UN climate summit in Copenhagen .

COP15 prisoners riot in makeshift jail
For the second day in a row , the police have used pepperspray against the inmates in the climate prison in Valby .
Climate activists smashed the cages and used benches to break cell doors open .
The police are sending out daily press-releases with the latest news about the many arrests in connection with the protests against the COP15 summit , but some stories never go further than the police ’s leadership and are left out of the official accounts .
Modkraft has spoken to several climate activists who witnessed the riot .
" The atmosphere was totally crazy .
Several hundred people were shouting and screaming at each other and many tore wooden benches loose inside the cages and began to hit the doors with them " says Mads who was among the people arrested after Sunday ’s ’ Hit the Production ’ demo that took place on Sunday afternoon in Østerbro .
" You could see the fear in their eyes "
257 activists were " preventatively arrested " at Sunday ’s demonstration and were taken to the police ’s main detention facility , commonly known as the climate jail , on Sunday afternoon .
Mads explains that the police used pepperspray several times against him and the others who sat confined in metal cages measuring 2.4 by 5 metres .
His story is is confirmed by two Swedish girls who Modkraft has also talked to .
They say that there was a " chaotic atmosphere " in the prison on Sunday evening where they were also detained in metal cages after the demonstration at Østerbro .
" The police stormed the cages and took everything from us : blankets , water bottles and benches were all removed .
They used a lot of pepperspray and it quickly spread around the room . " , says Elli .
She tells us that a group of inmates managed to smash open the door of one of the cells .
According to Ellie and her friend Marta it was that episode that unleashed the police action on Sunday evening .
" You could see the fear in their eyes .
They were very aggressive , and they threatened to use more pepperspray . " says Marta .
As a reaction to the pepper - spray many inmates tore their bed - sheets in pieces and used them to cover their eyes .
The two girls described the experience as " traumatic " , " humiliating " and " deeply shocking " .
" Many people were panicked and scared .
It was n’t possible to get away . " says Marta .
Police officers with hearing protection
On the internet forum " Anarchist Debate Forum " a demonstrator called Holst who was also detained at Valby describes the events as follows :
" When I was arrested today , the benches that were tied to the walls with strips were pulled off and used as battering rams against the doors .
People made so much noise by chanting and rubbing plastic bottles against the cell bars that the police had go around with hearing protection .
Many of the doors that had been destroyed on Saturday had been replaced with thick wooden boards .
The rights papers and bedding material were ripped into confetti .
" After some time riot police rushed into the cells to remove all of the benches , ( the ones that had not been ripped off the walls were cut off ) sleeping mats , and water bottles .
They used pepper - spray to come into the cells .
" For the remaining hours , people had to sit on the concrete floor and were given water through the bars of the cells like hamsters . "
There were also problems in the climate jail on Saturday evening after the police arrested 968 demonstrators on Amagerbrogade .
DR described the situation with these words :
" Inside the prison some of the detainees have among other things , pulled down walls between their cells .
Many of the benches from the cells have been removed and the remaining prisoners are now sitting on the floor .
During the disturbance , police officers took dogs into the hall but then decided to take them out again .
Police officer bit in the thigh by a police dog
Another detained woman told Modkraft that she sat together with ten others in a cell in Valby .
At one point " people in the cell begun to hang their blankets up so that the cops could n’t see in .
The police reacted by coming in and taking our blankets . "
Later , people began to strike the door to the cell so that it broke open .
After that , the benches were ripped free from the wall and the police came in with their pepperspray out .
They took the two people that had hit on the door , put them in plastic strips and brought them to a new cell where there was n’t anyone else .
The rest of the prisoners in the cell were moved to a new cell .
The episode , which was visible to the rest of the detainees , led to a huge amount of noise that ended with the police bringing dogs into the prison hall .
They brought them around the cells until one of the dogs got so worked up that it bit a police officer in the thigh .
Complaints on the way
Like Mads , the two Swedish girls were released on Sunday evening after several hours in police custody .
They were driven to a nearby S - train station where they were let out .
Neither of them are charged with anything or have received an explanation for why they were arrested in the first place .
All three have decided to complain about their arrest and the treatment they received afterwards .
Not because they want compensation , but because they do n’t want anyone else to go through the same experience .
" I hope that our complaint can help to change the system .
It ca n’t be right that the police can arrest people who have n’t done anything and put them in cages like animals .
It is completely inhuman and borders on torture . " says Elli .
According to the legal support group Rusk that deal with complaints from demonstrators , pepperspray was also used against detainees on Saturday 12 December in connection with similar prisoner unrest in the prison in Valby .
" It is totally reprehensible and gives the impression that the police are unable to handle these situations in a constructive way " , says spokesperson for Rusk , Marc Jørgensen to Modkraft.dk .
Climate Justice Action , the activist network that are arranging many of the big civil disobedience actions in connection with the COP15 summit , are also outraged at the police ’s methods .
" The police ’s behaviour is completely unacceptable .
The police are supposed to use pepperspray instead of shooting , but in this situation it was used against imprisoned demonstrators who could in no way have constituted a threat .
It is time that someone steps in and stops the police ’s insane behaviour " , they write in a press release .
The police however do not think that they have acted irresponsibly .
" What I have been told is that there was a cage with ten inmates where four or five of them became very violent and used wooden benches as battering rams against the cages .
So we decided to use pepperspray against them , but not directly at their eyes " , reports police spokesperson Henrik Suhr to politiken.dk about the episode on Sunday evening .
This is what happened both on Saturday and Sunday where pepperspray was used against the inmates in the so - called ’ climate jail ’ in Valby .
This happened in connection with a prisoner riot that involved several hundred arrested activists .
Modkraft has spoken to several climate activists who witnessed the riot .
" The atmosphere was totally crazy .
Several hundred people were shouting and screaming at each other and many tore wooden benches loose inside the cages and began to hit the doors with them " says Mads who was among the people arrested after Sunday ’s ’ Hit the Production ’ demo that took place on Sunday afternoon in Østerbro .
"
You could see the fear in their eyes " 257 activists were " preventatively arrested " at Sunday ’s demonstration and were taken to the police ’s main detention facility , commonly known as the climate jail , on Sunday afternoon .
Mads explains that the police used pepperspray several times against him and the others who sat confined in metal cages measuring 2.4 by 5 metres .
His story is is confirmed by two Swedish girls who Modkraft has also talked to .
They say that there was a " chaotic atmosphere " in the prison on Sunday evening where they were also detained in metal cages after the demonstration at Østerbro .
"
The police stormed the cages and took everything from us : blankets , water bottles and benches were all removed .
They used a lot of pepperspray and it quickly spread around the room . " , says Elli .
She tells us that a group of inmates managed to smash open the door of one of the cells .
According to Ellie and her friend Marta it was that episode that unleashed the police action on Sunday evening .
" You could see the fear in their eyes .
They were very aggressive , and they threatened to use more pepperspray . " says Marta .
As a reaction to the pepper - spray many inmates tore their bed - sheets in pieces and used them to cover their eyes .
The two girls described the experience as " traumatic " , " humiliating " and " deeply shocking " .
" Many people were panicked and scared .
It was n’t possible to get away . " says Marta .
Police officers with hearing protectionOn the internet forum " Anarchist Debate Forum " a demonstrator called Holst who was also detained at Valby describes the events as follows :
" When I was arrested today , the benches that were tied to the walls with strips were pulled off and used as battering rams against the doors .
People made so much noise by chanting and rubbing plastic bottles against the cell bars that the police had go around with hearing protection .
Many of the doors that had been destroyed on Saturday had been replaced with thick wooden boards .
The rights papers and bedding material were ripped into confetti .
" After some time riot police rushed into the cells to remove all of the benches , ( the ones that had not been ripped off the walls were cut off ) sleeping mats , and water bottles .
They used pepper - spray to come into the cells .
" For the remaining hours , people had to sit on the concrete floor and were given water through the bars of the cells like hamsters .
" There were also problems in the climate jail on Saturday evening after the police arrested 968 demonstrators on Amagerbrogade .
DR described the situation with these words : " Inside the prison some of the detainees have among other things , pulled down walls between their cells .
Many of the benches from the cells have been removed and the remaining prisoners are now sitting on the floor .
During the disturbance , police officers took dogs into the hall but then decided to take them out again .
Police officer bit in the thigh by a police dogAnother detained woman told Modkraft that she sat together with ten others in a cell in Valby .
At one point " people in the cell begun to hang their blankets up so that the cops could n’t see in .
The police reacted by coming in and taking our blankets .
" Later , people began to strike the door to the cell so that it broke open .
After that , the benches were ripped free from the wall and the police came in with their pepperspray out .
They took the two people that had hit on the door , put them in plastic strips and brought them to a new cell where there was n’t anyone else .
The rest of the prisoners in the cell were moved to a new cell .
The episode , which was visible to the rest of the detainees , led to a huge amount of noise that ended with the police bringing dogs into the prison hall .
They brought them around the cells until one of the dogs got so worked up that it bit a police officer in the thigh .
Complaints on the wayLike Mads , the two Swedish girls were released on Sunday evening after several hours in police custody .
They were driven to a nearby S - train station where they were let out .
Neither of them are charged with anything or have received an explanation for why they were arrested in the first place .
All three have decided to complain about their arrest and the treatment they received afterwards .
Not because they want compensation , but because they do n’t want anyone else to go through the same experience .
" I hope that our complaint can help to change the system .
It ca n’t be right that the police can arrest people who have n’t done anything and put them in cages like animals .
It is completely inhuman and borders on torture . " says Elli .
According to the legal support group
Rusk that deal with complaints from demonstrators , pepperspray was also used against detainees on Saturday 12 December in connection with similar prisoner unrest in the prison in Valby .
" It is totally reprehensible and gives the impression that the police are unable to handle these situations in a constructive way " , says spokesperson for Rusk , Marc Jørgensen to Modkraft.dk .
Climate Justice Action , the activist network that are arranging many of the big civil disobedience actions in connection with the COP15 summit , are also outraged at the police ’s methods .
" The police ’s behaviour is completely unacceptable .
The police are supposed to use pepperspray instead of shooting , but in this situation it was used against imprisoned demonstrators who could in no way have constituted a threat .
It is time that someone steps in and stops the police ’s insane behaviour " , they write in a press release .
The police however do not think that they have acted irresponsibly .
" What I have been told is that there was a cage with ten inmates where four or five of them became very violent and used wooden benches as battering rams against the cages .
So we decided to use pepperspray against them , but not directly at their eyes " , reports police spokesperson Henrik Suhr to politiken.dk about the episode on Sunday evening .

The space shuttle Atlantis has successfully docked with the International Space Station , according to Nasa officials .
The shuttle blasted off on Monday with six astronauts on an 11 - day voyage to deliver new equipment to the station .
The docking was manually completed by commander Charlie Hobaugh .
The crew were welcomed by colleague Nicole Stott , who has spent nearly three months on the space station and will return to earth with Atlantis .
The mission is set to include three spacewalks to store hardware on the outside of the orbiting outpost .
These parts include pump modules , gas tanks , two control moment gyroscopes and components for the space station 's robotic arm .
Atlantis is also carrying up to a million microscopic worms as part of an experiment to help scientists understand why human muscles waste away in zero gravity .
The all - male crew of Atlantis will spend the US Thanksgiving holiday in orbit .
They will return to Earth with a seventh crew member , Nicole Stott , who has been living at the space station for nearly three months .
But this will be the last such shuttle crew rotation before the fleet 's retirement in 2010 .
This mission will be the last shuttle mission for 2009 .
BRUSSELS — “ Who do I call if I want to call Europe ? ” U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger could n’t have known three decades ago how long and loudly his plaint about the multiheaded bureaucracy would resonate .
The phrase has been repeated in Brussels to the point of becoming cliche while pro-European Union forces have worked to get to where they are today : ready to install a president of the European Union , along with a high representative for foreign affairs , both tasked with making the EU more visible on the world stage .
Now that the new Lisbon Treaty creating these jobs has been ratified by all 27 member states it will come into force Dec. 1 .
So the race is on to fill the new positions and deliberation is hitting the mainstream , catching up to that which has gone on for years largely behind closed doors .
However , no one ’s quite sure what lies on the other side of the finish line for the “ winner . ”
The Lisbon Treaty officially creates the position of president , to be appointed by the EU ’s heads of state for a two - and - a - half - year term and preside over summits , but there ’s not much of a job description .
Whoever is named as the EU ’s first president will indelibly define the nature of the presidency .
Initially , there was zest for a strong personality , someone who would not only be picking up the receiver on Kissinger ’s desired hotline , but would get his or her own calls answered by other world leaders .
There are few European leaders who are recognizable on other continents ; Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy are not on the job market .
Campaigns are primarily being conducted through surrogates — no one owns up to “ running . ”
But as long as several years ago , and as few as 10 days ago , the person considered to have the best odds was former British Prime Minister Tony Blair .
Since leaving office two years ago , Blair has kept his profile high as the Quartet ’s special envoy for the Middle East , he has experience as a head of state and he ’s pro-Europe in a sea of U.K. skepticism .
Despite widespread disapproval for Blair ’s support for the U.S. - led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , numerous press articles speculated he could be appointed immediately upon the treaty ’s full ratification .
But at the head - of - state summit last week in Brussels , parties on the European left — of which former Labour leader Blair is a member — decided they would prefer to have the position of high representative , effectively ruling out fielding a candidate for the president position as well .
( This is part of the very complicated political game of divvying up the top institutional jobs in a grand agreement .
The European Commission presidency and European Parliament presidency are both currently held by center - right politicians , so the other major parties , Socialists and Liberals , are looking to exert their influence over the new president and high - representative posts . )
Despite U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Foreign Secretary David Miliband — who is now the likely pick for high representative — spending much of their time in Brussels talking up Blair ’s character and capabilities , his hopes basically died there , aided by the conspicuous failure of Sarkozy , who had wobbled in his support , to wholeheartedly try to resuscitate the candidacy .
Anne -Claire Marangoni , an expert in European affairs and diplomacy at the College of Europe , thinks that ’s for the best .
Blair ’s citizenship alone should have ruled him out , she said , saying the same should apply to Miliband .
“ The Lisbon Treaty is about enhancing the EU 's international stance and Britain has clearly not been the member state which most favored political integration in the field of foreign , security and defense policy , ” Marangoni said .
Referring to the strong opposition to Blair — see the petition project at www.stopblair.eu, for example — Marangoni said such an appointment would put the brakes on the European project again .
With the early and most glamorous frontrunner deposed , it looks like EU heads of state have decided they ca n’t risk a high - stature “ face of Europe ” who might steal away some of their personal influence .
“ They want political comfort , not political clout , ” concluded Giles Merritt , secretary general of Brussels - based think tank Friends of Europe , who believes a strong , well - known president would have been in the EU ’s best interests .
The list of possible candidates is now filled with politicians most people even in Europe would be hard - pressed to identify : the highly competent and well - regarded but rather bland Luxembourg Prime and Finance Minister Jean - Claude Juncker ; Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende , said to be campaigning heavily for the job ; and — the flavor of this week — Belgian Prime Minister Herman van Rompuy , praised for his ability to manage the sometimes bitter divisions between Belgium ’s linguistic minorities of Dutch , French and German .
“ It ’s the march of the pygmies , really , ” lamented Merritt .
Pascale Joannin , director general of the Robert Schumann Foundation in Paris , has a different problem with the probable candidates — their gender .
She suggested that the EU could increase citizen engagement if it better represented half of its population “ If you want to have representative institutions , you ca n’t have just men at the top of the four institutions ” ( of the commission , parliament , president and high representative ) , she said .
Joannin sees the new posts as the perfect opportunity to address this imbalance .
On Thursday she started a campaign supporting former Latvian President Vaira Vike - Freiberga as the EU ’s new face .
Bringing together an informal coalition of think tanks , women ’s groups and NGOs , Joannin founded “ A Woman to Head Europe ” and saw close to 3,000 people “ vote ” for Vike - Freiberga in the first 24 hours .
Joannin admitted time is short between the launch of her campaign and a special summit on the posts likely to be called for next week , but she thinks such a strong show of support can have an impact on the leaders ’ calculations .
The website has ready - made letters to send to each of the 27 member - state governments to make sure they get the message .
But before the EU leaders decide “ who , ” they have to agree on “ what ” they want their new president to be .

By my third year of Japanese study , my classmates and I had gotten to the point where we could express a lot of basic ideas , but for whatever reason – probably class chemistry more than anything – we were all really quiet .
Everyone was hesitant to take a chance and speak up .
So the professor implemented a participation grade , probably one of the cleverest techniques any of my Japanese teachers ever used .
This same teacher also emphasized storytelling ( through 接続詞 ) , relaying information ( 〜そうです ) , and skimming ( 速読 ) .
It was a landmark year in my study of the language .
Really gave me a solid foundation .
I think the skimming exercises were especially effective .
Someone ( one of the higher up professors ? ) had done research showing that skimming was just as valuable if not more valuable than slogging through passages looking up the definition for every word .
Several times a week , she would hand us a slip of paper with a Japanese newspaper article on it .
First she gave us five seconds or so to look at the headline and we would take a minute to talk about the topic of the article .
We made guesses about the content , and the professor asked us to explain why .
Then she gave us 30 seconds to look at the first few paragraphs of the article .
We would kind of desperately run our eyes over the squiggles , looking for X月XX日 , X氏 , and other hints .
The she asked us machine - gun style the who what where when of the article .
And that was it .
We never went into much more depth than that .
The exercise was predicated on the idea that short , fast repetitions are important to get your reading up to speed .
However , skimming is really only effective once you have a basic grasp of kanji and compounds .
We must have known 750 kanji at least , maybe even closer to 1000 , but knowing how the kanji work in compounds was even more important .
This same teacher drilled us on the different categories of compounds .
I think there were five categories .
Here ’s a brief rundown of the ones I can remember :
Synonyms and Antonyms – compounds in this category are two kanji with similar meaning or opposite meaning lined up together .
早速 ( さっそく ) – fast + fast = right away !
重複 ( ちょうふく ) – overlap + multiple = redundant ( unsure if this is n’t in the Verb + DO category which is outlined below )
姉妹 ( しまい ) – older sister + younger sister = sister
兄弟 ( きょうだい ) – older brother + younger brother = brother
変化 ( へんか ) – change + change = change
上下 ( じょうげ ) – up + down = up and down
左右 ( さゆう ) – left + right = left and right
和英 ( わえい ) – Japanese + English = Japanese to English
英和 ( えいわ ) – English + Japanese = English to Japanese
売買 ( ばいばい ) – sell + buy = buying and selling
攻防 ( こうぼう ) – attack + defense = attack and defense
Prefix +
Kanji – the kanji in these compounds all have prefixes that modify the other character .
非 , 無 , and 不 are the obvious negatives ones .
There must be some positive ones …超 comes to mind , but I ca n’t think of any two - character compounds .
無職 ( むしょく ) – no + work = unemployed
無色 ( むしょく ) – no + color = colorless
無教 ( むきょう ) – no + faith = atheist
不良 ( ふりょう ) – un + good = bad
非常 ( ひじょう ) – non + normal = abnormal / unusual / emergency
超能力 ( ちょうのうりょく ) – extremely + ability = superpower / ESP
Adjective +
Noun – in this category , the first kanji modifies the second kanji , forming a larger compound noun .
朗報 ( ろうほう ) – cheerful + information = good news
朝食 ( ちょうしょく ) – morning + food = breakfast
残金 ( ざんきん ) – remain + money = balance / remaining money
近所 ( きんじょ ) – near + place = neighborhood
笑顔 ( えがお ) – smile + face = smiling face
Adverb +
Verb – in this category , too , the first character modifies the second , but this time it modifies the way the verb is performed .
速読 ( そくどく ) – fast + read = read quickly / skim
朗読 ( ろうどく ) – clear / cheerful + read = read out loud
悪化 ( あっか ) – bad + change = get worse
強化 ( きょうか ) – strong + change = make stronger / fortify / enhance / reinforce
Verb +
Direct Object – these kanji are Chinese in origin , I think , so they come in the Chinese grammatical order , the second kanji being the direct object of the first , which is a verb .
上京 ( じょうきょう ) – go up + capital = go to the capital
帰国 ( きこく ) – return + country = return home / repatriate
送金 ( そうきん ) – send + money = send money
回想 ( かいそう ) – spin + thought = recall / flashback
消火 ( しょうか ) – erase + fire = extinguish
返品 ( へんぴん ) – give back + item = return something
Not every compound will fit into these categories , but thinking about kanji this way will often give you an advantage when you encounter a new compound made of familiar parts .
So go on !
Go out there and get reps !
Skimming is all well and good , but the goal is to build up endurance and recognition so that you can tackle longer material .
The US currently has some 68,000 troops in Afghanistan The US ambassador in Kabul has written to the White House to oppose sending thousands more troops to Afghanistan .
In a leaked cable , Karl Eikenberry said President Karzai 's government should first prove it would tackle corruption .
The message arrived amid intense debate over strategy , with President Obama yet to make a decision on troop numbers .
The dramatic intervention puts the ambassador - a former military commander in Afghanistan - at odds with generals seeking reinforcements .
On Wednesday , President Obama held his eighth meeting to discuss the question of whether to send tens of thousands more troops to confront the Taliban .
EIKENBERRY 'S CV Top US military commander in Afghanistan for two years Deputy chair of Nato 's military committee at Brussels in 2007 Quit army commission to be US ambassador in Kabul this year Front line US official dealing with Afghan President Hamid Karzai
US opinion on Afghan strategy In pictures : Obama team divided Your advice to President Obama Mr Eikenberry sent the secret cable in the past week , according to US media reports .
Expressing concern about corruption in Afghanistan , he said it was " not a good idea " to send substantially more soldiers , the BBC has been told .
The diplomatic dispatch appears to be a dramatic and last - minute intervention by the ambassador , says BBC Washington correspondent Adam Brookes .
It comes right at the end of weeks of White House deliberation over how to proceed in Afghanistan , and appears to put the ambassador at odds with the US Army , whose generals favour reinforcing and intensifying America 's campaign .
The US currently has some 68,000 troops in Afghanistan , among a coalition force of more than 100,000 .
Military chief ' fuming '
Officials say the Obama administration considered several options at Wednesday 's meeting , including : MARDELL'S AMERICA
Is it a bluff or could the president really send far fewer troops than expected ?
Sensible caution or more dithering ?
Mark Mardell
BBC News , North America editor
Read Mark Mardell 's thoughts in full • Deploying another 40,000 troops , the option pushed for by the top US military commander in Afghanistan , Gen Stanley McChrystal • Sending an additional 30,000 soldiers - a plan said to be favoured by Defence Secretary Robert Gates and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , Adm Mike Mullen • Sending about 20,000 extra troops •
A fourth option added in the past week involves sending 10,000 to 15,000 more soldiers , according to US media reports
In weighing up the options , Mr Obama is also preoccupied with how long it would take to see results and be able to withdraw , officials said .
Gen McChrystal was said to be fuming about Mr Eikenberry 's intervention .

But a statement issued by the White House after Wednesday afternoon 's strategy meeting appeared to reflect some of the envoy 's concerns .
" The president believes we need to make clear to the Afghan government that our commitment is not open ended , " it said .
" After years of substantial investments by the American people , governance in Afghanistan must improve in a reasonable period of time . "
Kabul hits back
The Obama administration is also known to have concerns about the reliability of the government of President Karzai , who was last week declared winner of August 's widely criticised presidential election .
Speaking on a visit to the Philippines , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the Obama administration had raised the issues of corruption and poor governance with President Karzai .
" I think the corruption issue really goes to the heart of whether the people of Afghanistan feel that the government is on their side , is working for them , " she told reporters .
A spokesman for President Karzai insisted the Afghan administration was " serious " about tackling corruption .
The BBC's Martin Patience in Kabul says many Afghans are lukewarm about the prospect of extra troops and want to know what they would actually do .
They believe security has worsened as more troops have been sent to the country .
Afghan officials insist the training of local security forces needs to be the priority - so that their troops can lead the fight against the insurgents .
Western military advisers are sceptical that this can be achieved soon , our correspondent says .

Record - high gasoline prices , the slowdown in the economy , and increasing environmental sensitivity are leading more people to bike to work or for play .
But an adequate infrastructure may not be in place to protect cyclists from serious injury according to surgeons who presented a new study on the issue during a scientific paper session at the 2009 Clinical Congress of the American College of Surgeons .
The researchers found that the severity of injury and hospital length - of - stay for bicycle injuries at one trauma center has increased significantly over the past 11 years .
Despite the wide - spread attention paid to the importance of wearing helmets , helmet use did not change during the time period of the study , and more than 33 percent of 329 bicycle injury victims had a significant head injury .
Even more alarming , the number of chest injuries increased by 15 percent and abdominal injuries rose three - fold over the last five years .
“ We were astounded by that data , ” said Jeffry Kashuk , MD , FACS , associate professor of surgery at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and senior attending surgeon at the Rocky Mountain Regional Trauma Center at Denver Health Medical Center , Denver .
“ We ’re talking about injured spleens and livers , internal bleeding , rib fractures , and hemothorax [ blood in the chest ] .
Those kinds of injuries are reflected by an increase in injury severity score , ” he added .
The study was conducted in Denver , which has one of the most well - developed bicycle path networks in the country .
“ Denver is very much a bicycle community .
If we are seeing an increase in injuries in a metropolitan area that has fairly mature bike infrastructure from the standpoint of bike pathways , there ’s reason for concern about what ’s happening in metropolitan areas that do n’t have that level of maturity .
There seems to be a significant increase nationally in the use of the bicycle for urban transportation .
If our data is a microcosm of what is going on nationally , we may be on the cusp of an injury epidemic , ” Dr. Kashuk said .
Researchers at the University of Colorado hope to obtain funding so they can expand the study nationally and generate data that will support better safety standards and raise community awareness about the lack of cycling infrastructure .
“ On a local and national level , people need to be aware of the fact that a push for bike transportation for the sake of health , the environment , and lower transportation costs has real potential to raise medical costs because our infrastructure may not be ready for it , ” Dr. Kashuk said .
“ Look at all the safety factors that have been incor-porated in automobiles and streets and highways .
If even a percentage of that kind of investment went into safety vis-a - vis bike paths and community infrastructure , we would protect people from major injury . ”

The Senate health reform bill moved one step closer to becoming law Friday when Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - NE ) announced he would vote yes in a crucial test vote of the bill scheduled for Saturday .
The move represents a surprising turnaround for Nelson , who as recently as Thursday threatened to join the Republican filibuster of the bill if restrictions of government funding of abortion are n’t tightened .
ADVERTISEMENT
Nelson was among three Democratic holdouts in the US Senate who have not declared which way they will vote on a motion to bring the health reform bill to debate on the Senate floor .
With all 40 Republican senators committed to voting against it , Democrats need the support of all 48 Democratic senators and two independents to overcome a Republican filibuster and bring the bill forward .
The two remaining uncommitted Democrats are Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas .
But Nelson ’s announcement Friday will likely put pressure on the holdouts to commit at least to a floor debate , if not to vote in favor of the bill at the end .
In his announcement , Nelson argued that even though there are parts of the bill he does n’t like , he is opposed to legislative obstructionism and therefore wants to see a debate on the bill .
“ Throughout my Senate career I have consistently rejected efforts to obstruct , ” he said in a statement .
“ That ’s what the vote on the motion to proceed is all about .
It is not for or against the new Senate health care bill released Wednesday .
It is only to begin debate and an opportunity to make improvements .
If you do n’t like a bill why block your own opportunity to amend it ? ”
Nelson did n’t state whether his concerns about abortion in the health bill were addressed .
ADVERTISEMENT
However , even with Nelson ’s vote , moving the bill forward is by no means certain .
Sen .
Joe Lieberman , whose support is needed , has come out strongly against the public option included in the Senate bill .
Lieberman has accused Democrats of pulling a “ bait and switch ” by adding the public option even though , he claims , they did n’t mention one during the 2008 electoral campaign .
But , as Politico notes , a public health care option of some kind was part of both Barack Obama ’s and the Democratic Party ’s platform last year .
Controversy has also erupted around Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ’s declaration that he would not use the reconciliation process to pass health care reform .
If Democrats ca n’t get the 60 Senate votes needed to pass the bill , they have the option of passing a watered - down bill and using the process of reconciling that bill with the already - passed House health bill to reinstate the public option .
Reconciliation requires only 50 votes for passage .
ADVERTISEMENT
One unidentified “ progressive activist ” told Art Levine of Truthout that “ it ’s important for Democrats to keep reconciliation alive so we can tell conservative Democrats , ‘ We do n’t need to use you all . ” ’
But others argue the reconciliation option is growing less relevant as Democrats come closer to the 60 - vote mark .

“ We ’re not hearing a lot of talk about [ reconciliation ] lately , ” one source told Truthout .
“ My senator is confident that his colleagues do n’t want to be on the wrong side of history over a procedural vote . ”

February 2nd : New site layout !
Valentine 's Day update !
The Earth ’s face is a pock - marked , scarified thing , riddled with enormous holes dug by human hands or caused by the caprices of nature .
Deep ‘ blue hole ’ lagoons accrete within coral reefs , volcanoes tear the earth apart leaving enormous smoking craters , weak undergound sewage lines can lead to sudden sink - holes in the middle of cities , open - pit mines strip the hearts out of mountains , nuclear weapons tests blast whole islands out of existence .
Here are 7 awe - inspiring examples of such enormous holes .
Craters , mines , lagoons , sink - holes .
1. The El Sod Crater , Ethiopia
‘ El Sod is a former volcano with only a crater lake remaining now .
It takes 45 minutes to reach by going down , to see the Boranas tribe working in the green waters to put out some black mud which contains some salt .
The men work totally nude , even if they are muslim .
The salt will be given both to animals and people .
To climb up the crater , it takes more than one hour under a very hot sun …
So once the men have finished to fill up bags of 25 kg , they put 2 on donkeys and come back to village .
They can do this 2 or 3 times a day .
The salt attacks the skin , the eyes , and the whole body as they have to dive to take the mud .
It ’s an incredible place to see in the 21th century . ’

2. Barringer Meteor Crater , Arizona
Meteor Crater is a meteorite impact crater located in the northern Arizona desert of the United States .
The site was originally known as the Canyon Diablo Crater , but scientists now generally refer to it as Barringer Crater in honor of Daniel Barringer who was first to suggest that it was produced by a meteorite impact , about 50,000 years ago .
At that time the local climate on the Colorado Plateau was much cooler and damper , an open grassland dotted with woodlands inhabited by woolly mammoths , giant ground sloths , and camels .
It was probably not inhabited by humans ; the earliest confirmed record of human habitation in the Americas dates from long after this impact .
1.2 km wide , 170 meters deep , with a rim 45 meters high .
The owners of the Crater proclaim it to be the first proven , best - preserved meteorite crater on earth .
Excavated by a nickel - iron meteorite about 50 meters across .
3. Mirny Diamond Mine , Siberia
Mirny Mine is the second largest excavated hole in the world , after Bingham Canyon Mine .
I ’d include Bingham Canyon here but it ’s not as astonishing as Mirny , since it ’s dug into a mountain range - it could almost be mistaken for a natural valley .
With Mirny there ’s no chance of that , abutting so closely to a large industrial town .
The mine was discovered in 1955 and developed from 1967 , in part by De Beers .
Hard - freezing of the ground 7 months of the year complicated mining , but they got around it by using no water in the refinement process ( because the water would freeze ) .
Mirny is 525 meters deep and 1.2 km across .
The airspace above the mine is closed for helicopters because of a few incidents in which they were sucked in by the downward air flow .
Currently 3,600 workers are digging tunnels to capture rogue diamonds .
The mine closed proper in 2001 .
4. Belize ’s Great Blue Hole
The Great Blue Hole is a large underwater sinkhole off the coast of Belize .
The hole is circular in shape , and was formed as part of a limestone cave system during the last glacial period when sea levels were much lower .
As the ocean began to rise again , the caves flooded , and the roof collapsed .
It is believed to be the world ’s largest feature of its kind .
Over 300 metres across and 125 metres deep .
Named one of the world ’s top ten scuba diving locations .
Gorgeous , ginormous .

The US tested atmospheric nuclear weapons on the remote Pacific Marshall islands for years , with the largest conducted in 1954 , code - named Castle Bravo .
It had a 15 megaton blast yield and tore the island of Elugelab from the face of the Earth .
Marshall Islanders watch the blast .

What was land , now sea .
6. Phalaborwa Copper Mine , South Africa
Another vast mine , South Africa ’s leading copper producer , with a capacity of 30,000 tonnes per day
Palabora produces about 80,000 tonnes of refined copper per year .
400 employees work on site .
Mining began in 1964 .
7. Guatemalan Sinkhole
In February 2007 a giant sinkhole opened up in a poor district of Guatemala City , sucking in 10 houses and killing 2 people .
According to Guatemala
City officials the hole was caused by leaking sewer pipes , which eroded the earth .
Residents said a terrible stench exuded from the hole , along with bizarre churning sounds and a foul vapor .
More than 100 meters deep .
Sheer walls .
Do you know of any other awesome deep holes ?

The situation in Iran has reached the point of no return .
The opposition has been calling for weeks for the downfall of the Islamic Republic and the removal from power of the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
His own supporters have demanded the " harshest possible punishment for the instigators of unrest " .
Judging by the video footage and photos distributed via the internet , despite the brutal clampdown of the last six months the opposition does not appear frightened .
The demonstrators are directly confronting the police and security forces .
Many police officers have been injured in the clashes of the last two days together with scores of opposition injuries and eight deaths on Sunday – Ashura – a day on which in Islamic tradition no blood is to be spilled .
Some of the pictures of those killed on Sunday are as gruesome as last summer 's images of Neda Agha Soltan .
Different layers of the opposition , the reformist Islamists as well as the more modern , possibly secular young activists and academics – and artists , musicians and journalists – have been enraged over the past few weeks .
Students – always at the forefront of democratisation movements in Iran – were not allowed to mark their national day on 16 Azar ( 7 December ) ; high - ranking reformist ayatollahs in Qom and Isfahan were not allowed to mourn the death of the highly respected Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri .
Several ayatollahs and leading opposition figures who have spoken out in defence of human rights , the right to demonstrations , and for a free media , have been threatened with losing their positions , and accused of " collaboration with western conspiracy " .
Hundreds of high - ranking opposition figures were arrested on Sunday and Monday , and many who are in detention received long prison sentences .
However , despite their unprecedented techniques of distributing information and mobilising support , the opposition still lacks a clear statement as to where it is going and what it would do were it to topple the regime .
It also lacks a leader accepted by all .
Activists argue that if they did have such clarity the entire machinery of the state would ensure their leadership was obliterated .
And it is true that the military arm of the regime is killing and arresting at random .
It is also true that Khamenei no longer has any of his seasoned advisers – such as former presidents Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami , or the former speaker of the parliament Mehdi Karoubi .
He sidelined them all when supporting Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for the presidential elections .
Over the past six months the supreme leader has also lost crucial links with the reformist ayatollahs and clergy in the holy cities of Qom , Isfahan and Mashhad .
The leader is now surrounded by the hardline clergy , right of centre politicians , Revolutionary Guards and Basij militia , who are calling for direct confrontation .
This can only lead to further bloodshed .
The opposition is now calling for more strikes and attacks at important centres of power such as the state TV , where clashes took place yesterday .
And February sees the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Republic .
There is talk of a military coup by the Revolutionary Guards if the situation does not settle down .
Iran is facing a long period of political instability ; and with increasing tensions in neighbouring Pakistan , plus the volatile situation in Afghanistan and Iraq , regional security appears more precarious than any time in the recent past .

Although the Earth Observatory typically reserves “ Image of the Day ” space for publishing data and images acquired by Earth - observing satellites , we are sometimes so enthralled by the spectacular images acquired by spacecraft observing other parts of the solar system that we want to share these ' otherworldy ' views with our visitors .
And if you are looking for remotely sensed images of the Earth , this view is the most remotely sensed image we have ever published !
This beautiful image of Saturn and its rings looks more like an artist ’s creation than a real image , but in fact , the image is a composite ( layered image ) made from 165 images taken by the wide - angle camera on the Cassini spacecraft over nearly three hours on September 15 , 2006 .
Scientists created the color in the image by digitally compositing ultraviolet , infrared , and clear - filter images and then adjusting the final image to resemble natural color .
( A clear filter is one that allows in all the wavelengths of light the sensor is capable of detecting . )
The bottom image is a closeup view of the upper left quadrant of the rings , through which Earth is visible in the far , far distance .
On this day , Saturn interceded between the Sun and Cassini , shielding Cassini from the Sun ’s glare .
As the spacecraft lingered in Saturn ’s shadow , it viewed the planet ’s rings as never before , revealing previously unknown faint rings and even glimpsing its home world .
Seen from more than a billion kilometers ( almost a billion miles ) away , through the ice and dust particles of Saturn ’s rings , Earth appears as a tiny , bright dot to the left and slightly behind Saturn .
Although it might appear that Earth is located within Saturn ’s outermost rings , that positioning is just an illusion created by the enormous distance between Cassini and Earth .
When Cassini took this image , the spacecraft was looking back at Saturn from a distance of about 2.2. million kilometers ( about 1.3 million miles ) .
The Sun was millions of additional miles beyond , hidden behind Saturn .
On September 15 , Earth ’s orbit had brought our home planet to a location slightly behind and to the left of the Sun from Cassini ’s perspective .
The Website of the Cassini Imaging Central Laboratory for Operations ( CICLOPS ) provides more detailed information about this image .
The Cassini -Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency , and the Italian Space Agency .

PlayStation Home , a virtual community for PS3 owners has been a huge success since its launch .
Despite reports stating otherwise , it is still a high priority for the folks at Sony .
Recent reports from Edge Magazine however have painted a different picture .
Speaking at the London Games Conference , Sony ’s director of PlayStation Home Pete Edwards had this to say about the service
“ It ’s been a long road .
We ’ve proved there is a market out there and we ’ve got a lot of people that spend a lot of time in [ Home ] .
It ’s not a priority right now but there is a business model there . ”
Sony has now come back and said that Edwards was misquoted .
“ Edwards was saying that monetizing Home was not as big a priority as building a great platform , with a compelling environment and a strong community .
Home is still a top priority for Sony and will continue to release quality content and provide a positive experience to our users , ”
While Home might not be for everyone , Sony has done a great job with supporting it and its getting better everyday .
As always , stay connected to PlayStation LifeStyle for all your PS3 news .

Channel 4 is giving both True Blood and Generation Kill their first airings on terrestrial television on Wednesday , one straight after the other .
It ’s an odd juxtaposition , because apart from the fact that they are both made by the American cable company HBO , they could scarcely be more different – True Blood , a tale of vampires coming out of the closet in the Deep South , is a fantastical , at times hilarious chunk of modern gothic ; Generation Kill , based on real events and people , is a painstakingly realistic seven - part depiction of life for an elite detachment of US Marines in the first phase of the Iraq War .
Optimizing for the Intel Atom CPU , part 2
There was a lot more feedback than I expected on the Atom post ( http://virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=286), so time for part 2 .
First , some more explanation .
This routine is one of the scan line renderers in Altirra , so it does indeed execute frequently -- 240 * 60 = 14,400 times per second at peak .
At ~2000 cycles per iteration , that 's just under 30 million cycles , which is about 1.9 % of 1.6GHz .
If you think this is n't much , you 're right -- except that we 're talking about a CPU designed for low - power netbook use .
If it were just a question of attaining target performance this would n't be an issue at all , because Altirra already runs at full speed on the machine in question .
However , when it comes to optimizing for netbooks , or even just laptops , power consumption and heat production come into play .
In other words , I hate it when my laptop becomes hot and loud , and I want programs to use less CPU even if there 's more available .
Reducing CPU usage further allows the CPU to drop to lower performance states more often , and 30 million cycles is more of a deal when the CPU is running at 400MHz instead of 1.6GHz .
Also , as I noted , this function was # 2 on the sampling profile , so if I needed to reduce CPU usage lower , this function would absolutely be on the optimization list .
The second thing I should point out is that I have n't actually committed to doing any Atom optimization for either Altirra or VirtualDub .
Part of the reason I stumbled upon this was that I was just curious as to what was taking up the CPU time , and launching a sampling profile is really easy .
The fact that the optimization is so annoying and most likely requires dropping to assembly is enough to give me pause , and I do n't have a lot of motivation other than curiosity , since I can always use more powerful machines when I need to .
This is n't to say , though , that it 's not worth optimization applications in general for Atom .
John pointed out in the previous post that Adobe should optimize Flash for Atom , and I would be very surprised if they were n't already heavily looking at this .
Inner rendering loops in Mozilla Firefox would be another good target , as web browsing in general is one of the main uses for netbooks .
( Do n't ask me to do this , though -- I already have enough projects as it is ! )
Now , back to our little guinea pig routine .
I mentioned some stats last time for cycle counts , but I did n't actually include the profiles .
Here are the top ten functions within Altirra.exe , with Atom first and then the Core 2 , according to CodeAnalyst :
( I definitely need to run the ClearType Tuner on the netbook . )
I was expecting to find some gem in one of VirtualDub 's conversion blitter routines , since both Altirra and VirtualDub share the same blitter code for display purposes and Altirra is a much easier to set up stress case .
Unfortunately , I had forgotten that I had added 8 - bit paletted hardware conversion support to the Direct3D9 display path a while back , so all that happens is that the image gets memcpy ( ) 'd up into a managed texture .
Whoops .
Well , in any case , the difference in the profiles is interesting .
The reason that this caught my attention is that RenderLores ( ) , which corresponds to this routine , jumped up a lot higher in the profile even though it 's much more streamlined than the rest of the code , which tends to be erratic .
The ANTIC core , for instance is structured as a Giant Switch Statement ( tm ) .
Therefore , it surprised me that a routine which had only a relatively simple loop fared relatively worse .
Now that I think about it , though , it could also be more that the Atom fares better on branchy code .
As for actually optimizing the routine :
for ( int i=0 ; i< w4 ; ++i ) {
dst [ 0 ] = dst [ 1 ] = colorTable[priTable[src [ 0 ] ] ] ;
dst [ 2 ] = dst [ 3 ] = colorTable[ priTable[src [ 1 ] ] ] ;
dst [ 4 ] = dst [ 5 ] = colorTable[ priTable[src [ 2 ] ] ] ;
dst [ 6 ] = dst [ 7 ] = colorTable[priTable[src [ 3 ] ] ] ;
src += 4 ;
dst += 8 ;
}
I 'm surprised that no one mentioned the possibility of pre-doubling the pixels in the color table , since scaled indexing is generally free on x86 , i.e. [ eax +ebx ] is the same cost as [ eax + ebx * 2 ] .
The downsides to this are the introduction of 16 - bit opcodes in the instruction mix , which can sometimes be problematic due to instruction prefixes , and the increased cost of updating the color table .
Doing so increases the best case time from 1644 clocks to 1536 clocks .
Stuart noted that the compiler is likely to be constrained due to aliasing concerns .
That 's a valid point , especially since all tables here are the same type -- uint8 * , to be exact -- and therefore changes to * dst could hit the lookup tables .
The full routine actually already has __restrict on all of the pointers to try to avoid this problem , but to be honest , I 've never seen a case where it made any difference in VC ++'s code generation .
Several people suggested hoisting into local variables to try to better control the fetch order :
uint8 s0 = src [ 0 ] ;
uint8 s1 = src [ 1 ] ;
uint8 p0 = priTable[s0 ] ;
uint8 p1 = priTable [s1 ] ;
uint8 c0 = colorTable [ p0 ] ;
uint8 c1 = colorTable [ p1 ] ;
However , it does n't work .
While VC ++ is n't smart enough to take the hint that dst [ ] can't alias against the source tables , it does realize that reads without an intervening write can be reordered , and it does so -- thus deinterleaving the reads back apart again .
Doh .
Ordinarily this is a good idea as it allows the compiler much more freedom to rearrange calculations , but in this case it simply lets the compiler do exactly what we do n't want it to do .
Thus , we have the problem of a compiler that is not designed for the architecture we are targeting and is a little too smart for its own good .
We 're not really supposed to be mucking with the instruction scheduling because , well , that 's the compiler 's job .
In another valiant attempt to avoid assembly , Frank suggested doing some manual write combining :
uint32 c0 = colorTable [ p0 ] ;
uint32 c1 = colorTable [ p1 ] ; *( uint32 *) &dst [ 0 ] = ( c1 << 24 ) | ( c1 << 16 ) | ( c0 << 8 ) | c0 ;
A good try , but the disassembly once again shows sadness :
0000003C : 8B DE mov ebx , esi
0000003E : C1 E3 08 shl ebx ,
8
00000041 : 0B DE or ebx , esi
00000043 : C1 E3 08 shl ebx ,
8
00000046 : 0B DA or ebx , edx
00000048 : C1 E3 08 shl ebx ,
8
0000004B : 0B DA or ebx , edx
Bitten again by another compiler optimization .
Visual C++ recognizes strings of shifts and logical ORs and can rearrange them , which sometimes leads to powerful optimizations with bit flags .
In this case , however , it ends up stringing everything into one long dependency chain on the EBX register at one instruction / clock .
Do n't try to use intermediate variables to rearrange the order -- the compiler will detect sequence of logical ORs and just linearize it again .
Replacing the logical ORs with additions gives an even more interesting result :
*( uint32 *) &dst [ 0 ] = ( c1 << 24 ) + ( c1 << 16 ) + ( c0 << 8 ) + c0 ;
00000039 : C1 E3 10 shl ebx ,10h
0000003C : 03 DD add ebx , ebp
0000003E : 69 DB 01 01 00 00 imul ebx , ebx,101h
Addition opens up a few more optimization opportunities for a few reasons .
One , it 's sometimes available on a few more execution ports -- I think one of the Pentium 4 versions could do logical OR on only one of the fast ALUs .
Two , addition allows address generation logic to be leveraged , i.e. lea eax , [ ebx+ecx ] .
And three , it allows multiplication tricks like this .
Unfortunately , while this is a neat idea on a modern CPU , the Atom 's 32 - bit integer multiply has two - cycle throughput and five cycle latency , which makes this not so hot .
Kumar suggested folding together the priority and color tables into a single table .
This is indeed possible , and it merges the two into a single 256 byte table , neatly removing an entire layer of dependent lookups .
While a good optimization , it does have a major tradeoff , which is that it makes updating the tables more expensive because now up to 256 entries have to be updated on a color change .
As it turns out , in this case while the priority table changes very rarely , the color table can change a lot more frequently , sometimes several times per scan line .
This reduces the rendering span length well below the size of the lookup table , which could easily cause rebuilding the lookup table to dominate execution time .
There are also frequently cases where it does n't , however , in which case the level of optimization is raised to adaptive switching between two algorithms depending on the rate of dynamic updates .
This is a bit more than a quick hack on a low - level routine , but it's an interesting and potentially lucrative idea nevertheless .
Several people mentioned the PSHUFB instruction .
This instruction is a 128 - bit vector instruction that does a byte permute , looking up each byte in another vector and effectively giving you 16 byte lookups into a 16 entry table .
Nice trick , and potentially lucrative .
The problem in this case is that both tables are too big for a single PSHUFB lookup .
The color table can be done via two PSHUFB lookups and a merge , but the 256 byte priority table definitely wo n't fit .
This is a problem because byte gathering in vector registers on x86 is painful in general and there 's no good way to do it other than by essentially going through memory , which then leads us back to having to do a lot of itty bitty byte stores to construct each vector .
Honestly , I can't see this winning unless the priority table can be efficiently replaced by a small number of logic functions .
( The priority table derives from combinatorial logic in the GTIA , but it'd have to be something less than the several dozen gates that it takes on the real chip . )
I have n't tried this myself , since , well , it 's a bit more than a quick hack to test it .
John compared the optimization rules to RPG rules .
I think it feels more like drawing a card from the deck in a board game : " You just read EAX after writing AL and AH .
Go back three spaces and lose turn . "
Finally , " A Coder " expressed some concern ( horror ? ) over the implications of going to assembly to this .
Well , the best I can say is : you identify a nice hotspot routine for assembly optimization , you test it against the original routine , you keep the old routine around for reference and porting purposes , and then you bury it under some nice , clean interface and forget it . :)

UNIVERSITY undergraduates will be able to claim educational expenses as a tax deduction after a former student had a landmark win against the Tax Office in the Federal Court yesterday .
Symone Anstis , a former Australian Catholic University student , was successful in her bid to claim $ 920 as self - education expenses after fighting the Australian Tax Office through a number of jurisdictions over the past three years .
Symone Anstis ... landmark case
While studying as a primary teacher full - time , Ms Anstis worked as a part - time sales assistant for retail chain Katies , where she earned $ 14,946 .
She also received a Youth Allowance of $ 3622 during the 2006 income year .
In a bold move she claimed education expenses including travel costs , supplies for children during teaching rounds , student administration fees and depreciation of her computer .
The Tax Office rejected the claim , so Ms Anstis and her father , Michael , who is a qualified solicitor but does not work as a lawyer , fought them all the way to the hearing in Melbourne yesterday .
Sergei Fedorov gets into a fight to avenge his brother Fedor ( Photo © khl.ru )
Sergei Fedorov , who moved from NHL to KHL past summer , got into a fight with Roman Derlyuk to avenge Derlyuk ’s dirty hit on Sergei ’s younger brother , Fedor .
After the game 23 - year - old Derlyuk could n’t beleive he fought 40 - year - old Sergei Fedorov himself .
“ Fedorov is a great player , I remember watching him play when I was a kid .
I ’d even call myself his fan .
And if someone told me that I ’d ever fight Fedorov I would … I would … never beleive .
It just happened that he went after me , one of his punches reached my head and I …
Of course I ’d never start a fight against such player as Sergei Fedorov… never , ” said Derlyuk to Alyona Shilova of vhockey .ru after the game .
Sergei Fedorov is playing for Metallurg Magnitogorsk on a line with his younger brother Fedor .
In 36 games Sergei scored 8 goals and recorded 16 assists .
His plus / minus rating is +23 .
It ’s Metallurg ’s best and KHL ’s 3rd best result .
Spirit of St. Louis
The abrading of a city ’s self - image is gradual .
But once that dreary process begins , it gathers an energy of its own and becomes difficult to reverse .
If a place is continually criticized — withered by condescension from without , and shame from within — a kind of civic inferiority inevitably results .
A case in point : the grand old Mississippi River town of St. Louis , gateway to the West , a city so thoroughly beaten up that it seemed to have thrown up its hands in defeat years ago .
Occasionally , however , something inexplicable comes along to alter the landscape , lowering the hands and providing the sense that positive change is possible .
An event of that magnitude took the region by surprise this summer , when Citygarden , a 2.9 - acre sculpture park in downtown St. Louis , opened to exuberant throngs .
Funded by the local Gateway Foundation and designed by Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects ( NBWLA ) , of Charlottesville , Virginia , the park features work from an impressive roster of modern and contemporary sculptors : Tom Claassen , Niki de Saint Phalle , Jim Dine , Keith Haring , Férnand Leger , Aristide Maillol , Julian Opie , Martin Puryear , Tony Smith , Jack Youngerman , and others .
Located on a woefully underutilized 1.1 - mile strip of open space called the Gateway Mall , the two - block sculpture garden has not only transformed the area but lifted the public ’s sense of itself and its city .
To understand why the stones , sculptures , and watercourses of Citygarden constitute so potent a tonic for regional dyspepsia , readers should know that plenty has happened here in the last half century to persuade anyone that suggestions of inferiority are both sound and logical .
The metro area has not grown much in population , but we ’ve sprawled all over the landscape , leaving large portions of a once vibrant city to decay .
We ’ve knocked down some irreplaceable pieces of our built past .
White flight has been supersonic ; a racial chasm persists .
Our primacy in booze and shoes went down the drain and walked out of town .
The plant sciences and biotechnology should replace these industries , but we ’re suspicious of science as ungodly , in spite of its being the region ’s best hope for economic redemption .
There ’s often a perception around here that no one is doing anything smart .
Forward - thinking residents , however , as well as visitors and immigrants who are unspoiled by familiarity , regularly remark on the quality of our architectural legacy and the vibrancy of our cultural life .
In addition to Eads , Saarinen , Sullivan , Gilbert , Grimshaw , Ando , and Maki , there are estimable works by local midcentury masters such as Harris Armstrong and William Bernoudy .
Stir all of that into a pot that also contains a first - rate symphony orchestra and opera company , art and history museums , and magnificently developed recreational resources , and the result is a dish that ’s anything but bland or spoiled .
So , regardless of what anyone tells you , St. Louis is not a disused dump à la Love in the Ruins or Blade Runner , and its strength has increased dramatically since the lights and water were turned on at Citygarden , where even the most chronic case of municipal blues can be treated — 24 hours a day , seven days a week — with a jubilant and healing boost .
Citygarden ’s seeds were planted in the late 1990s , when a local citizens ’ group drafted a plan for downtown that envisioned a sculpture park on the same two - block site that it occupies today .
“ Nothing happened immediately , ” says Paul Wagman , a spokesman for Gateway Foundation , “ until several years later , when , to the astonishment of everyone who ’d lived here , downtown began to come back . ”
The notoriously press - shy foundation — started by the late Aaron and Teresa Fischer , and now overseen by their son , Peter — has for more than 20 years supported a host of initiatives aimed at improving public spaces in the region .
In 2006 , at the city ’s request , the foundation funded a detailed master plan for the mall ; a cooperation agreement between the two parties followed .
“ The city would provide the land , and the foundation would do the planning and supervise creation of the garden , ” Wagman says .
The budget was $ 25 – $ 30 million , not including the sculptures .
Because the foundation already had an opening date in mind — July 2009 , in time for the All - Star Game , which would be played just blocks from the site — it embarked on an aggressive schedule .
It held a design competition in early 2007 and considered the likes of Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates , Charles Anderson Landscape Architecture , and Sawyer / Berson before selecting NBWLA .
“ We were committed to making this more about their place , St. Louis , than about us , ” says Warren T. Byrd Jr. , a senior principal at NBWLA .
“ It also became clear that this was meant to be a combination of sculpture garden , urban park , and urban garden . ”
Indeed , Citygarden is both a literal and symbolic reflection of the city .
Originally , the site had a somewhat deceiving six - foot elevation .
The designers took advantage of the terrain by increasing the elevation in some spots to ten feet and then dividing the park into three distinct bands .
“ The higher ground , which we termed the upland area , would have rows of trees , ” Byrd explains .
“ It houses not just the higher ground but the café terrace and maintenance building .
The middle ground ( we called it the flood - plain ) is the lowest area , the most open and parklike , with big shade trees — not on a grid — and a lot of lawn and water areas .
The southern band , the Market Street garden , is the most intensely horticultural . ”
Early on , the designers found a 1916 Sanborn map showing old property and foundation lines .
“ We looked at those and said , ‘ Let ’s trace some of that history , ’ ” Byrd says .
“ So the central walkways are literal traces of the old alleyways between the two blocks . ”
The process was intensely collaborative .
NBWLA worked with the Missouri Botanical Garden on plant selection and with the Gateway Foundation on the subtle art of sculpture siting .
At one point , a large model of the park was built , and the team moved sculpture replicas around like chess pieces , assessing each location based on the artwork , the landscape around it , and how it fit into the sequence of forms .
“ It seems remarkable that they do n’t compete with each other , ” Byrd says .
“ They do overlap in some views , but they tend to complement each other when you do see more than one in a view . ”
Since early July , when the wraps came off — on schedule and on budget —
Citygarden has been visited by a steady stream of revelers , who admire and touch , climb on sculptures or eat a meal , dance in the lyrical plumes of one fountain or wade into the mists of another .
“ You see little kids , elderly people , arty people , frumpy people , ” Wagman says .
“ People look happy .
They ’re interacting with each other , often in spontaneous ways . ”
The park taps into the power of pure joy and the city ’s hopes for a genuine and lasting renewal .
As a major Linux vendor , one might expect that Red Hat 's new Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization ( RHEV ) for Servers solution would be able to run on Linux servers .
You 'd be wrong .
Not only is that not the case , but the Management Server piece of RHEV , which provides virtualization management capabilities , requires users to be running Microsoft 's Windows Server .
That 's no typo :
A Linux vendor is requiring its users to run one of its key new products on the rival , closed source Windows operating system .
According to Red Hat , the plan is to have a Linux version ready by some point in 2010 .
But in the meantime , Red Hat customers who want to run the virtualization manager must purchase or already own a Windows server .
" The Windows Server could be running as a virtual server in RHEL ( Red Hat Enterprise Linux ) , but you would require a Windows machine for the management system , " Andy Cathrow , product marketing manager for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization , told InternetNews.com .
" We spent a lot of time talking to customers to see what their view was on this and I think with the possible exception of Red Hat , everyone has some Windows in their datacenter . "
Cathrow added that even though it is a requirement for running the management system , Red Hat would not be reselling Windows Server .
Instead , he noted that it is the customers ' own responsibility to acquire the required Windows Server .
While Red Hat wo n't be reselling Windows Server , it and Microsoft do have an interoperability agreement enabling each other 's respective virtualization technologies .
How this happened
The story of how Red Hat ended up shipping a Windows Server application to manage Linux virtualization starts with the root technology on which RHEV is built .
In 2008 , Red Hat acquired virtualization vendor Qumranet for $ 107 million .
Part of the Qumranet technology portfolio was a virtualization management technology called SolidICE , which was built for Windows .
Cathrow said that SolidICE had great features but was missing some server virtualization components .
" So we extended the SolidICE product and built on the Qumranet base , which has been out in the market and deployed with customers , " Cathrow said .
" We 're in the process of moving it to a fully Linux and open source base , but it was important for us to bring this to market quickly for our customers . "
Cathrow added that Red Hat decided to go to market with the enhanced Qumranet solution while work remains ongoing on building a Linux port using an open source effort .
In addition to the Windows Server requirement , users will also need to have a Windows desktop ( XP or higher ) in order to view the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager console .
Cathrow noted that the console uses Microsoft's .
NET Web Presentation Framework ( WPF ) to run .
Red Hat is also working on a multiplatform
Web - based user console , but it , too , is not yet available .
WPF and other Microsoft .NET capabilities are available to Linux users under the auspices of the Novell - led Mono project .
But according to Cathrow , Mono was not a route that Red Hat wanted to go for deploying its management server or console products .
" We need to make the transition to open technologies such as Java quickly and there is work to get a .NET application to run in Mono anyways , " Cathrow said .
" Anything that is written in Mono will run anywhere , but if something is written in .NET on Windows , there is no guarantee it will work on Mono on Linux . "
As Red Hat builds out its Linux version of the Virtualization Management server , Cathrow noted that there will be an easy migration path for users of the Windows version .
He added that with Red Hat 's subscription model , subscribers get new versions as they are made available .
" Anytime we acquire a company , there is work to go from a proprietary code base to open source , " Cathow said .
" So you 'll absolutely see the whole RHEV suite on an open source model next year . "

It is not just legs that are made for walking
American lobsters use " jet-assisted " walking to travel faster across the ocean floor , scientists have found .
The lobsters have small paddle - like structures on their abdomen , which they fan to create a wake which propels the crustacean forward .
These paddles can generate the same force underwater as some fish do with their pectoral fins .
The researchers who made the discovery describe the paddles as acting like " little auxiliary thrusters . "
To investigate why the lobsters fan these paddles , known as pleopods , graduate student Jeanette Lim and Professor Edwin DeMont of St Francis Xavier University in Antigonish , Canada devised a mechanical model which replicates the moving parts of a lobster 's abdomen .
" No one had actually measured how much force the American lobster 's pleopods could produce , " says Lim .
" We just took the abdomen of a lobster , emptied out the tissues , and hooked up eight mini servomotors bought from a robotic toy company in California to the pleopods . "
The motors made the life - sized model fan the pleopods at the same rate as a live lobster would .

The researchers then used a technique called particle image velocimetry to image and measure how fluid flowed from the pleopods , and the forces they generated .
They report their results in the Journal of Experimental Biology .
" Once we saw the flow visualisations , we were surprised with how large the wake was , " says Lim , now studying for her PhD at Harvard University in Boston , US .
" The pleopods on American lobsters ( Homarus americanus ) are relatively broad and paddle - shaped compared to pleopods on crayfish , for example , " she explains .
" But they are still fairly diminutive and rather flimsy appendages when you consider the size and toughness of the rest of the body . "
" So we were surprised their beating produced a sizable wake with thrust that was on par with forces produced by the fins of some swimming fish . "
Pleopods viewed from below
The model showed that the pleopods continually pull in water around the lobster 's body and funnel it into a jet directed out behind .
Each lobster can produce 27 to 54mN of thrust , which is comparable to that produced by other proficient swimmers such the bluegill sunfish ( Lepomis macrochirus ) and surfperch ( Embiotoca jacksoni ) , which use their pectoral fins to move at slow to moderate speeds .
Exactly how the lobster harnesses these forces is unclear .
The crustaceans beat their pleopods to swim , and the new research shows that the pleopods can provide substantial thrust while doing so .
But it also seems likely that the pleopods give the lobsters extra thrust while walking along the seabed or over obstacles .
The researchers call it " jet- assisted walking " .
" American lobster 's pleopods are capable of producing forces that could potentially aid walking , by acting like little auxiliary thrusters , " says Lim .
Robotic motors move real lobster pleopods " We cannot say for certain whether the pleopods are ' significant ' for locomotion in live lobsters as we measured forces from a model , but our results suggest they could be helpful when a little extra thrust is needed . "
However , not all types of lobster would produce similar forces , as pleopod shape , which affects its ability to be an effective paddle , varies a lot among lobster species .

Urban Greenhouses Aim to Help Cities Combat Climate Change
With its massive glass dome , the Plantagon Greenhouse would n't look out of place in a sci - fi movie .

Over in Denmark , a new campaign has launched in the effort to combat violence .
However , its sexualization of said violence , the " pussy - gangster " meter , and light chastisement at the end of the simulation seems more condonement than condemnation .
Advertisement
" Hit the Bitch " is the campaign , which shares the same name as the advergame - style simulation that accompanies it .
You play a man ( represented by a disembodied white forearm and hand ) in some sort of altercation with a woman you know .
( I was unable to find a translation of the content from Danish ) .
At various points , the woman provokes you , at one point flipping you the bird .
As you smack her , the meter creeps slowly upwards .
The way to end the game is to continue slapping the girl until your meter moves from 100 % pussy ( no hits ) to 100 % gangsta ( around ten hits ) .
Advertisement
After reaching the end , the girl falls to the floor , and you are greeted with a 100 % Idiot message , as well as a scolding in Danish .
Statistics also flash over the screen , which are presumably about the death toll of physical violence .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
I finished the game unnerved - the long slog to get to the end was n't at all rewarding ( unless you get off on images of violence ) and the tsk - tsking at the very end is n't nearly enough to counter the bruality of the game play , which can be done using a mouse or a webcam to control the hits .
Adfreak shares this feeling of unease :
Setting up an interface where you 're encouraged to slap and punch a woman seems pretty extreme .
It 's almost like an advergame , except you 're delivering an adverbeating !
( You can use the mouse , or connect with your Webcam and swing at the girl with your hand . )
Getting called a " 100 % idiot " at the end does n't feel like much of a rebuke .
Perhaps you 're supposed to feel guilty , like a real - life abuser might , for continuing to hit the woman just to see what happens next ?
Advertisement
What bothered me most about the game was definitely the sexualization of the abuse .
From the opening scene , it is inescapable .
Sociological Images points us toward the documentary Dreamworlds 3 : Desire , Sex , and Power in Music Video , and its segment on sexualized violence .
This snippet discusses the prevalent practice of showing violent imagery in a sexualized context , and the stunning real life consequences :
This game is saturated with the sexy - violence meme , from the woman 's cute clubbing outfit ( complete with a short leather skirt ) ...
Advertisement
... to the post - hit pouty face she makes ( before her face is completely bruised that is . )
Advertisement
The project is way too glamorized and stylized to have the impact the organization hoped .
Instead , the project ends up reinforcing the idea that violence is sexy , while allowing their ultimate message to fall to the wayside .

Add up every nickel and dime recorded by the Federal Election Commission and state election commissions in this decade now ending .
Result : Americans have given more than $ 24.2 billion in campaign contributions to federal and state incumbents and challengers .
Contributions to all federal candidates for House and Senate seats and the presidency from the 2000 through 2010 election cycles totaled $ 9.7 billion , according to an S&R analysis of records aggregated by the Center for Responsive Politics .
Contributions to candidates and committees in all 50 states , from 2000 through 2009 , totaled about $ 14.5 billion , according to records aggregated by the National Institute on Money in State Politics .
In this decade , thanks to computerization of records and a few top - notch , non-partisan organizations , we ’ve learned how to follow the money .
Well , so what ?
Has vastly increased public visibility of political money changed the way politics operates ?
The $ 24.2 billion spent on campaign contributions is only part of the story .
Over the past decade , $ 23 billion has been spent by corporations , labor unions , and other special - interest entities to lobby Congress and federal agencies , according to records aggregated by the center .
More than $ 45 billion has been spent in the decade now ending to influence legislation and regulation at state and federal levels of government .
It ’s only conjecture , of course , but it ’s hardly likely that the bulk of those billions of dollars was intended to improve the lot of the 99 percent of adult Americans who did not make campaign contributions or made gifts of less than $ 200 .
Where did the $ 24.2 billion in campaign donations come from ?
Only a tiny fraction , generally in the tenths of 1 percent , of Americans over age 18 make campaign contributions of more than $ 200 .
Those who give more than $ 1,000 are even fewer — but the amounts given by those latter donors total significantly higher .
The bulk of the decade ’s nearly $ 10 billion in donations to federal candidates came from special interests and individuals associated with specific special interests who gave $ 200 or more .
According to the center , the top special - interest givers in the election cycles in this decade , generally in this order , were
the finance , insurance and real - estate industries ; lawyers and lobbyists ; miscellaneous business ; ideological and single - issue donors ; the health industries ; communications and electronics ; labor ; agribusiness ; energy and natural - resource interests ; transportation ; and the defense industry .
Corporations and individuals associated with these special interests donated more than $ 8 billion this decade to federal candidates .
And the leader in campaign largesse for the decade and in each election cycle , at $ 1.62 billion , or more than 16 percent of all campaign contributions to federal candidates ?
The winner , by a wide margin , are the finance , insurance and real - estate industries .
The number of lobbyists has increased from 10,641 in 2000 to 13,426 this year .
Now , that ’s the number of people who have legally registered as lobbyists .
There are plenty of revolving - door people ( those who have left the Hill or the executive branch to become lobbyists and vice versa ) who are not registered as lobbyists but are as influential .
Consider the example of former Sen . Tom Daschle , who claims he ’s a “ resource ” for his health - care industry clients and not a lobbyist .
Those interested in studying campaign finance and lobbing — who ’s giving the money and who ’s getting it — have two non-profit and non-partisan organizations to thank for ready , intelligible access to FEC and state election commissions data .
They are the Center for Responsive Politics and the National Institute on Money in State Politics , which provides “ free online access to public records in all 50 states , to document political donor and lobbyist contributions to policymakers . ”
Also helpful is Earmark Watch , a project of Taxpayers for Common Sense and the Sunlight Foundation , which helps expose what these billions of dollars can buy from legislators .
These groups have become technologically more savvy .
Tracking campaign contributions and lobbying dollars can be narrowly focused on such data more easily than using the FEC ’s website or state election data websites .
The center and the institute now have talented staffers who frequently write analyses of donor data , especially when a particularly topic is in the news .
Congress irritated by the college football Bowl Championship Series ?
There ’s the center ’s Dave Levinthal on the Capital Eye Blog , detailing how much money the BCS , News Corp. , the NCAA and major football universities are giving to whom for what purpose .
Wondering whether Congress will include legal importation of drugs from abroad ( i.e. , Canada ) in health - care reform ?
There ’s Levinthal again , pointing out that the pharmaceutical and health - products industries have spent nearly $ 200 million in 2009 to oppose it .
Want to know how much money the health - care industry has spent trying to influence state legislation and regulation ?
There ’s the institute ’s Anne Bauer , telling you “ [ i ] n the last six years , major players in the health care industry gave $ 394 million to officeholders , party committees and ballot measure committees in the 50 states . ”
When the short - term , high - vig payday loan industry sought to reinvigorate itself ( i.e. , screw the borrowers ) through the ballot box , there was the institute ’s Tyler Evilsizer to explain that in Arizona and Ohio , “ donors from the industry gave more than $ 35 million to support ballot measures that would allow them to continue operating . ”
Computerization of records and sophisticated staff allow an organization such as Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , aka CREW , to track robocall ethics complaints against Sen .
John McCain , develop a list of the most corrupt members of Congress , and keep track of the revolving door moves of White House staffers and cabinet members .
Yes , the governed can quickly track donations to those who govern or seek to govern .
Yes , the governed can track the money spent by individuals , corporations , PACs and unions to legally influence those who govern .
Yes , the governed can easily see how easy and legal it is for big spenders to influence legislators and regulators .
So what have we gained because we can do this ?
Not much .
Over the decade , corrupt politicians have been imprisoned for a variety of crimes .
Convicted of crimes such as fraud and bribery , they were selfish and for sale .
What they did was illegal .
But what remains unabated in the American political system is legalized corruption .
The heightened ability to track political money does nothing to prevent the dramatic increase in legal campaign giving and the host of ethical and moral conflicts that so much money places in front of incumbents , challengers , and regulators .
We ’ve seen the amounts of money spent to legally attain and maintain political power grow to such amounts that billionaires now spend tens of millions of dollars to finance their own campaigns .
Modern elections trivialize issues and maximize dependence on name recognition .
That costs money , which forecloses the possibility that better - qualified candidates who are not as wealthy can prosper at the ballot box .
We ’ve seen how those with money to spend and an agenda to enact gain access to the levers of power , as did players in the health - care reform debate behind closed doors in the Obama White House .
Consider the consolidation of media , its threat to competitiveness , its anti-trust implications , and its potential to maintain unreasonably high consumer prices for news and entertainment .
When Comcast announced its intended $ 30 billion purchase of NBC Universal from General Electric , its lobbyists flooded the Hill .
Through September of this year , Comcast has spent $ 9.1 million on lobbying .
The Federal Communications Commission must approve the sale .
Comcast ’s 20 - member D.C. lobbying team , reports Politico ’s Kenneth P. Vogel , includes “ former aides to Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin ( D - Ill. ) , Sens. Byron Dorgan ( D - N.D. ) and Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R - Texas ) , former Senate Majority Leader and Obama confidant Tom Daschle ( D - S.D. ) , Rep. John Dingell ( D - Mich . ) , former House Speaker Dennis Hastert ( R - Ill . ) and Democratic Federal Communications Commissioner Michael Copps . ”
( Oh , look : There ’s “ confidant ” Daschle acting as a “ resource ” again , “ aides ” notwithstanding …)
Continual increases in media consolidation by conglomerates reduce the likelihood that Americans ’ monthly bills for cable , Internet , satellite , and telephone services will decrease .
Earlier this month , the House faced an impending vote on what Paul Krugman of The New York Times called “ a quite modest effort to rein in Wall Street excesses . ”
Three days earlier , wrote Krugman , “ Republican leaders met with more than 100 financial - industry lobbyists to coordinate strategies ” to sidestep banking reform .
All Republicans and 27 Democrats voted against the measure .
( Gosh , what wonderfully independent thinking from our members of Congress . )
That means it ’s less likely that credit will flow readily and credibly to America ’s small businesses and consumers , and that more Americans may lose their homes unfairly .
And the drug - industry lobbyists ?
We ’ve seen how lobbyists for pharmaceutical giant Genentech have written statements that 42 members of Congress from both parties have “ revised and extended ” into the Congressional Record .
That means it ’s likely the out - of - pocket cost ( and that inherent in premiums ) for prescription medications is likely to grow as a percentage of Americans ’ expenditures even as their wages have remained stagnant through the past decade .
We continue to see the fruits of lobbying in which special interests reap financial reward at little cost , such as the American Jobs Recovery
Act that provided no jobs but $ 100 billion in tax breaks for corporations .
Are Americans better off because of the ease with which they can track who gives how much money to the people who would represent them and propose and pass laws that may help or hinder Americans ’ lives , liberties and pursuit of happiness ?
No .
That ’s because incumbents and challengers do n’t care a whit that this system is so blatantly and transparently stacked toward the influence wrought by so much money .
We point fingers at the financially oiled , undue influence of special interests .
Our legislators and regulators just shrug : “ So what ? ”
No legislative intent lies on the horizon of the next decade that would stem the shameful influence of money on the conduct of legislators and regulators and what they do , or fail to do , in the public ’s interest .
There will be no sufficient , substantial changes in campaign finance laws or congressional ethics policies to end this system of legalized corruption .
No reform candidates exist on the horizon immune to the blandishments the crassly monied political system can promise or proffer .
From 2010 to 2019 , expect more of the same .
Another $ 45 billion will speak louder than you or me to those who govern us .
WASHINGTON -- Republicans are preparing an alternative health - care bill to Democratic legislation , House Republican Leader John Boehner said , marking a shift in strategy as the full House is set to begin debate on the issue this week .

JUST MAKE SURE YOU DON'T BURN IT EDIT : Using 162°F water is no guarantee you will get the right temp .
It depends what the temperature of your grain is , how much water you use and your equipment .
I would suggest using the Green Bay Rackers Mash Calculator and then finding out what works on your system .

JUST MAKE SURE YOU DON'T BURN IT
Due to my bad back , the limits of brewing inside a carpeted apartment , and time constraints i have working tons of overtime at my job , i've often tried to find a quick , cheap and easy method of brewing .
Brewing with extract limits the type of beers you can make and the character you can get in certain beers .
Some of my favorite grains , including vienna , rye , maize , oats etc. need to be mashed to get the right character out of them .
I want to use them quickly with a minimum amount of equipment to clean .
The method i found works best in my situation involves a few pieces of equipment I already had , it uses a short amount of time , and I can brew any type of beer i want .
I use this method to do 5 gallon partial mashes and 2.5 gallon all grains several times a week .
i thought i would post this to help some of the newer people easily do partial mashes , as i know passing the extract barrier can often be difficult .
I use the following equipment for the brewing process : 2 - 5 gallon stockpots ( different sizes will work , this is just what i use ) 1 - Lid ( to cover one of the stockpots ) 1 - Floating Thermometer 1 - Stirring Rod ( you can use anything from a wooden spoon to a mash paddle ) 1 - 24 " x 24 " Hop / Grain Bag
In this thread , i will explain how i made a 5 gallon batch using pictures from the brew night .
This batch took less than three hours .
Place the bag inside your stockpot , folded around the sides , and fill with the desired amount of strike water ( i use 2 gallons of water for 5 - 6 lbs of grain . )
Place the thermometer in the pot and heat the water to the desired strike temp .
i experience a loss of about 12 °F when i add my grains with this equipment , so i shoot for 162 °F water which will drop to 150 °F mash temp when I add the grain .
I always have all my ingredients ready to go to make everything nice and smooth :
Glow sticks were the trickiest treat in this year ’s Halloween bag .
The Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center received 43 phone calls on Halloween from people worried about children who had chewed on the neon tubes and swallowed some of the iridescent liquid inside .
A must - have for any Halloween costume , glow sticks make little goblins and ghouls more visible to cars while trick - or - treating .
Some , it seems , thought chewing on the sticks also was a good idea .
Most calls involved children 18 months to 6 years old .
The foul - smelling liquid inside can cause skin irritation , itchy eyes and upset tummies , but not Halloween death .
Glow sticks contain two solutions .
A small glass cylinder holds a hydrogen peroxide solution , which when broken combines with an alcohol mix , causing the stick to glow .
“ While it is an irritant , it is not something you need to go to the emergency room for , ” said Shireen Banerji , clinical toxicology coordinator for Poison Control .
The poison control center serves Colorado , Nevada , Idaho , Montana and Hawaii .
Fourteen of the glow - stick calls came from Colorado .
While almost all the cases involved children — the youngest was a 10 - month - old — the center did receive a call from one 45 - year - old who had ingested glow - stick fluid , Banerji said .
Man or boy test
You are encouraged to You are encouraged to solve this task according to the task description , using any language you may know .
Background :
The man or boy test was proposed by computer scientist Donald Knuth as a means of evaluating implementations of the ALGOL 60 programming language .
The aim of the test was to distinguish compilers that correctly implemented " recursion and non-local references " from those that did not .
I have written the following simple routine , which may separate the ' man - compilers ' from the ' boy - compilers '
— Donald Knuth
Task : Imitate Knuth 's example in Algol 60 in another language , as far as possible .
Details : Local variables of routines are often kept in activation records ( also call frames ) .
In many languages , these records are kept on a call stack .
In Algol ( and e.g. in Smalltalk ) , they are allocated on a heap instead .
Hence it is possible to pass references to routines that still can use and update variables from their call environment , even if the routine where those variables are declared already returned .
This difference in implementations is sometimes called the Funarg Problem .
In Knuth 's example , each call to A allocates an activation record for the variable A .
When B is called from A , any access to k now refers to this activation record .
Now B in turn calls A , but passes itself as an argument .
This argument remains bound to the activation record .
This call to A also " shifts " the variables x i by one place , so eventually the argument B ( still bound to its particular activation record ) will appear as x4 or x5 in a call to A .
If this happens when the expression x4 + x5 is evaluated , then this will again call B , which in turn will update k in the activation record it was originally bound to .
As this activation record is shared with other instances of calls to A and B , it will influence the whole computation .
So all the example does is to set up a convoluted calling structure , where updates to k can influence the behavior in completely different parts of the call tree .
Knuth used this to test the correctness of the compiler , but one can of course also use it to test that other languages can emulate the Algol behavior correctly .
If the handling of activation records is correct , the computed value will be −67 .
Performance and Memory : Man or Boy is intense and can be pushed to challenge any machine .
Memory ( both stack and heap ) not CPU time is the constraining resource as the recursion creates a proliferation activation records which will quickly exhaust memory and present itself through a stack error .
Each language may have ways of adjusting the amount of memory or increasing the recursion depth .
Optionally , show how you would make such adjustments .
The table below shows the result , call depths , and total calls for a range of k :

Knuth 's example :
begin real procedure A ( k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) ; value k ; integer k ; real x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ; begin real procedure B ; begin k:= k - 1 ; B:= A := A ( k , B , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) end ; if k <= 0 then A:= x4 + x5 else B end ; outreal ( A ( 10 , 1 , - 1 , - 1 , 1 , 0 ) ) end
This creates a tree of B call frames that refer to each other and to the containing A call frames , each of which has its own copy of k that changes every time the associated B is called .
Trying to work it through on paper is probably fruitless , but the correct answer is − 67 , despite the fact that in the original paper Knuth postulated it to be − 121 .
Note that Knuth 's code states :
if k <= 0 then A:= x4 + x5 else B
which actually discards the result value from the call to B .
Most of the translated examples below are equivalent to :
A := ( if k <= 0 then x4 + x5 else B )
and are therefore strictly incorrect , although in a correct ' man ' compiler they do produce the expected result , because Knuth 's version has already assigned to the return variable for A from within B , and it is in fact that assignment which is the true return value of the function :
B:= A := A ( k , B , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )
It is most likely that this was a deliberate attempt by Knuth to find yet another way to break ' boy ' compilers , rather than merely being sloppy code .

Even if closures are not available in a language , their effect can be simulated .
This is what happens in the following C implementation :

// With Clipper 5.2e compiler and standard RTLINK linker , default settings , only manages up to k=5 before a stack fault :
EVALUATE (0 ) Unrecoverable error 650 : Processor stack fault
// Using Blinker v5.1 it can get up to k=7 by increasing the stack size via BLINKER PROCEDURE DEPTH 74 .
But that may be the limit for 16 - bit Clipper ; increasing the procedure depth further does not help , and eventually results in
A (0 ) Unrecoverable error 667 : Eval stack fault
Harbour however is definitely a man : a 32 - bit WinXP executable built with Harbour v3.1 and mingw gcc 4.6.1 manages up to k=13 with the default settings .

Lazy Variadic Function Version [ edit ]
Lazy Variadic Functions version , as quoted :
If the variadic parameter is an array of delegates with no parameters :

Then each of the arguments whose type does not match that of the delegate is converted to a delegate .
int delegate ( ) dg ;
foo ( 1 , 3+x , dg , cast ( int delegate ( ) ) null ) ;
is the same as :
foo( { return 1 ; } , { return 3+x ; } , dg , null ) ;

Provided that it is marked in the caller and callee , E can perfectly emulate the requested call - by - name behavior by passing slots instead of values :
def a ( var k , & x1 , & x2 , & x3 , & x4 , & x5 ) {
def bS ; def & b := bS
bind bS {
to get ( ) {
k -= 1
return a ( k , & b , & x1 , & x2 , & x3 , & x4 )
}
}
return if ( k <= 0 ) { x4 + x5 } else { b }
}
def p := 1
def n := - 1
def z := 0
println ( a ( 10 , & p , & n , & n , & p , & z ) )
Here each of the " x " parameters is effectively call - by - name .
b is bound to a custom slot definition .

Fantom has closures , so :
class ManOrBoy
{
Void main ( )
{
echo( A ( 10 , |-> Int|{1} , |-> Int|{ - 1} , |-> Int|{ - 1} , |-> Int|{1} , |-> Int|{0} ) ) ;
}
static Int A ( Int k , |-> Int| x1 , |-> Int| x2 , |-> Int| x3 , |-> Int| x4 , |-> Int| x5 )
{
|-> Int| ? b
b = |-> Int| { k--; return A( k , b , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) }
return k <= 0 ? x4 ( ) + x5 ( ) : b()
}
}
yields

Another version that uses named result parameters the way the original Algol uses the function name .
This includes B setting the result of its enclosing A .
package main
import " fmt "
func A ( k int , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 func ( ) int ) ( a int ) {
var B func ( ) int
B = func ( ) ( b int ) {
k --
a = A ( k , B , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )
b = a
return
}
if k < = 0 {
a = x4 ( ) + x5 ()
} else {
_ = B ()
}
return
}
func main ( ) {
K := func ( x int ) func ( ) int { return func ( ) int { return x } }
fmt .
Println ( A ( 10 , K ( 1 ) , K ( - 1 ) , K ( - 1 ) , K ( 1 ) , K ( 0 ) ) )
}
By exploiting interfaces , one can more closely parallel the original Algol 's polymorphic parameters .
package main
import " fmt "
func eval ( v interface {} ) int {
switch v := v . ( type ) {
case int :
return v
case func ( ) int :
return v ()
}
panic ( " bad type " )
return 0
}
func A ( k int , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 interface { } ) ( a int ) {
var B func ( ) int
B = func ( ) ( b int ) {
k --
a = A ( k , B , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )
b = a
return
}
if k < = 0 {
a = eval ( x4 ) + eval ( x5 )
} else {
_ = B ()
}
return
}
func main ( ) {

Println ( A ( 10 , 1 , - 1 , - 1 , 1 , 0 ) )

Using Gosu Version 0.10.2 .
This is not stictly identical with Wirth 's example .

var k = in_k
var B( ) : int //

B = \ -> {
k = k-1 ;
return A(k , B , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )
}
return k<=0 ? x4 ()+x5 ( ) : B ( )
}
print ( A ( 10 , \ -> 1 , \ -> - 1 , \ -> - 1 , \ -> 1 , \ -> 0 ) )

Solution :
def a ; a = { k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ->

a ( -- k , b , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )
}
k <= 0 ? x4 ( ) + x5 ( ) : b ( )
}
def x = { n -> { it -> n } }
Test 1 :
println ( a ( 10 , x ( 1 ) , x ( - 1 ) , x ( - 1 ) , x ( 1 ) , x ( 0 ) ) )
This test overflowed the stack at the default stack size .
On my system I required " - Xss1409k " or larger to run successfully .
Output :
- 67
Test 2 :
( 0 .. 20 ) . each { k ->
printf ( " %3d : %7 d
" , k , a ( k , x ( 1 ) , x ( - 1 ) , x ( - 1 ) , x ( 1 ) , x ( 0 ) ) )
}
This test required " - Xss345 m " to avoid overflow .
Output :

Haskell is a pure language , so the impure effects of updating k must be wrapped in the IO or ST monad :
import Data .

: : ( Enum a , Num b , Num a , Ord a )
=> a -> IO b -> IO b -> IO b -> IO b -> IO b -> IO b
a k x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 = do
r <- newIORef k
let b = do
k <- pred !
r
a k b x1 x2 x3 x4
if k <= 0
then ( + ) < $> x4 <*> x5
else b
where
f ! r = modifyIORef r f >> readIORef r
main :: IO ( )
main = a 10 # 1 # ( - 1 ) # ( - 1 ) # 1 # 0 >>= print
where

There are a few challenges to implementing MoB in Icon / Unicon .
There are no nested procedures and non-local variables that go with them
There is no selectable call by value .vs. call by name / reference .
Knowledge of the implicit mutable / immutable types is needed .
Procedure calls can't be deferred transparently but can be deferred through co-expressions
Co-expressions are n't enough as they trap local copies of variables which follow Icon rules for mutability / immutability
The initial solution below involved the use of co-expressions which seemed a natural tool to solve MoB .
It turns out that co-expressions are n't necessary to solve this task .
Co-expressions are very powerful and MoB really does n't exercise their full capability .
There is a lighter weight solution and also a cheat solution which is a further simplification .
The light weight version exploits that procedures are a data type and can be passed around and assigned .
This allows us to defer calling ' B ' which is just what is required .
The change introduces a new record definition ' defercall ' and changes only two lines of the original solution in ' eval ' and ' B ' .
The cheat would be to have ' eval ' know that it always called ' B ' .
MoB is intense and can be pushed to challenge any machine .
If you run this and the program hangs up or fails with an inadequate space for static allocation error , you may need to tweak the way Icon / Unicon allocates memory .
This is controlled through the environment variables COEXPSIZE , MSTKSIZE , BLKSIZE ( see Icon and Unicon Environment Variables ) .
Notes :
The co-expression version will require adjustment to COEXPRSIZE , and possibly BLKSIZE and MSTKSIZE .
Mob 13 ran on a machine with 4GB RAM running Unicon Win32 using COEXPSIZE=71000 ; BLKSIZE=2000000 ; and MSTKSIZE=1000000 .
Mob 15 ran on on a 64 - bit linux box with 16GB RAM with COEXPSIZE to 200000 ( and everything else defaulting ) .
The non-co - expression version required adjustment to BLKSIZE and MSTKSIZE .
Mob 21 ran on the same 4GB machine with BLKSIZE=10000000 ; and MSTKSIZE=70000000 Mob 23 ran on the same 4GB machine with BLKSIZE=20000000 ; and MSTKSIZE=300000000
The co-expression version .
record mutable ( value ) # we need mutable integers
# ... be obvious when we break normal scope rules
procedure main ( arglist ) # supply the initial k value
k := integer ( arglist [ 1 ] ) | 10 # .. or default to 10 =default
write ( " Man or Boy = " , A ( k , 1 , - 1 , - 1 , 1 , 0 ) )
end
procedure eval ( ref ) # evaluator to distinguish between a simple value and a code reference
return if type ( ref ) == " co-expression " then @ ref else ref
end
procedure A ( k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) # Knuth's A
k := mutable ( k ) # make k mutable for B
return if k .
value <= 0 then # -> boy compilers may recurse and die here
eval ( x4 ) + eval ( x5 ) # the crux of separating man .v. boy compilers
else # -> boy compilers can run into trouble at k=5 +
B ( k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 )
end
procedure B ( k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) # Knuth's B
k . value -:= 1 # diddle A's copy of k
return A ( k . value , create | B ( k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) # call A with a new k and 5 x's
end
Below are the code changes for the non-co - expression version .
A new record type is introduced and the two return expressions are changed slightly .
record defercall ( proc , arglist ) # light weight alternative to co-expr for MoB
procedure eval ( ref ) # evaluator to distinguish between a simple value and a code reference
return if type ( ref ) == " defercall " then ref .
proc !
ref .
arglist else ref
end
procedure B ( k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) # Knuth's B
k . value -:= 1 # diddle A's copy of k
return A ( k . value , defercall ( B , [ k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ] ) , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) # call A with a new k and 5 x's
end

OCaml variables are not mutable , so " k " is wrapped in a mutable object , which we access through a reference type called " ref " .

if k <= 0 then
x4 ( ) + x5 ( )
else
let m = ref k in
let rec b ( ) =
decr m ;

Ol designed as purely functional language , so such ' tricks ' with side effects are not allowed .
But !
For some reasons in version 1.2 a very limited mutators ( set - ref ! , set - car ! , set - cdr ! ) are added ; so this task can be implemented as usual .
Please , be aware that mutators receives only values ( small numbers , constants ) or previously ( before the mutating dest ) declared objects .
; Because argument " k " is a small number , it 's a value , not an object .
; So we must ' pack ' it in object - ' box ' it ;
And ' unbox ' when we try to get value .
( define ( box x ) ( list x ) )
( define ( unbox x ) ( car x ) )
( define ( copy x ) ( box ( unbox x ) ) )
( define ( A k x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 )
( define ( B )
( set - car ! k ( - ( unbox k ) 1 ) )
( A ( copy k ) B x1 x2 x3 x4 ) )
( if ( <= ( unbox k ) 0 )
( + ( x4 ) ( x5 ) )
( B ) ) )
( define ( man - or - boy N )
( A ( box N )
( lambda ( ) 1 )

We emulate the ALGOL60 example as closely as possible .
Like most of the examples , we use functions to emulate call - by - name .
Oz variables are immutable , so we use a mutable reference ( " cell " ) for K .
The ALGOL example uses call - by - value for K .
Oz uses call - by - reference , therefore we copy K explicitly when we call A recursively .
We use explicit " return variables " to emulate the strange behaviour of the ALGOL B procedure which assigns a value to A's return value .

The above PL / I code has been tested on OS PL / I V2.3.0 , Enterprise PL / I V3R9M0 and PL / I for Windows V8.0 .
The limit for OS PL / I on a z / OS machine with 4 Gb seems to be A=15 , the limit for Enterprise PL / I on the same machine seems to be A=23 , and the limit for PL / I for Windows on a 16 Gb system seems to be A=26 .
The « Russian » compiler ( that is based on Kildall ’s compiler PL / I - 86 ) produced the best results .
However , two tricks were used there : a ) hardware stack pointer was set directly to allocated memory by quasi- assembler ’s instruction ; b ) stack of parameters was replaced by array of parameters and contexts .
The result is A=27 for Win32 ( Windows - XP ) and A=31 for Win64 ( Windows - 7 ) .
Source code test for Win32 see : http://rsdn.org/article/pl1/PL1ex7/pl1ex7.xml
In source code test for Win64 FIXED ( 31 ) was replaced by FIXED ( 63 ) and pseudo - variable ?ESP by ?

Like many implementations this uses lambda wrappers around the numeric arguments and explicit function calls in the x4 ( ) + x5 ( ) step to force the order of evaluation and handle value / call duality .
n <- function ( x ) function ( ) x
A <- function( k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) {
B <- function ( ) A( k <<- k- 1 , B , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )
if ( k <= 0 ) x4 ( ) + x5 ( ) else B ( )
}
A ( 10 , n ( 1 ) , n( - 1 ) , n( - 1 ) , n ( 1 ) , n( 0 ) )
That is the way any sane person would implement Man- or - Boy .
However , we can be a bit more evil than that .
Here call .
by. name is a function that rewrites the function definition given as its input :
call.by.name <- function (... ) {
cl <- as.list( match.call ( ) )
sublist <- lapply ( cl [ 2:( length(cl ) - 1 ) ] ,
function ( name ) substitute ( substitute ( evalq ( . , . caller ) ,
list(.=substitute( name ) ) ) ,
list ( name=name ) ) )
names ( sublist ) <- enquote ( cl [ 2:( length(cl ) - 1 ) ] )
subcall <- do.call ( " call " , c( " list " , lapply ( sublist , enquote ) ) )
fndef <- cl [ [ length ( cl ) ] ]
fndef [ [ 3 ] ] <- substitute ( {
.caller <- parent.frame ( )
eval ( substitute ( body , subcall ) )
} , list ( body=fndef [ [ 3 ] ] , subcall=subcall ) )
eval.parent ( fndef )
}
allowing us to write A in a way that mirrors ALGOL60 semantics closely :
A <- call.by.name( x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ,
function ( k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) {
Aout <- NULL
B <- function ( ) {
k <<- k - 1
Bout <- Aout <<- A( k , B ( ) , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )
}
if ( k <= 0 ) Aout <- x4 + x5 else B ( )
Aout
}
)
One has to increase the recursion limit a bit , but it gives correct answers :
> options ( expressions=10000 )
> mapply ( A , 0:10 , 1 , - 1 , - 1 , 1 , 0 )
[ 1 ] 1 0 - 2 0 1 0 1 - 1 - 10 - 30 - 67
If you inspect A without the original source you will see what has happened : call.by.name rewrote
A so that it looks like this :
> print( A , useSource=FALSE )
function ( k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 )
{
.caller <- parent.frame ( )
eval ( substitute ( {
Aout <- NULL
B <- function ( ) {
k <<- k - 1
Bout <- Aout <<- A( k , B ( ) , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )
}
if ( k <= 0 ) Aout <- x4 + x5 else B ( )
Aout
} , list ( x1 = substitute ( evalq ( . , .caller ) , list (. = substitute ( x1 ) ) ) ,
x2 = substitute ( evalq (. , .caller ) , list (. = substitute ( x2 ) ) ) ,
x3 = substitute ( evalq (. , .caller ) , list (. = substitute ( x3 ) ) ) ,
x4 = substitute ( evalq (. , .caller ) , list (. = substitute ( x4 ) ) ) ,
x5 = substitute ( evalq (. , .caller ) , list (. = substitute ( x5 ) ) ) ) ) )
}
That is , instead of evaluating its arguments normally , A captures their original expressions , and instead of evaluating its body normally , A substitutes calls to evalq the captured argument expressions in the calling frame .
After a few levels of recursion this way , you end up evaluating expressions like A ( k , B ( ) , evalq ( B( ) , .caller ) , evalq ( evalq ( B ( ) , .caller ) , .caller ) , evalq ( evalq ( evalq ( 1 , .caller ) , .caller ) , .caller ) , evalq ( evalq ( evalq ( - 1 , .caller ) , .caller ) , .caller ) ) , so this is not very efficient , but works .
Copied from Scheme , works fine :
#lang racket
( define ( A k x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 )
( define ( B )
( set ! k (- k 1 ) )
( A k B x1 x2 x3 x4 ) )
( if ( <= k 0 )
(+ ( x4 ) ( x5 ) )
( B ) ) )
( A 10 ( lambda () 1 ) ( lambda ( ) - 1 ) ( lambda ( ) - 1 ) ( lambda () 1 ) ( lambda ( ) 0 ) )
( formerly Perl 6 ) This solution avoids creating the closure B if $k <= 0 ( that is , nearly every time ) .
sub A ( $k is copy , &x1 , & x2 , &x3 , & x4 , & x5 ) {
$ k <= 0
?? x4 ( ) + x5 ( )
!! ( my &B = { A ( -- $k , &B , &x1 , & x2 , &x3 , & x4 ) } ) ( ) ;
} ;
say A ( 10 , { 1 } , { - 1 } , { - 1 } , { 1 } , { 0 } ) ;
Output :
- 67
The REXX language only passes by value , not by name .
However , there is a way to treat passed arguments as names .
However , using the code below , it only works for n up to ( and including ) 3 .
/*REXX program performs the " man or boy " test as far as possible for N. */
do n= 0 /*increment N from zero forever .
*/
say ' n= ' n a ( N,x1,x2,x3, x4,x5 ) /* display the result to the terminal .
*/
end /*n*/ /* [ ↑ ] do until something breaks .
*/
exit /* stick a fork in it , we 're all done .
*/
/*──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────*/
a : procedure ; parse arg k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5
if k < = 0 then return f ( x4 ) + f ( x5 )
else return f ( b )
/*──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────*/
b : k=k- 1 ; return a ( k , b , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )
f : interpret ' v= ' arg ( 1 ) " ( ) " ; return v
x1 : procedure ; return 1
x2 : procedure ; return - 1
x3 : procedure ; return - 1
x4 : procedure ; return 1
x5 : procedure ; return 0
output
n=0 1 n=1 0 n=2 - 2 n=3 0
Note : the lambda call can be replaced with Proc.new and still work .
def a ( k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 )
b = lambda { k - = 1 ; a ( k , b , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) }
k < = 0 ? x4 [ ] + x5 [ ] : b [ ]
end
puts a ( 10 , lambda { 1 } , lambda { - 1 } , lambda { - 1 } , lambda { 1 } , lambda { 0 } )
use std:: cell :: Cell ;
trait Arg {
fn run( &self ) -> i32 ;
}
impl Arg for i32 {
fn run( &self ) -> i32 { * self }
}

}.run ( )
}
}
pub fn main ( ) {
println ! ( " {} " , a( 10 , &1 , & - 1 , & - 1 , &1 , &0 ) ) ;
}
Another solution where we have B take itself as an argument in order to recursively call itself :
use std:: cell :: Cell ;
fn a(k : i32 , x1 : & Fn ( ) -> i32 , x2 : & Fn ( ) -> i32 , x3 : & Fn ( ) -> i32 , x4 : & Fn ( ) -> i32 , x5 : & Fn ( ) -> i32 ) -> i32 {
let k1 = Cell : : new ( k ) ;
struct B < 'a > { f : &'a Fn( &B ) -> i32 }
let b = B {
f : &|b| {
k1.set(k1.get ( ) - 1 ) ;
return a ( k1.get ( ) , & || ( b.f ) ( b ) , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )
}
} ;
let b = || ( b.f ) ( &b ) ;
return if k <= 0 { x4 ( ) + x5 ( ) } else {b ( ) }
}
pub fn main ( ) {
println ! ( " {} " , a( 10 , & ||1 , & || - 1 , & || - 1 , & ||1 , & ||0 ) ) ;
}
Another solution that gives a reference - counted function a weak reference to itself :
Translation of : Objective - C
use std:: cell :: Cell ;
use std::cell:: RefCell ;
use std::rc:: Rc ;
use std::rc :: Weak ;
fn a(k : i32 , x1 : & Fn ( ) -> i32 , x2 : & Fn ( ) -> i32 , x3 : & Fn ( ) -> i32 , x4 : & Fn ( ) -> i32 , x5 : & Fn ( ) -> i32 ) -> i32 {
let weak_holder : Rc< RefCell < Weak < Fn ( ) -> i32 >>> = Rc::new ( RefCell::new ( Weak : :< fn ( ) -> i32>::new ( ) ) ) ;
let weak_holder2 = weak_holder.clone ( ) ;

k_holder.set(k_holder.get ( ) - 1 ) ;
return a( k_holder.get ( ) , &*b , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) ;
} ) ;
weak_holder.replace( Rc::downgrade(&b ) ) ;
return if k <= 0 { x4 ( ) + x5 ( ) } else {b ( ) }
}
pub fn main ( ) {

A ( k , B , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )
}
if ( k <= 0 ) x4+x5 else B
}
println ( A ( 10 , 1 , - 1 , - 1 , 1 , 0 ) )
( define ( A k x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 )

func a ( k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) {
func b { a ( -- k , b , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) } ;
k < = 0 ? ( x4 ( ) + x5 ( ) ) : b ( ) ;
}
say a ( 10 , -> { 1 } , -> { - 1 } , -> { - 1 } , -> { 1 } , -> { 0 } ) ; #= > - 67
This solution avoids creating the closure b if k <= 0 ( that is , nearly every time ) .
func a ( k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) {
k < = 0 ? ( x4 ( ) + x5 ( ) )
: func b { a ( -- k , b , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) } ( ) ;
}
say a ( 10 , -> { 1 } , -> { - 1 } , -> { - 1 } , -> { 1 } , -> { 0 } ) ; #= > - 67
Alternatively , we can implement it as a class also :
class MOB {
method a ( k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) {
func b { self .
a ( -- k , b , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) } ;
k < = 0 ? ( x4 ( ) + x5 ( ) ) : b ( ) ;
}
}
var obj = MOB ( ) ;
say obj .
a ( 10 , -> { 1 } , -> { - 1 } , -> { - 1 } , -> { 1 } , -> { 0 } ) ;
Number >>x1 : x1 x2 : x2 x3 : x3 x4 : x4 x5 : x5 | b k | k := self .
b := [ k := k - 1 . k x1 : b x2 : x1 x3 : x2 x4 : x3 x5 : x4 ]. ^k <= 0 ifTrue : [ x4 value + x5 value ] if False : b 10 x1 : [ 1 ] x2 : [ - 1 ] x3 : [ - 1 ] x4 : [ 1 ] x5 : [ 0 ]
Sparkling does not directly support modifying external local variables .
To work around this limitation , we wrap the k variable in an array , which is mutable .
function a(k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) {
let kk = { " k " : k.k } ;
let b = function b( ) {
kk.k--;
return a( kk , b , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) ;
} ;
return kk.k <= 0 ? x4 ( ) + x5 ( ) : b( ) ;
}
function x(n ) {
return function ( ) {
return n ;
} ;
}
print ( a({ " k " : 10 } , x ( 1 ) , x ( - 1 ) , x ( - 1 ) , x ( 1 ) , x ( 0 ) ) ) ;
Standard ML variables are not mutable , so " k " is wrapped in a mutable object , which we access through a reference type called " ref " .
fun a ( k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) =
if k <= 0 then
x4 ( ) + x5 ()
else let
val m = ref k
fun b ( ) = (
m := !m - 1 ;
a (!m , b , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )
)
in
b ()
end
val () =
print ( Int.toString ( a ( 10 , fn ( ) => 1 , fn ( ) => ~ 1 , fn ( ) => ~ 1 , fn ( ) => 1 , fn ( ) => 0 ) ) ^ "
" )

As of Swift 3.0 , closure parameters are " non-escaping " by default .
The Man or Boy Test requires the closures to be escaping , and thus we must now annotate the closure parameters with the " @escaping " attribute .
func A ( _ k : Int ,
_ x1 : @escaping ( ) ->
Int ,
_ x2 : @escaping ( ) ->
Int ,
_ x3 : @escaping ( ) ->
Int ,
_ x4 : @escaping ( ) ->

_ x5 : @escaping ( ) -> Int ) ->
Int {
var k1 = k
func B( ) ->
Int {
k1 -= 1
return A ( k1 , B , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )
}
if k1 <= 0 {
return x4 ( ) + x5 ( )
} else {
return B ( )
}
}
print ( A ( 10 , { 1} , { - 1} , { - 1} , { 1} , { 0} ) )

There are two nontrivial features in the " man or boy " test .
One is that the parameters x1 though x5 are in general going to be function calls that do n't get evaluated until their values are needed for the addition in procedure A , which means that these in Tcl are going to be scripts , and therefore it is necessary to introduce a helper procedure C that returns a constant value .
The other is that procedure B needs to refer to variables in the local context of its " parent " instance of procedure A .
This is precisely what the upvar core command does , but the absolute target level needs to be embedded into the script that performs the delayed call to procedure B ( upvar is more often used with relative levels ) .
proc A { k x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 } {
expr { $k < = 0 ? [ eval $ x4 ] + [ eval $ x5 ] : [ B \# [ info level ] ] }
}
proc B { level } {
upvar $ level k k x1 x1 x2 x2 x3 x3 x4 x4
incr k - 1
A $k [ info level 0 ] $ x1 $ x2 $ x3 $ x4
}
proc C { val } { return $ val }
interp recursionlimit { } 1157
A 10 { C 1 } { C - 1 } { C - 1 } { C 1 } { C 0 }
The [ info level 0 ] here is a sort of " self " idiom ; it returns the command ( with arguments ) that called the current procedure .
Since the values of x1 through x4 are never modified , it is also possible to embed these as parameters of B , thereby slightly purifying the program :
proc AP { k x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 } { expr { $k < = 0 ? [ eval $ x4 ] + [ eval $ x5 ] : [ BP \# [ info level ] $ x1 $ x2 $ x3 $ x4 ] } }
proc BP { level x1 x2 x3 x4 } { AP [ uplevel $ level { incr k - 1 } ] [ info level 0 ] $ x1 $ x2 $ x3 $ x4 }
proc C { val } { return $ val }
interp recursionlimit { } 1157
AP 10 { C 1 } { C - 1 } { C - 1 } { C 1 } { C 0 }
SQL is kinda limited , and TSQL is not much better .
Unfortunately it fails the Man test due to Stack Level being limited to 32 .

The goal in this solution is to emulate the Algol 60 solution as closely as possible , and not merely get the correct result .
For that , we could just crib the Common Lisp or Scheme solution , with more succinct syntax , like this :
( defun A ( k x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 )
( labels ( ( B ()
( dec k )
[ A k B x1 x2 x3 x4 ] ) )
( if ( < = k 0 ) ( + [ x4 ] [ x5 ] ) ( B ) ) ) )
( prinl ( A 10 ( ret 1 ) ( ret - 1 ) ( ret - 1 ) ( ret 1 ) ( ret 0 ) ) )
To do a proper job , we define a call - by - name system as a set of functions and macros .
With these , the function A can be defined as a close transliteration of the Algol , as can the call to A with the integer constants :
( defun-cbn A ( k x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 )
( let ( ( k k ) )
( labels -cbn ( B ()
( dec k )
( set B ( set A ( A k ( B ) x1 x2 x3 x4 ) ) ) )
( if ( <= k 0 )
( set A (+ x4 x5 ) )
( B ) ) ) ) ) ;; value of ( B ) correctly discarded here !
( prinl ( A 10 1 - 1 - 1 1 0 ) )
We define the global function with defun-cbn ( " cbn " stands for " call by name " ) and the inner function with labels - cbn .
These functions are actually macros which call hidden call - by - value functions .
The macros create all the necessary thunks out of their argument expressions , and the hidden functions use local macros to provide transparent access to their arguments from their bodies .
Even the fact that a return value is established by an assignment to the function name is simulated .
Note that in A and B , we must assign to the variables A and B respectively to establish the return value .
This in turn allows the faithful rendition of the detail in the original that the if form discards the value of the call to B .
Establishing a return value by assignment , as in Algol , is achieved thanks to the Lisp - 2 base of TXR Lisp ; we can simultaneously bind a symbol to a function and variable in the same scope .
Also , k is treated as a call - by - name argument also , and is explicitly subject to a rebinding inside A , as is apparently the case in the Algol code .
This detail is necessary ; if we do not rebind k , then it is a by - name reference to the caller 's k , which is a by - name reference to its caller 's k and so on .
Call - by - name is achieved by representing arguments as structure objects that hold get / set lambdas , serving as access thunks , hidden behind macros .
These thunks allow two - way access : the passed values can be stored , not only accessed .
This creates a problem when the actual arguments are constants or function calls ; that is solved .
Constants are recognized and re-bound to hidden variables , which are passed in their place .
Function calls are passed as thunks configured to reject store attempts with a run-time error .
The complete code follows :
( defstruct ( cbn - thunk get set ) nil get set )
( defmacro make - cbn-val ( place )
( with - gensyms ( nv tmp )
( cond
( ( constantp place )
^( let ( ( , tmp , place ) )
( new cbn -thunk
get ( lambda ( ) , tmp )
set ( lambda ( , nv ) ( set , tmp , nv ) ) ) ) )
( ( bindable place )
^( new cbn -thunk
get ( lambda ( ) , place )
set ( lambda ( , nv ) ( set , place , nv ) ) ) )
(t
^( new cbn -thunk
get ( lambda ( ) , place )
set ( lambda ( ign ) ( error " cannot set ~s " ' , place ) ) ) ) ) ) )
( defun cbn-val ( cbs )
( call cbs.get ) )
( defun set - cbn-val ( cbs nv )
( call cbs.set nv ) )
( defplace ( cbn-val thunk ) body
( getter setter

Visual Prolog ( like any other Prolog ) does not allow variables to be changed .
But behavior can easily be mimicked by using a varM ( modifiable variable ) , which is actually an object containing a value of the relevant type in a modifiable entity ( a so called fact variable ) .
Secondly , anonymous function ( lambda - expression ) cannot be recursive , but this is mimicked by using yet a varM to hold the function .
( Token coloring of Visual Prolog in this wiki is unfortunately wrong , because styles are used across languages .
A correctly colored version can be seen in Man or boy test in the Visual Prolog wiki ) .

Adapted from the Lua example .
In vorpal , all execution is a message to an object .
This task primarily involves functions , so we have the apply the function objects to self for them to execute .
Correctly , prints - 67 .
self .a = method(k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) {
b = method ( ) {
code.k = code.k - 1
return ( self .a( code.k , code , code.x1 , code.x2 , code.x3 , code.x4 ) )
}
b.k = k
b.x1 = x1
b.x2 = x2
b.x3 = x3
b.x4 = x4
b.x5 = x5
if (k <= 0 ) {
return ( self.apply ( x4 ) + self.apply ( x5 ) )
}
else {
return ( self.apply ( b ) )
}
}
self .K = method (n ) {
f = method ( ) {
return ( code .n)

f.n = n
return ( f )

In Wren , a fiber 's stack starts quite small but is then increased as needed , apparently limited only by available memory .
Anyway , satisfying the test for k up to 20 is unlikely to be a problem on a modern machine .
import " / fmt " for Fmt
var a
a = Fn . new { | k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 |
var b
b = Fn . new {
k = k - 1
System . write ( " " ) // guards against a VM recursion bug
return a . call ( k , b , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 )
}
return ( k <= 0 ) ? x4 . call ( ) + x5 . call ( ) : b . call ( )
}
System .
print ( " k a " )
for ( k in 0 .. 20 ) {
Fmt .
print ( " $ 2d : $ d " , k , a .
call ( k , Fn . new { 1 } , Fn . new { - 1 } , Fn . new { - 1 } , Fn . new { 1 } , Fn . new { 0 } ) )
}
Output :
k a 0 : 1 1 : 0 2 : - 2 3 : 0 4 : 1 5 : 0 6 : 1 7 : - 1 8 : - 10 9 : - 30 10 : - 67 11 : - 138 12 : - 291 13 : - 642 14 : - 1446 15 : -3250 16 : - 7244 17 : - 16065 18 : -35601 19 : - 78985 20 : - 175416
The compiler is OK but the VM is a girlie - man VM .
Due to the way closures are built , the stack blows quickly when closures recurse .
So , while the code can be written per Knuth , it is unable to do anything .
So , classes are used to simulate the closures .
Also ( 5 ) ( ) --> 5 so no problems there .
fcn A(k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) { // -->1,0,-2,0,1,0,1,-1,-10,-30,-67,-138
B:=CB(k , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) ;
if (k <= 0 ) x4 ( )+x5 ( ) else B.B( ) ;
}
foreach k in ( 12 ) {
println ( " k=%2d A= %d " .
fmt(k , A(k , 1 , - 1 , - 1 , 1 , 0 ) ) )

I spend most of my programming time writing tools for other programmers .
My business ( Onyx Neon Press ) has a modest amount of code to produce books , but a fair amount of the code in our production process is Pod : : Simple and Pod : : PseudoPod -- tools for other programmers .
Most of my work on Parrot and Perl 6 is infrastructure for other programmers to use too .
I suspect -- but can't prove sufficiently -- that many of the most popular and most widely used projects on the CPAN are likewise tools for programmers .
Moose is a tool for programmers .
So are Catalyst , Scalar : : Util , Method : : Signatures , Devel : : NYTProf , and perl5i .
That 's not a bad thing .
I 'm not complaining .
It 's an observation .
Perhaps CPAN is a tool primarily for developers .
That 's fine too .
Even so , I wonder where are all of the wonderful applications
Perl programmers can mention when people outside the Perl community ask " What 's it good for ?
What can it do for me ? "
I 'm happy to talk about Padre and BioPerl or Movable Type and Melody .
Frozen Bubble is a good story ( especially with SDL Perl under fresh development again -- see Kartik Thakore 's journal for more SDL Perl details ) .
dotReader did n't get much attention , but it's an impressive project .
BBC iPlayer is just on the edge of projects to mention .
I 'm not sure bragging about websites implemented in Perl 5 is useful or interesting .
For the most part , that 's immaterial .
A web site is a web site is a web site .
Maybe Perl 5 does n't need this .
Java does pretty well with its comfortable niche in enterprisey web development , Eclipse ( a programmer tool for writing programmer tools , remember ) , and LimeWire .
Python gets a boost from the original Bittorrent code ( Mercurial is a developer tool , as is embedded Python for game developers and 3D modeling programs ) .
Ruby ... well , there 's Rails .
Sometimes I read Planet Gnome and Planet KDE and marvel at all of the nice projects that non-developer end - users can use .
I see some of these applications developed in Vala and JavaScript ( yes , a developer tool -- but one used to write a web browser , a mail client , a music player , et cetera ) and even sometimes Python .
I know I 've used Perl 5 for system administration , web development , workflow automation , games , visualization , and more .
Maybe I 'm a very unrepresentative user , and that 's fine .
Maybe I do n't have the mindset to create software for non-developer users and that 's probably fine too .
Even so , sometimes I wonder if the Perl community spends so much time obviously and obsessively focused on the needs of other developers that we might neglect some easy and obvious problems where Perl can be part of a great solution .
... not that such users will use Perl directly , but that expanding our area of influence may be a very good idea .
LONDON : An 11 - year - old schoolgirl in Bulgaria is said to have probably become the world 's youngest mother after she gave birth to a baby on her wedding day .
According to British tabloid the ' News of the World ' , Kordeza , who is barely old enough to start her senior school , went into labour during her marriage to her teenage boyfriend Jeliazko Zhelyazkova .
In fact , she was wearing her flowing white dress and tiara when she arrived at hospital and gave birth to Violeta .
But after spending the night with her newborn , Kordeza changed back into her wedding dress and nipped out to finish ceremony .
" I'm not going to play with toys any more , I have a new toy now , " the 11 - year - old bride , who fell pregnant within two weeks of her 11th birthday , was quoted as saying .
And the Zhelyazkova family could n't be happier for their child bride , the youngest girl ever to give birth in a city where 13 - year - old mums are routine , the report said .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
Are cash - strapped American consumers on for another date with energy price misery ?
The U.S. economy remains weak and one in six Americans can't find enough work .
Yet oil prices have risen steadily this year .
A barrel of crude costs $ 79 and change , more than double its price at the end of 2008 .
This year 's runup pales in comparison to the one that peaked last summer above $ 145 a barrel .
Even so , some researchers warn we could once again be approaching the point at which rising energy costs will squeeze consumers .
That could complicate recovery in an economy that , despite the tumult of the past two years , remains as consumer - driven as ever .
" If you had to ask me what is the safe driving speed , I 'd say $ 80 a barrel , " said Steven Kopits , managing director at energy market forecaster Douglas - Westwood in New York .
" We have bigger problems right now , but we should n't forget we 're still vulnerable to rising oil prices . "
After last July 's march to triple - digit crude , the recent increases look fairly tame .
The price of a gallon of gas is $ 2.63 a gallon , according to the latest AAA survey .
That 's well below the 2008 peak of $ 4.11 -- but up 25 % from a year ago and 63 % above last December 's low .
What 's more , the factors behind this spike seem apt to persist for some time .
They include a pickup in global economic activity fueled by massive government spending , a decline in the purchasing power of the dollar as the U.S. holds interest rates near zero , and lack of new oil supplies coming online to meet future demand .
While those trends hardly ensure rising fuel prices , they seem to have been doing their part so far , putting gasoline within striking distance of $ 3 a gallon .
That 's a price that could strain consumers whose spending accounts for two - thirds of economic activity .
" Any time it gets above $ 3 , it 's worth watching , " said James D. Hamilton , an economics professor at the University of California at San Diego .
" When you get to that level , you start to see a change in behavior as budgets get squeezed . "
Hamilton said the $ 3 - a - gallon price is noteworthy because it's around the level at which consumers are devoting 6 % of their budgets to energy costs .
Hitting that point in recent years seems to have prompted Americans to pull back .
Hamilton notes that Americans largely shook off the sharp runup in energy prices earlier this decade , as energy spending remained in the 5 % range and homeowners were able to tap home equity lines of credit .
But that window closed when house prices stopped rising and loss - soaked banks started cutting credit .
And though it 's futile to single out any one trigger for the recession that started at the end of 2007 , the downturn did n't start in earnest until consumers ' energy budgets breached the 6 % mark in November that year .
As energy prices soared and incomes came under pressure , Americans first stopped buying pickup trucks and then deserted the local car dealer altogether .
Car sales plunged in the spring of 2008 before falling off a cliff with the collapse of Lehman Brothers that September .
" The price of oil played a bigger factor in the recession than people seem to be remembering , " Hamilton said .
None of this is to say a further rise in energy prices would necessarily send the economy into a tailspin .
While consumers are still strapped , behavior changes should make the economy less vulnerable .
U.S. oil consumption has slid 9 % since 2007 , Kopits notes .
Americans also drove 3 % fewer miles in the latest year through August than they did two years earlier , according to data from the Transportation Department .
Hamilton points out that car sales reverted to depressed levels after the government 's Cash for Clunkers promotion ended in August .
Hillard G. Huntington , executive director at the Energy Modeling Forum at Stanford University , said that while oil markets remain exposed to a possible supply disruption , he believes the memory of last year 's record prices is fresh enough that another oil shock is unlikely .
" I can see a situation down the road where maybe we should worry , but I do n't think we 're there yet , " said Huntington .
" You see the most serious effects when the economy is already experiencing inflation . "
But Kopits warns that every recession since 1972 has been associated with an oil price surge that took U.S. oil consumption past 4 % of gross domestic product .
Today , he said , the magic number to get there is $ 80 .
" The historical record says that when prices went up , the U.S. went into recession fast , " he said .
JENIN , West Bank —
If you drive north from the Kfar Tapuach settlement up Route 60 , the main , Israeli - built and heavily fortified artery of the West Bank , you eventually reach the Palestinian town of Jenin .
It was here , in April 2002 , that Zakaria Zubeidi helped lead the brutal fight against the Israeli army in the storied battle of the Jenin refugee camp .
During eight days , 23 Israeli soldiers and up to 56 Palestinians , including some civilians , died .
Zubeidi survived .
He escaped capture and spent the next five years on the run and avoiding purported Israeli attempts to assassinate him .
In 2007 , he and all members of his militia , the Al - Aqsa Martyrs ’ Brigade , were granted amnesty by the Israeli government and Zubeidi committed himself to working for peace .
But in recent months , Zubeidi , 33 , has begun to lose faith .
He knows what militant settlers and die - hard followers of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane want to do to the Palestinians and he has said he has seen the upturn in settler violence that Israel ’s leaders have described .
“ The next war is with the settlers , ” Zubeidi said , sitting in a room at the Freedom Theater in Jenin , an organization that aims to promote reconciliation and non-violence among Palestinian youth .
“ I feel it will be very soon .
I would not give it more than a year . ”
Zubeidi ’s body bears the mark of his battles with Israel during the second intifada .
His face and eyes are permanently marked with the dark blast of an explosive , giving him the look of a amateurishly tattooed Maori warrior .
A bomb blew up in his face as he was putting it together .
Since the explosion he has found it hard to see during the daytime .
He ’s been shot 11 times and escaped several Israeli assassination attempts .
He has the necessary experience to pose a serious threat to the settlers .
“ I am sitting before you accused of 21 operations against settlers , ” he said .
The Israeli government blames him for numerous shootings and suicide bombings against settlers , soldiers and civilians inside Israel .
Zubeidi has noticed the increase in settler radicalism and violence in the past two or three years .
“ The more you have those radical cells the more you create radical cells on the Palestinian side , ” he said .
“ I look at all the world and how it is fighting Islamic radicalism .
Why are they not fighting Jewish radicalism ?
This is the most dangerous phenomenon in the Middle East — the settlers . ”
I asked Zubeidi if he and Jenin ’s other militants were making specific preparations for war with the settlers .
The Palestinian Authority president , Mahmoud Abbas , has more or less disarmed the militias that fought Israel in the second Intifada , so Zubeidi and his comrades may find it harder to obtain weapons if a new conflict in the West Bank erupts .
“ Of course we are preparing , ” he said .
“ It will be dependent on individuals — to bomb themselves [ as suicide bombers ] .
And some small guns .
If the guns are not available and explosives are not available we have experience using stones , ” he added , referring to the legendary clashes of the first and second intifadas between stone - throwing Palestinian youths and the heavily armed Israeli Defense Forces .
He pointed out that it was mainly with the tireless throwing of stones in the first intifada that Israel agreed to the establishment of the first autonomous Palestinian areas and the government of the Palestinian Authority .
But he also recalled that the guns used in the second intifada were not immediately available to the Palestinian fighters .
Things could change quickly if a full - scale war with the settlers erupts .
“ I do n’t fight in the shadows , ” Zubeidi said .
“ I am in the right .
They are taking my freedom .
They are oppressing me .
They are taking our land .
Why should I fight in the shadows ?
We , the Palestinian people , are fighting for our freedom . ”
On the evening of Jan. 19 , exactly two weeks after Zubeidi predicted a renewed war between Palestinians and settlers in the West Bank , a 34 - year - old settler named Moshe Avitan was driving with his wife Sarah from their home in the settlement of Shvut Rachel — by chance , the same community that is home to American - born Jack Teitel , who was recently charged with 14 acts of terrorism , including murder — to a meeting in another settlement named Kochav Hashahar .
It was dark on the West Bank roads , which are shared by both Palestinian and Israeli vehicles ( although the Israeli government and military can keep Palestinian cars off the roads at a moment ’s notice ) .
At four minutes to nine , Sarah ’s mother called her on her cellphone .
At that moment the car behind them accelerated and veered around them on the road .
“ A few minutes before we arrived a car overtook us and started shooting at us , ” Sarah told me a few days later .
We were sitting in a waiting area in Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital , just outside Jerusalem .
“ I ’ve been shot , I ’ve been hurt , ” Moshe cried out .
Even though he could n’t see and blood was pouring out of his nose and out of a bullet hole in his cheekbone just below his left eye he managed to stop the car on the deserted road .
The attackers drove on .
“ Moshe ’s been shot , ” Sarah shouted into the phone to her mother .
Sarah jumped out of the car and ran round to Moshe ’s side and asked him if he could lift himself over the gear shift and the handbrake into the passenger side .
Still conscious , he dragged himself across the front seat .
There was blood everywhere , “ streaming out of his nose . ”
Sarah got into the driver ’s seat and managed to dial emergency and put the paramedic on speakerphone .
She began to drive the short distance toward Kochav Hashahar .
“ Is he conscious ? ” the paramedic asked .
“ I am , I ’m conscious .
I ca n’t see , ” Moshe replied .
“ Press a cloth to the wound and see if he has any more , ” the paramedic told Sarah .
When she arrived at Kochav Hashahar Sarah was able to check Moshe ’s body and found no other bullet holes .
As instructed by the paramedic , she turned her husband ’s head sideways .
She took off one of the two shirts she was wearing and used it to staunch the bleeding until the ambulance arrived .
As we spoke , family members kept arriving at the hospital , thanking Sarah for saving Moshe ’s life .
“ He kept me alive because he got the shot , ” she said .
The couple have five children , all girls .
They have been married for 14 years and have lived in Shvut Rachel all that time .
She was born in England and teaches English in a junior high school in the settlement of Ariel .
He is a building contractor .
Shvut Rachel is itself named after a settler , Rachela Druk , who was shot dead on a road in the West Bank in 1991 .
The community was established on the night of Druk ’s funeral .
Moshe will live .
His brain was not damaged by the bullet .
He was in the oral and maxillofacial surgery unit when I visited and he still could not see .
Sarah and Moshe know they live in a dangerous place , but she pointed out that all of Israel can be dangerous , especially as Hamas ’s rockets gain greater reach inside the country .
There was not a trace of regret in her words about their decision to live in the West Bank .
“ The settlers are getting more radical and more extreme because the Arabs are getting more radical and extreme , ” she said .
“ There ’s no two ways about it .
It ’s a vicious circle .
They do n’t want us .
But it ’s our land .
We have no choice — we have to fight for it . ”
The shooting of Moshe Avitan was barely noticed in a country that was coming out of its war with Hamas in Gaza and elections , which were approaching in February and which would bring Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , a strong supporter of the settlement movement , back into power .
But the fault lines of violence between the Palestinians and settlers in the West Bank could already be seen on the inside pages of Israeli newspapers — small stories no one paid much heed to .
On Jan. 13 , as Israeli troops were battling Hamas in the streets of Gaza , Israeli media reported that a settler had shot dead a 16 - year - old Palestinian boy who had been throwing stones at the settler ’s car .
( The boy turned out to have died from some kind of trauma to the head .
The settler was not charged and the family , whom I visited as they mourned their son , was furious and still blamed the settler ) .
On Jan. 16 , there were protests in various parts of the West Bank over the ongoing war in Gaza .
One Israeli soldier was lightly injured and a 17 - year - old Palestinian boy was shot dead .
The shooting of Avitan , on Jan. 19 , may have been in revenge for these incidents and the war in Gaza .
A previously unknown group calling itself Al - Basha ’er Army told a Palestinian news agency that it was responsible for the shooting .
Each of the previous two intifadas were sparked by incidents that did not seem especially portentous at the time but unleashed years of bloodshed .
In 1987 , a traffic accident that killed four Palestinians led to seven years of violent clashes that came to be known as the intifada .
On Sept. 28 , 2000 , I got up early one morning to cover then - opposition leader Ariel Sharon ’s visit to the Temple Mount , a massively contested holy site in Jerusalem , which the Palestinians call Al Haram al Sharif .
Sharon ’s visit was a provocative event in the eyes of Palestinians , to be sure , but not an act that many people believed would cause a renewed war between Israel and the Palestinians far more bloody than the first intifada .
What both intifadas had in common was the long build - up of an unbearable tension between the Palestinians and Israel .
The sparks could have come from anywhere .
As they could again now .

InformaticaEasy.net vola a Milano per la presentazione in anteprima del Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 , smartphone di fascia alta al debutto nel 2010 .
Di seguito , video relativi a : presentazione , intervista esclusiva rilasciata dal Marketing Director ad InformaticaEasy e rapida prova sul campo .
Lo scorso mercoled ì ho avuto la preziosa opportunità di prendere parte ad un importante incontro con Sony Ericsson .
Oggetto del meeting , il nuovo Xperia X10 ed il relativo mondo di Android .
Appuntamento alle 18.00 , nell ' imponente quanto elegante e moderna sede italiana di Sony Ericsson , immersa in Piazza Affari e a due passi dal Duomo .
Una targhetta in Via delle Poste n°10 mi segnala l'ingresso della Sede ...
Difficile dimenticare i moderni uffici di Sony Ericsson : si respira un'aria fresca e dinamica , ricca di novità .
Lungo corridoi arredati con preziose suppellettili ( terminali Xperia - ed altri- con la funzione di eleganti oggetti di arredamento ) tutto è in fervore per gli ultimi preparativi relativi alla conferenza .
Dal momento dell ' arrivo , il tempo vola in fretta .
Pochi minuti di attesa ed io nonchè ad altri delegati di siti di informatica , giornalisti e sviluppatori Android , veniamo accolti nella sala conferenze .
Ad accoglierci i maggiori esponenti italiani di Sony Ericsson , tra cui Orazio Corva ( Product Marketing Manager ) e Maurizio De Palma ( Marketing Director ) .
Si inizia con le presentazioni , cui segue la consegna di simpatici gadget nonchè una pendrive Sony Ericsson contenente il materiale relativo alla conferenza ( parte del quale è stato riportato di seguito ) .
E' Orazio Corva ad intrattenere i presenti illustrando il nuovo ambizioso progetto di Sony Ericsson , già ampiamente avviato e quasi giunto al suo stadio finale : parliamo di Xperia X10 .
Ma cosa è in realtà Xperia X10 ?
Si tratta della nuovissima versione della serie Xperia dell ' Azienda ; parliamo di uno smartphone di nuova concezione che vedrà la luce sul mercato nei primissimi mesi del prossimo anno e che integrerà il sistema operativo Google Android , con un'interfaccia grafica utente ritoccata da Sony Ericsson per renderla più funzionale e più gradevole esteticamente .
Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 presenta all 'end - user un mondo aperto e integrato tra social media , comunicazione e intrattenimento , cercando di fondere questi aspetti in un unico prodotto facile da usare , da aggiornare e da espandere con moduli software e programmi aggiuntivi .
Tutto ciò contando su un hardware integrato di altissima qualità .
Xperia X10 è , in realtà , il fiore all ’occhiello di una famiglia di telefoni cellulari che arriverà sul mercato durante la prima metà del 2010 .
Mentre tale smartphone sarà disponibile a partire dal primo quadrimestre del 2010 , il Dott .
Corva ha rivelato inoltre che altri due prodotti , anch'essi Android - based , verranno rilasciati nella prima metà del prossimo anno .
Seguiranno altri due smartphone basati su Symbian S60 OS .
Il Product Marketing Manager assicura però che X10 sarà il modello di punta a tutti gli effetti e la maggiore driving force per Sony Ericsson nel 2010 , che intende rinnovarsi e rendersi maggiormente competitiva , soprattutto in Italia , nei confronti di altre aziende come Nokia che , attualmente , attirano maggiormente gli utenti .
E' proprio questa l'idea che l'X10 vuole trasmettere : rinnovamento ed integrazione dei servizi multimediali e di comunicazione online attualmente disponibili .
In più , fornendo valore aggiunto rendendo disponibili nuove applicazioni per espandere le funzionalità del terminale .
A proposito di applicazioni , Sony Ericsson ha voluto sottolineare la sua intenzione di coinvolgere quanto più possibile gli sviluppatori affinchè essi possano esprimere liberamente la propria creatività nell ' ideare nuovi software che verranno resi disponibili su uno Store dedicato .
In quest ' ottica , il Create Now Tour di Sony Ericsson è stato creato proprio per coinvolgere in maniera diretta ed a livello internazionale gli sviluppatori , offrendo loro la possibilità di lavorare su diverse piattaforme .
La nuova piattaforma UX ( user experience ) di Sony Ericsson consente agli utenti di organizzare tutto e scoprire ancora di più grazie ad una esperienza d’uso più aperta , umana ed intuitiva .
La piattaforma UX è costruita sul sistema operativo aperto Android e crea una straordinaria Sony Ericsson user experience combinando eccellenti funzionalità dedicate all ’intrattenimento con applicazioni personali , una elevatissma integrazione di servizi di social media e una ricca interfaccia grafica .
Xperia X10 è il primo cellulare ad umanizzare davvero il modo in cui le persone interagiscono con i propri telefoni .
Grazie all ’introduzione di applicazioni personali come Mediascape e Timescape , Xperia X10 consente agli utenti di organizzare ogni cosa nel proprio telefono in un modo davvero intuitivo Sony Ericsson Timescape gestisce tutta la tua comunicazione ( via Facebook , Twitter , foto , e-mail , SMS , ... ) con una persona in un unico posto .
Sony Ericsson Mediascape , invece , rappresentaun nuovo modo intelligente per avere tutta la musica , le foto e i video di amici ed artisti in maniera semplice e veloce , accedendo a tali contenuti ovunque essi siano ( dal telefonino a YouTube , PlayNow , ecc ... ) .
Le capacità “ intelligenti ” , integrate in Mediascape e Timescape , possono automaticamente riconoscere connessioni tra contatti , contenuti e media .
Suggerendo modalità alternative per comunicare o guidando verso nuove esperienze media , gli utenti possono scoprire sempre di più in modo veramente aperto .
Per esempio , premendo il nuovo tasto “ Infinite Button ” si entra in un mondo connesso , che aggrega tutte le interazioni con la stessa persona in un unico posto .
Molto interessante la funzionalità correlata di “ Intelligent face recognition ” che riconosce fino a cinque volti nelle foto e automaticamente li connette al tuo social phonebook e a tutte le altre comunicazioni con quella persona .
L’approccio aperto di Sony Ericsson offre agli utenti la massima scelta e con Xperia X10 è possibile scaricare qualsiasi applicazione si desideri direttamente da un’ampia varietà di store inclusi PlayNow e Android Market .
Basta parole , ora .
Stavolta InformaticaEasy fa un passo avanti e vi propone ben due video relativi all 'evento organizzato da Sony Ericsson .
Munito di videocamera , stavolta ho deciso di offrirvi , in primo luogo , un video " elaborato " relativo ad una panoramica della presentazione di Orazio Corva , in cui troverete tante indiscrezioni ed anticipazioni relative all ' X10 ( visionatelo in HD ! ) .
Appena terminata la visione del video che riporto di seguito , continuate a scorrere la pagina in basso e....
... potrete visionare un'esclusiva intervista rilasciata dal Dott .
Corva per gli utenti InformaticaEasy.net , durante la quale il Product Marketing Manager spiega le principali funzionalità ed innovazioni del prodotto tramite una prova " dal vivo " .
A tale intervista segue , sempre nel medesimo video , una rapidissima prova sul campo eseguita da me , durante cui vi mostro essenzialmente la velocità del sistema operativo ( che ricordo essere ancora in fase di beta e quindi da migliorare , ma comunque sensibilmente più reattivo rispetto alle prime versioni ) .
Vi consiglio , anche per questo video , di cliccare sul pulsante in basso a destra HD per visionarlo in alta definizione .
Ne volete ancora ?
Eccovi , in conclusione , un folto elenco relativo alle principali caratteristiche tecniche del dispositivo .
Da notare la potenza dell ' hardware che integra ( ad esempio , un chipset da ben 1GHz ... ) .
Non preoccupatevi , tanta potenza non dovrebbe far scaricare la batteria in maniera istantanea .
Sebbene verso il termine dell ' incontro uno dei due sample ( il White ) si sia scaricato , veniamo rassicurati da Sony Ericcson con un " non preoccupatevi , l'ultima volta che è stato caricato risale a due giorni fa " .
Inoltre , Orazio Corva parla di un terminale << focalizzato sul risparmio energetico >>.
Forse superfluo rendervi nota la mia intenzione di voler recensire al più presto questo terminale : da Sony Ericsson mi fanno sapere che sarà possibile già a partire da Gennaio 2010 .
Xperia X10 vedrà invece la luce nei negozi verso Febbraio / Marzo , ad un prezzo di lancio oscillante tra i 499 € ed i 549 € .
Tale prezzo dovrebbe subire dei tagli a partire da qualche mese dopo l'uscita .
Concludo ringraziando , in particolar modo , il gentilissimo Dott .
Orazio Corva e la simpatica Roberta Recchia di Burson - Marsteller ( PR per Sony Ericsson italia ) .
Will : ‘ A bit of dithering might have been in order before we went into Iraq ’
The Bush administration spent only one hour on a report on Afghanistan before handing the issue over to the incoming Obama administration , a former Clinton - era White House chief of staff says .
John Podesta , now president of the Center for American Progress , made the comments during a discussion on ABC’s This Week about former Vice President Dick Cheney ’s recent criticism of the White House for “ dithering ” over a decision to send more troops to Afghanistan .

Podesta painted a picture of a hypocritical Bush administration that itself “ dithered ” over Afghanistan decisions , and — according to Podesta — spent only one hour preparing a report for the handover of the Afghanistan issue to the Obama administration .
“ I think that the deliberation that ’s going on is actually exemplary , ” Podesta told the roundtable discussion .
“ It seems that the Bush administration for eight months did sit on Gen . [ David ] McKiernan ’s request for more troops . ”
Podesta was echoing a claim made by White House Press Secretary Richard Gibbs on Thursday .
“ It ’s pretty safe to say the vice president was for seven years not focused on Afghanistan , even more curious given the fact that an increase in troops requests sat on desks in this White House – including the vice president ’s – for more than eight months , ” Gibbs said .
“ I never heard Vice President Cheney assaulting President Bush for not acting on those requests at that time , ” Podesta said .
“ And they did present him with a report at the very end of the Bush administration , but I have it on good authority that the Bush administration spent one hour on that report before they handed it off to Obama . ”
In his recent remarks to the Center for Security Policy , former Vice President Dick Cheney implied that the Bush Administration was responsible for President Barack Obama ’s strategy in Afghanistan .

In the fall of 2008 , fully aware of the need to meet new challenges being posed by the Taliban , we dug into every aspect of Afghanistan policy , assembling a team that repeatedly went into the country , reviewing options and recommendations , and briefing President - elect Obama ’s team .
They asked us not to announce our findings publicly , and we agreed , giving them the benefit of our work and the benefit of the doubt .
Now they seem to be pulling back and blaming others for their failure to implement the strategy they embraced .
It ’s time for President Obama to do what it takes to win a war he has repeatedly and rightly called a war of necessity .
But Podesta ’s allegation , if true , could cast a shadow on Republicans ’ long - running claim that they are the party better suited to fight terrorism and foreign wars .
The notion that developing a proper strategy for Afghanistan requires long and careful deliberation was supported by conservative columnist George F. Will , who several months ago announced his support for a withdrawal of troops from Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ A bit of dithering might have been in order before we went into Iraq in pursuit of nonexistent weapons of mass destruction , ” Will said .
“ For a representative of the Bush administration to accuse someone of taking too much time is missing the point .
We have much more to fear in this town from hasty than from slow government action . ”

WASHINGTON  President Obama suggested Monday that he was not comfortable with abortion restrictions inserted into the House version of major health care legislation , and he prodded Congress to revise them .
“ There needs to be some more work before we get to the point where we ’re not changing the status quo ” on abortion , Mr. Obama said in an interview with ABC News .
“ And that ’s the goal . ”
On the one hand , Mr. Obama said , “ we ’re not looking to change what is the principle that has been in place for a very long time , which is federal dollars are not used to subsidize abortions . ”
On the other hand , he said , he wanted to make sure “ we ’re not restricting women ’s insurance choices , ” because he had promised that “ if you ’re happy and satisfied with the insurance that you have , it ’s not going to change . ”
I ’ve been hearing an interesting argument about consoles lately .
Namely , “ do n’t buy that one , it has a ton of awful games . ”
Ignoring the fact that I ’ve heard this argument applied to all three consoles , based on the gaming preferences of the person making the argument , this is still the worst argument for not buying a console I ’ve ever heard .
I do n’t care how many awful games any given system has .
I wo n’t be buying or playing any of them .
What I care about is how many quality games a system has .
I care about how many games I ’ll be able to buy , play , and enjoy .
Seriously , just think for a minute … would you rather buy a system with 100 awesome games and 1000 awful games , or a system with 20 good games and 5 awful games ?
For me , the choice is simple .
I ’d rather buy the system with 100 awesome games , because that ’s what I ’ll be playing .
Then , if I ever run out of awesome games to pick up , I might dip into the swelling bargin bin of mediocre and awful titles in case there ’s something that might be worth the 5 to 10 dollars , even if it was n’t worth 40 to 60 .
Admittedly , if there are a lot of terrible games for a system , it makes finding the good stuff harder , but with the advent of the internet , this is n’t something that has to be a huge chore .
Just go to your favorite review site , pick your favorite genre , click scores eight and up , and read through the list .
Then look into the games that catch your interest a little more and pick a couple to buy .
Alternatively , ask friends .
Ask store clerks , though take what they say with a grain of salt .
Ask around on internet forums .
You ’ll sort the good from the bad pretty quickly .
On a related note , I do n’t care about good games I ’m not interested in playing either .
This is n’t entirely true , but it ’s a general rule of thumb .
For instance , I do n’t generally like first person shooters .
Trying to convince me to buy a system because of all the awesome shooters it has on it is futile .
Sure , I might try one once in awhile , and even enjoy it sometimes , but I ’m not going to look at them when making my decision on a new piece of gaming hardware .
I ’m going to look at the genres I enjoy .
Once again , that ’s what I ’ll be buying , and I do n’t care about what I ’m not buying or playing .
Basically , there ’s no point in pointing out the bad stuff that will never matter , or the good stuff that will never matter .
If you want to convince someone to choose a particular console , or better yet , help them choose the console best for them , you need to tell them things that matter to them .
Which games are good ?
Which games are good in genres that particular gamer likes ?
Is HD important , or do they really care that much ?
What about graphics in general ?
Technical or aesthetic ?
Sound quality ?
Just games , or complete multimedia center ?
And these things will be different for different people .
That ’s why different consoles all manage to thrive , aside from some having different exclusive games than others .
They all focus on different areas , and cater to different wants .
And knowing what you want from a console , and which console best delivers on that want , is the best way to figure out which one will be right for you .
IronRuby has posed a significant challenge for the Microsoft team .
Ruby is defined primarily by its premiere interpreter Ruby MRI , also known as CRuby .
The ongoing RubySpec project intends to document it , but they are a long way from completion .
Most teams trying to implementation a Ruby compiler simply look at the CRuby source code , but this is n’t an option for Microsoft .
CRuby is licensed under the GPL , which Microsoft is afraid of for numerous legal reasons .
This means they have to reverse engineer it , a daunting feat .
Back in March of 2009 , IronRuby was only passing 80 % of the documented Ruby Specs .
And even then it was running 4.5 times slower than CRuby with a startup time of 10 time slower .
By August , IronRuby had made tremendous advances .
It now passes 92.5 % of the specification tests and is running twice as fast as CRuby .
The startup time is also greatly improved due to the adaptive compiler .
A fully compatible version , labeled IronRuby 1.0 , is expected to be ready this fall .
never okay for a woman to hit a man , ” Brown says in the December issue of Vibe magazine .
“ I think domestic violence is not just men on women . ”
As previously reported , Chris Brown shares the ‘ Resurrection Issue ’ cover of Vibe with Grammy nominee Drake .
Beyond domestic violence , Brown addresses his conflict with BET over the BET Awards and just how he feels about Oprah not reaching out to him this year .
Vibe ’s ‘ Resurrection Issue ’ is on newsstands now .
Well , I ’d toyed around with the idea for quite a while , but when SSH when down for a few days at Dreamhost , I decided it was time to finally make the switch .
The easy part was moving off static sites and getting my personally hosted blog onto wordpress.com .
Then of course is the real challenge : a Haskell site .
First shot : compile on the server
Since NearlyFreeSpeech.net ( henceforce NFS ) claims support for GHC , I thought I ’d try out compiling on their servers .
My first issue was that they only have 6.8.3 , whereas some of my libraries require 6.10 .
I e-mailed them about this , and they let me know that their unstable server had it available .
Switching over was painless .
However , I had a few problems with this approach :
cabal - install would not link due to memory constraints .
I can manually install all the libraries I need , but that ’s a real pain .
All the files I ended up using used up 250 MB .
NFS charges per megabyte of storage , so I did n’t feel like wasting time .
As usual with shared hosting , compiling is slow .
It ’s not as horrible as Dreamhost , where they kill the compiles regularly , but still not as nice as using my shiny new system at home .
Upload binaries
So I can of course just compile my binaries locally and upload them , right ?
Well , I do n’t happen to run a FreeBSD box .
I ’ve been itching to try out VirtualBox for a while though , and this seemed like a good time to do it .
I know what you ’re thinking : I ’m a masochist , and this is overkill for this kind of project .
However , setting this up did n’t actually require too much work , and it ’s a much more durable solution than trying to compile binaries on some flaky shared host ( looking at you again Dreamhost ) .
Anyway , the process was very straightforward :
Download the FreeBSD 7.2 ISO ( NFS beta realm runs 7.2 ) .
Install VirtualBox locally .
Install FreeBSD .
It ’s not too complicated .
But make sure you set aside enough hard disk and RAM .
Update ports collection .
This was the worst part for me , since I ’ve never used FreeBSD before .
Also , I tried a selective update at first : bad idea .
Just update the whole thing .
Install ghc .
Basically , “ cd /usr / ports / lang / ghc && make install ” .
It takes a * long * time as it installs everything .
Compile the binaries inside FreeBSD .
I used git / ssh to transfer to projects over to the virtual machine , which was very convenient .
Upload binaries and call it a day .
Other notes
I have opted not to use NFS for my large static file hosting .
I ’m using the Amazon S3 service , which so far I ’ve found to be much faster than Dreamhost .
It ’s a little tricky to get started though .
I was able to sync all my photos using s3sync .
Also , do n’t forget to strip your binaries before uploading them , it can save a lot of time .
NFS only supports CGI .
This is fine for my purposes , but others may not be so happy with it .
Finally , NFS recently started charging $ 0.01 / day for dynamic sites .
It ’s only $ 3.65 a year , but if you ’re like me and like to have lots of different sites running , it might add up .
I ’ll probably just end up running services under the same domain name instead of separate subdomains .
Conclusion
Well , I wo n’t give my full stamp of approval on this yet , but so far I ’m impressed .
I ’ll try to post some follow - up on this in the future .

CAIRO  History has proved that there are two subjects that will move Egyptians to pour into the streets in riotous numbers , crashing windows , burning cars , battling one another and defying an army of club - wielding riot police officers .
One is the price of bread .
Another is soccer , as was proved again this week after Egypt ’s national team was defeated by its bitter rival Algeria , losing a berth in the World Cup tournament next year and sparking a riot outside the Algerian Embassy in Cairo late Thursday night .
But there was a pronounced difference between the bread riots of 1977 and 2008 and the soccer riot of Thursday night : the government quieted those earlier outbreaks by quickly lowering the price of bread , while this week it stoked outrage against Algeria .
Egypt had defeated Algeria 2 - 0 in Cairo on Saturday to set up Wednesday ’s climactic playoff in the Sudanese capital , Khartoum .
After Egypt lost the second match , the government withdrew its ambassador from Algiers and accused Algerians of menacing Egyptian fans after the game .
President Hosni Mubarak ’s eldest son , Alaa , a wealthy businessman , sounded as if he were calling his nation to war .
Editor ’s Note — This is the last in a four - part series [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] on the November 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai .
V. “ By the Grace of Allah ”

November 28 .
7:23 A.M. Nariman House .
To the thump of rotor blades from an MI - 17 helicopter , a line of NSG commandos readied to slither down a hanging rope to the roof of Nariman House .
Alert to their movement , the gunmen tried to get a shot off from the windows but were foiled by snipers ’ cover fire , which blasted what glass remained from the upper - floor windows .
Intercepts of their phone calls made in the middle of the night indicated that all of the hostages had been executed .
The gunmen had abandoned negotiation , so the only move left was a final assault on the building .
Again , the approach was top - down : assault from the roof and force the gunmen toward the exits where additional commandos were waiting .

Indian television crews were carrying everything live , and Imran ’s handlers in Pakistan were watching , reporting what they could see .
Handler : Fifteen men have climbed down on your rooftop right now .
Imran :
They are standing in front of the windows as well .
Handler :
What are you saying ?
Can you see anything there ?
Imran :
They are firing in the front .
For several heated minutes , the gunman and the handler debated a strategy to protect their position .
Another man abruptly took the phone .
Handler 2 : You do this .
Go towards the roof , throw a grenade at them ; and fire at them before they can fire at you .
Do this now , in the name of Allah .
Imran : Okay , we will go , remembering the name of Allah .
Handler 2 : Bismillah - e - Rehman - e - Rahim .

Noon .
Taj Hotel .
In the best of times , when the chandeliers sparkled over gala wedding parties soaked with champagne and music , the Taj ballroom pulsed with life .
In the dark , it was suffocating .
An hour earlier , Colonel Kandwal had uncovered the body of Major Unnikrishnan in the lounge .
Now Kandwal and his commandos were tracking Unnikrishnan ’s killers through an ambush - ready void .
The passive night - vision goggles they carried were useless without some light source to pick up and magnify .
The colonel could only hope the gunmen were just as blind as he was .
Shots shattered the silence .
But where were they coming from ?
Outside , on the seafront , a grenade smashed the pavement and injured three policemen .
It appeared to have been thrown from a window at Wasabi , an Asian - themed restaurant on the first floor .
Snipers held their aim on the windows ; some took positions on a fire truck in case any of them appeared long enough for a shot .
The gunmen were running out of space to maneuver , though munitions seemed to be in ample supply .
More grenades flew out of the window every so often , jarring security forces below .
It was almost 6 P.M. — more than five hours after they had entered the ballroom — when Colonel Kandwal and his team finally emerged into the hallway that led to Wasabi restaurant .
Based on the ground he ’d cleared and wireless reports from officers on the street , he knew the gunmen were hemmed in on at least two sides .
Near the restaurant ’s entrance , a GPS device lay on the ground next to some empty ammo clips and 9 - volt batteries .
After securing the kitchen entrance , the commandos approached the two doors into the restaurant .
One was blocked with a refrigerator .
Figuring the batteries might be wired to an IED , they rigged it with their own explosives and blew the door .
A volley of gunfire came from the back of the room .
The gunmen ’s location confirmed , the colonel contacted his commanding officer who set up commandos just outside the Harbor Bar on the floor below , which was linked to Wasabi by a spiral staircase .
Others shifted to guard the two bar exits that opened on the ground floor .
The gunmen were nearly cornered , but well dug in .
When commandos tried to surge through the doorway , they were met with heavy fire and had to fall back .
Kasab Interrogation : Part III
“ I do n’t like lies , Kasab . ”
Rakesh Maria , the tall , stern director of Mumbai ’s crime branch , was growing impatient with his prisoner .
During the first session with another officer , Kasab portrayed himself as the victim of an overbearing father who had pressured him into joining the Lashkar to help support his poor family .
But Maria , a veteran of some of the city ’s toughest terror cases and soon to be made chief investigator of the Mumbai attacks , did n’t believe this story .
He decided to try deception .
He told Kasab that several of his cohorts had already been arrested and given up every detail about his origins , experience in the Lashkar , the Mumbai operation .
Kasab changed his story .
He said he ’d dropped out of school years earlier and moved to Lahore to live with a relative .
He supplemented menial work as a construction worker with nighttime muggings carried out with a friend named Shafiq .
They looked for weapons to up the stakes but had no luck .
So they eventually went to a Laskhar office and volunteered , hoping they ’d get guns and training .
After filling out several forms , the pair was taken to Muridke , the Lashkar headquaters , for a three - week induction period .
The next phase took place outside a village in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir .
The firearms training they sought was finally theirs , rounded out with lectures on Islam ; injustices visited on Kashmiri Muslims in India were a leitmotif .
At one session , Hafiz Saeed gave a lecture on the importance of fighting , and dying , for Islam .
In short order , Kasab went from small - time criminal to believer .
He was not alone .
There was no going back .
As the training intensified , they were instructed in the use of rocket launchers , mortars , and explosives in the foothills of Kashmir .
After three months , thirty - two young men were selected by Uncle Zaki for jihad operations .
Half were sent on a mission unknown to Kasab .
Three escaped from the camp .
Those who remained , he said , were sent back to Muridke and trained to use GPS instruments and marine navigation .
One day , six of these men went to Kashmir for an operation .
They were never seen again .
Three others with previous operations experience joined the group , including Ismail Khan , the designated field leader of the Mumbai group .
Their training cycle complete , the ten young men were shifted to a safe house in Karachi in the second week of September and informed they would launch a massive assault on Mumbai .
Kasab was assigned to the train station .
With Khan he studied digital and hand - drawn maps and video reconnaissance gathered by Lashkar agents based in India .
The attack was delayed for a month — for what reason Kasab did n’t know .
“ We were given the best food and the best clothes , ” Kasab explained .
“ Uncle Zaki said we could have anything in the world we wanted before setting out for Mumbai . ”
The group members , who had always addressed each other by code names , forbidden from saying more , now exchanged personal details .
They reminisced about their homes and shared thoughts on the afterlife and the pride their parents would feel in their martyred sons .
They imagined the village ceremonies that , in line with Lashkar tradition , would be held in their honor , attended by ranking officials and mujahideen .
Inspired orations about their jihad would be made and sweets distributed .
Money would be paid , by the grace of Allah , to their families .
5:39 P.M. Nariman House .
Havildar Gajendra Singh had been the first commando through the rooftop entrance .
One of the gunmen was waiting for him .
Whoomp .
A grenade blast sprayed Singh with shrapnel , and a hail of bullets riddled his body .
But other commandos followed .
The building rattled from exchanges of automatic weapons fire and the explosions of grenades , a pattern that would continue as the day wore on .
Commandos were closing in on the pair , but this was a fight to the end .
Singh ’s death had offered the terrorists an eleventh - hour adrenaline bump .

Now , with dusk threatening , security forces launched a barrage of rockets at the fourth floor from a window across the street .
The impact rocked Nariman House at its foundations , and left a smoldering hole .
Despite the dense black smoke spilling out from all sides of the fifth floor , the NSG advanced down to level four , where the gunmen were trapped and killed .
The NSG officers cleared the rest of the building and made their way down to the ground floor and out into the street .
A celebration erupted .
The commandos raised their rifles for the cameras .
The bodies of two female victims are visible through a blasted out window at Nariman House ( Vinukumar Ranganathan ) .
Joshi and several friends were asked to help remove the nine bodies inside .
Two of the women victims were stretched across a window - side bed with their hands tied .
The rest were scattered on the floor , including one of the kosher inspectors , whose flesh , according to a coroner ’s report , was so decomposed that he was probably killed the first night .
Joshi and his friends struggled to pick him up .
November 29 .
Early Morning .
Taj Hotel .
The Taj was shaken by synchronized grenade explosions — this time by NSG commandos .
By tying them together , one detonating after another , the concussion was intensified .
Swathes of the Wasabi restaurant and Harbour Bar were ablaze .
Compelled to move by the encroaching smoke , the gunmen descended to a corner of the Harbour Bar where commandos delivered a blitz of firepower .
The police at street level could hear muffled screams from within .
“ For God ’s sake , please stop this !
We ca n’t take it anymore ! ”
The gunfire and grenades kept pouring in , relentless .
Shortly after dawn , one of the gunmen smashed backward through a front window and was instantly struck down by waiting commandos .
When the fires inside were finally snuffed out , the charred remains of his three accomplices lay on the floor .
December 2008 .
The Aftermath .
Mumbai is no stranger to terror .
But the 26/11 attacks — as they came to be known — set a grim new standard .
Over the course of sixty hours , 163 people were killed and more than three hundred were wounded at multiple sites across the southern end of India ’s commercial capital .
Among those killed were twelve police officers , two NSG commandos , and four more security personnel , women and children , and forty - six Muslims .
The overall toll does not include nine of the gunmen who accomplished their goals : a rampant , news - dominating killing spree heard around the world that ended with their own deaths , while India and Pakistan reverted to knee - jerk hostile postures .
In hindsight , many lives might have been saved had more decisive action been taken by Indian authorities at critical junctures .
Chief among the many critical moments , where a bolder response might have mitigated the damage done , were the hour that elapsed at CST before the gunmen moved on to Cama Hospital and the almost three hours they spent unchallenged in Room 632 of the Taj hotel where they could have been contained .
As it happened , the courage shown by some individual police officers at the outset of the attack , when the city was gripped by fear , was counteracted by a kind of rigor mortis that seeped down from the top of the chain of command .
This failure to react creatively was not shared by the attackers themselves .
Their ability to adapt sustained their mission and increased its carnage .
A former director of India ’s external intelligence agency has asserted that information gathered prior to the attack was sufficient to foil the plot beforehand .
He is not alone .
It is now known that the Research and Analysis Wing ( RAW ) intercepted several suspicious phone conversations between Lashkar operatives in advance .
In mid-September , a seaborne operation was discussed that would target a hotel near the Gateway of India , which sits across from the Taj .
Less than a week later , in another conversation , the operative identified hotels that were being considered ; they included the Taj .
Then , on November 19 , a voice on a monitored satellite phone said , “ We will reach Bombay between nine and eleven . ”
The point of origin was traced to Indian territorial waters , and the information was relayed to the Navy .
A vessel was finally dispatched to the original location , by which time the source had moved on .
( The attackers landed at Badhwar Park 8:30 P.M. , just a half hour shy of the caller ’s estimated time of arrival ) .
Additionally , it emerged that the mobile phone numbers used by the attackers were known to the Indian Intelligence Bureau five days before they struck .
A police operative had infiltrated a camp and provided SIM cards to be tracked .
A note attached to the list recommended that they be carefully monitored .
They were n’t .
In fact , the enterprising operative was later arrested as a possible conspirator and held in custody for weeks during which the IB accused the police of exceeding their mandate .
In this fractious climate , the broader constellation of dots was never connected .
In a security conference of chief ministers following the attack , Prime Minister Manmohan Singh lamented rigid bureaucracy and stressed the “ need to break down the barriers to information - sharing among the various intelligence agencies . ”
More important than gathering better intelligence , he said , was an efficient analysis of the intelligence available .
Investigators counted and numbered the bullet holes outside Nariman House ( Jason Motlagh ) .
Police on the ground were likewise outmaneuvered .
Officers arriving on the scene did so in small groups , and without coordination .
Information relayed to command was stuck in a bottleneck .
Urgent calls for reinforcements made by officers taking heavy fire were noted and left hanging .
Those who wanted to press the fight against the gunmen were ordered , invariably , by superiors to stand down and wait for commandos .
Despite previous attacks , the NSG commandos expert in urban combat scenarios were stationed outside of Delhi , a two - hour flight away .
Their journey was stalled by a spate of delays , during which sixteen police officers died .
Pitted against skilled militants with automatic weapons , grenades , and GPS technologies , most were saddled with defective or outmoded equipment ( some carbines and revolvers dating to the World War I - era ) — or none at all .
Available body armor was shown to have repeatedly failed tests for high - powered rifles .
The rounds that killed Officer Karkare near Cama Hospital , for instance , reportedly broke through chest plates he was wearing .
He and officers Salaskar and Kamte lay on the ground for at least forty minutes before an ambulance arrived .
Some corrective measures have since been taken , with mixed results .
Police Commissioner Hassan Gafoor , the man who presided over the official chaos , was eventually dismissed .
Five first response teams with commando training have been formed and positioned around the city , equipped with MP5 sub - machine guns and MP9 pistols .
Officials say they can deploy anywhere in less than twenty minutes .
An elite unit , Force 1 , comparable to the NSG , was finalized this month .
Bulletproof and light - armored vehicles have been introduced to police , along with more advanced tactical weaponry and improved training for incoming recruits .
Several speedboats needed to patrol the coast have also reached them , and cell phones and SIM cards have been distributed to fishermen serving as lookouts .
The Taj hired a private security firm from Israel whose personnel carry concealed weapons to go with extensive surveillance .
Similar precautions are expected at the Oberoi when it opens in the new year .
At CST station , police now patrol the platforms with Kalashnikovs .
Metal detectors have been installed near the entrances , though no one seems to pass through them .
Some seasoned police officers on duty during the attacks ( who asked to remain anonymous ) betrayed skepticism over the city - wide upgrades , claiming it ’s a case of show over substance .
Cosmetic changes to systemic problems might fool the public , they said , but not those determined to do them harm .
With Lashkar fingerprints all over the attack , the Indian government was quick to blame Pakistan .
Pakistan initially denied that the gunmen were Pakistani , then admitted their citizenship but insisted that it had no control .
Tense relations between the countries soured further .
New Delhi sent dossiers to Islamabad to make its case .
A sixty - page summary , mostly based on Kasab ’s testimony , underscored the extent of Hafiz Saeed ’s involvement .
Pakistani authorities eventually arrested seven men linked to the attack , including Zaki ur Rehman Lakhvi alias Uncle Zaki , the Lashkar ’s chief of operations .
Critics say their efforts have been half - hearted .
In June , Saeed was detained , and let go , by a Lahore court citing a lack of evidence against him , to the ire of Indian and Western officials who believe he was the mastermind of the Mumbai attacks .
Doubts about Pakistan ’s pledge to crack down on the Lashkar are buoyed by alleged links its Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) maintains with the group it helped create to antagonize India .
Retired ISI and military officers are said to continue their role as go - between , yet particulars are scant .
Even if there is genuine will in the political establishment to change course , a stepped up campaign against Taliban - led militancy along the Afghan border has become the priority , in part due to intense US pressure .
There is further speculation about a rift in the Lashkar ranks .
Some analysts believe Zaki may have orchestrated the attacks independent of Saeed , the spiritual leader , who favors caution .
Regardless , Lashkar ’s operational structure is intact , with membership running into the tens of thousands .
Operatives say interest and funding have increased since the Mumbai attacks .
And , according to intelligence officials and current and former members , militants are poised to strike India again .
In the meantime , those people whose lives were shattered on 26/11 have struggled to recapture some sense of normalcy in the twelve months since the attacks .
Fongen Fernandes returned to Re-Fresh snack bar three days after the CST shootings .
The commuter throngs , he said , were there too , like it never happened .
“ Death may come in any form , whether I ’m home , or asleep , or working here , ” he mused .
“ So what else to do ? ” Bullet holes in the expensive plate glass of his workplace linger as reminders .
They still mark the walls of the Leopold Café , too .
When Farhang Jehani reopened the restaurant four days after the attack , he made a decision not to repair them , not to save money but as a symbol of Mumbai ’s resilience .
“ We plucked up our courage of spirit with love and support from customers from all over the world to keep going , like we always do in this city , ” he said .
“ Everything here is the same . ” Isaque Bagwan is still standing by at his second story Colaba office should trouble arise .
He was awarded the President ’s Gallantry Medal for a third time in his thirty - five - year career for his bravery at Nariman House , which is still shuttered .
Instead of being scapegoated for his role , Vishwas Nangre Patil was validated when fuller details of his predicament at the Taj came out .
Parambir Singh , who responded at the Oberoi , was promoted to inspector general of the coastal district , Maharashtra , a plum assignment that will limit his time in south Mumbai .
Renovations to the old wing of the Taj are ongoing .
A memorial was placed in the lobby of the Taj tower in honor of those who died ; it is a constant reminder of the violence there , but most of the staff has stayed on .
Today a Sikh doorman welcomes guests , same as the one at the Trident , but he escorts guests through a door framed by metal detectors and ushers their bags through x-ray machines .

Late September 2009 .
Afternoon .
Arthur Road Jail .
The Arthur Road jail was built to accommodate about a thousand prisoners but its crumbling warrens in the city center typically hold well over three times that number .
When it was decided that Kasab would be held there , some authorities thought it was too risky .
Mumbai ’s oldest jail is also its largest , a place where underworld figures have a wide berth .
It was feared that some might try to kill the attack ’s sole survivor .
To accommodate him , a special “ explosion - resistant , bullet - proof ” cell was constructed .
As a secondary precaution , a special court was set up inside the jail .
On the 105th day of the trial , the lacquered press benches were mostly empty .
A shopkeeper who lives near Nariman House described what he saw inside the shell - shocked structure in the siege ’s aftermath .
“ Sixteen empty 9 mm shells on the second floor . . . blood on the bookshelves . . . the fourth floor of the building was also in damaged condition . ”
The judge , wearing a cloak and white barrister ’s bands around his neck , turned to the court recorder and recited the witness ’s statements .
He yawned .
There were four more hours to go before the weekend recess .
Seated in a wooden holding pen were Kasab and his co-defendents , Fahim Ansari and Ahmed Sabahuddin , Lashkar operatives instrumental in the planning of the attack .
Both had already spent months in police custody when the attack occurred — arrested in connection with an earlier attack in Uttar Pradesh .
They were surrounded by four Mumbai police officers who did not break their stares .
Thickly bearded and waif - like , Sabahuddin seemed as if he might crack if rough - handled .
He mouthed a prayer with his eyes closed .
Ansari held a cold gaze that was sometimes directed at the gallery , his arms crossed defiantly .
The attackers had followed the maps he drew and studied video footage he collected of the attack sites .
Almost entirely hidden from view in a white jump suit , Kasab did n’t move .
His large , brooding forehead hung low under a shock of hair .
He looked resigned .
A month after the attacks , Rakesh Maria had Kasab brought to his office .
The prisoner had until then stayed in solitary confinement and had no idea what had happened to his partners .
Maria , deadpan , asked if he ’d like to see them ; Kasab said he would .
An officer was summoned and told to take Kasab to where his friends were being held .
Kasab expected a reunion .
But they drove to a hospital instead of a prison .
Inside the morgue , nine corpses — most burned , some grotesquely mutilated beyond recognition — were rolled out .
Stricken by the sight and smell , Kasab begged to leave .
In July , Kasab stunned the Arthur Road courtroom with a confession .
“ I do n’t think I am innocent .
My request is that we end the trial and be sentenced . ”
Existing evidence against him — surveillance tapes , recorded phone conversations , eyewitness testimonies , D’Souza ’s photograph — was conclusive enough .
But Pakistan ’s admission that he was a participant was what had sapped the little morale he had left .
In front of a rapt audience Kasab corroborated most of what he had previously stated in interviews ; however , this time there was no equivocating on the motives .
Murder as many as possible — then martyrdom .
For your mission to end successfully you must be killed , the handlers had told him .
Only martyrs are guaranteed entry to paradise .
The court accepted his plea .
But the judge , determined to gain some closure through the grinding machinations of the justice system , ruled that the trial would continue as long as needed to address every charge against Kasab .
Weeks away from the one - year anniversary of the crime , testimonies were nearly complete , on the books .
The end was always inevitable for the accused ; only now its impact had been blunted by rote formality .
It was an anticlimax for Kasab .
But the delay of his chosen fate will soon be over .
A hangman ’s rope looms .

I was having this minor debate on the fallacies of alarmists ’ science in the comment section of Air Vent and decided I needed to post on this because the infant climate science ( and it is in its infancy ) is making some fundamental mistakes .
The momentum that built up behind the man -made global warming fad ( and it is nothing more than an unproven hypothesis surrounded by a silly fan club ) has not allowed the basic approach to be tested or challenged .
You had a movement build up around an idea , which launched the idea into ‘ established fact ’ before the idea was validated .
It probably will never be validated because the methodology is flawed to its core – as I will explain in painful detail .
To create a global temperature index for the past 30 years – and then project that back to the 1880 ’s ( when global temp records were began ) and then project it back centuries before that – is not trivial .
And in my opinion the current approach is just plain wrong .
I take this position as someone who works ‘ in space ’ – where we have complex and interrelated models of all sorts of physical processes .
And yet we have to keep refining the models to fit the data to do what we do .
Climate science naively ( and ignorantly in my mind ) does just the opposite ; it keeps adjusting the data ( for no good reason ) until they get the result they want !
For this comparative exercise Al Gore , a genius in his own mind , provides the perfect analogy – gravity .
Yes Al , it ’s there .
But we still can’t predict how a body will travel through the atmosphere or space to an accuracy that is stable beyond a few seconds ( for the atmosphere ) or days ( for Earth orbits ) .
Our window of certainty is not months , seasons , years , decades , centuries or millennia .
And yet gravity is very well understood and simple mathematically .
Add to that the fact our measurement systems for space systems blow away those being used by alarmists , who claim a science fiction level of accuracy in measurement and prediction .
Maybe that is why they have a cult following instead of scientific proof ?
In Earth ’s orbit a satellite is pretty much free of atmosphere and can fly for 10 - 20 years .
But it cannot keep its position ( for GEO birds ) or we cannot know its position ( for GEO , MEO and LEO birds ) without constantly taking measurements and correcting the models .
( Sorry , geeked out there for a moment : LEO = Low Earth Orbit , MEO = Mid Earth Orbit , GEO = Geosynchronous Earth Orbit ( stays above one spot on Earth , very high altitude ) .
While gravity is well understood , it is not the only factor working on the satellite ’s flight path .
After nearly half a century of exploring space we have unraveled some of the factors ( sunshine pushing on the satellite , heat escaping causing a small thrust , an atmosphere which expands and contracts daily and seasonally , solar flares , etc ) .
We cannot accurately model these beyond a few days .
After about 7 days these forces build up enough change in the orbit in completely random ways that we have to remeasure the orbit and compute another prediction .
Gravity is simple , but we cannot predict out beyond a week with any accuracy .
For satellite orbits it would make no sense at all to ‘ adjust ’ the data to fit a curve as the alarmists do for temperature .
If a data point is bad it is either consumed inside a sea of good data points or rejected because we have a sea of good data points to use .
If there are sufficient data points you do n’t adjust the data – bottom line .
Either you have enough data to draw a conclusion or you do n’t .
You do n’t make up data to fill your need either .
If the rocket scientists can only predict the path of an object orbiting the globe for 7 days , what sane person thinks a hodge - podge of randomly accurate and aging sensors around the globe can measure a global index , let alone predict the future or unravel the past ?
It cannot .
But what ‘ scientists ’ do to the data to pretend they can is downright silly .
They make adjustments or homogenizing stations or fill in grids with pretend stations .
A total unscientific joke .
The measurement is the measurement .
It has a fixed accuracy and uncertainty .
Each station has a unique accuracy and uncertainty due to its siting , technology and the accuracy with which its readings are made each day .
( geeked out again : if there is a drift in time when you read the sensor , or that sensor ’s reference to UTC ( the world wide time reference ) is unknown or dynamic , then you increase the error bars to the measurement ) .
If the sensor is sited wrong or has problems you extend the error bars .
You DON ” T adjust the data !
( Sorry , geeked out again .
Error bars are the range in which the real world value could be .
If I measure an orbit to a accuracy of +/- 50 meters , then I know what ever number comes out of my system is not real .
Reality is in that 100 meter range around the value .
Statistically all I know is the satellite is in that range , the value I compute only centers the box it can be found in . )
You cannot adjust data to remove error or increase accuracy on a single sensor !
If you do a regular regime of calibrating the sensor against a known source , you can remove BIAS .
But that is all .
What we do with sensor nets when we combine them is we can remove some error by comparing measurements that overlap in time and space .
But that again something totally different than what the global scientists think they are doing .
Another example : moving stations .
When a temperature station is moved it should simply become a new station at that point in time , with a new set of siting errors ( and accuracy if the sensor is upgraded ) .
It has a different time window than it previous incarnation – it is a new data set .
Â
When I see crap like this I realize these people are just not up to this kind of complex analysis .
Before :
After :
You do n’t ‘ homogenize ’ neighboring stations into a mythical ( and fictional ) virtual station .
That is just clueless !
And there is no need to .
Â
When that happens start a new data set .
Those stations measured real temperatures , as shown in the top graph .
They are three independent data sets with fixed attributes for the locale .
Whatever that mess is in the bottom graph , it is nothing more than shoddy modelng .
It destroys the historic record and replaces it with someone ’s poor mathematical skills or scientific understanding .
I mean think of what that graph says in my world .
If I had measurements of the moon ’s position in the night sky from these three points I could reproduce the Moon ’s orbit .
But what happens in that second ‘ adjusted ’ graph is silly .
I would be changing the measured position of the Moon for two ‘ adjusted ’ stations to make it closer to the first station – while not moving the two stations physically !
They would produce a lunar vector similar to the others , but did I really move the Moon ?
Of course not , all I did was insert a lot of error .
Now my calculation on the Moon ’s position over that period does not reflect reality ( or the established gravitational model ) .
The question is , does it fit someone ’s half cocked new theory of gravity – yet unproven !
Basically what alarmists needed to do was not adjust data , they needed to create a thermal atmosphere model which would take into account siting characteristics both local and large .
This would include distance from large bodies of water , altitude , latitude , etc .
A three dimensional model that would explain why various stations have their unique siting profiles and temperature records .
It would explain why temperatures near oceans fluctuate less than stations inland 100 - 200 miles .
It would show how a global average increase of 1Â°C would result in a .6Â°C increase at high latitudes or altitudes .
It would EXPLAIN the data variations in the measurements .
But we do n’t have this model .
Alarmists cannot explain with accuracy why stations 10 miles apart show different temperature profiles each and every day of the year .
So they pretend to know how to ‘ adjust ’ the data and their groupies applaud them for their brilliance .
Yet the result , like my Moon example , is they simply lost site of reality .
Another irresponsible gimmick is creating mythical stations in grids without measurements .
As we all know the temperature for a town or city 20 miles away can be totally different than that for our home town .
Just bring up a local weather map .
As weather fronts move through the dynamics over a region are dramatic .
These changes happen all year at any time of day .
20 miles down the road things can be totally different .
Yet the CRU and others create fictional stations 750 kilometers away from the nearest data point – as if that makes any sense at all .
There is no data in these regions – do n’t make up data and call it truth !
No data means no measurement .
In my world we can interpolate a trend forward to fill measurement gaps .
For example we do n’t measure each point on the orbit , we measure a couple of times a day to get a set of points on the orbit from which we can derive an accurate orbit curve .
Because gravity is so damn simple we have incredibly high confidence in those computed positions in the measurement gaps .
But as I said , they decay over time ( 5 - 7 days ) .
If we do n’t remeasure , the errors increase with time .
Global Climate is nowhere near as simple as gravity .
It decays over distance and time rapidly , just as ballistic flight through the atmosphere is unpredictable over distance and time , no matter how predictable gravity is .
If they wanted to validate that 3 - D model I proposed , they would predict temperatures in regions without measurements and then go measure them to see if their model was right .
You do n’t mix models and raw data – that is just wrong ( though that is the essence of Michael Mann ’s “ Nature Trick ” ) .
Another disturbing problem with climate science is identification of error and uncertainty .
In the alarmists ’ world there is no degradation over distance or time – which makes their results pure science fiction .
If they had a reviewed , verified and defendable error budget they could move from fiction to science .
They would also understand why their conclusions are standing on seriously shaky ground .
OK , going full geek here .
An error budget shows how much error is added to the final computed number at each stage of its processing from the base measurement .
For the global warming problem this budget covers the point of a temperature measurement at a station to the point a global annual index is derived , and it must contain the following error steps :
Measurement error : all the errors associated with taking the raw measurement .
This includes the sensor accuracy and biases ( if unknown or measured these become noise ) , siting induced errors , time of measurement induced errors ( one must take the measurement the same time every day to within a certain tolerance to create a consistent historic or annual record ) .
Local geographic error : A sensor measurement like temperature is only good for a certain distance .
The farther you move from it the more the accuracy degrades as the error increases .
No one has demonstrated the distance a single station ’s measurement can be considered valid .
At this stage we have a raw station temperature set from specified times of day .
Station integration error : when you take data from two or more stations to create a regional index , you must integrate the first two error sources described above and carry that to the integrated station level for a region or grid .
In some systems combining sensors can increase accuracy .
Land temperature sensor nets are not one of those kinds of systems .
There are too many factors due to siting and distance ( the temp decay problem ) to increase accuracy .
To do that you would need to have sensors located geographically close ( under 5 miles I would estimate ) to actually remove sensor and siting errors .
At this stage we have a local regional data set ( more than one station ) .
Day - to - Month integration errors : Temperatures are taken daily at fixed times and then integrated to make a daytime and nigh time index .
Â
Then these daily indices are integrated into monthly indices .
The error from the daily computations must then be integrated and added onto the monthly index .
Month - to - year integration errors :
The AGW alarmists need to create a historic record , so they look at a yearly index ( CRU actually looks at the 4 seasons first , then integrates ) .
What ever the methodology , there will be additional error introduced to create an annual index for a geographic region .
At this stage we have a local regional data set per for a single year .
Large geographic integration errors :
Finally , you integrate mid sized regions from step 3 above into data sets for countries or hemispheres or the globe .
Again , we are compounding the errors from the previous steps – some offset , some do n’t .
They all have to be accounted for – no hand waving !
Each local region going into step 3 has a very unique set of errors due to the unique nature of the errors defined in steps 1 & 2 .
From step 3 on you have a homogenized set of local regions , which have errors integrated in a consistent manner as we move from daily measurements to monthly and annual ( steps 4 & 5 ) .
Finally we have a consistent method to capture additional errors as we integrate up to cover the globe ( step 6 ) .
A defendable error budget is an obvious requirement for any number spewed from any alarmists .
Without it the numbers mean nothing .
In my business we use these budgets to fly rockets ( atmosphere ) and spacecraft safely .
We use them to understand when we need to remeasure and recompute a new predict .
If space programs did not have a handle on this we could not fly through Al Gore ’s gravity field and Earth ’s atmosphere .
The fact is , for launch and ascent and because the error in position can increase so quickly , we measure and adjust the guidance at incredible rates to make it into orbit safely .
We have to .
We cannot adjust the data , we have to adjust to the data .
Now what I presented above is just the errors in making a measurement today for one year .
What happens when you go back in time ?
Well you have to recompute the error budget for each station for each year .
What you should see ( if done correctly ) is rapidly increasing error bars as the technological accuracy is lost as we go back in time .
The errors in step 1 would start to increase by orders of magnitude .
But if you look at the silly claims of NCDC , GISS and CRU you see very small changes in uncertainty going back in time Â – proof positive they screwed up their error budget .
One of my first posts on ClimategateÂ was on errors in climate estimates over time , and I used space exploration again as the example .
I used the accuracy know as ‘ image resolution ’ as the example everyone can relate to ( more pixels more detail , less error or blur ) .
I used two pictures of Mars to demonstrate the state - of - the - art capabilities of humankind separated by ~ 50 years .
First was an image taken in 1956 from the Mt Wilson Observatory :
Second was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2001 .
We can all see the effect going back in time has on accuracy and error .
In 1880 , when the global Â temperature record began , humans were drawing Mars not photographing it .
The CRU data dump made publicÂ a very interesting document .
It was an early attempt at an error budget , though it does not show the steps , just their initial estimate of a bottom line .
Also interestingly enough , they computed it for 1969 .
The following graph is from that document and proves ( per CRU ) that the current temperature reconstructions are way too imprecise to confirm the warming claims of the IPCC and other alarmists ( click to enlarge ) :
The title of this graph indicates this is the CRU computed sampling ( measurement ) error in C for 1969 .
It clearly shows much of the global temperatures for 1969 are +/- 1Â°C or more .
Which means that until our current temperature rises well above 1Â°C over that computed for 1969 we are statistically experiencing the same temps as back then .
And we know these error estimates will have to grow as we go back another 80 years to the 1880 ’s , let alone even farther back in time .
I do n’t even think the CRU estimates are right and complete , but I do know they alone disprove the IPCC claims that there has been 0.8 Â°C rise in temperature over the last century , mostly due to human activities .
The data cannot make that determination .
Prior to 1880 there are no real global temperature records , so scientists tried to find proxies .
One good proxy is ice cores , which capture the chemical composition of the snow and ice going back thousands and thousands of years .
Chemical signatures are very accurately tied to temperature since these are physical processes .
No surprise but the ice cores show no significant warming today .
Instead , Â these ice cores show many warmer periods in the history of humankind .
Update : WUWT has more ice core perspective .
– end update
Therefore Mann and Jones and other alarmists went to a much less reliable measure of historic temperature – tree rings .
Tree rings are effected by a lot of factors , the least of which is temperature ( after a certain minimum has been attained to activate is growth processes ) .
Tree growth depends on sunshine , nutrients , water and number days above the optimal temperature .
A tree ring should show the same growth under 30 days of 40 Â°F temps with plenty of moisture ( afternoon showers ) and nutrients as it would under 30 days of 55 Â°F temps and the same conditions .
Trees are not thermometers .
Using a living organism to measure temperature is dodgy compared to the physics of chemistry used with ice cores .
The error bars on a tree ring mapped to a temperature range ( and it can only be mapped to a range , not a value ) are huge .
But the alarmists do n’t do proper science , they run statistics until they get the answer they like , then throw out the error bars as if they are meaningless .
There is no way for trees rings to define any historic temperature value .
Therefore claims that the MPW or Roman Period were a degree or two warmer or colder using trees is all bunk .
This post is too long and too geeky already , but I need to note that there are few people in the world capable of discerning which scientific argument is more sound .
No journalist or politician can discern whether I am right or wrong .
Al , give it up baby .
You did not invent the internet ( I know those who did ) and you have a 3rd grade grasp of science ( and I have two 4th graders who can prove it ) .
I suggest you stay away from any debates outside talking to journalists .
They never know when you drop one of your classic whoppers of ignorance .
The sad fact is the science behind man-made global warming is not good science .
It is rather pathetic actually .
I work with premier scientists and in fact review their missions for feasibility to return the results advertised .
I would fail this mess without a second thought .
In addition , you cannot leave the verification of man-made global warming ( AGW ) in the hands of those whose careers and credibility rest on AGW being proven to be true .
Â
When you do , you get those questionable ‘ adjustments ’ that turn raw temp data ( processed to at least step 5 in the error budget above ) into something completely different .
For example , here is my version of a classic graph now making its rounds on the internet ( click to enlarge ) :
What is shows by the blue dots and lines is the raw temperature data for Northern Australia .
This overlays perfectly with what the UN IPCCs Global Climate Models predict would be the temperature record for the region without AGW ( the blue region in the underlying graph .
The red dots and lines are what is produced from alarmists ’ ‘ adjustments ” , and unsurprisingly these line up with the Global Climate Models predictions if there is AGW ( reddish region ) .
Alarmists adjust temp data that magically proves alarmists ’ theories , based on alarmists ’ models .
Impressed ?
I ’m not .
I tend more towards disgusted .
The science of global warming is a mess .
They have no error budget that proves they can detect the warming they say they have detected .
Their tree data is applied wrong by assuming a temp value when all you can estimate is a range ( and tree ring recent divergence with current temps just proves trees are lousy indicators of temperature anyway ) .
The alarmists have made all sorts of bogus and indefensible site adjustments , station combing while regularly making up stations from thin air to alter ( or hide ) the real temperature record .
Instead of explaining the data , they adjust the data to meet their explanations .
The Global Climate research has not made it to a professional level of scientific endeavor as we see in more established areas of science ..
If their science was so settled the supporters could answer these challenges without lifting a finger .
But they cannot , instead they play PR games and smear their opponents .
Houston , they have a problem .

Experiments in Musical Intelligence For downloading Experiments in Musical Intelligence music as MP3 files , click here .
I began Experiments in Musical Intelligence in 1981 as the result of a composer 's block .
My initial idea involved creating a computer program which would have a sense of my overall musical style and the ability to track the ideas of a current work such that at any given point I could request a next note , next measure , next ten measures , and so on .
My hope was that this new music would not just be interesting but relevant to my style and to my current work .
Having very little information about my style , however , I began creating computer programs which composed complete works in the styles of various classical composers , about which I felt I knew something more concrete .
My first exploration with Experiments in Musical Intelligence involved coding the rules of basic part - writing as I understood them , since part writing constitutes one of the primary superstructures of traditional tonal music .
After much trial and error , my program produced a kind of vanilla music which basically adhered to these rules .
While basically correct in terms of how the voices move one to another and still conform to classical triadic harmony , the music seemed , at least to the educated ear , lifeless and without much musical energy .
While some of the music composed using this approach did prove fairly successful , most of its output was equally uninteresting and unsatisfying .
Having an intermediary - myself - form abstract sets of rules for composition seemed artificial and unnecessarily premeditative .
As well , having to code new sets of rules for each new style encountered proved daunting .
I therefore revised the program to create new output from music stored in a database .
My idea was that every work of music contains a set of instructions for creating different but highly related replications of itself .
These instructions , interpreted correctly , can lead to interesting discoveries about musical structure as well as , hopefully , create new instances of stylistically - faithful music .
My rationale for discovering such instructions was based , in part , on the concept of recombinancy .
Recombinancy can be defined simply as a method for producing new music by recombining extant music into new logical successions .
I describe this process in detail in my book Experiments in Musical Intelligence ( 1996 ) .
I argue there that recombinancy appears everywhere as a natural evolutionary and creative process .
All the great books in the English language , for example , are constructed from recombinations of the twenty - six letters of the alphabet .
Similarly , most of the great works of Western art music exist as recombinations of the twelve pitches of the equal - tempered scale and their octave equivalents .
The secret lies not in the invention of new letters or notes but in the subtlety and elegance of their recombination .
Of course , simply breaking a musical work into smaller parts and randomly combining them into new orders almost certainly produces gibberish .
Effective recombination requires extensive musical analysis and very careful recombination to be effective at even an elemental level no less the highly musical level of which I dreamed .
For more details on how this process works , please see my three books on the subject from A - R Editions Computers and Musical Style , Experiments in Musical Intelligence , and The Algorithmic Composer and one from MIT Press Virtual Music .
Basically , Experiments in Musical Intelligence works using three basic principles :
( 1 ) deconstuction ( analyze and separate into parts )
( 2 ) signatures ( commonality - retain that which signifies style )
( 3 ) compatibility ( recombinancy - recombine into new works )
Since the early days of Experiments in Musical Intelligence , many audiences have heard its output in the styles of classical composers .
The works have delighted , angered , provoked , and terrified those who have heard them .
I do not believe that the composers and audiences of the future will have the same reactions .
Ultimately , the computer is just a tool with which we extend our minds .
The music our algorithms compose are just as much ours as the music created by the greatest of our personal human inspirations .

Scientists at Boston Biomedical Research Institute ( BBRI ) and the University of Pennsylvania have found that combining two chemicals , one of which is the green tea component EGCG , can prevent and destroy a variety of protein structures known as amyloids .
Amyloids are the primary culprits in fatal brain disorders such as Alzheimer 's , Huntington's , and Parkinson 's diseases .
Their study , published in the current issue of Nature Chemical Biology ( December 2009 ) , may ultimately contribute to future therapies for these diseases .
" These findings are significant because it is the first time a combination of specific chemicals has successfully destroyed diverse forms of amyloids at the same time , " says Dr. Martin Duennwald of BBRI , who co-led the study with Dr. James Shorter of University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine .
For decades a major goal of neurological research has been finding a way to prevent the formation of and to break up and destroy amyloid plaques in the brains and nervous systems of people with Alzheimer 's and other degenerative diseases before they wreak havoc .
Amyloid plaques are tightly packed sheets of proteins that infiltrate the brain .
These plaques , which are stable and seemingly impenetrable , fill nerve cells or wrap around brain tissues and eventually ( as in the case of Alzheimer 's ) suffocate vital neurons or brain cells , causing loss of memory , language , motor function and eventually premature death .
To date , researchers have had no success in destroying plaques in the human brain and only minimal success in the laboratory .
One reason for these difficulties in finding compounds that can dissolve amyloids is their immense stability and their complex composition .
Yet , Duennwald experienced success in previous studies when he exposed amyloids in living yeast cells to EGCG .
Furthermore , he and his collaborators also found before that DAPH - 12 , too , inhibits amyloid production in yeast .
In their new study , the team decided to look in more detail at the impact of these two chemicals on the production of different amyloids produced by the yeast amyloid protein known as PSI +.
They chose this yeast amyloid protein because it has been studied extensively in the past , and because it produces varieties of amyloid structures that are prototypes of those found in the damaged human brain .
Thus , PSI + amyloids are excellent experimental paradigms to study basic properties of all amyloid proteins .
The team 's first step was to expose two different amyloid structures produced by yeast ( e.g. , a weak version and a strong version ) to EGCG .
They found that the EGCG effectively dissolved the amyloids in the weaker version .
To their surprise , they found that the stronger amyloids were not dissolved and that some transformed to even stronger versions after exposure to EGCG .
The team then exposed the yeast amyloid structures to a combination of the EGCG and the DAPH - 12 and found that all of the amyloid structures broke apart and dissolved .
The next steps for the research team will be to explore the mechanism and potency of such a combinatorial therapy for the treatment of diverse neurodegenerative diseases .
" Our findings are certainly preliminary and we need further work to fully comprehend the effects of EGCG in combination with other chemicals on amyloids .
Yet , we see our study as a very exciting initial step towards combinatorial therapies for the treatment of amyloid - based diseases , " says Duennwald .
Authors of the study include : Martin L Duennwald and Chan Chung from Boston Biomedical Research Institute and Nicholas P Lopreiato , Elizabeth A Sweeny , M Noelle Knight , James Shorter , Huan Wang , and Blake E Roberts from the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics , University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine .
Men and women live in different worlds when it comes to attitudes to eroticism .
I suggested that most women today know how to pleasure a man but a British sex expert ( male ) disagreed :
“ They have n’t a clue , and even if they knew , most would n’t do it . ”
A joke illustrates the point : “ What is the difference between a job and a wife ? ”
Answer “ After ten years a job still sucks ! ” .
Unfortunately many people still believe in sheltering young women from eroticism and so girls are told the basic reproductive facts but nothing of sexual pleasure .
We are confident in telling girls about vaginal intercourse because it is the means of producing children .
It also happens to be one of the easiest ways for a woman to provide a man with sexual release .
Putting it crudely , masturbation by hand or mouth not only involves more work but is also more explicitly sexual .
Since women are not necessarily hoping for orgasm , they can be easily shocked by sex ( in the context of sex play rather than trying for a baby ) .
Women often do n’t know how to orgasm and so they associate sexual pleasure with immorality .
Men do hope for orgasm ; and so eroticism and sex play , including activities other than intercourse , are more important to men .
Women do not get the same sexual pleasure
Women have difficulty understanding men ’s passion for sexual pleasure .
The film ‘ Indecent Proposal ’ ( 1993 ) might be a little far - fetched , but nevertheless we accept that a man might pay as much as $ 1,000,000 for sex .
Equally the film reflects women ’s aversion to non-relationship sex : why else is the idea of sex with a good - looking millionaire so repulsive ?
Men experience a purely physical reaction to seeing a woman ’s body that has nothing to do with personal relationships .
So , men engage lap dancers , visit go - go bars and watch topless reviews because they enjoy the sensations of sexual arousal that come from the physical proximity of a semi- naked woman .
Conversely , women do not tend to pay even for this relatively mild physical gratification because the female mind and body simply do not respond as a man ’s mind and body do .
Women ’s sexual arousal and orgasm are not automatic and so women have to learn about their sexual arousal .
Women do experience lust ( or the desire to get laid ) but they often need to be enticed into sex whereas men rarely need encouragement .
“ – men wish that women ’s sexuality was like theirs , which it is n’t .
Male sexual response is far brisker and more automatic : it is triggered easily by things , like putting a quarter in a vending machine .
Consequently , at a certain level and for all men , girls and parts of girls are , at this stimulus level unpeople .
That is n’t incompatible with their being people too .
Your clothes , breasts , odour , etc. are n’t what he loves instead of you – simply the things he needs in order to set sex in motion to express love .
Women seem to find this hard to understand . ” ( p34 The Joy of Sex – 1972 )
A man ’s arousal and orgasm are pretty much a given during sex .
But a woman can take part in sexual activity without ever becoming aroused or reaching orgasm .
So even women who have sex for years do not necessarily know how to orgasm .
In order to qualify as ‘ sexually experienced ’ , it is quality ( breadth of experience ) not quantity ( years or partners ) that counts .
As a minimum , a sexually experienced woman should ( 1 ) be able to masturbate to orgasm alone , ( 2 ) have explored clitoral stimulation with a partner via masturbation and oral sex and ( 3 ) have attempted a variety of positions for sexual intercourse .
In order to discover how her arousal works , a woman needs to be positive enough about eroticism to be willing to explore her sexual fantasies .
Unfortunately the average woman ( and this includes many ‘ sex experts ’ ) lacks this experience .
Excerpt from Ways Women Orgasm ( ISBN 978-0956-894700 )
When the Chinese herbalist Li Ching - Yuen died in 1933 , newspapers around the world reported the news of his passing .
According to his own testimony , he was 197 years old .
An investigation , however , suggested Li had forgotten his actual birthday .
Official government records recorded the birth year as 1677 , making him 256 .
Here is a copy of the obituary as printed in the New York Times on May 6 , 1933 :
LI CHING - YUN DEAD ; GAVE HIS AGE AS 197 .
“ Keep a Quiet Heart , Sit Like a Tortoise , Sleep Like a Dog , ” His Advice for a Long Life .
Li Ching - Yuen Li Ching - Yuen
Inquiry Put Age At 256 .
Reported to have buried 23 wives and had 180 descendents – sold herbs for first 100 years .
Peiping , May 5 – Li Ching - Yun , a resident of Kaihsien , in the Province of Szechwan , who contended that he was one of the world ’s oldest men and said he was born in 1736 – which would make him 197 years old – died today .
A Chinese dispatch from Chungking telling of Mr. Li’s death said he attributed his longevity to peace of mind and that it was his belief every one could live at least a century by attaining inward calm .
Compared with estimates of Li Ching - yun ’s age in previous reports from China the above dispatch is conservative .
In 1930 it was said Professor Wu Chung - chien , dean of the department of Education in Minkuo University , had found records showing Li was born in 1677 and that Imperial Chinese Government congratulated him on his 150th and 200th birthdays .
A correspondent of The New York Times wrote in 1928 that many of the oldest men in Li’s neighborhood asserted their grandfathers knew him as boys and that he was then a grown man .
According to the generally accepted tales told in his province .
Li was able to read and write as a child , and by his tenth birthday had traveled in Kansu , Shansi , Tibet , Annam , Siam and Manchuria gathering herbs .
For the first hundred years he continued at this occupation .
Then he switched to selling herbs gathered by others .
Wu Pei-fu , the warlord , took Li into his house to learn the secret of living to 250 .
Another pupil said Li told him to “ keep a quiet heart , sit like a tortoise , walk sprightly like a pigeon and sleep like a dog . ”
According to one version of Li’s married life he had buried away twenty - three wives and was living with his twenty - fourth , a woman of ’ 60 . ’
Another account , which in 1928 credited him with 180 living descendents , comprising eleven generations , recorded only fourteen marriages .
This second authority said his eyesight was good ; also , that the finger nails of his right hand were very long , and “ long ” for a Chinese might mean longer than any finger nails ever dreamed of in the United States .
One statement of The Times correspondent which probably caused skeptical readers to believe Li was born more recently than 1677 , was that “ many who have seen him recently declare that his facial appearance is no different from that of persons two centuries his junior . ”

WHEN she signed up for a self - development course , Rebekah Lawrence hoped it would help her find happiness .
Instead , it triggered a psychotic state in which she leapt naked to her death from her office window .
Yesterday , the Deputy State Coroner , Malcolm MacPherson , found her deadly psychosis stemmed from the course she had completed two days earlier , known as The Turning Point .
Rebekah Lawrence in 2004 .
For Ms Lawrence 's family , the finding confirmed what they had believed since she died on December 20 , 2005 .
Her widower , David Booth , said there were '' unqualified people doing damaging things to people 's minds '' - with potentially fatal results .
An inquest into Ms Lawrence 's death heard there were no legal restrictions for practising under the titles of psychotherapist or counsellor , and therefore no public safeguards .
Orlando , Florida ( CNN ) -- A 40 - year - old man accused of killing one and wounding five in a shooting at a business where he once worked was charged Friday with first - degree murder , police said .
" I 'm just going through a tough time right now , I 'm sorry , " the 40 - year - old suspect who had recently declared bankruptcy allegedly told police as he was taken into custody .
Authorities identified the suspect as Jason Rodriguez , a former employee of Reynolds Smith & Hills , whose offices are located in the 16 - story Gateway Center building .
The incident began at 11:44 a.m. , when Rodriguez entered the business ' eighth - floor reception area , said Lt. Louis Tanzi , violent crimes section commander for the Orlando Police Department .
" He produced a handgun and started shooting in the reception area and continued shooting in the entire office area until he left , " he told reporters .
According to the charging affidavit , the fatality occurred when Rodriguez entered the suite , pulled a handgun from a holster under his shirt and shot twice at an employee who was standing near the receptionist 's desk .
He then entered a common work area " firing multiple rounds and causing injuries to several other employees , " it says , citing a witness .
During the incident , Rodriguez " was recognized by numerous former co-workers , " it says .
He then left in a car , described by witnesses as a small , silver compact vehicle , the affidavit says .
Police went to his residence where they found a 2001 four - door silver Hyundai , it says .
As police were disabling the car , Rodriguez appeared at the window of the residence , his hands in the air , and surrendered without incident , the affidavit says .
Asked by a reporter why he allegedly committed the crime , Rodriguez , escorted by police , said , " They left me to rot . "
Paraded in front of reporters outside the police station , he said , " Innocent . "
Tanzi said he was " very comfortable " that authorities have the right man .
" We 're positive ; we have eyewitnesses who have identified him , " he said , adding that Rodriguez will be facing other charges as well .
Tanzi said other employees of the architectural and engineering firm where the attack occurred have described Rodriguez as a " disgruntled former employee . "
A company spokesman said Rodriguez had been let go from the company two years ago for " performance issues . "
Ken Jacobson , the chief financial officer and chief legal counsel for Reynolds , Smith & Hills , said that Rodriguez was hired as an " engineer one , " which he described as a " beginning engineer . "
" His work performance was pretty deficient from the start , " he said .
" We tried to work with his performance for 11 months and when he did n't improve , we let him go in June of 2007 . "
The company had n't heard from him since -- until Friday 's outburst , he said .
" So we can't make any sense of this , " he said .
The affidavit describes apparently conflicting reasons for his departure .
Rodriguez told a detective that he had resigned from the company after five years there to get a better job , it says .
But it adds , " Rodriguez stated that people at RS&H , the Orlando Office , harassed him and threw him out for no reason at all , making it look like incompetency . "
He told police that , after a year and a half of unemployment , he found work at a Subway Restaurant , but was not given enough hours so he filed for unemployment , according to the affidavit .
" Rodriguez felt the people at RS&H were hindering his efforts to obtain unemployment benefits , " it adds .
" Rodriguez stated he was expecting an unemployment check but it did not come as expected .
Rodriguez stated he felt he was forced into a situation where he could no longer provide for his family . "
Tanzi said police recovered a firearm and had received " limited cooperation " from the suspect .
The five wounded victims are all in stable condition , he said .

Asked about the building 's security system , he said it was typical of the city 's office buildings with a security officer in the front and surveillance cameras .
" It 's nothing elaborate , " he said .
Public records indicate that Rodriguez filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy last May and that the case was discharged in September .
Four of the victims were being treated at Orlando Regional Medical Center , and one had gone into surgery , spokeswoman Katie Dagenais said .
The fifth victim was at Florida Hospital , the hospital said .

The PBS mainstay Bill Moyers , left , said he was retiring from weekly television and would end his Friday night public affairs show , “ Bill Moyers Journal , ” on April 30 , 2010 .
That date will also be the last for “ Now on PBS , ” which has been canceled .
Mr. Moyers said he had been planning for some time to retire the program on Dec. 25 but was asked by PBS to raise the funds to continue through April , which he did .
“ I am 75 years old , ” he said of the decision to end the series , which began in April 2007 .
The program has recently been having a “ good run of it , ” he added in a telephone interview on Friday , “ so I feel it ’s time . ”
He said he was not quitting television work although he had no new projects planned .
“ Now ” began in January 2002 and was originally hosted by Mr. Moyers .
John Siceloff , the executive producer , said the program , currently hosted by David Brancaccio , has been “ a unique voice at a time when outlets for insightful journalism are diminishing . ”
He added , “ We ’re all looking for places to continue that work . ” PBS said in a statement that it was in the middle of a “ review and reinvention ” of its news and public affairs programming and would announce plans for its lineup in January .
By Richard Clarke Arsenal are out of the Carling Cup . Arsène Wenger 's side were brave and bold at Eastlands on Wednesday night but , in the end , the class of Manchester City was telling .
This Quarter - Final was goalless until five minutes after half - time .
That is when Carlos Tevez darted in from the left and drove a stunning shot into the top corner of the net .
Arsenal responded manfully but Man City 's second punctured arguably their best period of the game .
Like the first , Shaun Wright - Phillips ' goal was class .
The former Chelsea winger raced up the right and drove stunning shot high into the other corner .
Man City 's strength , power and quality was apparent all night but Arsenal 's usual mix of youngsters and squad players gave them a real test .
The third goal , from substitute Vladimir Weiss at the death , gave the scoreline a skew the visitors did not deserve .
The statistics will say this is Wenger 's third defeat in their last four games .
But , at least , the manager will be able to draw a number of positives from this one .
Before kick - off the Frenchman had named a side with as much experience as he could muster .
Alex Song dropped back to partner captain Mikael Silvestre at centre half .
Armand Traore and Emmanuel Eboue reprised their recent first - team run-outs in the full back positions .
However there were younger heads further forward .
Craig Eastmond ( 18 ) retained his Carling Cup role as the holding central midfielder with Aaron Ramsey ( 18 ) and Tomas Rosicky ( 29 , admittedly ) just in front .
Fran Merida ( 19 ) and Jack Wilshere ( 17 ) occupied the flank while Carlos Vela ( 20 ) was the lone front man .
For their part , Manchester City were at full strength .
All their major summer signings - Tevez , Joleon Lescott , Gareth Barry and , of course , Kolo Toure and Emmanuel Adebayor - were on display .
In the opening stages , their quality was apparent .
The home side bossed the opening quarter but , for all that , they only created one chance .
It came in the seventh minute , when Barry sent over corner from the right and Adebayor stole in front of Song to power in a firm , downward header .
Lukasz Fabianski gathered on the goal - line at the second attempt .
Arsenal rallied briefly after that with Wilshere setting up Ramsey to shot from distance .
However in the 20th minute , Wright - Phillips robbed Silvestre on the right - hand byline and Craig Bellamy pulled his shot inches beyond the far post with Fabianski .
A crystal clear opportunity .
Until this point , Arsenal had not created a chance worthy of the name .
That changed in the 22nd minute when Wilshere sent Vela scuttling into the area .
The Mexican striker beat Lescott to the ball but could only stab his shot over the bar .
For a finisher as classy as Vela , it was decent opportunity .
But Man
City were still ominous every time they went forward and , in the 24th minute , Tevez might have provided the perfect response to Arsenal 's adventure .
The Argentinean teased and then beat both Silvestre and Eastmond before forcing Fabianski in to a decent save at the near post .
However , as the game become more open , Arsenal became much more competitive .
Vela continued to cause consternation in the Man City defence and , just after the half - hour , Eboue darted into the area and forced the first real save out of Shay Given .
Wright - Phillips had been testing Traore to the limit all night .
Just before the whistle , the Frenchman was booked for a late challenge on the Englishman .
From Barry 's free - kick , Song headed just over his own bar .
At the break , Arsenal could congratulate them on a job well done but only half done .
And some of that work would be undone five minutes after the restart .
Rosicky lost possession and Tevez collected on the left flank .
He darted inside Eboue and Song before curling a sumptuous shot into the net off the underside of the bar .
It was just what Arsenal did not need .
They responded as best they could .
Rosicky headed high and Ramsey blazed a decent effort over the bar .
However Adebayor might have killed the tie in the 56th minute .
Arsenal were caught out by Bellamy 's early cross and Fabianski's attentions distracted the Togolese striker who diverted the ball wide .
No - one could accuse the visitors of not chancing their arm .
Just past the hour Rosicky sent Eboue clear on the right and his cross was nearly touched home by Vela .
Seconds later Merida 's cross was just too high for Ramsey , who sent his header wide with the goal at his mercy .
Arsenal were now pushing back their older , more experienced opponents .
So Man City 's second was entirely against the run of play .
Wright - Phillips collected the ball on the right showed a burst of speed and , from the corner of the area , slammed a shot high into the far corner of the net .
It was an unstoppable effort and , unfortunately for Arsenal , curtailed their best period of the match .
As brave as Arsenal had been , you sensed the game was up .
Eleven minutes from time , Song might have seen red for a last - man foul on Stephen Ireland .
In the end the Cameroonian only got a yellow card .
However it was his fifth caution of the season and subsequently he will be suspended for Saturday 's game against Stoke .
Arsenal continued to search for something from the game but , as the seconds ticked by , their pursuit seemed more and more fruitless .
It also created gaps at the back .
Three minutes from time , Bellamy drew fine save from Fabianski .
Shortly afterwards the Welshman set up substitute Weiss to slam home a third .
Merida bashed a shot against the bar in injury time .
It was typical of Arsenal 's evening .
Undoubtedly , they had been beaten by the better side on the night but the visitors deserved credit for the performance the youngsters had put in .

In what should be no surprise , banks are cutting back on small business loans .
Please consider Small business loans : $ 10 billion evaporates .
Eight months after President Obama began prodding the nation 's banks to increase their small business lending , the loan numbers continue to move in the opposite direction .
The 22 banks that got the most help from the Treasury 's bailout programs cut their small business loan balances by a collective $ 10.5 billion over the past six months , according to a government report released Monday .
Three of the 22 banks make no small business loans at all .
Of the remaining 19 banks , 15 have reduced their small business loan balance since April .
Credit crunch : Obama administration officials , including Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Small Business Administration head Karen Mills , will host a forum Wednesday in Washington to discuss the lending challenges small businesses face .
Bankers , members of Congress , and a selection of small business owners will participate .
While credit conditions have improved in some parts of the financial system , lending remains very tight for businesses that rely on banks for their financing , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke acknowledged on Monday .
Pump Runs Dry
President Obama vowed Monday to ease the financial plight of the nation 's small businesses , which have been hit hard by the recession .
" Small businesses are the heart of the American economy , " Obama said in a speech at the White House .
" They 're responsible for half of all private sector jobs , and they created roughly 70 % of all new jobs in the past decade .
They 're not only job generators , they 're at the heart of the American Dream . "
Many small businesses , drowning from dried - up coffers and unpaid bills , are having a tough time getting loans from lenders .
" Too many entrepreneurs can't access the capital to start , operate or grow their business , " Obama said .
" Too many dreams are being deferred or denied by a form letter canceling a line of credit . "
The stimulus bill allocated $ 730 million for direct spending on small - business programs , including expanded financial support for the SBA 's two key lending initiatives , the 7 ( a ) and 504 programs .
Under those programs , the SBA guarantees loans made by banks to small - business borrowers .
If the business defaults , the SBA picks up the tab for the insured portion of the loan .

Russia 's President Dmitry Medvedev has proposed reducing the number of time zones spanning his vast country .
He did not say by how many , but Russia currently has 11 time zones .
The BBC's Penny Spiller reports on how Moscow could go about making it happen .
Are times a' changing in Russia ?
At the time of writing this , it is just after 1500 ( GMT+2 ) in Kaliningrad .
People in this west Russian exclave , between Poland and Lithuania , still have a few more hours of work before heading home for their dinner .
In Kamchatka , in the far east of Russia , people have long since left work and had their dinner .
In fact it is 0100 ( GMT +12 ) , and the majority are probably fast asleep in their beds .
In between the two ends of this , the world 's largest country , lie another nine time zones .
President Medvedev said , when he raised the issue in his state of the nation speech , that Russians had " traditionally been accustomed to feeling a pride " in how many time zones the country had " because to us it seemed a vivid illustration of the greatness of our motherland " .
Andrei Ostalski of BBC Russian says that the large number of time zones is one of the factors Russians point to as an example of their country 's greatness .
But not everybody thinks that way , he adds .
" A lot of thinking people have been saying for a very long time that it is actually a problem .
It could explain why Russia has so many problems with governance , " he says .
" It raises lots of questions about whether you can keep a country as big as this together .
Should it be , for instance , a federation ? "
President Medvedev made mention in his speech of the difficulties in having so many time zones .
" Have we ever thought about to what extent such a fractional division allows for an effective governance of our country .
Does it not result in the use of too costly technologies ? "
He pointed out that the US and China - other very large countries - " show that it is possible to cope with a smaller time difference " .
The president did not mention how many time zones might be cut , but Vladivostock Economics University rector Gennady Lazarev told the RIA Novosti news agency that it could be reduced to just four - one each for Kaliningrad , Moscow , the Ural Mountains region and Siberia and the Far East .
Real problems Stephen Dalziel , executive director of the Russo - British Chamber of Commerce ( RBCC ) and a former BBC correspondent , saw first hand the difficulties while on a recent work trip to south - east Russia .
The city of Blagoveshchensk lies on the border with China , some 8,000 km ( 5,000 miles ) and six time zones east of Moscow .
Mr Medvedev wants expert views on the proposals Between Moscow 's working day starting and Blagoveshchensk 's working day ending there is a window of some three hours or so to get business done .
" It does cause businesses there a real problem .
It gives them a very short working day in which to contact Moscow .
It causes even more problems when they want to do business with Europe , " he said .
" I think businesses in Blagoveshchensk would say that even a four hour time difference with Moscow would make things much easier for them . "
Not surprisingly , the number one trading partner for many businesses in Blagoveshchensk is China , which lies just across the Amur river .
But in all other respects , the city is typically Russian , Mr Dalziel says .
Of the business people he met , he said : " They realise that doing business in China makes geographical sense , but they do n't want to be cut off from Moscow , or Europe for that matter . "
So how do you go about changing a country 's time zones ?
Jonathan Betts of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich says it is not actually very difficult .
" It would be done very much in the same way that daylight saving is adopted , " he explained .
" The most important thing is to make sure that everyone knows about it .
If that is done , there should n't be any problems whatsoever . "
It is not just citizens and institutions within the country that need to know .
Other countries also need to be informed , so that international flight times and global telecommunication systems for instance can be changed .
" The only thing that can't be changed is the fact that the sun will not be in the same position that it used to be at a given time , " Mr Betts said .
I think it needs to be thoroughly researched and tested .
It must be demonstrated that there are practical and economic benefits to reducing the number of time zones
Andrei Ostalski , BBC Russian
He points out that while there are sometimes economic and cultural advantages to changing time zones , a political motive often lies behind the move .
This has long been associated with the Chinese Communist Party 's decision to have one time zone - Beijing time - in a country that is so vast it spans five time zones .
The decision to move time in Venezuela back half an hour in 2007 was criticised as an unnecessary attempt by President Hugo Chavez to exert his power - although he insisted an earlier dawn would increase the country 's productivity .
" It is an ultimate statement of power to show your people that you have control over nature in this way , " Mr Betts says .
There is no suggestion that Mr Medvedev is attempting to exert his power with this proposal .
In fact , Andrei Ostalski suggests the president may have intended it to be a populist touch to an otherwise fairly dry state of the nation address .
He thinks the proposals will be taken seriously in Moscow , but hopes that no changes will be made without careful consideration of their effects .
" I think it needs to be thoroughly researched and tested .
It must be demonstrated that there are practical and economic benefits to reducing the number of time zones , " Mr Ostalski said .
Mr Medvedev himself seems to want the same thing .
" I hope that experts will give us an objective , I stress an objective , answer to these questions , " he said in his speech .

( CNN ) -- Oprah Winfrey will announce on Friday 's " The Oprah Winfrey Show " that she will end her talk show , said a spokesman for Winfrey 's Harpo Productions .
" Oprah will be ending her talk show , " Harpo spokesman Don Halcombe said Thursday .
" She will be speaking about it on tomorrow 's live show . "
The show will air live from its Chicago , Illinois , studio at 9 a.m. CT ( 10 a.m. ET ) , he said .
The show will end on September 9 , 2011 , as its 25th season draws to a close , according to a letter from Harpo Inc. that President Tim Bennett addressed to partners and obtained by CNN affiliate WLS - TV .
" Tomorrow , Oprah will announce live on " The Oprah Winfrey Show " that she has decided to end what is arguably one of the most popular , influential and enduring programs in television history , " Bennett wrote .

The show has been the highest - rated talk show for 23 consecutive seasons , according to the Oprah.com site .
It is seen by an estimated 42 million viewers a week in the United States and is broadcast to 145 countries .
The show had its origins in 1984 , when Winfrey moved to Chicago to host WLS - TV's morning talk show , " AM Chicago , " which became the No. 1 local talk show .
The show surpassed ratings for " Donahue " one month after it began , the site said .
Within a year , it had expanded to an hour - long format and been renamed " The Oprah Winfrey Show . "
It entered national syndication in 1986 .
In August 2004 , Winfrey signed an extension for the show to keep it on the air through 2011 .
" I got a call from Oprah , and she told me that she is announcing that next year will be her last year , " talk show host Ellen DeGeneres told her audience Thursday .
" It will be her 25th year , and she feels like it 's time for her to stop .
" I do n't think I could be here without her , " DeGeneres said .
" I think she has blazed a trail .
...
She is an amazing woman .
She will always be the queen of daytime television .
...
She is fantastic , and I love her and I wish her the best .
She deserves to rest .
She has worked really , really hard . "
Over the years , the show has made news on several occasions .
In September 2004 , for instance , Winfrey began a new season by giving each member of the audience a new car .
In May 2005 , Tom Cruise caused a sensation when he jumped up and down on Oprah 's couch , declaring his love for actress Katie Holmes .
Other guests have shared their personal struggles , such as Elizabeth Edwards , wife of former vice presidential candidate John Edwards ; performer Whitney Houston and Lisa Niemi , widow of actor Patrick Swayze .

The show has also served as a launching pad for several experts -- Dr. Mehmet
Oz on nutrition and health ; Suze Orman on financial matters ; Dr. Phil McGraw on families and relationships ; and Martha Beck , a life coach .
McGraw went on to have a talk show of his own .
Along the way , Winfrey has revealed her struggles with weight loss and as a survivor of childhood sexual abuse .
From the talk show , she has created the popular Oprah 's Book Club ; O Magazine ; Oprah 's Angel Network , a charitable foundation ; and co-founded Oxygen Media , a 24 - hour cable channel aimed at women .

In 2008 , Winfrey announced that beginning in 2009 , the Discovery Health Channel would be named OWN : The Oprah Winfrey Network .
The network is " a multi- platform media company designed to entertain , inform and inspire people to live their best lives , " according to Oprah.com .
Harpo Productions has also grown to include Harpo Films .
Winfrey 's wealth was estimated at around $ 1 billion by Forbes in 2004 .
Last year , she topped the Forbes Celebrity 100 list that measures both power and money .
Make sure to check the temperature of your turkey so that it 's properly cooked before you cut into it .
Whether you 're a seasoned cook or it's your first time stuffing a turkey , you likely want the end result to be tasty and easy on the belly .
Yet even experts admit Thanksgiving dinner can be challenging .
" It 's a complicated meal , " said Ben Chapman , food safety specialist and assistant professor of food science at North Carolina State University .
" You 're cooking with something you might only cook once or twice a year .
And you 're cooking for a large group .
As a meal , it 's one of the ones that 's harder to manage . "
Chapman has deciphered myth and family - lore from fact to produce some helpful tips so your meal will at least be safe .
“ The biggest risk comes from undercooking , " Chapman said .
" You also have to worry about cross-contamination , which can happen when countertops , sinks or utensils are n’t being cleaned properly between use with raw meats and other foods . "
MYTH No. 1 : The turkey is cooked when the juices run clear or when the leg pulls away from the bone .
FACT : " Color is not an indicator of safety or doneness , " Chapman said .
Turkey juices do change from raw - meat pink to a clear color as the bird cooks , but that does n't equate with safe eating .
" That is n't necessarily the temperature that the pathogens are killed at , " Chapman said .
The two most common pathogens associated with turkeys , and the ones we aim to blast before serving , are Campylobacter and Salmonella , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) .
These pathogens can't grow until the temperature hits 41 degrees Fahrenheit , and they are killed off when the thermometer reaches 165 degrees F .
How to measure a turkey 's doneness : Stick a tip - sensitive digital thermometer into perhaps eight to 10 spots on the turkey .
If the thermometer reads at least 165 degrees F all around , it can come out .
Chapman says to target areas of thick muscle away from the turkey cavity and bone .
The bone conducts heat much better than does the meat and so could give you a false reading .
MYTH No. 2 : You should cool your turkey to room temperature for a while before putting it in the fridge .
FACT : Decades ago , when people plopped a hot turkey into the refrigerator , the heat would overload the system and lead to spoiled milk .
" This might have been true 30 years ago , but refrigerators today are now built to keep the temperature constant , so while it might be a bit of an energy suck , the safest thing to do is get the leftover meat in the fridge within two hours of removing it from the oven , " Chapman said .
You might be thinking you 've already zapped the harmful bacteria in the oven , so why the need to rush it into the fridge ?
Turns out , between the oven and fridge there 's lots of opportunity for pathogens to take up residence in your turkey meat , Chapman said .
" You might kill the Salmonella and Campylobacter , but as you 're cutting it you might infect the meat with other pathogens , " Chapman said .
For instance , Staphylococcus aureus lives on most of us around our eyes and nose .
But it does n't release its toxins until it has a food source , like turkey meat .
Scratching your nose or rubbing an eye while handling the turkey could give the staph a ride onto the food .
The cold temperatures in your fridge will slow down growth , keeping the pathogen at safe levels .
In addition , a few pathogens may have survived the oven in tiny hideouts and if given the opportunity will take off in growth .
MYTH No. 3 : The best way to thaw a frozen turkey is in the garage .
FACT : " Not a great idea , because you can't really control the external temperature of the turkey , " Chapman said , adding the turkey 's temperature could climb above 41 degrees F , at which point the Salmonella and Campylobacter can begin to grow .
Thawing the turkey on the counter can be problematic , too , as the outside of the bird will reach a different temperature than the inside .
And while there is no " best " thawing technique , Chapman lists a few descent ways : placing it in the fridge , microwave or under cool water .
All methods , however , come with their own risks .
For instance , you have to make sure the turkey 's center gets thawed when in the refrigerator .
According to the USDA , here are guidelines for thawing a whole turkey in the refrigerator :
4 to 12 pounds : one to three days
12 to 16 pounds : three to four days
16 to 20 pounds : four to five days
20 to 24 pounds : five to six days
MYTH No. 4 : You can safely cook a frozen turkey overnight at a low temperature .
FACT : That low temperature could be just what the harmful bugs need to thrive .
" We call that temperature between 41 and 135 degrees the danger zone .
That 's the temperature the pathogens can grow at , " Chapman told LiveScience .
" If you try to cook a turkey low and long , you may be putting the turkey and pathogens in that danger zone for too long , and they 'll grow . "
He added , " About four hours in that danger zone , you can grow Salmonella and Campylobacter to a level that will make people sick . "
And you can expect " a nasty couple of days . "
MYTH No. 5 : Once the turkey is safely cooked , your job as safety cook is done .
FACT : Fresh fruits and vegetables have been linked to more outbreaks of foodborne illness than any other type of food .
Once produce has become contaminated , it can be tricky to shake the bad guys , including Salmonella and E. coli , loose .
That 's partly because bacteria can form tight - knit communities called biofilms that hang on to fruits and veggies .
Rough surfaces like those on cantaloupes and spinach provide lots of nooks and crannies where pathogens can hang out .
For cantaloupes , the bacteria can be transferred from the surface to the internal tissues when preparing .
You 'd want to scrub such produce more thoroughly in cool water .
But too intense of a cleaning could bruise or tear the protective skin covering the food .
The result could be spoilage and the associated bacteria , according to the USDA .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends storing produce that is supposed to be kept cool in the refrigerator at a setting of 40 degrees F or below .
And toss out any bruised or slightly rotting fruits and serve your fresher goods .
[ Back to Essays ] Big Lies Are Big Truths With Small Lies
When we attack the big lies that move people to vicious acts , we commonly underrate humanity .
We assume that they are weak enough or foolish or hateful enough to be moved to action by lies that sound to us blatant and insane .
Most people are decent .
They want to survive ; they want others to survive .
They are not moved merely by stupidity and viciousness .
If we are not to fall once again into old lies , we must understand the power of those lies .
To understand Nazi Germany , Communist Russia and the lies that hold our own society , at best , stagnant , we must understand that it is truth that moves people .
A big lie consists of great truths warped by small lies , hooks in the rich bait of truth .
To understand the big lie , we must unthread its small lies from its great truths .
It is easy to look at the results of such lies with contempt for those who were taken in by them .
How many of us have sneered self - righteously at people who were willing to sacrifice liberty to have the trains run on time ?
And how many of us would not , caught in the endless creep of rush - hour exhaust , sell our souls for an efficient transportation system ?
It is easy to be outraged by death camps , while swallowing without protest daily instruction by the media on which groups are " cults " and , therefore , not worthy of concern , somehow subhuman .
It is not my purpose here to say that unlike things are alike , to say that the killing of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi soldiers in a recent war was , for example , the ethical equivalent of the Holocaust -- only to point out that if we were now at the beginning of a period of boundless viciousness , constructed of our own dearest assumptions , perhaps we would not now know it .
Certainly few virtuous anti-Communist Americans of the 50's knew how nearly their own agreements came to wiping out the entire population of this planet in nuclear holocaust , vastly more destructive than anything the Nazis conceived .
We know this now , looking at the documents of the Cuban missile crisis in 1963 .
Our assumptions about ourselves and the Russians were in place -- a very elaborate set of unchallengable assumptions .
The game was about to play itself out .
The inevitable was narrowly averted -- largely because individuals on both sides violated the rules , opened up live communications with " monsters " on the other side -- and also because one of the monsters backed down , despite the overwhelming big truth that it is disastrous to back down .
There 's an example of a " big truth " -- it is disastrous to back down .
The little lie is what is omitted :
That sometimes it is worse NOT to back down .
Nazi Germany lives on as the historians ' favorite example , the almost universally accepted exemplar of pure evil .
But Hitler 's vision had the power to sweep tens of millions of people into the storm of World War II .
What great truths did Hitler bring to the German people to move them so ?
First , there 's emotional truth .
To people living in fear , rage comes as truth , just as joy is truth to the conservative and stoic conservatism moves the bored and lightly antagonistic -- just as the outpouring of grief reaches one in stone apathy .
Hitler 's rage and pain were real to Germans who were below rage .
It promised the possibility of action , of asserted rightness .
Apathy is nearer to death than grief , grief than fear , fear than anger .
If a cheerful person is overwhelmed and becomes , briefly , apathetic , he will , as part of his recovery , pass through anger .
Anger is , then , on the road to life and recovery for those below anger and nearer to death .
The rolling boil is greeted with vast relief by a people long simmering .
The little lie is in giving anger incorrect targets .
When anger fixes on wrong targets , it will be rebuffed , overwhelmed , knocked back down to apathy , like Don Quixote tilting at windmills or the drunk mad at his boss , crashing through the barroom mirror and taking a swing at the cops when they arrive .
The big truth is that where a nation is fragmented , each alienated from all others , it is necessary to give people something they can agree about -- and also , that a nation must be a nation to survive , must be united , must have agreed - upon goals upon which it can act , that people who move together toward a shared purpose have great power and love for each other .
The little lie is in the agreements themselves -- for example , the agreement that the Jews were responsible for all of Germany 's problems .
That 's obvious stupidity , you say ?
But see what a LITTLE lie it is .
What are a few Jews to a great nation 's survival ?
We sacrifice the rights of a few individuals to achieve a great universal truth , the unity of a nation .
The truth is of a higher order than the lie .
Not so , for the lie invalidates a higher truth , the unity of mankind .
It says that mankind is made up of true men and monsters .
It says that there shall be no unity among men , only endless war of true men against monsters .
Surely what holds for a nation holds for mankind :
We , like all people , achieve power and love for each other by acting together toward shared goals .
Surely the survival of mankind is a higher - order concept than the survival of one nation , for if mankind perished , all nations would perish .
And by the end of World War II , with the emergence of nuclear weapons , we knew that a failure to achieve a unity of all people could lead to the destruction of all people .
Of course , Hitler 's rationale was that the Jews were a plague upon the entire planet and that eventually all nations would join Germany in eliminating them .
He knew he needed to stretch his lie that far to uphold , at least outwardly , the truth that a whole world is greater than any of its nations , a truth he , himself , could not believe .
The little lies that barb great truths are , themselves , loose threads of even greater truths .
Tug on the little lies , and the universe begins to unravel .
It is more difficult to disentangle the great truths of Karl Marx from its little lies -- or Freud 's ball of thread -- or hardest of all , one 's own , the great truths and big lies by which each of us lives .
But one can not live a lie .
The lies give the illusion of supporting life because they are wound like vines about the truths that keep us going , truths that are strangled by the lies that pretend to support them .
Each has his own dearest lies :
They do n't understand me .
It does n't matter .
You can't have everything .
What I do n't know wo n't hurt me .
It 's not my problem .
Nobody cares .
I need to be loved .
It 's a dangerous world .
What 's the use .
They would n't get it .
If I once slow down , I 'm finished .
All blondes are whores .
All whores have hearts of gold .
Pervasive generalities based on old painful decisions persist to color all our truths and slant them subtly -- even the craziest lies lacquered in plausible rationales .
We use them as a stay against chaos , something to hang on to when the winds of chaos would sweep us away .
But often it is only the need to grow that threatens our stability .
Rather than confront what is before us and learn to handle it , we cling to our lies .
Thus , the little lies that hide within our great truths ( for example , the truths of our basic goodness ) keep us from growing , hold us fixed in one place .
One man with a great truth ( for example , that freedom is proportional to responsibility or that an economy prospers from fair exchange or that we hate those we have injured ) can create a civilization , an economy , a relationship , but when sufficiently rebuffed and confused by those who would counter him , falls back upon his little lies , the limiters of his creativity , the still point of a spinning world where he can stand still being right and making others wrong .
The spokesman for responsibilty confuses responsibility with blame ; the pursuer of fair exchange becomes infatuated with vengeance ; the guru of relationships insists we must love everyone .
Each becomes a parody of truth , frozen in an awkward posture .
Strip away the little lies from a big grotesque lie , and you will find a great truth .
Each of us is a great truth .
The MPAA has successfully shut down an entire town 's municipal WiFi because a single user was found to be downloading a copyrighted movie .
Rather than being embarrassed by this gross example of collective punishment ( a practice outlawed in the Geneva conventions ) against Coshocton , OH , the MPAA 's spokeslizard took the opportunity to cry poor ( even though the studios are bringing in record box - office and aftermarket receipts ) .
Mike LaVigne , IT director , said the number of people who access the Internet using the connection varies widely , from perhaps a dozen people a day to 100 during busy times such as First Fridays and the Coshocton Canal Festival .
It 's used by Coshocton County Sheriff 's deputies who can park in the 300 block and complete a traffic or incident report without leaving their vehicle .
Out - of - town business people can park and use their laptops to make connections .
During festival times , vendors find it a convenience to check the status of credit cards being used to make purchases , LaVigne said .
Because it 's a single address used by many people , it 's difficult to tell who made the illegal download , although the county plans to investigate the matter .
PeerBlock is a tool which can control who can connect to your computer on the Internet .
In addition to hindering monitoring by anti-P2P companies , it 's also capable of blocking malicious software .
As the team is currently celebrating more than 100,000 downloads , Torrent Freak caught up with the creators for the lowdown .
Peerblock is a piece of software which lets you control who your computer communicates with on the Internet .
By utilizing lists of ‘ known bad ’ computers , it ’s possible for it to block P2P companies from monitoring a user ’s file - sharing activities , along with spyware and other malicious software .
Just over a month has passed since the first stable public release of the software and PeerBlock has now managed to clock up more than 100,000 downloads .
To mark this milestone , Torrent Freak caught up with Mark from the project for the lowdown .
Mark told us that the creation of PeerBlock was inspired by him upgrading his PC from 32 to 64 bit in order to utilize 6 gb of RAM .
Everything worked fine – until he tried to get PeerGuardian ( another IP blocker ) to work .
Having hacked away and jumped through hoops to get around driver - signing it would still only work half the time and often crashed without warning .
As a software engineer who has worked in the commercial sector for more than 13 years , Mark – who admits to being “ an arrogant bastard who truly believes he can do just about anything better than just about anybody , ” decided he could find a solution .
It was “ put up or shut up time , ” he told Torrent Freak .
Noticing that the PeerGuardian code was open - source but had n’t been touched for a couple of years , Mark contacted another developer who had the same thing in mind , but having heard nothing back , he went at it alone .
“ I started setting up a Sourceforge .
net project for it so we could get free source - control , but they took too long to set it up for me so I instead created a project over at Google Code where it was ready within minutes , ” he told us .
Having heard from a few people who were interested in helping out with the development side – “ night_stalker_z ” who ’d earlier started trying to hack the PG2 code into shape , “ DarC ” / “ DisCoStu ” who wanted to help out with fixing up the installer , XhmikosR who rewrote the installer , and some testers , things moved forward .
After facing troubles due to the lack of a “ signed driver ” for 64 - bit versions of Vista ( which resulted in Mark having to set up a registered company before they were allowed to buy a $ 230 code - signing certificate ) , a couple of blogs wrote articles on PeerBlock which attracted some much - needed publicity to the project .
This resulted in 10,000 downloads in just one weekend .
“ We ’re still getting donations from people and we now have enough to pay for next year ’s annual code - signing certificate , and we ’re saving up to be able to rent our own VPS with full root access etc , upon which we ’ll be able to build a ‘ real ’ online - update system , a custom web - app to tie our forums / issue - tracker / website all together , and some other neat things , ” Mark explains .
The first stable release of PeerBlock came out on September 27th , and as of November 5th had clocked up an impressive 100,000 downloads .
The site now receives up to 7,000 visitors each day .
Aside from fixing one or two bugs , the team has lots of new features planned for PeerBlock .
Anyone that has tried to surf the web with a blocklist in place will know how painful that can be , so PeerBlock will have some new features which allow the “ whitelisting ” of certain apps , such as a browser , the creation of a proxy server to let users configure PeerBlock to listen on certain ports , possibly an integral “ AdMuncher ” style ad - blocking feature on a per URL basis ( as opposed to just an IP - address ) , and an encrypted chat feature .
TorrentFreak asked Mark why users should choose PeerBlock over the competition .
“ Well , first off we need to ask ‘ Who IS the competition ? ’
The only ones I ’m really aware of are : Protowall by the folks over at Bluetack which is closed - source and I do n’t believe was ever updated for Vista , and Outpost Firewall , which is closed - source and basically just a hack add - on to a more professional firewall product , ” he responded , while noting that uTorrent ’s built - in IP - filtering feature only handles one manually - updated list .
“ We protect your entire machine , and give you the option to try out any P2P app you want – this freedom of choice is a very important thing , I think .
And since it does everything automatically , including list - updates , it ’s one less thing to think about , ” he added .
Another important question relates to the blocklists that have to be used in conjunction with PeerBlock in order for it to block anything .
He told Torrent Freak that he ’s a big fan of iblocklist , who serve up a staggering 10 TB of blocklists every month for free .
The site does n’t create the lists , but does offer those from Bluetack , including the Level1 list ( renamed to ‘ P2 P ’ in PG2 / PeerBlock , which contains both Gov and Anti-P2P IP - addresses ) and others .
Mark admits that even in a best case scenario , the available blocklists are n’t 100 % effective .
That said , there have been studies which show that using blocklists along with software such as PeerBlock can help speed up downloads , but no - one knows how many of the potential “ bad IPs ” are covered by currently available blocklists .
P2P aside , Mark says there has been feedback to suggest that PeerBlock discovered a Conficker infection on a user ’s machine that their anti-virus programs missed , and can also stop ads appearing in browsers that lack in - built blocking .
One other exciting thing for the future of PeerBlock is porting it to the Mac .
Mark says they ’re saving all the donations for additional development and this is the most - requested request right now .
Users of PeerBlock are encouraged to give as much feedback as possible to Mark ’s team , via their forums , IRC ( # peerblock on freenode . net ) or email .

The Afghan government could fall within weeks if Nato pulled out troops now , David Miliband warned today as he urged British opponents of the war to give the fight to rebuild the country more time .
In an interview with the Guardian at the end of a visit to Kabul for the presidential inauguration of Hamid Karzai , the foreign secretary said : " If international forces leave , you can choose a time – five minutes , 24 hours or seven days – but the insurgent forces will overrun those forces that are prepared to put up resistance and we would be back to square one . "
At the end of a day spent visiting British troops and officials at the headquarters of the international military effort , Miliband said that Afghans were " sad that they need anyone , but they are passionate that my goodness they do – because if we were n't here their country would be rolled over " .
He agreed that public anxiety about the war is growing in Britain as a result of rising casualties .
" Afghanistan was n't on the front pages until the last six months for obvious reasons , " he said .
" Now for tragic reasons there is a lot of interest .
What we have to do is explain to people that the costs of staying are real but they are less than the costs of leaving . "
He called for the three main party leaders to remain united in support of the war , despite growing unease , in particular from Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrat leader .
" Nick Clegg and David Cameron ask serious questions about different aspects of the campaign .
They can do that , and they should be asked , " Miliband said .
But he challenged opponents of the war to show that retreat would not harm both Afghanistan and Britain .
" I do n't think British opinion is about to flip to a position that says withdraw now , " he said .
" But there is a high degree of concern about the casualties , understandably , there is a high degree of concern about the complexity of effecting a strategy in a country with history as complex as this , and there is a high degree of concern about all the partners that we have got .
" There is a natural reaction to 18 , 19 , 20 - year - olds , your neighbours , relatives and your friends being killed .
It makes you ask , why are we there , can you succeed , is it worth it ? "
Concerns about Karzai's failure to combat bribery and extortion in Afghanistan led Gordon Brown to warn earlier this month that he would not put UK troops " in harm 's way for a government that does not stand up against corruption " .
After meeting Karzai today Miliband said the Afghan president had asked him " to convey to the British people his gratitude for the sacrifices being made by British soldiers in defending his country .
In particular he repeated to me , as he had to the prime minister , his condolences and his shock at the terrible killing of five British soldiers by an Afghan policeman . "
The foreign secretary said Karzai 's estimation of a three - to five - year deadline for the handover of security control to Afghan forces would not mean an end to western involvement .
" My argument is not stay or go , my argument is we stay for a purpose , for a period , for progress , " he said .
" Artificial timetables just give succour to your enemy .
We are going to transition , and transition is a better word than exit .
" The argument we have to take on is the argument that it is futile , and we have to take it on directly by saying that it is making a difference towards a goal – the goal is hard , but the goal is clear . "
Miliband agreed that Britain should look beyond its military efforts in the south of the country .
" It is important we do n't fall into a trap of ' Helmandshire ' , that we are creating a colony , " he said .

As the recession has deepened and the rate of unemployment has risen , a number of commentators have sought , for various reasons , to portray the situation as far graver than the “ official ” rate of unemployment indicates .
Some of these commentators charge that the government is deliberately misrepresenting the amount of unemployment and that the “ real ” rate of unemployment is much greater than the official rate that the government announces and the news media report each month .
I have no desire to claim that the government never hides bad news — indeed , the extent of its blatant lies and outrageous propaganda ought to have provoked public outrage a long time ago — but in the present instance , I believe the critics are the ones who are misrepresenting the situation .
If the government is hiding the bad news about unemployment that the critics are courageously “ revealing , ” it is hiding that bad news in plain sight .
Since 1940 , the Bureau of Labor Statistics has provided a variety of information on the population ’s employment status derived from the Current Population Survey , a rather complicated , stratified random sample of approximately 60,000 households conducted each month .
A BLS website explains how the data are collected .
From these data , various measures of the rate of unemployment may be , and routinely are , computed .
Again , a BLS website lays out these measures for all the world to see , and it makes available the component figures for anyone who wishes to compute a differently defined rate .
Thus , in October 2009 , the most recently reported month , the rate designated U - 3 , which is defined as “ total unemployed , as a percent of the civilian labor force ( official unemployment rate ) , ” stood at 10.2 percent .
The persons classified as unemployed in this measure , the most commonly reported one , are basically those who are not currently working but who have made an attempt to find a job in the past four weeks .
By adding other categories of persons to those regarded as unemployed in the U - 3 measure , one may arrive at greater rates .
The broadest such measure , designated U - 6 , is defined as “ total unemployed , plus all marginally attached workers , plus total employed part time for economic reasons , as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all marginally attached workers . ”
This rate stood at 17.5 percent in October 2009 .
A note attached to the BLS table of unemployment rates explains : “ Marginally attached workers are persons who currently are neither working nor looking for work but indicate that they want and are available for a job and have looked for work sometime in the recent past .
Discouraged workers , a subset of the marginally attached , have given a job - market related reason for not looking currently for a job .
Persons employed part time for economic reasons are those who want and are available for full - time work but have had to settle for a part - time schedule . ”
One does not need to devote a lifetime to studying how these statistics are defined and measured to realize that in many ways they tend to overstate how dire the unemployment situation really is .
For example , the persons classified as in the labor force but currently unemployed must have actively sought a job during the past four weeks , but a wide variety of actions qualifies as evidence that they have actively sought a job , including : ( 1 ) “ contacting : an employer directly or having a job interview ; a public or private employment agency ; friends or relatives ; a school or university employment center ” ; ( 2 ) “ sending out resumes or filling out applications ” ; ( 3 ) “ placing or answering advertisements ” ; ( 4 ) ” checking union or professional registers ” ; and ( 5 ) “ some other means of active job search . ”
So , if you are out of work and tell the CPS data collector that three weeks ago you asked Uncle Charlie whether he knew of any job openings , then you qualify as officially unemployed , even though you made no other effort to find employment .
Many of those classified as “ marginally attached workers ” and included in the U - 6 measure are even more questionable .
After all , they admit that they are neither working nor doing anything to find work .
Merely saying that “ they want and are available for a job and have looked for work sometime in the recent past , ” though not in the past four weeks , does not evince much genuine interest in employment .
Strange to say , many commentators have insisted , from the very onset of the current recession , that we are plunging into a second Great Depression .
Perhaps we are , but the evidence to date does not confirm such a plunge .
Yes , by taking an extremely loose view of what constitutes unemployment , we can say that perhaps one worker in six is now out of work .
But in 1933 , the official rate of unemployment was nearly 25 percent , and perhaps another 25 percent of the labor force comprised persons working part - time who wanted to work full - time , so the U - 6 rate at that time ( long before the requisite data for such an estimate were routinely collected ) was in the neighborhood of 50 percent — and that at a time when workers ’ earnings and assets were much less than they are now and hence long spells without work correspondingly more frightening .
Small wonder if a typical scene from the early 1930s shows dejected workers standing on the sidewalk in a soup line , whereas the typical queue nowadays is more likely to show cheerful customers waiting to be seated in an upscale restaurant .
The year 2009 may not be the best of years , but it ’s miles away from 1933 .
Black Friday brought out the rowdy side of Wal - Mart shoppers early this morning when the Upland location shut down for more than two hours after customers caused a ruckus inside .
Store management called Upland police at 2:44 a.m. , asking for assistance in dealing with customers who were “ fighting inside , ” said Lt. Jim Etchason .
About 300 people were in the store , which had remained open all night as a security precaution after a Wal - Mart worker on Long Island , N.Y. , was trampled to death last year on Black Friday when a surging , impatient crowd rushed the doors after the store opened .
But in Upland , employees said , customers began tearing into merchandise that had been shrink - wrapped and were supposed to be opened at 5 a.m .
“ This was without a doubt the worst I ’ve ever seen it , ” said one employee , who said she has worked a dozen Black Fridays .
“ They would n’t let people line up , ” she added .
“ They were belligerent .
They just bombarded the store . ”
Several officers were sent and stood by as shoppers were kicked out and the store closed down , Etchason said .
The bargain hunters were told to line up in the parking lot .
Meanwhile , the carts were emptied and all the items returned to the shelves , employees said .
But they said that outside , people began “ yelling and screaming , ” pounding on the glass doors and trying to sneak into the store through the lawn and garden section .
Store managers had to be sent outside to try to calm the crowd , workers said .
“ It was scary , ” one said .
But when police officers left at 6:15 a.m. , “ everyone was behaving themselves , ” Etchason said .
The store had reopened a bit before 6 a.m. , allowing customers inside in groups of 30 , and “ people were proceeding inside in an orderly fashion . ”
No arrests were made , and no injuries were reported .
By 9 a.m. , the store seemed back to normal , with packed shopping carts and long checkout lines .

NEW YORK --
Talk about a freak -- Tim Lincecum needed just 15 wins to bag another NL Cy Young Award .
Yup , throw out those old baseball cards .
Wins and losses do n't mean much anymore when it comes time for voters to pick baseball 's best pitchers .
It 's all about WHIP , FIP , BABIP and other lines of alphabet soup .
" It 's turned into a game of complete numbers and statistics and what people do with that , " Lincecum said .
Lincecum won the Cy Young Award on Thursday for the second straight year , emerging from one of the tightest votes in the history of the honor to become the first repeat winner since Randy Johnson .
Only 10 points separated the top three vote - getters .
Chris Carpenter was second and St. Louis teammate Adam Wainwright finished third despite getting the most first - place votes .
Lincecum , nicknamed " The Freak " for his giant stride , led the NL with 261 strikeouts and tied for the league lead with four complete games and two shutouts .
The wiry right - hander attracts plenty of attention on the mound with his shoulder - length brown hair and twisting delivery .
But it was his 15 victories -- the fewest for a Cy Young starter over a non-shortened season -- that were really noticeable for the award winner .
The 2009 honors for Lincecum and Kansas City Royals ace Zack Greinke reflect a recent shift in how pitchers are evaluated .
The focus has changed to more developed statistics , including some that even take into account team defense .
Greinke equaled the previous low of 16 wins for a non-shortened season when he won the AL award on Tuesday .
Afterward , he talked all about FIP , a mathematician 's dream that stands for Fielding Independent Pitching .
Lincecum has his own favorite indicator .
" To say which one I look to the most , I would just say WHIP , " he said , referring to walks plus hits allowed per inning , " just because you just limit the amount of baserunners that can hurt you . "

One reason the record industry ’s strategy of suing online infringers ran into trouble is that there are too many infringers to sue .
If the industry can only sue a tiny fraction of infringers , then any individual infringer will know that he is very unlikely to be sued , and deterrence will fail .
Or so it might seem — until you read The Dynamics of Deterrence , a recent paper by Mark Kleiman and Beau Kilmer that explains how to deter a great many violators despite limited enforcement capacity .
Consider the following hypothetical .
There are 26 players , whom we ’ll name A through Z. Each player can choose whether or not to “ cheat ” .
Every player who cheats gets a dollar .
There ’s also an enforcer .
The enforcer knows exactly who cheated , and can punish one ( and only one ) cheater by taking $ 10 from him .
We ’ll assume that players have no moral qualms about cheating — they ’ll do whatever maximizes their expected profit .
This situation has two stable outcomes , one in which nobody cheats , and the other in which everybody cheats .
The everybody - cheats outcome is stable because each player figures that he has only a 1/26 chance of facing enforcement , and a 1/26 chance of losing $ 10 is not enough to scare him away from the $ 1 he can get by cheating .
It might seem that deterrence does n’t work because the cheaters have safety in numbers .
It might seem that deterrence can only succeed by raising the penalty to more than $ 26 .
But here comes Kleiman and Kilmer ’s clever trick .
The enforcer gets everyone together and says , “ Listen up , A through Z . From now on , I ’m going to punish the cheater who comes first in the alphabet . ”
Now A will stop cheating , because he knows he ’ll face certain punishment if he cheats .
B , knowing that A wo n’t cheat , will then realize that if he cheats , he ’ll face certain punishment , so B will stop cheating .
Now C , knowing that A and B wo n’t cheat , will reason that he had better stop cheating too .
And so on … with the result that nobody will cheat .
Notice that the trick still works even if punishment is not certain .
Suppose each cheater has an 80 % chance of avoiding detection .
Now A is still deterred , because even a 20 % chance of being fined $ 10 outweighs the $ 1 benefit of cheating .
And if A is deterred , then B is deterred for the same reason , and so on .
Notice also that this trick might work even if some of the players do n’t think things through .
Suppose A through J are all smart enough not to cheat , but K is clueless and cheats anyway .
K will get punished .
If he cheats again , he ’ll get punished again .
K will learn quickly , by experience , that cheating does n’t pay .
And once K learns not to cheat , the next clueless player will be exposed and will start learning not to cheat .
Eventually , all of the clueless players will learn not to cheat .
Finally , notice that there ’s nothing special about using alphabetical order .
The enforcer could use reverse alphabetical or any other order , and the same logic would apply .
Any ordering will do , as long as each player knows where he is in the order .
Now let ’s apply this trick to copyright deterrence .
Suppose the RIAA announces that from now on they ’re going to sue the violators who have the lowest U.S. IP addresses .
Now users with low IP addresses will have a strong incentive to avoid infringing , which will give users with slightly higher IP addresses a stronger incentive to avoid infringing , and so on .
You might object that infringers are n’t certain to get caught , or that infringers might be clueless or irrational , or that IP address order is arbitrary .
But I explained above why these objections are n’t necessarily showstoppers .
Players might still be deterred even if detection is a probability rather than a certainty ; clueless players might still learn by experience ; and an arbitrary ordering can work perfectly well .
Alternatively , the industry could use time as an ordering , by announcing , for example , that starting at 8:00 PM Eastern time tomorrow evening , they will sue the first 1000 U.S. users they see infringing .
This would make infringing at 8:00 PM much riskier than normal , which might keep some would - be infringers offline at that hour , which in turn would make infringing at 8:00 PM even riskier , and so on .
The resulting media coverage ( “ I infringed at 8:02 and now I ’m facing a lawsuit ” ) could make the tactic even more effective next time .
( While IP address or time ordering might work , many other orderings are infeasible .
For example , they ca n’t use alphabetical ordering on the infringers ’ names , because they do n’t learn names until later in the process .
The ideal ordering is one that can be applied very early in the investigative process , so that only cases at the beginning of the ordering need to be investigated .
IP address and time ordering work well in this respect , as they are evident right away and are evident to would - be infringers . )
I ’m not claiming that this trick will definitely work .
Indeed , it would be silly to claim that it could drive online infringement to zero .
But there ’s a chance that it would deter more infringers , for longer , than the usual approach of seemingly random lawsuits has managed to do .
This approach has some interesting implications for copyright policy , as well .
I ’ll discuss those next time .
DECEMBER 17 --The Lingerie Football League , where bikini - clad women grapple on the gridiron , is threatening legal action against a group of former players who have complained that the league has reneged on promises to pay the medical bills for women injured during practices and games .
In a December 10 letter , a lawyer for the league warned nine ex-players that " evidence gathered " showed that the women had " participated in the posting " of false information online ( apparently on Facebook and MySpace pages ) .
The letter , a copy of which you 'll find here , is the latest heavy - handed tactic employed by the struggling 10 - team league , which launched about three months ago with the laughable assertion that it was " one of television 's biggest commercial properties . "
According to several former players , league founder Mitchell Mortaza and his deputies have repeatedly threatened legal action when players have complained ( or simply inquired ) about health coverage and wages .
In an e-mail exchange , Mortaza declined to comment on the letter , but he wished TSG " the best of luck with your story , especially the elements that you obtained illegally which is actionable . "
Mortaza , a former " Blind Date " contestant whose rap sheet includes drunk driving and public intoxication arrests , is the league 's chief enforcer .
In an October e-mail to a player who had written to him about disorganized practices , Mortaza responded , " Let me give you a little advice and this goes for any other player creating unnecessary , drama .
Simply SHUT UP and play football . "
He added that he wished the woman stopped attending practices " so we have reason to terminate you and assess the termination fine . "
That fine --$ 5000 - - is detailed in the league 's standard player contract , which also warns of a $ 500 fine if a woman wears any " additional garments " underneath her lingerie uniform .
The league , an ex-player told TSG , did not want women wearing bras or underwear , since that would inhibit instances where players were exposed when uniforms were ripped off or pulled down during play .
Such " accidental nudity " is addressed in the contract , which requires a player to " knowingly and voluntarily " agree to such inadvertent exposure .
Other e-mails from league officials show them threatening to file a stolen property report with the Chicago Police Department over a uniform that one ex-player purportedly did not return .
That woman was warned that the league 's " outside law firm in Chicago will be pressing charges and making certain there is a bench warrant issued ... We are also actively building a slander case against you and will be filing when ready because of your sustained false accusations .
We are subpoening records from several public internet websites . "
In an e-mail to members of the Chicago Bliss , the team 's coach , Keith Hac , ripped his players as " irresponsible children " after an " alcohol related incident " at a promotional event .
Hac noted that he took " full responsibility " for the incident , adding that , " I should never have allowed the drinking on the bus in the first place ( several underage girls ) and I should have not allowed it to continue as long as it did . "
Hac concluded with this helpful advice : " Stop acting like a bunch of Chicago Bliss tee - shirt wearing bimbos when the liquor starts flowing . " ( 4 pages )

You can turn the LEDs off and use it as a normal table as well .
It costs $ 1500 to $ 2100 .

When viewing Beck as a baffoon , one can't help but laugh at him and the people who adore him ( yes , that 's the right word ) .
Mark
Twain once said : " Against the assault of laughter nothing can stand . "
The problem with Beck as I see it , is that we 're laughing at the wrong person .
Beck enjoys the laughter he gets from his critics .
In fact , it energizes him .
His ego is still growing and he loves every minute of derision .
However , we should be laughing at the people who watch / listen to his shows .
They should be cringing with humiliation .
So we should hoist aloft a campaign to make sure that America knows Beck 's audience to have the cumulative IQ of a dead flashlight battery .
We should have SNL sketches devoted to idiots watching Glen Beck .
Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert should devote whole segments on Glen Beck supporters with misspelled signs , interviews with illiterate Beckies across the country , and special features about how some of them are paying $ 500 a drop for Beck 's tears ( Vicks Vaporub not included ) .
Nah , it wo n't float .
Why not ?
Because Beckies transcend humiliation : they are too stupid to even surmise that someone is laughing at them .
So what should we do with this large crowd ( according to his ratings ) of idiots ?
The King of Fools Has Been Crowned !
Long Live The King !!!

Severe thunderstorms have begun developing in Queensland 's south with large hail falling on the Granite Belt .
Forecaster Michael Knepp says one rain gauge at Stanthorpe has measured about 15 millimetres of rain in as many minutes .
He says the thunderstorms are slow moving - and that means they could produce large hail and flash flooding .
" It 's really started to explode on our radar in the last 10 to 20 minutes , " Mr Knepp said .
" We probably can expect towards Toowoomba and along the ranges activity in the next few hours - maybe continuing into the evening . "
Hail the size of marbles has been reported at Stanthorpe .
The Weather Bureau says that because the cells are moving very slowly , it may be hours before they reach the coast .
Emergency Management Queensland says the quiet start to the storm season may change this afternoon .
Director of Disaster Management Mike Shapland says this may have caused people to become complacent and not be as well prepared as they should .
" People can still take a number of steps today to prepare for the possibility of a storm this afternoon or this evening , " he said .
" It is particularly important that residents ensure their gutters are clear to avoid water backing up in their drains .
" They should make sure all outdoor furniture is secured so that it can not become a projectile if the winds pick up .
The weather bureau says places that may be affected over the next few hours include Warwick , Toowoomba , Stanthorpe , Boonah , Oakey , Millmerran , Crows Nest , Allora , Clifton , Pittsworth , Jondaryan and Yarraman .
The words blond and blonde come from the French and follow somewhat the French pattern .
Blond ( without the e ) is used to describe males , mixed gender , or uncertain gender .
Blonde refers to women or female gender .
In modern use , blond is sometimes used for female as well as male , but blonde is preferred for female .

Editor 's note : Sir Ken Robinson , Ph.D , an expert in creativity , innovation and human resources , gave this popular talk at the TED conference in 2006 .
In this article he explores why the message has resonated with audiences .
Robinson is a best - selling author whose latest book is " The Element : How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything ( Viking ) . "
He received a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II in 2003 for his service to the arts and education .
( CNN ) -- I spoke at TED in 2006 , the year they started to put the talks online .
I 'm told that since then , the talk has been downloaded more than 3.5 million times in more than 200 countries .
The number of people who 've seen it may be 20 times that or more .
I have a stream of e-mails , tweets and blog posts round the world from young people , parents , students , teachers , cultural activists and business leaders of all sorts .
They tell me how deeply they relate to the talk and often that they 've seen or shown it many times at meetings , conferences , workshops and retreats .
Parents tell me they 've shown it to their children ; young people tell me they 've shown it to their parents .
They say they 've laughed and sometimes cried together and had a different sort of conversation as a result .
Changing the conversation is one of the primary purposes of TED .
Why has this talk had such an impact ?
I think there are several reasons .
To begin with , the talk is short .
The 18 - minute talk is part of the genius of TED .
In a world of instant messaging , rampant data and overspecialization , brevity is a virtue .
( Even so , I 've seen blogs that strongly recommend the talk but warn that it 's almost 20 minutes long . )
A second factor is that , based on the audience 's reaction , the talk is entertaining and funny at times , which always helps .
And I 'd just had my hair cut .
We may never know how much that simple act contributed to the global appeal of the talk .
But the real reason for its impact is that what I 'm saying clearly resonates deeply with people of all ages and across many different cultures .
I believe that the argument is becoming more urgent by the day .
What is the argument ?
In a nutshell , it 's that we 're all born with immense natural talents but our institutions , especially education , tend to stifle many of them and as a result we are fomenting a human and an economic disaster .
In education , this vast waste of talent involves a combination of factors .
They include a narrow emphasis on certain sorts of academic work ; the exile of arts , humanities and physical education programs from schools ; arid approaches to teaching math and sciences ; an obsessive culture of standardized testing and tight financial pressures to teach to the tests .
The result is a disastrous waste of talent among students and their teachers .
To sense the scale of this disaster , you only have to look at the alarming rates of turnover among faculty and the levels of drop out , disaffection , stress and prescription drug use among students .
Even for students who stay the course and do well in education , the rules of success have changed irrevocably .
Just look at the plummeting value of college degrees .
The waste of talent in education is not deliberate .
Teachers are as anxious about this as everyone else , but many of them feel trapped in the awkward groping of national reform policies , many of which misunderstand the problems as well as the solutions .
The waste of talent is n't deliberate , but it is systematic .
It happens in part because the dominant systems of education are rooted in the values and demands of industrialism : they are linear , mechanistic and focused on conformity and standardization .
Nowadays , they 're buttressed by major commercial interests in mass testing and by the indiscriminate use of prescription drugs that keep students ' minds from wandering to things they naturally find more interesting .
The tragedy is that meeting the many social , economic , spiritual and environmental challenges we now face depends absolutely on the very capacities of insight , creativity and innovation that these systems are systematically suppressing in yet another generation of young people .
Reforming these systems is not enough .
The truth is that we are caught up in a cultural and economic revolution .
This revolution is global in scale and unpredictable in nature .
To meet it , we need a revolution in the culture of education .
This new culture has to emerge from a richer sense of human ability .
To shape it , I believe we have to leave behind the manufacturing principles of industrialism and embrace the organic principles of ecology .
Education is about developing human beings , and human development is not mechanical or linear .
It is organic and dynamic .
Like all living forms , we flourish in certain conditions and shrivel in others .
Great teachers , great parents and great leaders understand those conditions intuitively ; poor ones do n't .
The answer is not to standardize education , but to personalize and customize it to the needs of each child and community .
There is no alternative .
There never was .
The good news is that all around the world there are wonderful examples of people and organizations that are making determined efforts to do things differently in education -- and in business , health care , architecture , communities and cultural programs .
There are examples of these all over the TED Web site and in the expanding ripples of the TED prizes .
TED itself is a great example of the spirit of collaboration and inter-disciplinarily that is the essential to a genuine culture of creativity .
What are the principles of this culture ?
Towards the end of my talk , I mention a book I was working on called " Epiphany . "
It was published this year under a much better title , " The Element : How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything " ( Viking ) and is now in 11 languages .
It draws on conversations with people in science , business , education , the arts , sports and more on how they found in themselves the talents and passions that have shaped their lives .
But the book is not about them : it 's about you and your children , if you have any ; and your friends too , if you have any of those .
There 's a wealth of talent that lies in all of us .
All of us , including those who work in schools , must nurture creativity systematically and not kill it unwittingly .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sir Ken Robinson .
Redwood City , California - Electronic
Arts has acquired the assets of Sierra Entertainment from Activision Blizzard for $ 20 million and plans to merge the popular Tiger Woods PGA Golf franchise with the Leisure Suit Larry series to more clearly reflect the lifestyle of the best golfer in the world .
Mary Cameron , director of marketing for EA , said , " We could view the recent revelations about the life of Tiger Woods as a detriment , but we 'd rather see it as an opportunity for growth . "
The game will have gameplay elements of both series incorporated into the new franchise .
Players can choose to play Tiger Woods as golfer and philanderer or Larry as Tiger 's caddy and partner in crime .
Players will need to score on and off the course to achieve higher levels .
" There 's a stealth aspect of the game as well , " said Cameron .
" If Tiger or Larry get caught , then they 'll have lose status and money .
It 's cheaper to pay off the floozies . "
Many wondered why Tiger Woods would agree to have his image attached to a sleazy game while he 's trying to polish his tarnished image .
" With all the pictures we have of him and our talented graphic artists , we were able to provide all the leverage we needed , " said Cameron .
" He decided it was in his best interest to go along . "

This is n't the first time EA has tried to blend sports with sex .
Back in 1985 the company tried to put together One - on - One : Dr. J and Larry Bird with the Atari 2600 classic Custer 's Revenge , but were unable to get clearance to depict Larry Bird naked .
The game is scheduled to hit shelves in time for Summer 2010 .

This sheds some light on why they 're not all that eager to legalize drugs , huh ?
Shades of BCCI :
Drugs money worth billions of dollars kept the financial system afloat at the height of the global crisis , the United Nations ' drugs and crime tsar has told the Observer .
Antonio Maria Costa , head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime , said he has seen evidence that the proceeds of organized crime were " the only liquid investment capital " available to some banks on the brink of collapse last year .
He said that a majority of the $ 352bn ( £ 216bn ) of drugs profits was absorbed into the economic system as a result .
This will raise questions about crime 's influence on the economic system at times of crisis .
It will also prompt further examination of the banking sector as world leaders , including Barack Obama and Gordon Brown , call for new International Monetary Fund regulations .
Speaking from his office in Vienna , Costa said evidence that illegal money was being absorbed into the financial system was first drawn to his attention by intelligence agencies and prosecutors around 18 months ago .
" In many instances , the money from drugs was the only liquid investment capital .
In the second half of 2008 , liquidity was the banking system 's main problem and hence liquid capital became an important factor , " he said .
Some of the evidence put before his office indicated that gang money was used to save some banks from collapse when lending seized up , he said .

Yesterday I gave you a teaser about my gingerbread house adventure – you get the full story today !
A week ago ( last Sunday – when I blogged about exercise ) I took the subway out to Flushing to visit my ( Bobby ’s ) aunt and uncle .
Auntie
Jo had offered a while ago to teach me how to make real gingerbread houses – the recipe was from her German housekeeper ( I think she said it ’s from 45 years ago ) .
I jumped at the opportunity – Auntie Jo is so sweet and I love learning new things about baking .
When I got there we got breakfast ( see this post for my New York bagel ) .
Auntie
Jo had made the dough the night before ( you have to chill it ) so when we got back , we started with the baking process .
Here is the recipe ( hand - typed from Auntie Jo ’s recipe book ) :
It says …
GINGERBREAD HOUSES ( from Cookie Cookery )
Mix together until smooth :
1 cup shortening ( 2 bars )
1 cup light brown sugar
3/4 cup molasses

<— End Recipes —>
This was the baking station : a beautiful recipe book ( handmade ) , a cutting board , cardboard cutouts ( for making the house shapes ) , flour , a rolling pin .
The dough is in that metal bowl .
First , you flour the cutting board .
Then you roll out the dough ( with a rolling pin ) until it ’s about 1/4 – 1/8 inches thick .
Use the cardboard shapes to cut out the pieces for the house .
Auntie
Jo showed me how to scoop under the dough before cutting it out so that it comes off the cutting board more easily .
I had fun cutting out the pieces !
Mine were not as nicely shaped as Auntie Jo’s , but she has more practice than I do ( I ’ll keep trying ) .
Duke ( Ellington ) kept us company :
( He did n’t get any gingerbread . )
After we did the houses , we still had dough left , so we did some cutouts – that ’s a carrot cookie cutter .
It is so cute .
The house pieces came out and we put them in the garage to cool :
While they cooled , we took a break …
… To eat cinnamon toast with butter and hot tea with milk and sugar .
Uncle Morris DJ ’d and played us some lovely jazz music while we baked that afternoon .
Then it was time to make the icing .
We did n’t use a double boiler ; we just boiled water in a pan and put the metal bowl with the icing batter inside .
And we beat the icing in the mixer – beautiful .
We used a pastry tube thing to squeeze the icing ( like glue ) and put the houses together .
The roofs go on last .
We actually ended up with an extra base , so I put a heart on it and gave it to Bobby .
After I put on the roofs , I packed up the houses and took them home to finish decorating ( it was late ) .
I just decorated them yesterday ( Saturday ) , and this is how they came out :
I used gummy bears and chocolate chips .
I ’m giving them to my coworkers and my cousin ( in - law - to - be ) .
I think they make great gifts – I ’ll definitely be making them next year too .
Thank you Auntie Jo for teaching me !
And to Uncle Morris for great company 🙂
I ’m actually on my own now …
Bobby is en route to Miami ( should touch down in about 25 minutes ) and I miss him .
But I ’ll see him on Wednesday .
I ’m still missing the cats , too .
Have you ever made gingerbread houses ?
Do you give baked goods as presents ?
What are your favorite things to make ?
The Airfoil Speakers Touch Situation
Regarding today ’s aforelinked tale from Rogue Amoeba regarding the four - month - long process to get a minor bug - fix update to Airfoil Speakers Touch published on the App Store , several readers who insist upon defending Apple in this matter have pointed me to Jeff LaMarche ’s response .
LaMarche writes :
I ’m going to risk the ire of the maddening crowd once more , but I think somebody needs to come to Apple ’s defense this time .
I love a good mob scene as much as the next guy , and I keep my pitchfork nice and sharp just in case the need should arise .
But … the picture that Rogue Amoeba has painted in their farewell post does n’t look quite so black and white to me .
Certainly , Apple could have handled many things about the situation better , but so could have Rogue Amoeba .
Let ’s strip it down to the basics .
Airfoil Speakers
Touch included pictures of Apple products ;
These were images owned by Apple ;
The iPhone SDK Agreement specifically prohibits the use of images , icons , and logos owned by Apple in iPhone applications ;
The first rejection clearly and unambiguously stated why the app was being rejected and how it could be fixed .
There is much that is wrong with LaMarche ’s synopsis .
Point 1 is simply wrong ; the Airfoil Speakers Touch iPhone app does not contain any of these images .
It contains no pictures of Apple computers .
It contains no icons of Apple applications .
It displays these images after they are sent across the network by Airfoil for Mac. Airfoil for Mac reads these images using public official Mac OS X APIs .
I.e. Airfoil Speakers
Touch can only show a picture of the Mac it is connected to because the image is sent from the Mac it is connected to .
Point 3 , I disagree with .
I ’ve just re-read the entire iPhone SDK Agreement ( again ) , and I find no clause that prohibits what Airfoil Speakers Touch was doing .
Here ’s section 3.2 ( d ) , which is perhaps what LaMarche is referring to ( bold emphasis added ) :
1
(d) To the best of Your knowledge and belief , Your Application and Licensed Application Information do not and will not violate , misappropriate , or infringe any Apple or third party copyrights , trademarks , rights of privacy and publicity , trade secrets , patents , or other proprietary or legal rights ( e.g. musical composition or performance rights , video rights , photography or image rights , logo rights , third party data rights , etc. for content and materials that may be included in Your Application ) ;
One can argue that Airfoil Speakers Touch is somehow “ violating ” , “ misappropriating ” , or “ infringing ” on Apple trademarks here .
I would strongly disagree , and argue instead that Airfoil Speakers Touch was using these images very much appropriately .
And note that the SDK agreement does not state you cannot “ use ” Apple trademarks .
There ’s also section 2.6 :
This Agreement does not grant
You any rights to use any trademarks , logos or service marks belonging to Apple , including but not limited to the iPhone or iPod word marks .
If You make reference to any Apple products or technology or use Apple ’s trademarks ,
You agree to comply with the published guidelines at http://www.apple.com/legal/trademark/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html, as modified by Apple from time to time .
This clearly suggests that iPhone apps can make use of Apple trademarks , if they comply with the terms of Apple ’s guidelines .
I ’ve read that document , too , and see no clause therein which would suggest that what Airfoil Speakers Touch was doing was in violation of the guidelines .
In his write - up regarding the situation , Rogue Amoeba ’s Paul Kafasis includes this bit from their App Store rejection notice :
Apple Logo and Apple - owned Graphic Symbols :
You may not use the Apple Logo or any other Apple - owned graphic symbol , logo , or icon on or in connection with web sites , products , packaging , manuals , promotional / advertising materials , or for any other purpose except pursuant to an express written trademark license from Apple , such as a reseller agreement .
That ’s less ambiguous .
However , note that this language is not contained within the SDK agreement itself .
The only way Rogue Amoeba got this language was by designing , building , and submitting the application that did it .
( And this gets to LaMarche ’s fourth point , wherein he claims the notice was “ unambiguous ” .
It was not .
It did not state where Rogue Amoeba had violated this rule .
Was it the Mac icons ?
The app icons ?
Both ?
Rogue Amoeba was left to guess — and , when they asked for clarification , left to wait . )
Is Apple within their rights to reject this app for this reason ?
Sure .
The bottom line is that they can reject apps for whatever reasons they want — that ’s the rule that matters here .
But was Rogue Amoeba foolish for designing their application this way ?
No .
There ’s nothing in the SDK agreement that they ’ve violated .
It ’s just good design .
In UI design , just as in cinema , it is almost always better to show rather than tell .
How else can you show which computer the Airfoil iPhone client is connected to ?
Apple certainly agrees with the design — showing an icon of the machine is exactly how their own Remote app solves the same UI problem .
Obviously , the iPhone Remote app is Apple ’s own app , so they ca n’t be accused of violating / misappropriating / infringing their own trademark .
But if the de facto rule is “ Apple can show a representation of the computer its iPhone apps connect to , but third - party developers can ’t ” , that does n’t exactly refute Rogue Amoeba ’s conclusion that developing for this platform just is n’t worth it .
Nov. 18 , 2009  --
New guidelines saying women between the ages of 40 and 50 should not receive mammograms to screen for breast cancer have met a groundswell of rejection from many medical centers , breast cancer survivors and numerous doctors -- some of whom have advised their patients to ignore the recommendation .
The American Cancer Society and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology are among the many groups that supported the old guidelines and have stood firmly by them since the United States Preventive Services Task Force released its new recommendations Monday evening .
The USPSTF , a panel of independent medical experts , said it was recommending against annual mammograms for women between the ages of 40 and 49 , saying the risks outweighed the benefits from earlier screening .
That announcement , which goes against a trend of recommending increased screening by cancer agencies , has left many confused .
Meanwhile , doctors ' offices and hospitals have been fielding calls from women wanting to know what these new guidelines will mean for them .
One of these calls came not from a woman concerned about getting breast cancer but one who has already had it .
Beth Thompson , 44 , a mother of four who lives in the suburbs of Baltimore , Md. , was first diagnosed with breast cancer following a mammogram at the age of 40 .
" I had no risk factors and no family history , " Thompson told ABCNews.com .
" Under the new guidelines I would n't be screened .
That 's why I 'm so upset about this .
I firmly believe I would not be here today if I had not had a screening mammogram at 40 . "
Thompson explained that in removing the tumor detected by the mammogram , doctors found a faster - growing one underneath , one that would not have been found until it became a palpable lump .
" It really makes me shudder to think of what a different situation I would have been in if that were the case , " she said , explaining that she needed four surgeries , four rounds of chemotherapy and took Herceptin , an adjuvant for an aggressive form of breast cancer , for a year .
" That 's the treatment that I needed even for an early - stage cancer , " Thompson said .
" There 's just no reason that I would have been screened and no way that it would have been found at the time , except for mammography . "
According to most medical centers that ABC News has heard from , the new screening guidelines will not be followed .
M.D. Anderson , the Mayo Clinic , Baylor College of Medicine and Fox Chase Cancer Center were among many hospitals that said they are sticking with the current guidelines , recommended by the American Cancer Society .
In recent months , some sentiment has arisen opposing increased screening .
A study released in September brought to light some of the potential risks of a false positive .
While efforts have been made to increase cancer screening , many patients are unaware of the potential consequences of a false positive , including unnecessary anxiety , testing and possibly treatment .
" [ Some ] women do n't understand how screening can cause problems , " said Dr. Bob Crittenden , an associate professor in family medicine at the University of Washington .
" Personally , I think this is symptomatic of many in people in medicine promising good health if you get screened .
As we know with PSAs and other screenings of asymptomatic people , we have only a few things we can do that actually help extend life and then usually only marginally . "
Crittenden explained that in his own practice , patients are screened if they would like before age 50 and screenings are strongly encouraged after that age .
Several family doctors contacted by ABC News said the recommendations reflect some of the sentiment against screenings because of the possibility of unnecessary treatments , and expressed hopes that they will lead to more open conversations about mammograms and cancer screening with patients .
Sources of Medical Opposition
Dr. Gary Lyman , a breast cancer oncologist at Duke University who researches comparative effectiveness , says guidelines like those issued by the USPSTF may cause a great deal of harm .
" This is a reversal of the position they took in their previous recommendations , and this flies in the face of previous guidelines from other groups in the U.S. , " he said .
" [ While ] the risk of breast cancer is less in the younger age group , 40 to 50 , mammograms save lives in those age groups . "
Lyman said his primary criticism is that in between the last set of screening guidelines in 2002 and the current ones , only one study has come out in the area , and it did nothing to change what doctors know about mammograms .
" I 'm puzzled why , when the evidence has n't really changed , when the estimate in benefit and risk has n't really changed , why they reversed their position , " he said .
Lyman said he was also worried about potential confusion among women over 50 , since under the new guidelines they are being told to get screened every other year , while previously they had been told to get screened every year .
" I do n't know if we know that 's going to cause harm or not , " he said .
" What I 'm worried about the most , however , is confusion on the part of women and their physicians that may make them question whether mammograms will do anything . "
His concerns were borne out in at least one New York hospital on Tuesday .
" I spoke to our breast imaging department today and they said that the ' no - show ' rate doubled today , " said Dr. Susan K. Boolbol , the Chief of Breast Surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York .
" That means that twice as many patients today decided not to show for their mammogram appointment .
That is a very concerning rate .
We will monitor this to see if it continues . "
But Boolbol said she is also concerned that " controversies such as these really create a feeling of mistrust for the medical community at large . "
Lyman said the benefits of mammography have been clear , particularly since insurers and Medicare began reimbursing for them , noting that mortality rates have fallen by 25 percent since then .
" I can't say all that 's due to mammography , but it 's pretty clear that part of that and maybe most of that is due to early detection with routine mammographic screening , " he said .
But he agrees with Boolbol about the potential for mistrust , noting that screening rates have fallen in the past few years .
" I 'm concerned again , with all this confusion , that women may stop getting their mammograms regularly .
We may not know the effect of that [ in terms of mortality ] for another 10 to 15 years , " Lyman said .
While many have said the new recommendations are part of a bid to lower medical costs , Lyman said he does not believe there was an economic motive .
Instead , he said , the issue could be that the panel does not include a breast cancer specialist .
" There 's no breast cancer expertise on that panel , and I think it 's hard to develop guidelines with the data as it is without understanding breast cancer , " he said .
" It 's certainly not a change in the evidence .
Something else is at work . "
Breast Cancer Screening Recommendations ' Devalue ' Lives , Survivor Says
While false positives may create problems for some patients , many seem to feel that those are outweighed by the deaths that can result if the screening is not done , something that will present a challenge to any desire to change screening guidelines .
" At the Methodist Breast Center , we diagnose and / or treat about 500 patients with breast cancer every year , " said Dr. Luz Venta , medical director of the Methodist Breast Center in Houston and fellow of the Society of Breast Imaging , in a statement .
" And about 21 percent of these are women under age 50 .
Should these women be sent away and told the cost of screening for breast cancer is not justified in the number of lives that can be saved ? "
That sentiment was echoed by many , some of them survivors of breast cancer themselves , who flooded the message boards of breast cancer groups like breastcancer.org and the Susan Love Foundation to protest the new guidelines .
Thompson , whose sentiments run along those same lines , said she worries about getting her own daughters , the oldest of whom is in her teens , proper screening when they reach the right age , and is concerned that future recommendations might change how soon they get screened .
" I will move heaven and earth to have them screened at 30 , " said Thompson , affirming the recommendation that women with a first - degree relative with breast cancer get screened 10 years before cancer first appeared in that relative .
But Thompson , reflecting the sentiments of other survivors of breast cancer , also said she worries that any recommendation for screening that would have excluded her also devalues the lives of other potential breast cancer survivors .
" It 's disheartening to hear the new guidelines , when they talk about the few lives that are saved , " she said .
" It 's hard not to feel a little devalued by that . "
Yesterday it was revealed that UFC ’s current heavyweight champion Brock Lesnar had underwent “ minor ” surgery for an intestinal problem .
White told the LA Times today that they are now “ waiting to see if he needs more . ”
With Lesnar likely to be out for some considerable time there has been much speculation over a potential interim heavyweight title being created while he recovers .
White appears to have confirmed that this will be the case , telling the paper that he’s , “ working on it right now . ”
Heavyweight fighters who could potentially fight for the interim title in Lesnar ’s absence include Shane Carwin , Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira , Cain Velasquez and Frank Mir .
Considering he was already chosen to be the next challenger for the title , Shane Carwin is certain to be involved .
He has reported within the last few days that he is recovering from a knee injury and will be available to fight after UFC 108 on January 2nd .
As for his potential opponent , Nogueira is currently out with a severe staph infection which may effect his chances of competing for the title in the near future .
Frank Mir meanwhile is set to fight Cheick Kongo at UFC 107 .
An impressive showing there may help his chances of being selected , but with that bout not taking place until Mid December , the decision may have already been made by then .
That leaves Cain Velasquez who made a statement in his previous fight with a dominating victory over veteran Ben Rothwell at UFc 104 .
Earlier this year he had been lined up to face Carwin , but that bout was later scrapped when Carwin was chosen instead to face Brock Lesnar .
With Velasquez being healthy , having no fight currently scheduled and having a legitimate reason why he should fight Carwin i’m leaning towards this being the interim match - up , more than likely at UFC 109 in February .
When we create binary operators , in mathematics or in programming , they often have certain common identifiable properties :
If you can re-order the arguments , e.g. 1 + 2 is the same as 2 + 1 , we say that it is commutative — in contrast , division is not commutative .
— in contrast , division is not commutative .
If you have two applications of the operator and the order of evaluation / bracketing does n’t matter , e.g. ( 1 + 2 ) + 3 is the same as 1 + ( 2 + 3 ) , we say that it is associative — in contrast , subtraction is not associative .
— in contrast , subtraction is not associative .
If one particular operand always leaves the other side unchanged , we can say that this is the unit of an operator , e.g. 1 * x is the same as x , so 1 is the unit of multiplication .
of an operator , e.g. 1 * x is the same as x , so 1 is the unit of multiplication .
If one particular operand always ignores / overrides the other , we can say that this is the zero of an operator , e.g. 0 * x is the same as 0 , so 0 is the zero of multiplication .
of an operator , e.g. 0 * x is the same as 0 , so 0 is the zero of multiplication .
If an operator has a unit or zero that only works on one side of the operator , we name it accordingly .
For example , we say that division has a right - unit of 1 ( because x / 1 is the same as x ) , but it does not have a left - unit ; there is no value k such that for all x , k / x is the same as x .
We can find these properties all over maths and programming .
Set union is commutative , associative , and has a unit of the empty set , but no zero .
The boolean AND operator is commutative , associative , has the unit “ true ” and the zero “ false ” .
STM ’s orElse combinator is associative , with the unit retry , and the left - zero of a return statement .
Any operator that is associative and has a unit forms a monoid , which can be put into Haskell as an instance of the Monoid type - class ( more on that below ) .
The operators in CHP also have some of the aforementioned properties .
A full list is buried at the back of the tutorial , but I should probably pull them into the API documentation .
( Note that the laws I discuss here are concerned with the behavioural semantics of the operators ; the types of the expressions may differ trivially . )
The parallel operator < || > is commutative and associative , with a unit of skip , the process that does nothing and returns successfully .
The unprioritised choice operator <-> is commutative and associative , with a unit of stop , the process that is never ready in a choice .
The implication of choice and parallelism being associative and commutative is that the order of the items in a call to alt or runParallel does n’t make any difference to the behaviour .
The operators for wiring up a pipeline in the Utils module are associative but lack the other properties .
Poison Handler Properties
We can view the poison handlers `onPoisonTrap` and `onPoisonRethrow` as binary operators .
To recap : `onPoisonTrap` runs the left - hand side , but if a poison exception occurs then the right - hand side is run .
`onPoisonRethrow` does the same , but after the right - hand side has finished , the poison exception is rethrown .
They are not commutative — in exception terminology , the first argument is the try and the second the catch ; they can not be swapped freely !
To my surprise , `onPoisonTrap` is associative .
Abbreviating it to `oPT` , consider p `oPT` q `oPT` r .
If you bracket the first two items , ( p `oPT` q ) `oPT` r , q will only execute if p throws poison , and r will only execute if q then throws poison ( because p’s poison is trapped , so the only poison that can escape the first bracket is from q ) .
If you bracket the latter two , p `oPT` ( q `oPT` r ) , the brackets will only execute if p throws poison , which will pass control to q , which will only pass control to r if poison is thrown by q .
So the semantics are associative .
In contrast , `onPoisonRethrow` is not associative .
Abbreviating it to `oPR` , consider : p `oPR` skip `oPR` r .
If bracketed ( p `oPR` skip ) `oPR` r , r will be executed if p poisons , but if bracketed p `oPR` ( skip `oPR` r ) , r will never be executed ( because skip wo n’t throw poison ) .
`onPoisonTrap` has a left - unit of throwPoison ( because throwing poison automatically transfers control to the other side , the handler ) , and a right - unit of throwPoison ( because trapping poison then throwing poison has a null effect on the original code ) .
`onPoisonRethrow` has no left - unit but has two right - units : throwPoison and the return statement .
Any code that cannot throw poison ( e.g. a return statement ) is a left - zero of both `onPoisonTrap` and `onPoisonRethrow` because it will never trigger the handler .
Neither operator has a right - zero ; there is no handler that can cause the original code to always be ignored .
Monoids
The fact that some of the operators mentioned here are associative and have units mean that they could form a monoid .
In fact , CHP blocks of code could form several monoids .
In Haskell , there is the problem that the monoid instance must be uniquely identified by its type , even though it is really its operator that is distinctive .
All the standard number types can form a Monoid in addition ( unit : 0 , operator : + ) or multiplication ( unit : 1 , operator : * ) .
Defining a Monoid instance for , say , Int would thus be ambigious : when you say 4 `mappend` 3 , would you expect 7 or 12 ?
To solve this , the Data .
Monoid module defines newtype - wrappers around types to identify the monoid .
Sum Int is a monoid in addition , whereas Product Int is a monoid in multiplication .
I could use the same trick for CHP ; I could define several monoid instances .
Here is a monoid that allows blocks of code ( with no useful return ) to be joined in parallel :
newtype Par = Par {runPar :: CHP ( ) } instance Monoid Par where mempty =
Par skip mappend p q = Par ( runPar p < |*|> runPar q ) mconcat = Par .
runParallel_ . map runPar
This could be made a little more useful by making a parallel monoid out of blocks of code that return a type that is itself a monoid ; when the parallel blocks of code have all finished , their results are combined using the monoid instance :
newtype ParMonoid a = ParMonoid {runParMonoid :: CHP a} instance Monoid a => Monoid ( ParMonoid a ) where mempty = ParMonoid ( return mempty ) mappend p q = ParMonoid ( liftM ( uncurry mappend ) $ runParMonoid p < ||> runParMonoid q ) mconcat = ParMonoid .
liftM mconcat .
runParallel . map runParMonoid
There is also a straightforward monoid instance for choice between blocks :
newtype Alt a =
Alt {runAlt :: CHP a} instance Monoid ( Alt a ) where mempty =
Alt stop mappend a b = Alt ( runAlt a <-> runAlt b ) mconcat =
Alt . alt . map runAlt
Finally , there is a monoid built around `onPoisonTrap` :
newtype PoisonTrap a = PoisonTrap {runPoisonTrap :: CHP a} instance Monoid ( PoisonTrap a ) where mempty = PoisonTrap throwPoison mappend a b = PoisonTrap ( runPoisonTrap a `onPoison Trap` runPoisonTrap b)
Consider the meaning of mconcat ( map PoisonTrap [ p , q , r , s ] ) .
It says run p ; if no poison is thrown , that ’s done .
If poison is thrown , run q .
If q throws poison , run r , and if that throws a poison , run s.
Obviously this is quite excessive , but I had never thought of constructing such a function until I realised that `onPoisonTrap` was associative and thus could form a monoid .
I ca n’t recall seeing monoid instances like these ( involving monadic actions ) , so perhaps these sorts of monoid instances on monads do n’t end up being very useful ( if you know of a particular use , please add a comment below ) .
I find it interesting to see how CHP code can form several different monoids just as an exercise .

The hit game Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 was released yesterday and sold as well as was advertised .
However , the release of Modern Warfare 2 was n’t without any hitches .
For the entire early hours of release , thousands of consumers reported issues with trophies not syncing as well as issues with the friend invite system .
Thankfully , Infinity Ward responded quickly and has managed to eliminate the former issue .
Only hours ago , Infinity Ward released their first official post - release patch for Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 .
According to Robert Bowling , one of the masterminds behind the Call of Duty franchise , the PS3 trophy issue has been patched and fixed .
Robert Bowling posted the following on Twitter :
# MW2 PS3 Status : Patch successful .
Trophy Unlocks on PS3 now available in Single Player & Spec Ops .
Adding more servers to meet MP demand .
Now that the first issue has been resolved , now Infinity Ward is faced with the friend invite issue .
Robert Bowling had the following to say about friend invites via his Twitter account :
Thanks for the feedback from PS3 players we already have a patch in the wings for release .
Party invite update by Friday
While the official release of Modern Warfare 2 has had a couple issues , there ’s no denying that Infinity Ward takes these issues very seriously .
Look out for the upcoming Call of Duty : Classic on the PSN tomorrow as well as the official PSLS Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 review in the coming days .

A miscarriage of justice was declared at the Court of Criminal Appeal A man who was jailed for rape after going to the aid of a drunken teenager in Edinburgh has been declared a victim of a miscarriage of justice .
Desmond Uttley was sentenced to six years in jail after he was found guilty of raping the 15 - year - old girl in 2002 .
However , after hearing new evidence , judges at the Court of Criminal Appeal overturned his conviction .
The 35 - year - old had denied raping the schoolgirl at his Lochend Gardens home on 14 June in 2002 .
He had stood trial at the High Court in Glasgow later that year .
We are satisfied that the verdict , returned in ignorance of this evidence , must be regarded as a miscarriage of justice
Lady Dorrian
Court of Criminal Appeal
The girl had been out with a 14 - year - old male friend and both been " extremely intoxicated " after drinking cider .
She was unable to stand without help and was lying on the road in the pouring rain when Mr Uttley arrived on the scene and helped her friend to pick her up .
He invited them both back to his house and carried the girl to his home where he laid her on a bed and she fell asleep .
During Mr Uttley 's trial she identified him as her attacker , although she had given the police two descriptions of her assailant , neither of which matched him .
After jurors retired to consider their verdict , they returned to the court with questions over whether tests were carried out on swabs taken from the teenager , and if Mr Uttley 's DNA was present on them .
The trial judge , Lord Menzies , told them there was no DNA evidence in respect of those swabs .
The appeal court heard that no blood or semen was found on the swabs from the teenager and they were not submitted for DNA testing .
Three men Mr Uttley 's defence lawyers on Thursday led evidence at his appeal from a Strathclyde University forensic science lecturer , Dr Adrian Linacre , who was asked to examine swabs taken from the teenager in 2004 .
He carried out a particular type of DNA analysis on the Y chromosome , which was different from the standard genetic fingerprinting test .
He found no DNA matching Mr Uttley , but did find there was some from three other male sources .
Lady Dorrian said : " We are satisfied that the verdict , returned in ignorance of this evidence , must be regarded as a miscarriage of justice . "
The Crown asked for time to consider the judgement over whether to make a motion for a new prosecution .

The children of Falluja guardian.co.uk
Doctors in Iraq 's war - ravaged enclave of Falluja are dealing with up to 15 times as many chronic deformities in infants , compared to a year ago , and a spike in early life cancers that may be linked to toxic materials left over from the fighting .
The extraordinary rise in birth defects has crystallised over recent months as specialists working in Falluja 's over - stretched health system have started compiling detailed clinical records of all babies born .
Neurologists and obstetricians in the city interviewed by the Guardian say the rise in birth defects – which include a baby born with two heads , babies with multiple tumours , and others with nervous system problems - are unprecedented and at present unexplainable .
A group of Iraqi and British officials , including the former Iraqi minister for women 's affairs , Dr Nawal Majeed a - Sammarai , and the British doctors David Halpin and Chris Burns - Cox , have petitioned the UN general assembly to ask that an independent committee fully investigate the defects and help clean up toxic materials left over decades of war – including the six years since Saddam Hussein was ousted .
" We are seeing a very significant increase in central nervous system anomalies , " said Falluja general hospital 's director and senior specialist , Dr Ayman Qais .
" Before 2003 [ the start of the war ] I was seeing sporadic numbers of deformities in babies .
Now the frequency of deformities has increased dramatically . "
The rise in frequency is stark – from two admissions a fortnight a year ago to two a day now .
" Most are in the head and spinal cord , but there are also many deficiencies in lower limbs , " he said .
" There is also a very marked increase in the number of cases of less than two years [ old ] with brain tumours .
This is now a focus area of multiple tumours . "
After several years of speculation and anecdotal evidence , a picture of a highly disturbing phenomenon in one of Iraq 's most battered areas has now taken shape .
Previously all miscarried babies , including those with birth defects or infants who were not given ongoing care , were not listed as abnormal cases .
The Guardian asked a paediatrician , Samira Abdul Ghani , to keep precise records over a three - week period .
Her records reveal that 37 babies with anomalies , many of them neural tube defects , were born during that period at Falluja general hospital alone .
Dr Bassam Allah , the head of the hospital 's children 's ward , this week urged international experts to take soil samples across Falluja and for scientists to mount an investigation into the causes of so many ailments , most of which he said had been " acquired " by mothers before or during pregnancy .
Other health officials are also starting to focus on possible reasons , chief among them potential chemical or radiation poisonings .
Abnormal clusters of infant tumours have also been repeatedly cited in Basra and Najaf – areas that have in the past also been intense battle zones where modern munitions have been heavily used .
Falluja 's frontline doctors are reluctant to draw a direct link with the fighting .
They instead cite multiple factors that could be contributors .
" These include air pollution , radiation , chemicals , drug use during pregnancy , malnutrition , or the psychological status of the mother , " said Dr Qais .
" We simply do n't have the answers yet . "
The anomalies are evident all through Falluja 's newly opened general hospital and in centres for disabled people across the city .
On 2 November alone , there were four cases of neuro - tube defects in the neo-natal ward and several more were in the intensive care ward and an outpatient clinic .
Falluja was the scene of the only two setpiece battles that followed the US - led invasion .
Twice in 2004 , US marines and infantry units were engaged in heavy fighting with Sunni militia groups who had aligned with former Ba'athists and Iraqi army elements .
The first battle was fought to find those responsible for the deaths of four Blackwater private security contractors working for the US .
The city was bombarded heavily by American artillery and fighter jets .
Controversial weaponry was used , including white phosphorus , which the US government admitted deploying .
Statistics on infant tumours are not considered as reliable as new data about nervous system anomalies , which are usually evident immediately after birth .
Dr Abdul Wahid Salah , a neurosurgeon , said : " With neuro - tube defects , their heads are often larger than normal , they can have deficiencies in hearts and eyes and their lower limbs are often listless .
There has been no orderly registration here in the period after the war and we have suffered from that .
But [ in relation to the rise in tumours ]
I can say with certainty that we have noticed a sharp rise in malignancy of the blood and this is not a congenital anomaly – it is an acquired disease . "
Despite fully funding the construction of the new hospital , a well - equipped facility that opened in August , Iraq 's health ministry remains largely disfunctional and unable to co-ordinate a response to the city 's pressing needs .
The government 's lack of capacity has led Falluja officials , who have historically been wary of foreign intervention , to ask for help from the international community .
" Even in the scientific field , there has been a reluctance to reach out to the exterior countries , " said Dr Salah .
" But we have passed that point now .
I am doing multiple surgeries every day .
I have one assistant and I am obliged to do everything myself . "

Oh . No. You .
Di'int .
Pseudoscience is something I do n't really have the social skills to fight head on .
I 'm not a practical , working research scientist .
" But that 's obviously nonsensical " is n't a sufficient counterargument for , say , homeopaths .
Speaking of which , let 's take a brief detour to cover that .
Homeopathic remedies " work " for a suitably relaxed definition of " work " .
By " work " , what homeopaths mean is that homeopathic remedies do have measurable beneficial effects on those who receive them ; and , as scientific studies have routinely and eternally confirmed , those beneficial effects are precisely equal to the beneficial effects experienced by patients administered a placebo instead .
In other words homeopathic remedies work precisely as well as " nothing - disguised - as - a- pill " .
Or , to put that in black and white : if your remedy works precisely as well as " nothing at all " , then your remedy does nothing .
It is possible that there might be other remedies - let 's call them null - remedies - out there , which , when administered to one group of patients while the others are given a placebo , actually have literally no effect on the health of the patient , while those with the placebo actually do cheer up and feel a little better , as we might expect .
In that situation we would have to conclude that the null - remedies , since they do not even cause the patient to cheer up a little , are actually counter - acting the placebo effect .
If a pill does literally nothing , not even a placebo effect , then we know it is actually harmful .
That 's negative .
Remember this : placebo is zero .
Placebo is zero .
To simply have " no effect " is less than zero .
For a medicine to attain the status of " actually viable as a legitimate medicine " requires measurably more than just the placebo effect , which homeopathic remedies do not and , if the slightest logic is applied , cannot provide .
The real question , then , is : should it be medically acceptable to sell a placebo ?
My answer is : only if it 's labelled , in black and white , as a warning from the Department of Health : " PLACEBO " .
" Dimextrothin - proven weight loss through psychological ( placebo - effect ) appetite suppression . "
" Take an unlimited quantity at will for strictly illusory light to moderate pain relief . "
" 100 % pure water .
No active ingredients . "
Anyway .
So yes : there 's junk science .
But it 's not often you run into actual junk mathematics .
Here 's the thing about junk mathematics .
Science is up for debate .
With a law , a theory , a paper , a data source or a single datum , you can dispute the author , the source , the motivation , the politics , the data gathering methods and the spelling .
You can fight over this stuff .
That which is " true " is what stays standing after the fight is over .
That 's how science works .
Science is what fits the universe better than anything else , all brute force statistical manipulation and personal biases removed .
Mathematics ?
Not so much .
When you 're wrong in maths , you 're wrong .
You 're wholly , one hundred percent wrong .
Exactly as wrong as it's possible to get .
Boolean false .
Zero points out of a possible one .
When you 're wrong in mathematics , you 're claiming a falsehood is true .
That means that the statement you just made - regardless of its other ramifications - results in one equalling zero and the destruction of all mathematics .
When someone proves you wrong in mathematics and you raise protest , the person who proved you wrong will turn around with condescending amusement and go , " I 'm sorry .
Did you just argue back ?
Perhaps you mistook mathematics for one of your airy - fairy grey - area subjects ?
Literary analysis ?
Philosophy , maybe ? "
And that person can be anybody .
It can be a high school upstart who spotted a typo in your long division .
It can be the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics undermining your life 's work in two lines .
There are no points for experience here .
There are no " mainstream " and " alternative " mathematicses .
There are no " fringe theorems " .
That which is " true " is that which makes the universe easiest to understand , model , explain , predict and generally deal with .
Climate change is real because this is the option ( as opposed to the " climate change is n't real " option ) which best explains accumulated climate data .
Solipsism is obviously complete horsebull , because assuming that other people are real is a much more efficacious way to deal with real life than behaving as if they do n't exist .
No , there is no Matrix , because pretending there is a Matrix does n't help us with anything or explain anything or predict anything .
Point nine recurring equals one because the people who operate under the assumption that point nine recurring equals one are real mathematicians who accomplish real maths , and the people who believe otherwise are to a man gawking , wrong - headed bystanders who have no business playing with concepts they do n't understand , and who have accomplished no significant mathematics .
At all .
The people who are right are the people whose beliefs have n't led to the undermining and collapse of all mathematics .
The people who are wrong do not matter .
Be quiet .
Adults are working .
You can't say things like " it is not possible to represent all real numbers in any given radix system " .
You ca n't say " the real numbers are n't well defined " and argue for the countability of the real numbers if you do n't accept the well - formed and logical existence of infinite decimal expansions as real numbers .
You ca n't use " Cantor was ridiculed again and again " as an argument against his mathematics or say that Cantor 's enumeration of the rationals being technically a surjection , not a bijection , invalidates it .
Well , you can , in as much as humans have the right to be wrong .
But you 're not a plucky underdog challenging the status quo .
You 're not a breath of fresh innovative air to a stiff - collared , staid establishment grown complacent , creaky , stale and irrelevant .
If you 've come up with something which directly contradicts established mathematics , you 're just wrong .
And if you do n't stop talking ( and start disabling comments ) when a mathematician who knows anything about anything tells you that , then you 're more than wrong , you 're out of your depth and self - evidently mucking with forces you do n't understand .
This guy 's filling ( polluting )
Knol with his dubious junk .
If Knol was relevant , I 'd bother to campaign against it .
If you have been anywhere near the geekier parts of the internet lately then you are probably numb from hearing all the chatter about Google ’s new language called " Go " .
I saw a few links to it from reddit , and I thought , " yay , another language to look at . "
Yes , that is actually what I thought , I know , I ’m weird .
Upon reaching the Go site , and doing a few quick cursory glances , I found myself quite repulsed .
And I do n’t mean repulsed in that it is a bad language , but repulsed in that it is a language which is designed for a world entirely outside of the one that I work in on a daily basis .
I mean , Go looked ugly to me .
Sure , Rob Pike and Ken Thompson were working on it , but that is exactly the reason why it is so hideous to me .
They are hardcore C and Unix kernel types guys , whereas I like my languages to be a little higher level .
I want my languages to lean more heavily in the “ developer productivity ” camp , rather than the " machine productivity " camp .
But to be fair ,
Go is a systems programming language , and so after reading their goals for the language I feel that they are heading in a really good direction ( Not that they care at all how I feel ) .
Digging Further
Despite my misgivings , and my lack of interest in actually using the language , I decided that I would read on a bit further and see if there was anything that really stood out to me about Go. I started reading that it had pointers , but not pointer arithmetic , meh .
It has some interesting concepts around slices , meh .
They have a concurrency model called " goroutines " that talk to each other through a message passing system called channels , meh .
All of this I had seen before in many popular languages .
So far I was n’t really blown away …
But as I read through the Go language design faq , I came across this sentence :
And perhaps most radically , there is no type hierarchy : types just are , they do n’t have to announce their relationships .
Now that is cool .
Go is an object - oriented language without a type hierarchy .
You might be wondering how that would work .
How can you possibly have an effective object oriented language without a type hierarchy ?
You may also be thinking to yourself right now , " But is n’t the bedrock of object oriented systems inheritance ? "
And to be quite honest , a few years ago I would have thought the same thing .
The reality is that inheritance is not the only mechanism of reuse in object oriented languages .
Over the years , after much trial and tribulation , along with the guidance of many people who are much smarter than I am , I too have seen the light that composition is a much more powerful mechanism for sharing behavior than inheritance .
It appears that the designers of Go feel the same way , and strongly enough to drop inheritance entirely .
Composition Versus Inheritance
Go allows you to have types which contain data and methods that operate on that data .
It also allows you to create interfaces which you can place on those types .
If you think about it , this is really all of the functionality that you need in order to recreate all of the behavior that we have in object oriented hierarchies .
Think about that for a second , what does the naive developer do when he wants to create a new custom collection type ?
Does he simply inherit from the base collection type and override the methods that he needs ?
Well , this may be fine if you want to override every method in the base collection type and guarantee that you have not broken behavior in any way , but a more seasoned developer is likely to use composition and wrap a collection type and then expose only the functionality the he needs .
So instead of :
public class CustomCollection <T> : Collection < T> {
You could do something like this :
public class CustomCollection <T> : IEnumerable < T> { private Collection < T> wrappedCollection = new Collection <T >( ) ; public void Add ( T item ) { wrappedCollection .
Add( item ) ; } public IEnumerator < T> GetEnumerator ( ) { return wrappedCollection .
GetEnumerator ( ) ; } IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator ( ) { return GetEnumerator ( ) ; } }
Now , it would be nice to have some sort of interface delegation mechanism in place so that I do n’t have to put methods in to pass calls from the external interface to the object which is being wrapped , but that is an argument for another time .
Interestingly enough , in Go , interfaces are implicit .
You can define and interface and a type automatically implements this interface if it satisfies the interfaces conditions .
This is what the sentence I quoted above meant when they said that types do n’t announce their relationships .
This really gives a very dynamic feeling to a statically typed language .
Is This The Right Way ?
I honestly do n’t know .
If Go catches on it ’ll be interesting to see how much of an issue not having a traditional inheritance model creates for them .
There are n’t very many widely used object oriented languages which do n’t have a hierarchical inheritance mechanism .
Off the top of my head , javascript is the only one I can think of and most people do n’t use its prototypal inheritance model at all .
But for those who do use it , it seems to create a better model for flexibility , composability , and reuse .
Only time will tell whether this is a good design decision from the Go team , and I for once will be eagerly anticipating what comes out of it .
But This Is A Systems Language !
So before people go on harassing me about how many other cool things there are in the Go language , I ’ll just say right now that many of the features that they are implementing in Go are fairly revolutionary for a low level programming language .
Sure , some of this stuff has been done in D , and probably a few other languages , but they are really pushing the bar for a low level systems language .
I think that is awesome !
However , I am looking at this from a person who has been using high level , safe , garbage collected languages for many years now , so much of this is old news to me .
In the low level world of systems programming though , these types of changes would likely be revolutionary .
Summary
I look forward to the evolution of Go , and in particular , which direction they take regarding generics and an exception system .
Currently
Go has neither because the language designers do n’t yet understand whether they are needed , and if they are , how they can be worked in without sacrificing the relative simplicity of the language .
I hope that this post has piqued your interest in Go just a little bit , and I encourage you to go check it out ( pun intended ) .
KIEV , Ukraine  Tatyana
Shvets strode through the Kiev Zoo recently as if it were her own backyard , feeding scraps of bread to the bison ( “ Hello , my dears ! ” ) , cooing to the storks ( “ Oh , you must be cold ! ” ) and lavishing love upon every creature in sight , as she has since she first visited as a child half a century ago .
But often enough , her glee turned to dismay .
The camels ’ corral was a mess , she insisted .
The elephant was scrawny .
The hippopotamus seemed depressed .
And the monkeys ’ cramped accommodations ?
“ God , what a nightmare , ” she said .
Ms. Shvets chased after and berated zoo workers , making mental notes about complaints that she would send to the zoo ’s management .
There was a lot to write up .
The Kiev Zoo , it seems , has seen better days .
Ukraine ’s government is in disarray and the political discord has been unrelenting  and , yes , now even the lions and tigers and bears have been drawn in .

Big Web buzz right now : Adam Lambert 's Good Morning America performance , scheduled for tomorrow , has been canceled because of his sexually - charged number on Sunday 's American Music Award show .
An ABC News spokeswoman tells us : " Given his controversial American Music Awards performance , we were concerned about airing a similar concert so early in the morning . "
Update : CBS has confirmed that Lambert will appear on tomorrow 's Early Show to both discuss his AMA act and to perform .
Lambert talked to Ryan Seacrest a short time ago ABC canceling .
" Obviously I respect their decision , they gotta do what they gotta do .
It 's too bad , I think there were a lot of fans who were excited to come see me . "
He added , " They probably had a lot of pressure coming at them from certain people who were n't happy about it .
I respect their decision - I do n't necessarily agree with it , but they need to do what they need to do . "
Lambert added that " I do n't feel I owe anyone an apology for anything .
I performed , it was late night TV , I did something that female performers have been doing for years , no different .
It 's just the fact that I 'm me and it's a little different for people .
It 's really not that big of a deal .
I 'm not a babysitter , I 'm a performer . "

Bubble Boy Economist Ed Yardeni has a new fear : the real estate market .
( MONEY Magazine ) – Bubble , bubble , toil and trouble . "
Okay , so I 'm taking liberties with Shakespeare .
But in the financial markets , as in Macbeth , talk of bubbles means that someone 's up to no good .
Right now the talk is about a real estate bubble .
Having just been burned badly in the stock market bubble of the 1990s , American investors are setting their sights on a new investment mania , residential real estate .
Admittedly , buying a home is a time - honored tradition in this country .
But just as the promise of ever - escalating stocks turned out to be too good to be true , the idea that you can't lose money on real estate may be setting us up for a fall .
Ed Yardeni , the chief investment strategist at Prudential Securities , believes that a bubble in housing is developing -- a bubble that could do even more damage to the economy when it bursts than the collapse of the tech bubble has done over the past 2 1/2 years .
Yardeni is well known for making bold predictions , his catastrophic forecasts for Y2 K among them .
Now , with all those year 2000 fears a distant memory , he thinks the next big problem on the economic horizon may occur where are hearts are .
Insana :
Do you still think that a housing bubble is either occurring or likely to occur for the U.S. economy ?
Yardeni :
As you know , Ron , that 's a rather controversial subject .
I think most observers of the national housing market believe there is a bubble .
The controversy is whether we 're at the end of it and it's about to burst , or whether it 's at an earlier stage .
I think we 're somewhere between the beginning and the middle of the housing bubble , so I certainly do n't think it 's about to burst .
There are obviously some very solid fundamentals justifying higher prices , including both the aging of the baby boom and the entrance of baby boomers into the real estate market .
Insana :
How long do you see this bubble continuing ?
Yardeni :
If , in fact , this continues , then we 're talking about another 18 to 24 months of still higher home prices before we have to start to worry about a bursting bubble .
Insana :
The people who argue with the notion that there is a bubble say that inventories of unsold homes have n't yet been built up , that there 's no danger of overcapacity in the housing sector , the one sign that usually brings a bubble to a conclusion .
What do you say to them ?
Yardeni : I think that 's a reasonable point .
However , let 's see what happens to home prices .
Nationally they 're up about 7 % in the last 12 months , but there are a lot of metropolitan areas where home prices are up 20 % to 25 % -- and most of that occurred in the last six months .
So if we continue to see those kinds of appreciation rates in major metropolitan areas and start to see increases of more than 10 % in the national average , I think you 'll see people borrowing more against the gains , believing that you can't lose in real estate because home prices always go up .
The main reason that there is the potential of a real estate bubble is because credit is amply and very cheaply available to purchase this asset .
And notwithstanding Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan 's speech in Jackson Hole , Wyo . a few months back -- that the Fed does n't really have much to do with bubbles -- the reality is that easy money is always a precondition for bubbles .
Insana : Alan Greenspan has argued that a national housing bubble is not only not likely but also nearly impossible .
Why would you disagree with that statement ?
Yardeni :
That worries me because the Fed chairman was also blind to the Nasdaq bubble and argued that he was n't going to bet against thousands of investors who believed that stocks were worth what they were paying back in '99 and early 2000 .
Greenspan is entitled to his opinion , and obviously he 's got great credibility -- I think overall he 's done a fine job -- but his track record on seeing bubbles and dealing with them is n't all that great .
I would say in many ways he contributed to the stock market bubble in the late 1990s .
It 's unfortunate that he 's chosen to even comment on the subject , because that suggests that , once again , he 's not going to take any actions to avert a bubble , and he 's not going to do anything to stop it .
The reality is the Fed needs housing to be strong , because right now that 's the only sector that 's responding to low interest rates .
Insana :
What constitutes a bubble in housing compared with merely a bull market in housing ?
Yardeni :
Well , you know , it does n't look like a bubble to the average individual buying a house , given that mortgage financing is at this time so cheap .
But all the preconditions are there if home prices do continue to rise -- partly based on good , solid fundamentals and partly on people 's frustration with stocks and other financial assets , and their belief that you can't lose with real estate -- and people increasingly borrow that equity as they refinance their mortgages .
As they leverage up their real estate holdings , they become more vulnerable to having to sell that house if they can't make the mortgage payments , either because they lose their job or because interest rates rise down the road , as hard as that is to imagine right now .
A bubble is always easy to define after the fact .
It 's an enormous run-up in prices that seems totally justified by the fundamentals -- and then suddenly something happens to make people realize that the prices are too high .
Insana :
How would a burst real estate bubble affect the economy ?
Yardeni :
We would probably lose the only sector that is clearly responding very positively to lower interest rates .
And then the Fed would just completely lose its power to revive the economy , and we would have to start worrying about a deflationary scenario a la Japan for the past 10 years .
Insana : Now , Ed , you 're hardly a stranger to provocative or even hyperbolic forecasts -- Y2 K , for instance ....
Yardeni : Guilty as charged , Ron .
Insana :
What led you last year to start thinking about the prospects for a housing bubble when most people thought the stock market would drag real estate down almost immediately ?
Yardeni : I watch savings deposits data every week and , again , with all due respect to the Federal Reserve chairman , just about every economic historian who has studied the history of bubbles has concluded that easy money is a precondition for bubbles .
The Fed has been forced to lower interest rates dramatically to offset the deflationary , recessionary consequences of the bursting of the Nasdaq bubble .
And there 's clearly only one sector that 's benefiting from the Fed 's easy money , and that 's housing .
It 's being financed by individuals who are pouring money into savings accounts instead of buying stocks .
In the past 52 weeks , half a trillion dollars has poured into savings deposits .
It 's not a liquidity trap , because the banks are lending that money out to the mortgage market .
In the year that ended in the second quarter , we had $ 600 billion in additional mortgage lending .
Insana :
In other words , the individual investor is now recycling his savings into the mortgage market rather than the stock market ?
Yardeni : Exactly .
For over a year now , the Fed has been trying to avert a very severe recession , and so far it has succeeded .
But by keeping interest rates extremely low at a time when people want to be very liquid , it is creating a huge pool of very cheap money that 's going straight into the real estate market .
It 's keeping existing home sales at near - record highs .
Greenspan has really been an unusual Fed chairman in the sense that he wants us to prosper all the time ; when we get into trouble , he tries to bail us out .
Insana :
So he is trading one bubble for another ?
Yardeni :
In some ways he 's the bubblemeister -- though he 's certainly not the only contributor to these bubbles .
Insana : Alan Greenspan does not believe that monetary policy inflates or deflates asset bubbles .
You obviously do n't agree .
Yardeni : I think he 's wrong .
He 's trying to rewrite history , because the reality is that he gave so many speeches in which he basically acted as a cheerleader for the bubble .
Greenspan is the one who had the credibility and promoted the idea of a New Economy more than anybody on Wall Street did .
At the same time that he 's trying to rewrite history , he 's also trying to distance himself from any responsibility .
Insana :
While we wait to find out who is correct here , Yardeni or Greenspan , can you offer any practical advice to individuals who might want to participate in the real estate market but not get popped by another asset bubble ?
Yardeni : Despite my misgivings , real estate right now is one of the best tax deals on the planet .
If you 're a married couple and you own your home for two years , you get to keep all of the capital gains up to $ 500,000 tax - free forever .
There 's no better deal anywhere in the tax code .
Then you can do it again .
And you do n't even have to wait five years anymore .
You just have to live in the next house for two years .
That could be another major contributor to a housing bubble :
If more and more people become aware of the extraordinary tax advantage of capital gains and real estate , that could feed into my scenario .
Insana :
But the trick , as in the stock market , is not to get overleveraged .
Yardeni : Absolutely .
Let 's forget about getting rich quick -- getting rich slow is not a bad way to go .
And , you know , I 'm not rooting for this to turn into a bubble .
I just think all the preconditions for that are there .
Real estate is much more widely owned than stocks , and so it could have a much more damaging impact if we ratchet prices up too fast relative to the fundamentals and then are forced to take them down when the bubble bursts .
Most individuals should stay home and enjoy it , fix it up .
If they want to invest in real estate in the stock market , the home - builder stocks are really cheap .
They 've been very volatile lately ; it 's been a wild ride .
There 's still a lot of skepticism about the long - term growth prospects of home builders .
But if you want to own stocks with price / earnings ratios under 10 , the home builders are the place to be .
Insana :
We can worry about the bubble , then , another time .
Thanks ,
Ed .
Ron Insana is co-anchor of CNBC's Business Center .
His new book , TrendWatching , will be published in November by HarperBusiness .
Villains – we all love to hate them .
Without wicked characters , most books would be extremely dull .
This list looks at ten of the most vile of the vile villains to grace the pages of literary works .
10 The Wicked Witch of the West from Baum ’s “ The Wonderful Wizard of Oz . ”
She covets .
That is her nature .
She wants Dorothy ’s silver slippers .
The Wizard himself believes that the Witch ’s magic is more powerful and could kill him in an instant if he goes near her .
The Wizard finally offers Dorothy a trip home if she will kill the Witch .
That ’s how loathsome she is to the embodiment of good in Oz .
The Witch actively tries to kill Dorothy and company several times , with wolves , bees , the winged monkeys , crows .
She captures the Cowardly Lion and tries to starve him to death .
She tries to burn the Scarecrow to death .
All to force Dorothy to give up the slippers .
She steals one of Dorothy ’s slippers , by tripping her over an invisible bar .
Dorothy finally has enough and throws a bucket of water on her .
Why does it kill her ?
Because water is pure .
The Witch is thorough corruption in all respects , and thus the embodiment of impurity .
9 Pap Finn from Twain ’s “ The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . ”
No wonder Huck Finn does n’t really care for religion .
Why should he honor his father , if his father is a drunken child beater ?
When he first appears , he is pasty white , sweaty , filthy , stinks , and repeatedly threatens to beat Huck to death if he does n’t stop trying to be civil for Miss Watson .
He is probably the only character in the story that Huck really hates , but Huck is also scared to death of him , and reluctantly obeys him as much as he has to .
Pap kidnaps
Huck and forces him to live with him , tries to sue the local judge for the money Huck found at the end of “ Tom Sawyer , ” on the pretense that Huck is Pap ’s property , because Pap made him , and thus the money belongs to Pap , and was never Huck ’s to give away .
Huck finally just escapes from him out of terror and loathing .
Jim finds
Pap dead later , and does n’t tell Huck until the end .
No one sheds a tear .
8 Count Dracula from Stoker ’s “ Dracula . ”
Forget all that sexual stuff you see in the movies .
Dracula vants one thing : blood .
He requires the blood of humans to survive , and has no qualms at all about killing everyone in the whole vorld , vone neck bite at a time , to keep his thirst quenched .
The interesting about Dacula is that he kills vone person at a time , and yet manages to vipe out the entire crew of a Russian cargo ship bound to England .
He does this in the form of a volf , because as a volf , he is supremely savage , ripping people to pieces and lapping their blood off the ground .
His motive for traveling to England is simply that he currently lives in a remote area of Transylvania , and there are n’t a lot of people to suck dry .
England has “ teeming millions , ” as he puts it .
The main characters of the book start to get in his way , and he immediately starts viping them out , vone by vone , turning Lucy Vestenra into a vampiress , scaring her mother to death .
Van Helsing starts plotting against him , and he retaliates by going after Mina Harker , the most dear to everyone of his rivals .
He is vicked , cruel and heartless right to the end , ven they cut his head off and stab him through the heart .
7 Sauron from Tolkien ’s “ The Lord of the Rings . ”
All he wants is the whole world of Middle - earth brought under his control .
Power , power , power .
That is his motive .
He also has a generous capacity for revenge against the Valar and elves , for defeating him at the end of the 2nd Age , before the story begins .
He has no one to answer to , as the most powerful entity in Middle - earth , and as a result , commits atrocities rampantly across the whole land .
He sends his armies into Gondor , Rohan and the Shire , without provocation , for the sole purpose of finding his Ring of Power , and killing everyone in the way .
He is finally undone , destroyed into permanent spirit form , by one of the smallest creatures of Middle - earth , but according to the lore of the story , he is not dead .
He has merely been dealt so severe a blow that he will never rise again ( we hope ) .
6 Aaron the Moor from Shakespeare ’s “ Titus Andronicus . ”
His final words are , “ If one good deed in all my life I did , / I do repent it from my very Soule . ”
That ’s the vilest “ screw you ” in literary history .
He is the main instigator of the carnage throughout the play , and yet his only motive is that he enjoys what he ’s doing .
He loves to hurt people .
He wants people to hate him .
It is ecstasy to him .
He proclaims in his big speech , while standing with his head in a noose , that his only regret is that he was not 10,000 times worse before he was caught .
He convinces Demetrius and Chiron , the sons of the Queen , Tamora , to kill Lavinia ’s betrothed , Bassianus , in front of her , just to make her grieve .
They do this , then rape her and cut her tongue out and hands off , so she ca n’t tell .
Aaron eats it all up .
It ’s delicious fun to him .
Then he frames Titus ’s sons for Bassianus ’s murder , and lies to Titus , that if one of his family will cut of his hand and send it to the emperor , the emperor will spare his two sons .
Titus complies , cutting off his hand , which is returned from the emperor , along with Titus ’s sons ’ heads anyway .
Aaron knew it would happen , and loves every minute of it .
He ’s finally caught and forced to die by starvation and dehydration .
He refuses to show remorse .
5 Bill Sikes from Dickens ’s “ Oliver Twist . ”
Dickens describes him thus , early in the novel : “ a stoutly - built fellow of about five - and - thirty , in a black velveteen coat , very soiled drab breeches , lace - up half boots , and grey cotton stockings which inclosed a bulky pair of legs , with large swelling calves ; –the kind of legs , which in such costume , always look in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to garnish them .
He had a brown hat on his head , and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck : with the long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he spoke .
He disclosed , when he had done so , a broad heavy countenance with a beard of three weeks ’ growth , and two scowling eyes ; one of which displayed various parti-colored symptoms of having been recently damaged by a blow . ”
Oliver Reed played him to terrifying perfection in the musical version , “ Oliver ! ” He is Fagin ’s finest protege , from years back , and now , he is well trained to steal and burglarize , but he is depicted as being just as likely to kill a man when no one is looking , rather than try to pick his pocket without being noticed .
He has absolutely no moral scruples of any kind .
He is only out to make a buck for himself .
Nancy , the poor whore he sleeps with , thinks he loves her , and because she used to be a pickpocket also , trained by Fagin , she feels unstable .
Sikes seems to offer her stability .
Until he beats her to death for trying to stop him from beating Oliver to death .
He regularly beats his dog , Bull ’s Eye , until the poor dog needs stitches .
Its so patently terrified of him that it follows him around , afraid to run .
Sikes is finally undone by the London mob , which hounds him through the streets until he accidentally hangs himself .
4 Satan from Milton ’s “ Paradise Lost . ”
His motive for attempting to overthrow God is that he believes himself to be more beautiful , more powerful , and thus rightfully deserving of the Throne of Heaven .
So he and his minions , whom he has corrupted from God , wage war against God and his minions .
Not smart .
They lose , although they make a better fight , 3 days ’ worth , than expected , because they ca n’t be killed if they ’re already in Heaven .
Then they ’re thrown into Hell , where Satan immediately decides on revenge .
But not open war .
That failed once .
No sense in trying again .
If he ca n’t beat God , he ’ll ruin all of God ’s work .
It ’s all Satan has left as a weapon .
It makes him repugnantly underhanded , no longer willing to stand and fight like a man .
He stabs God in the back , as it were , by corrupting his greatest creation , humans , and introducing sin into the mortal universe .
It will require the death of God ’s own Son as recompense .
Satan ’s story is easily the most vengeful ever told .
3 Police Inspector Javert from Hugo ’s “ Les Miserables . ”
Jean ValJean is released from prison after nineteen years , all for stealing a loaf of read for his starving family .
That was a five year sentence .
The rest was aded on for escape attempts .
Once out , he finds it difficult to function as a citizen , and steals out of habit .
But a Bishop pities him and covers for him so he does n’t go back to prison .
Valjean then turns over a new leaf and six years later , has become mayor of Montreuil - sur - Mer .
Enter Javert .
He is Montreuil ’s chief police inspector and used to work at the prison where Valjean was incarcerated .
He suspects the Mayor to be Valjean when Valjean lifts a horsecart off a helpless man .
Only Valjean could be so strong , Javert remembers .
What follows is almost a thousand pages of abject misery for Valjean , as Javert hounds him all over France .
His motive ?
The law must be upheld .
Valjean had stolen a child ’s silver coin out of habit as soon as he was released .
He then tried to give it back but could n’t find the child .
Over and over , Javert witnesses the magnanimous good deeds Valjean commits , and refuses to give up the chase .
Valjean finally gets the drop on him , but refuses to kill him , even though Javert ’s pursuit is the primary reason for several of Valjean ’s family members ’ deaths .
He releases Javert , who cannot reconcile this mercy with his conscience , and drowns himself in the Seine , rather than live in a world where there is good .
2 Grendel from “ Beowulf . ”
Grendel is the classic monster in all of literature .
Except for his lineage , directly back to Cain of the Bible , he has no motive for killing and devouring as many of the innocent townsfolk of the meadhall , Heorot , as he can .
Whether he enjoys it or not is not said , but he is sure to enjoy the meal of thirty people at once .
Beowulf arrives and rips his arm off .
Grendel flees rather than keep fighting like a man .
Beowulf finds him in his mother ’s cave , like a spoiled bully finally beaten .
he is cowering in a corner , and Beowulf beheads him .
Good riddance .
1 Iago from Shakespeare ’s “ Othello . ”
He is the pettiest , the most underhanded , the embodiment of the prime , immortal blemish of mankind : envy .
He has been said to have no motive for destroying the life of every major character in the play , other than revenge , at first , for Othello ’s passing over him for the post of Lieutenant .
Othello chooses Cassio for Lieutenant , while Iago believes he is better for the promotion from Ensign .
He then sets about ruining both Othello and Cassio ’s lives with a web of lies .
He cannot fight Cassio or Othello face - to - face , because he is afraid they will kill him .
So he corrupts Roderigo , a local moron , who is in love with Desdemona , Othello ’s wife .
Thus , Roderigo does all of Iago ’s dirty work for him , causing Othello to go mad with jealousy over his wife ’s apparent affair with Cassio .
By the time it ’s over , Roderigo has gotten in a fight with Cassio , and they wound each other .
Then in the confusion , Iago stabs Roderigo in the back to silence him .
Othello kills Desdemona , whose best friend , Emilia , rats on her own husband , Iago , who immediately kills her to save himself .
How do you kill a fiend so vile ?
It is left somewhat ambiguous at the end , with Lodovico promising to torture Iago .
Whether he will be killed is not stated .
A phrase used to determine the appropriate circumstances under which to flush a toilet .
Urine was to be left unflushed in the toilet bowl while feces were to be flushed right after bowel evacuation .
This was used in efforts of water conservation either in the sense of environmental conservation or the saving of clean toilet tank water during power outages in remote areas .
“ Man , do n’t waste three gallons of water to get rid of a cup of sterile piss .
”
“ Why is that kindly hippy ? ” “ Just remember man , ' If it ’s yellow , let it mellow .
If it ’s brown flush it down . '” “ Thank you , sir .
Perhaps with the water we save in the crapper you might be able to bathe more thoroughly in the future .
” If it 's yellow , let it mellow .
If it 's brown , flush it down
RC app NEW !
New , improved , and all you need to work from anywhere
This week The Pirate Bay confirmed it would shut down its tracker for good , instead encouraging the use of DHT , PEX and magnet links .
This move confounded many BitTorrent enthusiasts , who although wishing to adapt , were confronted with hard to grasp terminology and technology .
Time for some explaining .
The Pirate Bay ’s recent confirmation that they had closed down their tracker since DHT and Peer Exchange have matured enough to take over , was coupled with the news that they had added Magnet links to the site .
This news has achieved its aim of stimulating discussion , but has also revealed that there is much confusion over how these technologies work .
The key thing to understand is that nobody is being forced to use Magnet links or trackerless torrents .
While these long - standing technologies may prove to be the future , they will co-exist with tracker - enabled torrenting for quite some time .
For now , nobody will be forced to immediately change their existing downloading habits , although it may be wise to switch to a BitTorrent client that is compatible with these technologies .
In an attempt to clear some of the mystique surrounding DHT , PEX and Magnet links we will walk through all three briefly , hoping to assure those who ’ve become confused earlier this week .
DHT and PEX in action
DHT
Using DHT instead of trackers is one of the things The Pirate Bay is now trying to encourage , and torrent downloads that rely solely on this technology are often referred to as “ trackerless torrents . ”
DHT is used to find the IP addresses of peers , mostly in addition to a tracker .
It is enabled by default in clients such as uTorrent and Vuze and millions of people are already using it without knowing .
DHT ’s function is to find peers who are downloading the same files , but without communicating with a central BitTorrent tracker such as that previously operated by The Pirate Bay .
DHT is by no means a new technology .
A version debuted in the BitTorrent client Azureus in May 2005 and an alternative but incompatible version was added to Mainline BitTorrent a month later .
There is , however , a plugin available for Azureus Vuze which allows it access to the Mainline DHT network used by uTorrent and other clients .
Peer Exchange ( “ PEX ” )
Peer Exchange is yet another means of finding IP addresses .
Rather than acting like a tracker , it leverages the knowledge of peers you are connected to , by asking them in turn for the addresses of peers they are connected to .
Although it requires a “ kick start ” , PEX will often uncover more genuine peers than DHT or a tracker .
Magnet links
Traditionally , . torrent files are downloaded from torrent sites .
A torrent client then calculates a torrent hash ( a kind of fingerprint ) based on the files it relates to , and seeks the addresses of peers from a tracker ( or the DHT network ) before connecting to those peers and downloading the desired content .
Sites can save on bandwidth by calculating torrent hashes themselves and allowing them to be downloaded instead of . torrent files .
Given the torrent hash – passed as a parameter within a Magnet link – clients immediately seek the addresses of peers and connect to them to download first the torrent file , and then the desired content .
It is worth noting that BitTorrent can not ditch the .torrent format entirely and rely solely on Magnet links .
The .torrent files hold crucial information that is needed to start the downloading process , and this information has to be available in the swarm .
Pirate Bay links cf. Mininova links :
When the Magnet link specification first came out , in January last year it called for a particular format ( “ base32 encoded ” ) .
The links that EZTV , Mininova and ShareReactor have displayed for some time all conform to that original specification .
In May of last year the specification was changed , in favor of “ hex encoding ” , and that is the format of the links being displayed by The Pirate Bay .
Torrent clients should accept either format .
Compatible Clients
All the main torrent clients : uTorrent 1.8.5 , Vuze 4.3.0.2 , BitTorrent 6.3 , BitComet 1.16 , and Transmission 1.76 ( and others ) support Peer Exchange and DHT ( via a plugin in the case of Vuze ) .
Neither BitComet nor Transmission yet support Magnet links but Transmission is planning to include Magnet link support in the upcoming 1.8 release .
Bearing in mind that no site , including The Pirate Bay , has yet abandoned support for traditional torrent files , there is plenty of time for support to be added .
We hope that this article has cleared some of the smoke that was generated by The Pirate Bay ’s announcements earlier this week .
There is no need to panic , cry or be angry , and it ’s not a problem if you ’re still confused after reading this article .
Torrents will still be available and aside from some extra downloading options thanks to sites that add Magnet links , nothing drastic will change in the near future .

Untuk pembahasan kali ini kami akan memberikan ulasan mengenai Sistem Akuntansi yang dimana dalam hal ini meliputi pengertian , ciri , struktur dan contohnya , nah agar lebih dapat memahami dan mengerti simak ulasan selengkapnya dibawah ini .
Pengertian Sistem Akuntansi
Informasi keuangan dari suatu perusahaan dibutuhkan oleh berbagai macam pihak yang berkepentingan .
Pihak luar memerlukan informasi ini untuk kepentingan mereka sedangkan bagian pihak manajemen informasi keuangan ini diperlukan untuk mengawasi dan mengambil keputusan - keputusan untuk menjalankan perusahaan .
Untuk memenuhi kebutuhan informasi keuangan tersebut maka perlu disussun sistem akuntansi .
Banyak para ahli memberikan pengertian sistem akuntansi yang berbeda , namun pada dasarnya mempunyai pengertian yang sama .
Dengan adanya suatu sistem akuntansi yang memadai , untuk menjadikan akuntan perusahaan dapat untuk menyediakan informasi keuangan bagi setiap tingkatan manajemen , bagi para pemiliki atau pemegang saham , kreditur dan para pemakai laporan keuangan ( stakeholder ) lain yang dijadikan dasar pengambilan keputusan ekonomi .
Sistem tersebut dapat digunakan oleh manajemen untuk merencanakan dan mengendalikan operasi perusahaan .
Yang salah satu sistem yang dapat digunakan oleh manajemen perusahaan ialah sistem akuntansi gaji .
Hal demikian untuk mengatasi adanya kesalahan dan penyimpangan dalam segi perhitungan dan pembayaran gaji atau upah maka hal ini perlu sekali dibuat suatu sistem akuntansi penggajian dan pengupahan .
Sistem akuntansi gaji juga dirancang oleh perusahaan untuk memberikan suatu gambaran yang jelas mengenai gaji karyawan sehingga mudah dipahami maupun mudah untuk dapat digunakan .
Pengertian Sistem Akuntansi Menurut Para Ahli
Beberapa definisi atau pengertian sistem penggajian dikemukakan para ahli sebagai berikut :
1. Menurut Neunar ( 1997 : 210 )
Sistem akuntansi gaji untuk kebanyakan perusahaan ialah suatu sistem dari prosedur dan catatan - catatan yang memberikan kemungkinan untuk menentukan dengan cepat dan tepat berapa jumlah pendapatan kotor setiap pegawai , berapa jumlah yang harus dikurangi dan pendapatan untuk berbagai pajak dan potongan lainnya dan berapa saldo yang harus diberikan kepada karyawan .
2. Menurut Zaki Baridwan ( 1999 : 102 )
Suatu kerangka dari prosedur yang saling berhubungan sesuai dengan skema yang menyeluruh untuk melaksanakan kegiatan dan fungsi utama perusahaan .
3. Menurut Mulyadi ( 2003 : 17 )
Sistem akuntansi merupakan organisasi formulir , catatan dan laporan yang dikoordinasi sedemikian rupa untuk menyediakan informasi yang dibutuhkan oleh manajemen guna memudahkan pengelolaan perusahaan .
4. Menurut Stettler ( Baridwan 2000:4 )
“ Sistem Akuntansi merupakan formulir - formulir , catatan - catatan , prosedur - prosedur dan alat - alat yang digunakan untuk mengelola data mengenai usaha suatu kesatuan ekonomis dengan tujuan untuk menghasilkan umpan balik dalam bentuk laporan - laporan yang diperlukan manejemen untuk mengawasi usahanya dan bagi pihak lain yang berkepentingan seperti pemegang saham , kreditur dan lembaga - lembaga perusahaan untuk menilai hasil operasi . ”
5. Menurut Huzaini ( 2000:13 )
” Sistem Akuntansi merupakan satu bidang khusus akuntansi yang berhubungan dengan rancangan dan penerapan berbagai prosedur , pengumpulan dan pembuatan laporan data keuangan . ”
6. Menurut Marom ( 2002:1 )
Sistem Akuntansi merupakan gabungan dari formulir - formulir , catatan , prosedur - prosedur dan alat - alat yang digunakan untuk mengelola dalam suatu badan usaha , dengan tujuan menghasilkan informasi- informasi keuangan yang diperlukan manejemen dalam mengawasi usahanya atau untuk pihak - pihak lain yang berkepentingan .
Komponen Utama Sistem Akuntansi
Berikut ini terdapat beberapa komponen utama sistem akuntansi , antara lain sebagai berikut :
Blok Masukan ( Input Block )
Masukan adalah data yang dimasukkan ke dalam sistem informasi beserta metode dan media yang digunakan untuk menangkap dan memasukkan data tersebut ke dalam sistem .
Masukan terdiri dari transaksi , permintaan , pertanyaan , perintah , dan pesan .
Umumnya masukan harus mengikuti aturan dan bentuk tertentu mengenai isi, identifikasi , otorisasi , tata letak , dan pengolahannya .
Cara untuk memasukkan masukan ke dalam sistem dapat berupa tulisan tangan , formulir kertas , pengenalan karakteristik fisik seperti sidik jari , papan ketik ( keyboard ) , dan lain - lain .

Contoh : Dalam sistem akuntansi untuk menghasilkan laporan penjualan per jenis produk , transaksi penjualan dan retur penjualan merupakan masukan .
Data tanggal transaksi , jenis produk , kuantitas yang dijual , harga jual satuan , nama pelanggan merupakan masukan yang dimasukkan ke dalam sistem akuntansi untuk menghasilkan informasi penjualan per jenis produk .
Media yang digunakan untuk memasukkan data tersebut ke dalam sistem akuntansi dapat berupa formulir faktur penjualan yang mempunyai format dan aturan tertentu untuk pengisiannya .
Blok Model ( Model Block )
Blok model terdiri dari logico - mathematical models yang mengolah masukan dan data yang disimpan , dengan berbagai macam cara , untuk memproduksi hasil yang dikehendaki atau keluaran .
Logico - mathematical model dapat mengombinasi unsur - unsur data untuk menyediakan jawaban atas suatu pertanyaan , atau dapat meringkas atau menggabungkan data menjadi suatu laporan ringkas .
Contoh :
pengolahan data pendapatan dan beban untuk menghasilkan laporan laba rugi memerlukan logico - mathematical model yang sederhana berikut ini :
Laba = Pendapatan – Beban
untuk memberikan jawaban atas pertanyaan yang sering diajukan oleh Manajer Keuangan mengenai saldo piutang debitur diperlukan logico - mathematical model sederhana sebagai berikut :
Blok Keluaran ( Output Block )
Produk suatu sistem informasi adalah keluaran yang berupa informasi yang bermutu dan dokumen untuk semua tingkat manajemen dan semua pemakai informasi , baik pemakai intern maupun pemakai luar organisasi .
Keluaran suatu sistem merupakan factor utama yang menentukan blok - blok lain suatu sistem informasi .
Jika keluaran suatu sistem informasi tidak sesuai dengan kebutuhan pemakai informasi , perancangan blok masukan , model , teknologi , basis data , dan pengendalian tidak ada manfaatnya .
Keluaran sistem akuntansi dapat berupa laporan keuangan , faktur , surat order pembelian , cek , laporan pelaksanaan anggaran , jawaban atas suatu pertanyaan ( misalnya berapa beban pengobatan sampai dengan saat ini ? ) , pesan , perintah , hasil suatu pengambilan keputusan yang deprogram , scenario dan simulasi , dan aturan pengambilan keputusan .
Mutu yang harus melekat dalam keluaran sistem informasi adalah ketelitian , ketepatan waktu , dan relevansi .
Media yang dipakai untuk menyajikan keluaran sistem informasi dapat berupa : layar monitor , mesin pencetak ( printer ) , alat pendengar ( audio ) , atau microfilm .
Umumnya keluaran sistem akuntansi berupa hasil cetak dan tayangan pada monitor computer .
Blok Teknologi ( Technology Block )
Teknologi ibarat mesin untuk menjalankan sistem informasi .
Teknologi menangkap masukan , menjalankan model , menyimpan dan mengakses data , menghasilkan dan menyampaikan keluaran , serta mengendalikan seluruh sistem .
Dalam sistem informasi berbasis computer danpenyimpan data diluar ( auxiliary storage ) , telekomunikasi , dan perangkat lunak ( software ) .
Contoh :
Untuk menghasilkan informasi penjualan harian , suatu , sebuah rumah makan menggunakan teknologi berupa register kas ( cash register ) .
Mesin yang digunakan oleh rumah makan ini mampu membuat ringkasan sampai dengan 20 macam jenis makanan dan minuman yang dijual .
Blok Basis Data ( Data Base Block )
Basis data merupakan tempat untuk menyimpan data yang digunakan untuk melayani kebutuhan pemakai informasi .
Basis data dapat diperlakukan dari dua sudut pandang : secara fisik dan secara logis .
Basis data secara fisik berupa media untuk menyimpan data , seperti kartu buku besar , pita magnetic , disk , disket , kaset , kartu magnetic , chip , dan microfilm .
Basis data secara fisik merupakan tempat sesungguhnya suatu data disimpan .
Namun yang lebih penting bukan dalam bentuk fisik apakah data disimpan , melainkan bagaimana mencari , menggabungkan , dan mengambil data yang disimpan untuk memenuhi kebutuhan khusus pemakai .
Oleh karena itu , basis data dapat dipandang dari sudut pandang logis yang bersangkutan dengan bagaimana struktur penyimpanan data sehingga menjamin ketepatan , ketelitian , dan relevansi pengambilan informasi untuk memenuhi kebutuhan pemakai .
Blok Pengendalian ( Control Block )
Semua sistem informasi harus dilindungi dari bencana dan ancaman , seperti bencana alam , api , kecurangan , kegagalan sistem , kesalahan dan penggelapan , penyadapan , ketidakefisienan , sabotase , dan orang - orang yang dibayaru ntuk melakukan kejahatan .
Beberapa cara yang perlu dirancang untuk menjamin perlindungan , integritas , dan kelancaran jalannya sistem informasi adalah :
Penggunaan sistem pengelolaan catatan
Penerapan pengendalian akuntansi
Pengembangan rancangan induk sistem informasi
Pembuatan rencana darurat dalam hal sistem informasi gagal menjalankan fungsinya
Penerapan prosedur seleksi karyawan
Pembuatan dokumentasi lengkap tentang sistem informasi yang digunakan oleh perusahaan
Perlindungan dari bencana api dan putusnya aliran listrik
Pembuatan sistem penunjang untuk mengantisipasi kegagalan sistem informasi yang sekarang digunakan dan pembuatan tempat penyimpanan data diluar perusahaan sebagai cadangan ( backup )
Pembuatan prosedur pengamanan dan penggunaan alat - alat pengamanan serta pengendalian akses ke dalam sistem informasi .

Harus bisa menyimpulkan informasi yang termasuk dalam catatan - catatan akuntansi dalam bentuk laporan - laporan bagi manajemen dan juga bagian - bagian lain yang memiliki kepentingan .
Unsur - Unsur Sistem Akuntansi
Berikut ini terdapat beberapa unsur - unsur sistem akuntansi menurut Mulyadi ( 2001:3 ) , antara lain sebagai berikut :
Formulir merupakan dokumen yang digunakan untuk merekam terjadinya transaksi .
Formulir sering disebut juga dengan istilah dokumen , karena dengan formulir ini peristiwa yang terjadi dalam organisasi direkam ( didokumentasikan ) di atas secarik kertas .
Jurnal merupakan catatan akuntansi pertama yang digunakan untuk mencatat , mengklasifikasikan dan meringkas data keuangan dan data lainnya .
Sumber informasi pencatatan dalam jurnal ini adalah : Formulir , contoh jurnal adalah jurnal penerimaan kas , jurnal pengeluaran kas , jurnal pembelian , jurnal penjualan , jurnal umum .
Buku besar terdiri dari rekening - rekening yang digunakan untuk meringkas data keuangan yang telah dicatat sebelumnya dalam jurnal .
Rekening - rekening dalam buku besar ini disediakan sesuai dengan unsur - unsur informasi yang disajikan dalam laporan keuangan .
Buku pembantu , jika data keuangan yang digolongkan dalam buku besar diperlukan rinciannya lebih lanjut dapat dibentuk buku pembantu , buku pembantu terdiri dari rekening - rekening pembantu yang merinci data keuangan yang tercantum dalam rekening tertentu .
Contoh rekening piutang dagang dalam buku besar dibuatkan rincian untuk setiap langganan .
Laporan .
Hasil akhir proses akuntansi adalah laporan keuangan yang dapat berupa : Neraca , laporan Rugi - Laba , dan laporan perubahan modal .

Just went to an eye specialist for further follow - up to my eye issues , and he checked out the surgery I had in France for my detached retina , and told me two things :
1 . Wow , they did a good job .
2 . The surgery would have cost , easily , $ 20,000 in the states .
It cost me a little over $ 2,000 in France .
It ’s amazing how bad our health care system really is , when you finally get sick enough to find out .
I ca n’t wait for Blue Cross to give me a hard time for the $ 2,000 French surgery when they ’d have had to pay ten times that , were I to have had the surgery here .
We ’ll cross that bridge when the French finally bill me for the surgery that took place at the end of July …
Ok , here 's what I want to know .
If the cost of an iPhone ( and I 'm assuming many other high - price smartphones can take up almost half of the price of a data plan .... would one be able to pay the full price of a phone up front and get that amount off of the data plan ?
Sometimes it 's easier to justify one $ 500 purchase than a promised series of 24 $ 30 purchases .
" Beam us up . "
It 's one of the most iconic lines in television history .
It 's something often heard in the hit science fiction television series " Star Trek " and all of the television shows and movies that followed .
The transporter essentially dematerialized a human body at one point only to rematerialize it in the transporter bay on the ship .
Somehow , it broke down atoms and molecules within the body -- scattered them through the vacuum of space without losing a single one from point A to point B , then voila , that person re-emerged out of thin air .
Sounds pretty cool , though impossible , right ?
But what if there was such a device ?

Cooper ’s timing was not good .
Regional chain restaurants have struggled against growing competition from national companies and , more recently , they have been pummeled by the economic slide as consumers cut back on dining out .
Deal Metrics bought part of the financially ailing Brigham ’s company in 2008 for an undisclosed amount from New England Capital Partners , a Newton private equity firm that owned it for four years .
Kevin M. McCafferty , chairman of New England Capital Partners , could not be reached for comment yesterday .
People “ think I ’m some kind of guy who saw an opportunity and took advantage of it , and to some degree I am that guy , ’’ he said .
But “ we ’re not just another investment firm seeking outsized returns for our investors .
We ’re not [ company ] killers . ’’
“ They ’re angry that someone is taking away their clam chowder and taking away their frappes , ’’ Cooper acknowledged in an interview Wednesday at an upscale steakhouse in Baltimore .
But , he said , the business had been mismanaged for years before he bought it .
Brigham ’s customers have been swamping Cooper with e-mail messages blaming him for ruining a piece of local culture .
But they did not expect the end to come so swiftly .
Employees say they suspected something was amiss ; they were paid in cash in recent weeks and health insurance was canceled months ago .
Deal Metrics has already shut down at least five of its 13 Brigham ’s , including shops in Brockton , Danvers , and Peabody .
In all , about 200 people will be out of work just before the holidays .
Hogan and many other former Brigham ’s employees say Cooper , a 33 - year - old equity investor based in Baltimore , betrayed the Brigham legacy .
They say that in less than 18 months he appears to have dismantled the last vestiges of the 95 - year - old institution .
That will leave only a hint of a chain that once had more than 100 restaurants across Massachusetts .
The restaurant chain - once a household name in New England - is expected to file for bankruptcy today , and the 13 locations operated by Cooper ’s company , Deal Metrics LLC , are closing , Cooper said this week .
About a dozen independently owned stores that feature Brigham ’s ice cream remain unaffected by the bankruptcy .
The abrupt closure , caused by a landlord ’s eviction of the restaurant for failure to pay rent , meant she was unable to say goodbye to regular customers she considered family .
They included an elderly blind woman who relied on Hogan to read her mail aloud most days .
The owner of the failing ice cream shop chain , Luke T. Cooper , is “ terrible , ’’ said Hogan , who waited tables at the Arlington location for 37 years .
“ It ’s very obvious he does n’t care about people or give a damn about them . ’’
When sheriff ’s deputies unexpectedly told employees at the Brigham ’s restaurant in Arlington to leave last Friday , locking the doors behind them , longtime waitress Kathy Hogan was angry .
But not at the county officers .
New England Capital Partners sold the Brigham ’s ice cream brand name to HP Hood in 2008 .
The Tron Group , another Boston equity firm , engineered the deal and oversaw the sale of the restaurants to Deal Metrics .
Cooper acknowledged the Brigham purchase was his first attempt at turning around a restaurant company in trouble .
The only other venture listed on his website , www.dealmet.com, is for Charity Home Raffle , a Baltimore group that raffles foreclosed homes for nonprofits .
He said he has worked with other businesses but declined to name them .
Cooper , a graduate of the Syracuse University College of Law , is a lawyer in good standing .
The website also listed Cooper ’s credentials .
It says he “ completed graduate work in finance from Yale University School of Management ( ’02 ) and the University of Chicago GSB , ’’ or Graduate School of Business .
But officials for the two universities said they have no record of Cooper completing graduate work as a full - time or part - time student .
Yale said Cooper signed up for a summer course in 2004 but was a “ no - show . ’’
Asked about the discrepancy , Cooper declined to answer .
“ It ’s immaterial , my educational background as it relates to this business , ’’ he said .
Cooper said he bought the restaurants despite the fact they were $ 1.1 million in debt because he thought he could make improvements that would boost profits .
He said he consolidated vendors , improved the company ’s website , and reassigned employees .
But the recession , combined with high rents and other problems , hurt business , he said .
For example , he said , the Brigham ’s location on High Street in Boston cost $ 25,000 a month to rent .
Lincoln Properties , the building ’s owner , could not be reached for comment .
“ The reality is that businesses go out of business all the time .
Brigham ’s is no different , ’’ Cooper said .
Yet employees point to what they say was a gradual decline in service and quality under Deal Metrics ’ tenure .
The menu grew thinner .
and some restaurants fell into disrepair .
In some locations , rent has gone unpaid for months , they say , and vendors - those who continued to deliver - were typically paid by managers with cash from registers .
Diane Dunleavy , who worked at the downtown Boston Brigham ’s for 21 years , said her paychecks bounced in the last several months , so she started cashing them at the restaurant .
She said she called the attorney general ’s office to complain when her health insurance was suddenly dropped .
The attorney general ’s office said it could not say whether it is investigating claims against Brigham’s .
Dunleavy called Cooper “ a capital investor taking all the money and that ’s it . ’’
“ I do n’t think he knew the kind of place Brigham ’s was , ’’ she said .
Brandie Holmes , who had worked at the Braintree restaurant for a decade starting when she was 15 years old , quit in July .
She said although she was promoted to manager , she was consistently paid at a waitress rate ( a little more than $ 2 an hour ) and was told it was an accounting error that would eventually be corrected .
“ As soon as Luke Cooper took over , things really started to change , ’’ she said .
“ I found it was in my best interest to move on . ’’
Sitting in a Baltimore restaurant where the waiter knew his name , Cooper denied any wrongdoing , and said Brigham ’s employees should have realized the chain did not have a future .
“ They knew it had an expiration date , ’’ he said .
And when asked about the employees ’ pay claims , Cooper said he would “ love to sit down and talk ’’ to those who say they were treated unfairly .
“ Bankruptcy court will ultimately decide what we owe our employees and other creditors , ’’ he said .
“ If , in fact , there are obligations to them . ’’

AUSTRALIA desperately needs an integrated population policy if the country is to survive predicted population increases , politicians and environmentalists say .
Queensland 's population topped 4 million last month , increasing by a record 112,666 people or 2.6 per cent in the year to March 31 .
Queensland Treasurer Andrew Fraser said the state 's population was expected to reach 5 million in 2016 , 6 million in 2028 , 7 million in 2042 and 8 million in 2057 .
Federal Treasury Secretary , Ken Henry said Brisbane would double its population to 4 million by 2049 and Australia 's population would climb to 35 million in the next 40 years .
Mr Henry said we had a ' ' poor ' ' record when it came to the environment and questioned how we would deal the challenges of such population increases .
Former sustainability minister Andrew McNamara believes there are already '' too many of us ' ' because Australia has no population policy .
'' Traffic is congested , trains overcrowded , we have long waiting lists in hospitals , can't afford housing , urban sprawl is causing social alienation and environmental problems are overwhelming , '' he said .

* Deal to improve communication , response to supply threats
* EU says could involve third parties
* EU Commissioner says hopes no gas shutoffs this New Year
* Rules out EU support for Ukrainian gas bills
( Adds Piebalgs comment on Turkmenistan , Azerbaijan )
By Katya Golubkova and Conor Sweeney
MOSCOW , Nov 16 ( Reuters ) - The European Union and Russia on Monday agreed to an “ early warning ” mechanism to shield Europe from potential energy supply cuts and protect consumers in the event of a repeat of last year ’s Russia - Ukraine gas dispute .
The agreement requires both sides to notify the other of any likely disruption to supplies of oil , natural gas or electricity and to work together to resolve the problem .
Third parties would also be allowed to participate , the European Commission said .
“ An energy crisis like the one the EU suffered in January is harmful for supply , transit and consuming countries alike , ” EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs said after signing the agreement with Russian Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko .
“ We need to do everything necessary to make sure that such a situation never happens again , ” he said in a statement .
Russian gas supplies to Europe via Ukraine -- a route that supplies a fifth of Europe ’s gas -- were halted for more than two weeks in January due to a quarrel between Moscow and Kiev .
Concerns are growing that the dispute could be repeated this January , when Ukraine holds presidential elections .
Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said the country had struggled to pay its latest monthly gas bill to Russia .
[ ID:nL6559554 ]
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin also warned last week that Moscow would cut off deliveries should Ukraine siphon off , for its own use , gas crossing its territory en route to Europe .

Russia ’s Energy Ministry said in a separate statement that the “ early warning ” mechanism would maintain a clear line of communication between Moscow and Brussels , as well as the means by which to react to unexpected supply disruptions .
“ The document contains no sanctions against third parties , but puts forward joint actions to warn of any supply disruptions , ” Shmatko , the Russian energy minister , said .
NETWORK OF COMMITMENTS
Vladimir Chizhov , Russia ’s ambassador to the European Union , described the memorandum as “ a network of commitments ” .
“ It ’s not just a red phone connecting Moscow and Brussels , ” he told reporters on Friday , ahead of the signing .
“ It ’s a network of commitments which , of course , includes prompt information of any disruptions to our energy links , be it through technical failures , or natural disasters , or somebody turning off the supply or somebody diverting the energy flow . ”
Piebalgs , the EU energy commissioner , told reporters at the signing ceremony in Moscow that he hoped there would be no repeat of last year ’s gas supply disruptions .
But he ruled out extending a loan to Ukraine to help Kiev pay for Russian gas .
“ We hope ... transit systems wo n’t be closed and there will be no interruption to gas ( supplies ) , ” Piebalgs said .
“ I hope that they ( Ukraine ) will pay for gas , ” he said .
“ The possibility of giving Ukraine a loan is ruled out . ”
The European Union is also studying the possibility of securing alternative supplies of gas from Central Asia and Azerbaijan , including the Nabucco pipeline route .
Asked about the establishment of energy supply links with Turkmenistan , holder of the world ’s fourth - largest natural gas reserves , Piebalgs said the European Union must be patient .
“ I think we need a little patience on the subject of energy .
What we do know is that Turkmenistan wants to diversify its gas supplies , and Europe is happy about this , ” Piebalgs told Reuters after the signing ceremony .
He was speaking in Latvian .
He said the EU must first work to secure gas supplies from Azerbaijan .
“ This will automatically form a new corridor ( for gas supplies ) , ” he said .
Azerbaijan , which plans to produce 45 percent more gas by 2015 , could potentially supply much of the gas needed to fill the EU and U.S. - backed Nabucco pipeline , mostly from the second phase of the Shakh Deniz project in the Caspian Sea .

Louis Wain
1860 -l939
The progressive escape of reality towards delusion is expressed in the pictures below .
They were painted by Louis Wain , an European artist in the beginning of this century .
Since Wain was young , he used to draw and paint cats for calendars , albums , postcards , etc .
When he became 57 years old , he was affected by an unknow mental disorder , which overtook his life as well his art .
The last 15 years of his life were spent in psychiatric institutions .
His cat 's paintings started to change and to show startling images .
Quite revealing of his psychotic condition were the cat 's eyes .
See how they become fixed with hostility , even in the earliest paintings , because the psychotic probably tends to think that the world is looking upon him in a menacing way .
Another sign is the fragmentation of the cat 's body .
They become altered in a strange way under the psychotic 's gaze , and almost always are represented as distorted and phantastic shapes
England 's ultimately comfortable passage to the semi-finals of the ICC Champions Trophy was marred by a moment of controversy towards the end of the night at Centurion , when Andrew Strauss refused Graeme Smith a runner .
Smith , who batted 216 minutes in all after having spent a session in the field , was clearly unhappy when AB de Villiers was asked to head back to the pavilion , and Mickey Arthur , the South African coach , was seen swearing in frustration .
Smith was dismissed soon after for 141 , and South Africa eventually fell 12 runs short of the 313 that would have given them a mathematical chance of survival in the competition .
" I was cramping quite badly and I requested a runner , " said Smith later .
" Andrew spoke with the umpires and turned it down .
He felt that if you score a hundred , you 're going to be tired .
From my perspective , it felt a touch inconsistent .
Guys have got runners for cramps in the past , so there needs to be a degree of consistency there .
This is the frustration that we have . "
Strauss 's take was obviously very different .
" He asked me for a runner because he was cramping , " he said .
" The umpires were not particularly keen to give him one .
I felt that at the end of a long game , after a long innings , you 're going to be tired .
Cramping to a certain extent is a preparation thing .
To a certain extent , it 's a conditioning thing .
I did n't feel that he merited having a runner at that stage . "
Smith insinuated that the Strauss decision may have had something to do with the suggestions of softness that resulted in him recalling Angelo Mathews during England 's victory over Sri Lanka on Friday night .
" I 'm not going to sit here and slag Andrew and say that he should have done this or that , " he said .
" The decision rests with the umpires as well .
From my perspective , it 's just about putting it behind me now .
The thing I 've learned from this game is that the world 's round .
It 's going to come back somewhere in the game , at some period of time in his captaincy .
It 'll be interesting to see how he handles it again . "
Strauss was of the view that the refusal of a runner had nothing at all to do with the run out - obstruction incident .
" You just go with each situation as it comes , " he said .
" I think the umpires were very uncomfortable with it as well .
My personal view is that you should n't get a runner for cramps , full stop . "
When it was pointed out that batsmen had been allowed runners in the past while suffering from cramps , he said : " That 's something for the ICC to look at .
I did n't feel he was cramping that badly either .
He was still able to run .
That was my view . "
Despite the disappointment of defeat , Smith still found time to smile when he was reminded of the fact that Arjuna Ranatunga , the former Sri Lankan captain , frequently asked for and was given runners .
" I do n't know if I want to be likened to Arjuna , " he said .
" I think I 've worked quite hard in the winter [ laughs ] .
From our perspective , it was a crucial period of the game .
I was on the field for 95 overs and just felt it was inconsistent , that 's all . "
The facts are n’t on Sarah Palin ’s side , Comedy Central ’s Stephen Colbert declared Thursday night , before passing verdict on Palin ’s new book , Going Rogue :
It ’s a “ steaming pile of shit . ”
“ While I was hollowing her book out to hide my waffles , I had a chance to read almost the entire cover , ” Colbert told his audience .
“ And I was struck by the subtitle : ‘ An American Life . ’
And that is so fitting , because in her 413 - page autobiography , just like America , nothing is ever Sarah Palin ’s fault .

“ The shopping sprees , that was all the idea of some bad people on McCain ’s staff , ” Colbert continued , while the words on screen read “ The devil made her wear Prada . ”
“ And the Katie Couric interview ? ” Colbert asked .
“ Katie ’s entirely to blame . ”
( “ For turning on the camera , ” the screen read . )
“ And it ’s certainly not her fault that much of the book is n’t ‘ accurate , ' ” Colbert said , making quotation marks with his fingers .
“ That ’s the fault of the Associated Press .
As Palin explained on her Facebook page , ‘ The AP somehow nabbed a copy of the book before it was released .
We ’ve heard 11 writers are engaged in this opposition research , er , ‘ fact checking ’ research ! ’
“ Where Palin ’s concerned , fact - checking and opposition research are the same thing .
Because she knows the facts are out to get her .
And the fact that this book is a steaming pile of shit ?
Also not her fault , ” Colbert said to laughter and applause .

Many alcoholic beverages contain byproducts of the materials used in the fermenting process .
These byproducts are called " congeners , " complex organic molecules with toxic effects including acetone , acetaldehyde , fusel oil , tannins , and furfural .
Bourbon has 37 times the amount of congeners that vodka has .
A new study has found that while drinking a lot of bourbon can cause a worse hangover than drinking a lot of vodka , impairment in people 's next - day task performance is about the same for both beverages .
Results will be published in the March 2010 issue of Alcoholism : Clinical & Experimental Research and are currently available at Early View .
" While the toxic chemicals called congeners could be poisonous in large amounts , they occur in very small amounts in alcoholic beverages , " explained Damaris J. Rohsenow , professor of community health at the Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies at Brown University .
" There are far more of them in the darker distilled beverages and wines than in the lighter colored ones .
While the alcohol alone is enough to make many people feel sick the next day , these toxic natural substances can add to the ill effects as our body reacts to them . "
Rohsenow added that few studies have looked at the effects of high - versus low - congener beverages on next - day hangover or performance , and some of those early studies were not careful to wait until breath alcohol levels ( BALs ) were close to zero before measuring performance , so results may have included some of alcohol 's direct effects .
" We wanted to investigate next - day effects of bourbon versus vodka while ensuring that BALs were zero or almost zero when we studied performance , and we used a variety of performance measures classified by their relevance to safety , " said Rohsenow .
" We wanted to use a new hangover questionnaire that included only the symptoms that had been found to be valid in laboratory studies of hangover .
We wanted to find out if bourbon 's effects the next day were due to different effects on sleep , so people 's sleep patterns were recorded while they slept .
Finally , we wanted to know if performance impairments the morning after drinking were associated with how hung - over the person felt . "
Researchers recruited and paid 95 ( 58 women , 37 men ) healthy , heavy drinkers to participate in one acclimatization night , followed by two drinking nights .
The participants drank bourbon or vodka to an average of 0.11 g % BAL on one night , with a matched placebo on the other night , randomized for type and order .
Polysomnography recordings were made overnight ; self - report and neurocognitive measures were assessed the next morning .
" First , while alcohol in the beverage did increase how hung - over people reported feeling the next morning compared to drinking a placebo , bourbon made people feel even worse than vodka did , " said Rohsenow .
" Second , alcohol in the beverage did make people do worse when they needed to pay attention for a continuous period of time while making rapid accurate choices , but they did no worse after bourbon than after vodka on these tasks .
Therefore , while people felt worse , they did n't perform worse after bourbon than after vodka .
However , people were not aware that they were performing worse since they thought their driving ability was not impaired in the morning even though they could not react as well . "
She added that other studies have found that professional pilots do worse on aspects of flying that require continuous attention across tasks the morning after drinking to intoxication .
" A third finding was that while alcohol in the beverages made people sleep less well because they woke up more during the night , this was no worse after bourbon than it was after vodka , " Rohsenow said .
" This means that bourbon 's greater effects on hangover are not due to it having greater effects on sleep .
Fourth , people who reported more hangover symptoms also did worse in their ability to pay attention for a continuous period of time while making rapid accurate choices . "
Regarding this last finding , that people with more hangover symptoms - feelings of headache , nausea , general lousiness , thirst and fatigue - also performed worse when required to pay continuous attention and make choices , Rohsenow said that feeling worse was perhaps distracting them , or that it just hurt more to use the extra energy needed to pay close attention .
" A second possibility is that as alcohol was metabolized into other substances in the body before leaving , these substances had a direct effect on the nervous system in addition to increasing hangover so that these were two separate but related after - effects of drinking to intoxication , " she said .
The bottom line , said Rohsenow , is that becoming intoxicated to a .11 g % BAL makes it less safe for a person to engage in behaviors required for safety - sensitive performance the next morning .
" Many safety - sensitive occupations require that workers be able to pay close attention to a number of tasks over a period of time , and to respond quickly with the right choices , and drinking to excess was found to impair this performance just after alcohol had left people 's bodies . "

Islamabad , Paksitan ( CNN ) --
Life is slowly getting back to normal at the women 's campus of Islamabad 's International Islamic University .
The young women who study here chatter on the school 's well - manicured lawns , their brightly - colored scarves and Pakistani dresses blowing in the wind on a sunny autumn day .
Barely three weeks ago , this quiet place of learning was the scene of a nightmare .
On October 20 , two suicide bombers launched near simultaneous attacks on both the men's and women 's side of the campus .
Afsheen Zafar , 20 , is in mourning .
Three of her classmates , girls she describes as " shining stars , " were killed on that terrible day .
Still , she says the carnage could have been much worse if not for the actions of a lowly janitor , who was also killed .
" If he did n't stop the suicide attacker , there could have been great , great destruction , " Zafar says .
" He 's now a legend to us , " says another 20 - year - old student named Sumaya Ahsan .
" Because he saved our lives , our friends ' lives . "
The janitor 's name was Pervaiz Masih .
According to eyewitness accounts , the attacker approached disguised in women 's clothing .
He shot the guard on duty , and then approached the cafeteria , which was packed with hundreds of female students .
Masih intercepted the bomber in the doorway , however , and the bomber self - detonated right outside the crowded hall , spraying many of his explosive vest 's arsenal of ball bearings out into the parking lot instead of into the cafeteria .
" The sweeper who was cleaning up here saw someone outside and went towards him , " said Nasreen Siddique , a cafeteria worker who was wounded in the head , leg and arm by the blast .
" [ Masih ] told him that he could not come inside because there were girls inside .
And then they started arguing .
And then we heard a loud blast and all the glass broke . "
" Between 300 to 400 girls were sitting in there , " said Professor Fateh Muhammad Malik , the rector of the university .
" [ Pervez Masih ] rose above the barriers of caste , creed and sectarian terrorism .
Despite being a Christian , he sacrificed his life to save the Muslim girls . "
Masih was a member of Pakistan 's Christian minority , traditionally one of the poorest communities in the country .
When the attacker struck , Masih had been on the job for less than a week , earning barely $ 60 a month .
Masih lived with seven other family members , in a single room in a crowded apartment house in the city of Rawalpindi .
Until the attack his mother , 70 - year old Kurshaid Siddique , worked as a cleaning lady at a nearby house to help make ends meet .
Now , she makes a daily pilgrimage to the cemetery where Masih is buried .
Siddique is inconsolable .
Asked if she was proud that some people were calling her son a hero , Siddique waved a hand in the air dismissively , answering , " My hero is dead now . "
She pulls out a framed photo of her son , pictured wearing a button down white shirt and a thick mustache .
When Masih 's three - year - old daughter Diya sees his photo , she reaches for it , saying , " Mama , I want that picture . "
From time to time , Diya turns to her mother and repeats one word , " Papa . "
The Islamic University offered to give Diya a free education and employ Masih 's widow , Shaheen Pervaiz .
Meanwhile , the Pakistani government has promised to award Masih 's family 1 million rupees ( about $ 12,000 ) for his bravery .
" He is a national hero because he saved the life of many girls , " said Shahbaz Bhatti , minister of minorities in the Pakistani government .
" As a Christian , a person of minority , he stood in front of the Taliban to protect the university . "
But the grave of this national hero is a sorry sight .
It is located in the poorer , garbage - strewn Christian half of a neighborhood cemetery , less then three feet from a muddy road .
Masih 's mother and widow visit every day .
One of his sisters crosses herself , then stoops down to pick up an empty pack of cigarettes someone threw onto the little mound of earth .
The family had to borrow money to pay for Masih 's funeral and they are now behind on paying the rent .
If the government money comes through , Masih 's mother would like to decorate her son's grave .
" I would like him to have his name in cement with a nice poetry verse , " she says .
" And there should be a fence surrounding his grave . "
Jacksboro , Texas – Bobby Williams resides in the small town of Jacksboro , Texas .
His Facebook profile lists his interests as “ Constitution lover for life hoss . ”
He is currently attending his local community college and enjoys following Conservative talk radio as well as right wing blogs in his free time .
Bobby enjoys getting involved with the current hot issues he learns about from his Tea Party email list subscription .
“ I just love my country , you know ?
If you do n’t like it well then you can just get out .
We do n’t cut and run and we ai n’t scared , ” he enthusiastically proclaimed without a follow up on exactly what it is that he is n’t scared of .
Soap would n’t be this reporter ’s first guess .
A pressing issue on the mind of Bobby Williams is why others do not match his enthusiasm for the important political issues .
He is constantly trying to warn his friends and co-workers about the horrors being committed by the current administration in office but seems to be falling on deaf ears .
“ I mean god damn , we got us a Muslim Socialist President with no birth certificate right now in the White House .
He ’s giving jobs to ACORN goons while funneling tax payer money to his Chicago gangster friends .
Why are n’t we doing anything about it ?
Shit , Rush seemed pretty pissed about it .
Lucky for Obama he ’s a busy guy and ca n’t go take care of this himself .
We got Chuck Norris on our side , that ’s like better than God .
Hell we got God too . ”
“ I guess it is because the drive - by liberal media has brain washed people into ignoring these facts .
It ’s a good thing I re-bookmarked Glenn Beck ’s blog back when I did after my AOL account got all messed up . ”
Bobby confessed that he will need to learn to accept the fact that he is ahead of the political curve compared to the general public and some others may not understand .
He is just grateful for the wonderful right wing internet resources afforded to him by his aforementioned AOL account .
His concerns about the current administration however , will not be calmed .
“ All these people crying for health care need to shut up and get a job .
Lord knows if it was n’t for my back from the accident , I know I would . ”
This was then followed by a 20 minute telling of a 5 minute story about his accident which then somehow landed back on the topic of Obama .
“ If he ever messed with Texas … well I ’m not sure what I would do . ”
Hang in there Bobby Williams .
Your country needs you .
How can you not love Cassini ?
The latest treat NASA ’s spacecraft has provided us is the first ever movie of Saturn ’s incredible aruroras .
The high - resolution video was assembled from 472 still images , spaced over 81 hours in October , that show the phenomenon in three dimensions .
The lights can be seen as a rippling , vertical sheet up to 750 miles high above Saturn ’s northern hemisphere .
“ The auroras have put on a dazzling show , shape - shifting rapidly and exposing curtains that we suspected were there , but had n’t seen on Saturn before , ” Cal Tech scientist Andrew Ingersoll , a member of the Cassini imaging team that processed the new video , said in a press release .
“ Seeing these things on another planet helps us understand them a little better when we see them on Earth . ”
NASA ’s Cassini spacecraft has returned many truly amazing images of Titan , Saturn and Enceladus , but the aurora video is one of the more spectacular views yet seen of another planet .
Each image has a 2 to 3 minute exposure time , and together they reveal that Saturn ’s auroras are rapidly changing , as on Earth .
But because of Saturn ’s lighter , primarily hydrogen atmosphere , the lights reach much higher than in Earth ’s heavier oxygen and nitrogen atmosphere .
Though Cassini has spied the alien auroras in ultraviolet and infrared light before , this time the phenomenon was captured in the visible spectrum .
The imaging team added false color to the black and white images to highlight the aurora .
Scientists are still trying to figure out what color the lights really are .

The timing , composition and realisation grab you .
But it 's the anonymous drama of the subjects that keeps you looking : who are the two men talking in earnest on the pier ?
What is running through the mind of the young black man caught in the mirror on a street corner ?
Yet in the case of the photos presented here , that mystery extends to the photographer herself .
We know she was called Vivian Maier , that she took at least 30,000 shots in Chicago and New York in the 1950s and 1960s .
For these few facts , we can thank a young Chicago estate agent called John Maloof , whose chance discovery of the Maier archive has brought publishing offers , invitations to exhibit Maier 's work all over the world , and the hope , from some , that a new star of mid-century American photography may have been unearthed .
A couple of years ago , Maloof was n't even that interested in photography .
With real - estate business slow due to the credit crunch , he began to investigate a box of negatives he'd bought for a few hundred dollars at an auction as a possible source of archive photography for a neighbourhood history book .
Maloof scanned a few of the negatives , liked what he saw , and bought himself a beginner 's SLR camera .
" Throughout that time , I 'd compare my work to Vivian 's and think , ' Wow , this is n't good for me . '
She was teaching me photography .
I bought some books by street photographers such as Harry Callahan , Henri Cartier - Bresson , Lee Friedlander .
I thought , she 's special – does n't anybody know ? "
Nobody did , it seemed .
Maloof had gleaned Maier 's name but little else from the intact but uncatalogued archive .
He Googled her name without luck , and went so far as to track down another box of her work that a " found photography " enthusiast had bought at the auction .
By which point he had 20,000 negatives and about a thousand rolls of film with 12 - 14 images on each – but no more clues as to the young , reserved - looking woman occasionally seen peering into shop windows or mirrors for a self - portrait , Rolleiflex camera around her neck .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A call to the auction house gave Maloof hope : Maier was alive , he was told , but believed to be too ill to receive visitors .
Come May this year , Maloof had set up a blog displaying what he thought to be the best of the images so far ( he still updates www.vivianmaier.com most days ) .
He Googled again , only to discover a Chicago Tribune obituary dated a few days earlier : " Vivian Maier , proud native of France and Chicago resident for the last 50 years died peacefully on Monday .
Second mother to John , Lane and Matthew .
A free and kindred spirit who magically touched the lives of all who knew her ...
Movie critic and photographer extraordinaire . "
She had died at the age of 83 .
The newspaper directed Maloof to an address in a Chicago suburb , but he was able to turn up nothing .
Meanwhile , Maloof joined Hardcore Street Photography , a group on Flickr , the photo - sharing website , wondering if his enthusiasm for Maier 's work would be shared by others .
" That week it exploded , and my inbox really filled up , " says Maloof .
" I 've been asked to display these photos in Australia , Canada , UK , France and Mexico City . "
So far , Maloof has put up a few hundred images on his blog , and he reckons , by his inexpert eye , that about one in 10 of Maier 's images is worth posting – there are at least 20,000 images that he has n't even looked at yet .
No wonder he admits to feeling overwhelmed by the project of exploring Maier 's huge archive . '
From what has emerged so far , it 's easy to see what has excited Maloof and others worldwide .
The well - to - do shoppers of Chicago stroll and gossip in all their department - store finery before Maier , but the most arresting subjects are those people on the margins of successful , rich America in the 1950s and 1960s : the kids , the black maids , the bums flaked out on shop stoops .
There are more formal , almost abstract experiments with light and line , too .
" She has an amazing appreciation of light .
You can see it developing through her work , " says Maloof .
Then , a couple of weeks ago , Maloof got lucky .
He came across an address on a label in the archive .
He discovered that two people with the Christian names Matthew and Lane were registered there .
One phone call later , and he learnt that Vivian Maier had been a nanny to John , Matthew and Lane for a decade from the early 1950s in a wealthy suburb of Chicago .
And at a lunch with two of her charges , now in their fifties , he learnt much more .
A French Catholic , Maier had apparently arrived in New York as a young girl in the 1930s , where she had earned her keep in sweatshops and learnt English at the theatre .
Eventually , she found herself in Chicago nannying three boys .
" She had a peculiar personality , " Maloof was told .
" They told ' me she would bring home a dead snake to show them , or convince the millkman to drive them all to school in his delivery truck .
They loved her . "
She had no family that anyone knew of , never , so it 's said , taking a single personal call at the house she worked in for a decade .
" She wore big hats and coats , and men 's shoes , and thought of herself as a film critic . "
Her camera was around her neck constantly .
As the children grew up , Maier moved on to nanny other families .
But by the 1990s , she was homeless , and fortunate that the three boys she had originally looked after were able to return the favour , buying her an apartment and paying her bills until she died .
Why did this intensely private person pursue her rich , revealing photography ?
Certainly not for public show believes Maloof , who says there only a few , small prints in the archive .
Who was Vivian Maier ?
Perhaps more biographical tidbits will emerge over the next few years – but there is surely only one place where we might find the answer : in the dark room .
Sorry , Rupert Murdoch … Content Will Remain Free. Here Are the Facts :
Rupert Murdoch , in a Wall Street Journal Op - Ed , once again proclaimed the advertising business model dead and the era of free content over .
There is no doubt that Murdoch is an astute business man .
He has made a fortune in media , much of it in tabloids and by cozying up to dictatorships in countries such as China and Russia .
He cynically titled the piece that he published in his own newspaper to further his business interests , “ Journalism and Freedom . ”
Generally speaking , I ’m a fan of Murdoch .
They say , “ you ca n’t argue with success ” and I usually do n’t , nor do I want to .
However , in this latest episode his reasoning is so divorced from the facts that I have doubts as to whether he ’s really serious .
I think his contention can be boiled down to this passage in the Op - Ed :
A business model that relies primarily on online advertising cannot sustain newspapers over the long term .
The reason is simple arithmetic .
Though online advertising is increasing , that increase is only a fraction of what is being lost with print advertising .
Well , not exactly …
Here are the facts :
Fact : Print revenues have increased since the dawn of the internet .
According to ZenithOptimedia , US Print ad revenues from 1996 to 2008 have increased by $ 18 billion ( from $ 50 Billion to $ 68 Billion ) and globally they have increased by $ 50 Billion .
( from $ 131 Billion to $ 181 Billion )
Some markets , such as the UK , have fared worse but when corrected for differences in market composition the story holds ( more on that later )
Fact : Print ’s loss in market share has been less than Digital ’s gain .
During the same 1996 - 2008 period , US Internet ad share has gone from 0 % to 10 % while Print ad share has dropped from 44 % to 32 % .
By “ simple arithmetic , ” that ’s a gain of 10 % for Internet and a loss of 8 % for Print which means the decline in print share has been less , not more , than the gain for Internet .
To be fair , globally Print shares have decreased slightly more than Internet has increased ( 12 % vs 10 % ) .
Still , to say that the the increase has only been a “ fraction ” of the Print loss is way off base .
Moreover , it ’s important where the losses have come from .
Magazines have actually increased their shares , the loss has been completely restricted to newspapers .
This should n’t be surprising as the Internet has been very successful with classified advertising and not done so well with display advertising .
While it ’s true that newspapers are in serious trouble , the problem for the industry has more to do with their historical reliance on classified advertising .
There are some fairly common sense ways to correct this and move toward display advertising , but newspapers have been slow to adopt them .
Fact : Much of the recent losses have been cyclical .
The trends mentioned above are long term trends .
The short term trends since 2007 look much worse for Print .
This should n’t be surprising as magazine display advertising is highly dependent on durable goods , which drive the business cycle .
In a downturn , people put off long term purchases and so it ’s inevitable that advertising expenditure in those categories falls off in a recession more than in the general market .
Furthermore , recessions create bloated inventories .
Companies that need to empty their warehouses will focus more on direct response sales promotions and less on the display advertising that is Print ’s forte .
In a recovery , this trend is reversed .
( and Magazines did gain share during the last recovery ) .
Fact : People do n’t actually pay for print content .
While there are exceptions , for the most part publishers do n’t make money on distribution and in many cases actually lose money .
This is especially true with US magazines , in which roughly 85 % of circulation is sold through highly subsidized subscriptions .
In effect , we ’re usually paid ( albeit in paper , ink , gas , etc. ) to read print content .
Fact : The Internet Makes things cheaper .
On the web , anybody can publish ( even me ! ) .
The notion that an increase in competition will not decrease prices fails to recognize a simple rule of economics .
To believe that consumers will start paying for content assumes that the increase in demand will exceed the avalanche of supply .
Fact : Consumers show no aversion to ads .
My wife complains about me all the time ( with good reason ) , but I know she really loves me ( at least she has n’t divorced me yet ) .
Consumers have a similar relationship with ads .
They complain and watch , complain and watch .
Although counter - intuitive , the evidence with DVR ’s shows that even when people have the capability to skip ads , they watch them to a much greater extent than anybody expected .
While this seems incredible , it starts to make sense when you imagine a world without ads .
Actually , in some places in the world , they do n’t have to imagine it .
They actually experienced it and , as this Polish ad shows , the picture was n’t pretty .
If consumers show no inclination to avoid ads , why would they agree to pay for content ?
Unless the content is highly specialized , experience shows that they wo n’t .
Moreover , to attract ad money , most content creators are zealous in their pursuit of traffic from content aggregators .
Fact : He ’s Hedging .
If anybody wants to read Murdoch ’s piece for themselves but do n’t want to pay for it , no problem !
Just go to this page on the site “ All Things Digital ” and you ’ll find a preview and a link to the Op - Ed on the Wall Street Journal .
Do n’t worry , Rupert wo n’t mind .
He owns “ All Things Digital ” and the site is completely free !
The Way Forward
The truth is that there is nothing wrong with the advertising model .
Yahoo ! , which is largely free content ad model as you can get , generated nearly $ 2 billion in free cash flow even during the crisis year of 2008 .
Facebook also looks poised to become profitable ( although Murdoch owned MySpace does not ) .
The problem is n’t with the model , but the way in which many media moguls of the past run it .
As I wrote previously in How Great Media Companies Fail on the Internet , traditional media companies will need to change the way they operate their companies if they are to be successful in the new , digital world .
( Hint : overpaying for digital properties and running them into the ground is not a recipe for success ) .
There is no doubt that Digital Media poses a great challenge to incumbent media companies .
As Murdoch himself said in the same piece , “ Some newspapers and news organizations will not adapt to the digital realities of our day — and they will fail . ”
So , Rupert , take your own advice : Stop whining and start adapting .
( btw .
Thanks for The Simpsons . )

Eric Klinenberg , Book Forum , September / October / November 2007
Why do so many nations have economic policies more laissezfaire and social programs less generous than their citizens prefer ?
In her explosive counterhistory of global capitalism , against the glib accounts offered by mainstream economists and celebrity journalists , Naomi Klein argues that the answer lies in a simple two - step strategy , honed over three decades by an international cabal of freemarket fundamentalists :
First , exploit crises — whether due to economics , politics , or natural disasters– –to advance an agenda that would never survive the democratic process during ordinary times .
Next , create a “ corporatocracy , ” in which multinationals and political leaders align to promote their interests at the public ’s expense .
The idea that crises can produce openings for radical change is ancient , and Karl Marx surely ranks among its most notable proponents .
Yet in The Shock Doctrine , Klein asserts that only in the late twentieth century did it become programmatic among a cadre of power brokers — libertarian intellectuals , corporate executives , and political elites — intent on inducing economic transformation on a global scale .
Milton Friedman , the late University of Chicago professor who is commonly called the most influential economist of the last fifty years , was the inspiration .
Friedman laid out his theory in the 1982 preface to his signature treatise , Capitalism and Freedom , originally published in 1962 : “ Only a crisis — actual or perceived – –produces real change .
When that crisis occurs , the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around .
. . .
Our basic function [ is ] to develop alternatives to existing policies , to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible ” — by which he meant enacting radical deregulation , privatization of national industries and public - sector programs , and deep cuts to the welfare state — “ becomes the politically inevitable . ” Klein , the author of No Logo ( 2000 ) , a popular manifesto on the cultural politics of branding and anticorporate activism , calls this species of political opportunism “ disaster capitalism . ”
Her new book is a broad survey of its rise as a mode of development imposed on unwilling populations throughout the world .
It is also a searing indictment of its practitioners , from the “ Chicago School juntas ” of Friedman acolytes who collaborated with murderous dictators so long as they professed enthusiasm for free markets , to the international - development organizations that demanded “ shock therapy ” and showed little regard for the welfare of those who absorbed it , to the corrupt officials who profited from what they benignly labeled “ structural adjustment .
” Readers who have followed recent debates in developmental economics will be familiar with one strand of Klein ’s story : neoliberalism ’s catastrophic failure to improve living conditions of either ordinary workers or the poor .
“ Everywhere the Chicago School crusade has triumphed , ” Klein reports , “ it has created a permanent underclass of between 25 and 60 percent of the population ” and an overclass of well - connected billionaires who build modern fortresses to safeguard their lifestyles while promising that their wealth will soon trickle down .
Moreover , she explains , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund plant “ debt bombs ” in their assistance packages , so that national governments must blow their modest budgets repaying creditors rather than investing in public health and well - being .
There ’s nothing revelatory in Klein ’s critique of the international - development agencies , though she does provide a telling portrait of Jeffrey Sachs , the superstar economist who personifies their imperial arrogance as he jets around the globe promising to revive moribund economies and refusing to acknowledge his failures .
What is instructive , particularly for liberals who would like to believe that the shock doctrine was authored solely by the Right , is that the list of its proponents , particularly in the 1990s , included so many Democratic luminaries : Lawrence Summers , Joseph Stiglitz , George Soros , and Bill Clinton , to name just a few .
The Washington Consensus , after all , was hardly a partisan term .
The heart of Klein ’s book is her arresting claim that the shock doctrine not only operates according to the logic of torture but also leads to the enactment of brutal repression — including detention , disappearances , torture , and murder — against its critics .
She introduces her case by juxtaposing accounts of two “ shock doctors ” : Ewen Cameron , director of McGill University ’s Allan Memorial Institute and former president of the American Psychiatric Association , who in the 1950s and ’60s received CIA funding to perform experimental research using electroshock therapy on patients suffering from minor psychiatric ailments , “ without their knowledge or permission , ” and Friedman , whose department used State Department and major - foundation funding to train an international team of economists on how to break down developmental states built on Keynesian social policies , such as those in the Southern Cone of Latin America , and replace them with laws more favorable to multinationals .
Although their laboratories were strikingly different , with Cameron experimenting on individuals and Friedman on national economies , the social scientists shared faith that their subjects would benefit from heavy doses of “ planned misery .
” Cameron ’s research papers convey his confidence that shock treatments , which gained legitimacy in the 1940s and ’ 50s but whose effects were never fully understood , could “ break up old pathological patterns , ” reducing patients to psychological infancy and allowing for dramatic reconditioning .
Yet , Klein reports , in his experiments Cameron grew “ frustrated that his patients still seemed to be clinging to remnants of their personalities , ” and so in addition to the six consecutive jolts he routinely administered , the professor “ further disoriented them with uppers , downers and hallucinogens . ”
He then attempted to restore their sanity by playing recorded messages —
“ You are a good mother and wife and people enjoy your company ” — for sixteen to twenty hours a day .
In one case , we learn , “ Cameron played a message continuously for 101 days . ”
What Klein calls “ shock and awe ” campaigns on the mind were devastating for patients .
Still , the CIA integrated many of Cameron ’s techniques into its 1963 handbook Kubark Counterintelligence Interrogation , used for training agents to extract information from “ resistant sources ” and ushering in “ a new age of precise , refined torture . ”
Alas , these methods have proved as dangerous and ineffectual as the agency ’s research .
Klein claims that Friedman ’s version of the shock doctrine was inspired by the dream “ of de- patterning societies ” so that they could be remade from scratch .
In Chile , for instance , a team of “ Chicago Boys ” led by Sergio de Castro collaborated with General Augusto Pinochet ’s military allies as they planned their bloody coup , assuring them that privatizing state - owned industries , reducing trade barriers , and eliminating price controls would boost the economy .
When , instead , inflation skyrocketed to 375 percent , a leading bank urged Friedman to visit Santiago and help stop the free fall .
Rather than advise the government to introduce immediate social protections or distribute essential goods , Friedman called for “ shock treatment . ”
In a personal meeting with the dictator , he emboldened Pinochet “ to embrace the free market with greater abandon . ”
The result : “ Chile ’s economy contracted by 15 percent , and unemployment — only 3 percent under [ deposed Socialist president Salvador ] Allende — reached 20 percent .
” Today , many regard Chile as an economic success story and credit Friedman ’s policies with making it so .
Klein offers a useful corrective , noting that the nation ’s growth started only after the economy crashed in 1982 , when Pinochet reversed course , firing the most influential Chicago Boys and nationalizing companies whose revenues would reduce debt .
Moreover , she explains , the Chilean turnaround excluded nearly half of Chile : By 1988 , 45 percent of the population lived in poverty , and in 2007 Chile ranks eighth on the United Nations ’ list of the world ’s most unequal countries .
The Shock Doctrine provides a sprawling global tour of neoliberalism ’s conquests .
Klein assesses “ the Chicago School crusade death toll ” during three decades of upheaval , from the 1970s to today .
She also illustrates the strategic shift from crisis exploitation to disaster provocation .
By 1993 , leading US economists were suggesting that policy makers , as scholar John Williamson put it , “ think of deliberately provoking a crisis so as to remove the political logjam to reform , ” and corporate - funded think tanks begin encouraging national governments to manufacture “ pseudo - crises , ” such as the ’93 debt scare in Canada , that would lead to dramatic retrenchment of social programs .
The Shock Doctrine is a massive , courageous undertaking , and Klein ’s impassioned critique of the violence that accompanies American economic imperialism is not merely necessary but urgent .
At times , however , she overreaches , and her analysis falls short of her ambitions .
The least developed idea is her boldest claim : that the practice of economic shock therapy not only partakes of the logic of physical torture but is also its moral equivalent .
Klein persuasively shows that both Cameron and Friedman fantasized about their capacities to rebuild from clean slates and that neither adequately considered the human damage wrought by their shock therapies .
But the two shock docs made scientific and political interventions that are strikingly dissimilar , and Klein ’s argument would have been more compelling had she established a deeper connection between them .
Klein generally portrays the proponents of economic liberalization , including leading scholars , as either puppets of or handmaidens to the multinationals , and the Chicago School as the sponsor of “ juntas ” that used “ disappearances ” as their “ primary enforcement tool . ”
The economists play a purely nefarious and extraordinarily influential role in Klein ’s account of recent world history , and it would be useful to learn more about them , their ideas , and their internal debates .
When they come across as caricatures , so , too , does Klein ’s message , even when it carries insight .
Klein says little about the economic and social problems that predated shock therapy and the triumph of neoliberalism , which makes it diffi cult to evaluate her claim that the Chicago School “ created ” an underclass ranging from 25 to 60 percent of its victims ’ populations or even to measure how much damage it produced .
And her enthusiasm for the rise of a more “ shock resistant ” Left in Latin America is unchecked by a more somber account of why voters in parts of Europe — most recently France — are turning in the opposite direction .
The Shock Doctrine is most effective when Klein ’s travels take her to the depths of the “ disaster capitalism complex . ”
In Iraq , she shows how Paul Bremer created an “ anti– Marshall Plan , ” rewriting the constitution to privatize national industries and allow foreign firms to own 100 percent of Iraqi assets .
In Sri Lanka , she documents a politically driven land grab following the great tsunami of 2004 , when an official task force — half of whose members came from the tourist sector — granted large hotel developers the right to build luxury resorts on coastal properties and prohibited the poor fishermen who had lived there before from rebuilding .
In New Orleans , she observes , the abandoned population no longer trusts any level of government — federal , state , or local .
One community leader tells her that the pressing question has become , “ What can we do right now to start to bring our neighborhoods back in spite of the government , not because of it ? ”
Herein we find the source of a political problem that begins where Klein ’s narrative stops .
Once citizens recognize that state - supported disaster capitalism and the neoliberal policies it advances have failed them , will they also lose faith in the very idea that the government — even a social - democratic one — can help ?

Evan “ Doc ” Shaner is a 24 year old freelance cartoonist and dinosaur enthusiast who lives in Aurora , Colorado .
I stumbled upon his Deviant Art profile and was immediately impressed by his large body of work .
His diverse portfolio include everything from Batman & Robin to Mile Davis and Clifford Brown .
At the request of his fans , Doc Shaner has illustrated these three wonderful sets of Venture character mugs .
How long have you been a fan of The Venture Bros .?
Probably since about halfway through the first season .
I do n’t make a habit of watching a lot of TV , but I just happened to catch the episode where we first meet the Impossibles and I was hooked from then on .
What can you tell me about these pieces ?
I was in a frenzy of working of this small mugshot sets sometime in the last year and at some point someone suggested doing something with the Venture Brothers .
I liked doing these because they take very little time and it let me try out some characters I would n’t normally get around to drawing , like Brock or 24 .
I loved drawing Jefferson .
For these Venture Bros. mugshots , what medium did you use ?
Watercolor and ink ?
It ’s just pen and ink wash .
Then I scan it and lay some color over the washes in Photoshop .
Are the logos computer generated ?
More like computer manipulated .
It ’s partially because I do n’t have the time to work on the logos but there ’s also an authenticity that comes with the actual logo that I probably could n’t replicate on my own .
That and I ’m lazy .
What did you think of The Venture Bros. Season 4.1 ?
I ’ve really enjoyed the first eight episodes .
I like that they took a risk by keeping Brock out of the picture for a large part of it .
All the big risks they ’ve taken with some of the long established characters have been great .
I think it ’s a testament to the strength of the show ’s writing .
I especially liked the episodes with the other former boy detectives and the one featuring the Order of the Triad .
Any plan to produce more Venture Bros. illustrations ?
I ca n’t imagine I would n’t .
I love the show and even though I have n’t done much about it lately I like these characters .
Given the time I ’m sure I ’ll try to do something with them .
A special thanks to Evan ‘ Doc ’ Shaner for letting us use his illustrations !
We look forward to seeing more Venture Bros. related art !

WWF does not consider nuclear power as a viable policy
option , due to its costs , radiotoxic emissions , safety and
proliferation impacts .
In this report focusing on climate
policies , a policy approach that favors the use of nuclear
power is hence adjusted .
The indicators emissions per
capita , emissions per GDP and CO2 / kWh are adjusted as
if the generation of electricity from nuclear power had
produced 350 gCO2 / kWh ( emission factor for natural gas ) .
A country using nuclear energy is therefore rated as a
country using gas , the most efficient fossil fuel .
My , my .
This is sort of like the Harvey Wasserman style of scatter shot exagerations and falsehoods , but Harvey can't usually put together well constructed sentences like this , nor write a serious report .
They admit that a " ... policy approach that favors the use of nuclear power is hence adjusted ... " to make it look the opposite of what it IS !!!!!
Fortunatly , as my irregular series of reports here on the advance of the nuclear renaissance show , fewer people who make policy are listening .
This was a shorty .
In a few days will have a 3rd installment of the lastest advances in alternative - to - renewables non-carbon fission power .

Just five days before James Cameron called a fan a " f** king a ** hole " after refusing to sign an autograph , the " Avatar " director proclaimed that he'd " sign as many autographs as people will line up for . "

During an interview with " Good Day L.A. " -- which airs on the FOX station in L.A. -- on December 18 , Cameron told Dorothy Lucy , " The only worse thing than to have to sign a lot of autographs is to have them not show up . "

Apparently , Cameron forgot that logic Wednesday afternoon , when he rejected a fan request at LAX -- and then blasted the guy for invading his " personal space . "
Today 56 newspapers in 45 countries take the unprecedented step of speaking with one voice through a common editorial .
We do so because humanity faces a profound emergency .
Unless we combine to take decisive action , climate change will ravage our planet , and with it our prosperity and security .
The dangers have been becoming apparent for a generation .
Now the facts have started to speak : 11 of the past 14 years have been the warmest on record , the Arctic ice - cap is melting and last year 's inflamed oil and food prices provide a foretaste of future havoc .
In scientific journals the question is no longer whether humans are to blame , but how little time we have got left to limit the damage .
Yet so far the world 's response has been feeble and half - hearted .
Climate change has been caused over centuries , has consequences that will endure for all time and our prospects of taming it will be determined in the next 14 days .
We call on the representatives of the 192 countries gathered in Copenhagen not to hesitate , not to fall into dispute , not to blame each other but to seize opportunity from the greatest modern failure of politics .
This should not be a fight between the rich world and the poor world , or between east and west .
Climate change affects everyone , and must be solved by everyone .
The science is complex but the facts are clear .
The world needs to take steps to limit temperature rises to 2C , an aim that will require global emissions to peak and begin falling within the next 5 - 10 years .
A bigger rise of 3 - 4C — the smallest increase we can prudently expect to follow inaction — would parch continents , turning farmland into desert .
Half of all species could become extinct , untold millions of people would be displaced , whole nations drowned by the sea .
The controversy over emails by British researchers that suggest they tried to suppress inconvenient data has muddied the waters but failed to dent the mass of evidence on which these predictions are based .
Few believe that Copenhagen can any longer produce a fully polished treaty ; real progress towards one could only begin with the arrival of President Obama in the White House and the reversal of years of US obstructionism .
Even now the world finds itself at the mercy of American domestic politics , for the president cannot fully commit to the action required until the US Congress has done so .
But the politicians in Copenhagen can and must agree the essential elements of a fair and effective deal and , crucially , a firm timetable for turning it into a treaty .
Next June 's UN climate meeting in Bonn should be their deadline .
As one negotiator put it : " We can go into extra time but we can't afford a replay . "
At the deal 's heart must be a settlement between the rich world and the developing world covering how the burden of fighting climate change will be divided — and how we will share a newly precious resource : the trillion or so tonnes of carbon that we can emit before the mercury rises to dangerous levels .
Rich nations like to point to the arithmetic truth that there can be no solution until developing giants such as China take more radical steps than they have so far .
But the rich world is responsible for most of the accumulated carbon in the atmosphere – three - quarters of all carbon dioxide emitted since 1850 .
It must now take a lead , and every developed country must commit to deep cuts which will reduce their emissions within a decade to very substantially less than their 1990 level .
Developing countries can point out they did not cause the bulk of the problem , and also that the poorest regions of the world will be hardest hit .
But they will increasingly contribute to warming , and must thus pledge meaningful and quantifiable action of their own .
Though both fell short of what some had hoped for , the recent commitments to emissions targets by the world 's biggest polluters , the United States and China , were important steps in the right direction .
Social justice demands that the industrialised world digs deep into its pockets and pledges cash to help poorer countries adapt to climate change , and clean technologies to enable them to grow economically without growing their emissions .
The architecture of a future treaty must also be pinned down – with rigorous multilateral monitoring , fair rewards for protecting forests , and the credible assessment of " exported emissions " so that the burden can eventually be more equitably shared between those who produce polluting products and those who consume them .
And fairness requires that the burden placed on individual developed countries should take into account their ability to bear it ; for instance newer EU members , often much poorer than " old Europe " , must not suffer more than their richer partners .
The transformation will be costly , but many times less than the bill for bailing out global finance — and far less costly than the consequences of doing nothing .
Many of us , particularly in the developed world , will have to change our lifestyles .
The era of flights that cost less than the taxi ride to the airport is drawing to a close .
We will have to shop , eat and travel more intelligently .
We will have to pay more for our energy , and use less of it .
But the shift to a low - carbon society holds out the prospect of more opportunity than sacrifice .
Already some countries have recognized that embracing the transformation can bring growth , jobs and better quality lives .
The flow of capital tells its own story : last year for the first time more was invested in renewable forms of energy than producing electricity from fossil fuels .
Kicking our carbon habit within a few short decades will require a feat of engineering and innovation to match anything in our history .
But whereas putting a man on the moon or splitting the atom were born of conflict and competition , the coming carbon race must be driven by a collaborative effort to achieve collective salvation .
Overcoming climate change will take a triumph of optimism over pessimism , of vision over short - sightedness , of what Abraham Lincoln called " the better angels of our nature " .
It is in that spirit that 56 newspapers from around the world have united behind this editorial .
If we , with such different national and political perspectives , can agree on what must be done then surely our leaders can too .
The politicians in Copenhagen have the power to shape history 's judgment on this generation : one that saw a challenge and rose to it , or one so stupid that we saw calamity coming but did nothing to avert it .
We implore them to make the right choice .
This editorial will be published tomorrow by 56 newspapers around the world in 20 languages including Chinese , Arabic and Russian .
The text was drafted by a Guardian team during more than a month of consultations with editors from more than 20 of the papers involved .

Good haul this year for Blue Dogs willing to sell out their constituents
How the mighty have fallen .
It seems as though it was only yesterday ( actually March 5th ) that we received a dispatch from the " Democratic Blue Dog Coalition . "
I had thought it was a caucus , but apparently it 's much , much more than that .
They have a coalition , they have allies .
Plus they 're " fiscally conservative , " do n't you know .
Anyway , our update from the Army of the Potomac said that , uh , wait a moment , I 'm getting confused here .
They usedterminology : " Blue Dogs Launch Health Care Task Force . "
No , , that 's what it said .
I guess they 're Blue Sea Dogs .
Aircraft carriers and cruisers .
" Coalition , Task Force Leaders Participate in White House Health Care Summit " was the subhead .
Now that 's a bit mixed up .
Obviously President Obama is only going to have summits with other heads of state ; the Blue Dog Coalition leaders are what , kings and queens ?
( The co-Chair for Policy is a , actually ; Baron Hill , Indiana - 09 .
They 're all knaves , to me . )
And the Task Force leaders must be at least Rear Admirals .
So , Admiral Mike Ross was promoted from U.S. Representative , and would command the fleet .
The release said he would " lead " Blue Dog efforts to " advance " health care reform legislation .
We learned that at the summit he and the other Task Force commanders , Rep. Jim Cooper ( Tennessee - 05 ) and Rep. Earl Pomeroy ( North Dakota ) " presented President Obama with a letter communicating the Blue Dogs ' willingness to work with the Administration on meaningful health care reform legislation . "
By God , that must have really made the President 's day .
Mike really got into it .
On May 12th , he promulgated the Blue Dog ' Principles for Health Care Reform . '
On June 4th , he laid out the Blue Dog " conditions for responsible health care reform . "
June 19th , Mike issued a statement on Draft Health Care Reform Legislation .
On July 7th , another statement introducing the Blue Dog position that there should be a triggered public option insurance plan , and its reimbursement rates ( if it were ever to be triggered ) would be negotiated with providers , who would n't be required to negotiate at all .
Rendering it useless for its purpose , i.e. , providing competition for the private insurers .
On July 14th he issued another pronouncement , marking the introduction of the legislation in the House .
More on July 16th , and July 22nd , July 24th ( yawn ) .
Then something odd : a July 29th release attributed to Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin ( South Dakota ) .
Did Mike have the flu ?
No , he was being scoped , investigated .
By the end of July , ProPublica , an independent , non-profit investigative journalism group was calling Mike about the sale of his pharmacy to USA Drug .
On September 22nd , the story broke in .
The main thrust of the article was that Mike had been paid much more for the building than its assessed value .
In addition , ProPublica had hired an independent appraiser , and that figure was even lower than the county assessor 's number .
So ProPublica said Mike got a higher price ( $ 420,000 ) than he should have .
They figured the building should have been priced somewhere between the independent appraisal ( $ 198,500 ) and the assessed value ( $ 269,000 ) .
So Mike called them ' leftists ' and said , ' nuh -uh , ' and thensaid ' yeah - huh ' and so on and so forth .
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Mike Ross had " engaged in bribery and honest services fraud " and that 's where it stands .
The more interesting story is something I have n't seen analyzed anywhere : what the buyer paid for the pharmacy 's inventory .
Overpaid is more like it .
The big number there was $ 450,565.40 , which lumped together pharmacy inventory ( medicine ) with OTC drugs and general - store type bric - a - brac .
That makes it impossible to tell if the drugs were valued at net acquisition cost , as they claimed .
The non-prescription drug inventory got valued at 90 % of retail , which is ridiculous .
Mike bought the stuff hugely discounted from the retail price , so that 's an overpayment right there .
It 's like giving Mike the profit on all the stuff in the store until it runs out , .
The other junk was bought at various percentages of retail price , also making no sense .
You buy inventory for cost ; plus a percentage , And now we enter the fascinating world of pharmacy entrepreunership .
I warn you not to read this if you 're at all sleepy .
Mike received $ 154,886.25 for his ' prescription files . '
The going price for the information in a single refillable prescription is $ 7 going on $ 10 , depending on who 's buying it and what the customer base is like .
If you own a pharmacy , you might buy the files of a pharmacy that 's closing , getting names , drugs , dosages , the prescribing doctor 's name , social security number , phone number etc .
The purpose is to get the customers to come to your pharmacy ; you 're buying an opportunity to woo new customers .
Obviously , your distance from the defunct pharmacy , the presence of other competing pharmacies , and other factors go into how much you 'll be willing to pay for each ' script . '.
And his wife is still working for the new owner as pharmacist .
In that situation , the scripts are worth nothing on their own .
The scripts and the drug inventory are inextricably linked .
The buyer paid for the drugs , and also for the opportunity to have Mike 's customers come back tomorrow and next week , which they would anyway .
This was completely a paper transaction ; the name of the pharmacy even stayed the same .
Then it gets sort of weird , and Mike is saying some things that really do n't make much sense to me .
According to Mike , he got paid a very low price for the scripts , only about $ 2.50 each , instead of the $ 7 to $ 10 industry standard .
But he 's counting on our ignorance of the business when he says that .
According to the pharmacy association 's studies , it 's useful to think of grouping various business - sale scenarios , depending upon the material circumstances of the sale .
The Group 1 scenario would be a major chain buying a small , nearby pharmacy 's scripts , with a great opportunity to capture the customers , as long as they get contacted immediately .
Scripts are worth a lot of money in that case , because the chain store is gaining a steady customer who 's buying expensive drugs over and over again .
In contrast , Group 4 is the situation where you only have one competitor within driving distance ( more or less ) , so you only have one possible pharmacist to sell your scripts to .
In that case , they have you over a barrel .
In Mike 's case , you have Group 5 , no value .
The new owner of Mike 's pharmacy only loses his customers if Mike and his wife send them over to the only competition in town .
That wo n't happen , because first , Mike 's wife is still the pharmacist and her salary ( so far undisclosed ) is being paid by the new owner , and second , because the new owner paid them $ 100,000 not to compete .
Even more curious , if you take $ 155,000 and divide by $ 2.50 , you get about 62,000 scripts .
Even if this is every prescription for an entire year ( and really you should only count the first prescription , not every refill ) , it 's still 7 prescriptions for every man , woman and child in Nevada County , Arkansas .
There 's more than one pharmacy in Nevada County ;
Mike shares the town of Prescott with a competitor , and there are others .
For instance , there are 11 WalMarts within 50 miles of Mike 's pharmacy .
( As our former Fearless Leader would have said , Thank God for the Google .
Or was that McCain ? )
Then there 's Walgreens , not to speak of all the other pharmacies owned by the chain that bought Mike 's building and inventory .
My gosh this is fun to write .
If my thinking here actually makes sense , we may be 1 step out of 52 closer to our goal of retiring the Blue Dogs in the House of Representatives .
I hereby demote Task Force Admiral Mike Ross , and will henceforth think of him as Captain Peter " Wrongway " Peachfuzz , captain of the S.S. Guppy .

Jenson Button will move to McLaren - Mercedes next season to join compatriot and fellow world champion Lewis Hamilton , the team has confirmed .
The announcement of a multi- year deal between Button and McLaren follows weeks of feverish speculation about the champion 's future , which was heightened when he paid a visit to the McLaren factory last Friday .
Although Button was initially expected to remain with the Brawn team that took him to the 2009 title , talks with Ross Brawn 's squad reached an impasse over the issue of Button 's salary .
The Briton had taken a pay cut to help the team when Honda 's exit left it in a delicate financial position , but now sought a wage increase having clinched the championship - and given that Brawn 's finances would become more healthy following its takeover by Mercedes - Benz .
" It 's always a difficult decision to leave a team when you 've been there for so long , " said Button .
" But life is all about challenges - and , most important of all , it 's about challenging yourself .
" So , although I won the world championship with Brawn GP last year , and I 'll never forget that , I was always adamant that I wanted to continue to set myself fresh challenges .
So that 's why I 've decided to join Vodafone McLaren Mercedes .
" You can't help but be affected by this team 's phenomenal history .
McLaren is one of the greats of world sport , and its achievements and list of past champions read like a Who 's Who of Formula 1 - Emerson Fittipaldi , James Hunt , Niki Lauda , Alain Prost , Ayrton Senna , Mika Hakkinen and of course my new team - mate Lewis Hamilton .
I 've followed the McLaren team ever since I was a small boy , and it feels unbelievable to finally be a part of it . "
McLaren had originally lined up Kimi Raikkonen to fill its second seat , but these talks also broke down during pay discussions , leading to Raikkonen 's decision to take a year off from Formula 1 next year , and leaving the way clear for Button to take the vacant McLaren drive as he was unable to agree a suitable deal with Brawn and Mercedes .
Button 's move ends a seven year relationship with his previous team , which he joined when it was still known as BAR in 2003 , and stayed with through its difficult seasons under Honda ownership prior to this year 's fairytale success .
He said he had been deeply impressed by McLaren since beginning talks with the squad .
" When I visited the McLaren Technology Centre earlier this month , it was n't simply the technical resources and the incredible standards of excellence that impressed me , " Button said .
" No , I was equally struck by the ambition , the motivation and the winning spirit that flow through everybody there .
And then there 's the team 's epic history : put it this way , the trophy cabinets seem to stretch for miles .
" From a personal point of view , it 's also a great pleasure to be joining a fellow British world champion .
Lewis has achieved an incredible level of success in a very short period of time , and he's a wonderfully gifted driver who has earned the respect of every Formula 1 driver .
I 'm sure there 's plenty that we can learn from each other , and I 'm really looking forward to using our combined knowledge to push the team forward . "
With Button no longer in the frame , Nico Rosberg is expected to be announced as Mercedes ' lead driver for its new works F1 assault with the erstwhile Brawn team , with Nick Heidfeld linked to the second seat .
Button replaces Heikki Kovalainen at McLaren .
The Finn took only one win during his two seasons as Hamilton 's team - mate , and struggled for race pace this season despite some strong qualifying performances .

Take a hike , you douchebag .
And you can take Gary Sinese with you .
You are both Republican tools .
Why do I say this ?
I was watching CSI : NY tonight .
The premise was this : dere ’s dis guy ( oh , wait , this is NY not NJ , sorry ) and he ’s using technology to kill people .
First , he takes over a car ’s GPS and directs the victim to a bad area of NYC , then takes over the On - Star type service to first enjoy taunting his victim , then listening as he dies .
Another guy dies when the killer takes over the restaurant ordering system to give this victim a double helping of peanuts instead of the peanut - free dinner that was originally entered by the server .
As the victim ’s throat closes up the killer is on the phone ( who knew killer ’s answered 911 calls ? ) , asking for the gory details as to whether the victim has turned blue yet .
MUWAHHHH !
Sounds interesting , right ?
I thought so .
Turns out , this guy was killing specific people ; a doctor , the owner of a hospital , and staff members who had the unfortunate job of telling him that he no longer had insurance and they would not treat his advanced stage cancer any more .
He chose Mac ( Sinese ’s character ) to “ tell his story ” because Mac ’s father had died of a pretty invasive cancer , too , and he just knew that Mac could relate to him after watching his father die of a similar cancer .
Heady stuff .
I would have forgotten the plot line as just another interesting CSI plot ( it ’s hard to feel sympathy for a killer , but it ’s also difficult to not feel sympathy for a man who maybe had a chance if he could have gotten the chemotherapy and other treatment he needed , a thought provoking dichotomy , to be sure ) – until the very end when Mac made a little speech to the killer , who was now in the hospital , getting treatment for his cancer , at the city ’s expense , saying that the killer was nothing like his father !
His father would have been proud to say that he lived long enough and it was his time to go – and go quietly into the night , happily ( singing patriotic songs as the life flowed out of his body , I am sure ) .
Of course , his dad had insurance , which took care of him until there was nothing left to do , but his time had come and it was time to go and go proudly he would .
Glad to die , by golly !
One guy has insurance and runs the course of his therapy and the other who is no longer insured ( the reason was not given ) is cut - off mid-therapy .
One might think this could be called a false equivalency .
Not in the eyes of these Republican tools – rich , Republican tools who could pay cold hard cash straight from their personal checking accounts for a heart transplant – several times a year .
I am washing my hands of the far too many Bruckheimer franchises .
One viewer down .
And I did n’t even have to die to do it .

What we talk about when we talk about grammar is hardly ever actual grammar - the way we put words and sentences together in English .
Most of the time , it ’s new words , or new meanings for old words , that grab our attention .
But earlier this month , John Carroll - who teaches at Boston University and blogs at Campaign Outsider - sent me a question that really is about grammar .
It was prompted by a New York Times review of “ The Battle for America 2008 , ” which had two instances of subjunctive were that sounded wrong to Carroll .
In the first , reviewer Michiko Kakutani asked if there was anything more to say , anything new to reveal , about last year ’s presidential campaign .
“ Given the voluminous coverage of that race , it might seem as if the obvious answer to these questions were no , ” she answered .
Later in the review , she wrote : “ Mr. Axelrod went on to argue , presciently it turned out , that Mr. Obama ’s profile . . . fit this historical moment better than Mrs. Clinton ’s and that if he [ Axelrod ] were right , Mr. Obama could catalyze a political movement and prevail . ”
Should , could , those weres be wases ?
wondered Carroll .
I was n’t at all sure - partly because both subjunctive verbs are deep in complex sentences , and partly because I ’ve never agonized over subjunctive were .
I learned a casual attitude from one of my first usage books , “ A Dictionary of Contemporary English Usage , ” by Bergen and Cornelia Evans .
Bergen Evans , an English professor and a popular usage maven in the mid-20th century , often criticized “ rules ” that were really just crotchets .
And he said it was OK to use was instead of subjunctive were pretty much anywhere except in the expression , “ if I were you . ”
“ Was has been used as a past subjunctive for more than 300 years and is the preferred form today , ” he wrote .
Besides , he said , if you ’re self - conscious about subjunctives , you ’ll end up with a pretentious were where a was is correct : “ To be safe , one should write as one speaks . ”
Taking that caution to heart , I resolved to use was unless it sounded shocking .
Now before anyone starts fretting about the erosion of precise distinctions , let ’s remember that with any verb other than to be , we use the past - tense form to serve as a subjunctive in these counterfactual if - clause conjunctions .
“ I drove fast ” and “ If I drove fast ” use the same verb , and we have no trouble telling indicative from subjunctive .
Only to be , only in first and third person singular , uses a different form , not the plain past tense , in this construction :
She was a princess , if she were a princess .
Obviously , we could get along without this were .
But until we agree to chuck it , how do we choose between was and were ?
The subjunctive in an if clause , says the American Heritage usage guide , is used of something “ presupposed to be false , ” like “ if I were rich . ”
If the something is n’t presumed false , but just unknown , you need an indicative verb : “ If it was dark , he would have taken the flashlight . ”
Even so , like Carroll , I would have used was in both Times examples .
I could justify were in “ the answers were no , ” but the sentence was so hedged already - “ it might seem as if ” - that more tentativeness seemed like overkill .
In the case of Axelrod ’s “ if he were right , ” well , it ’s no longer presumed false ( that is , unproven ) ; he was right .
These musings were n’t getting us anywhere , though ; it was time to call in a genuine grammarian .
So I sent my query to Geoffrey Pullum , coauthor of the imposing Cambridge Grammar of the English Language and a linguist at Edinburgh University .
Was there an obvious cure , I asked , for our was - were puzzlement ?
There was , he said : Have it both ways .
The Times ’s choice of the “ irrealis were , ” as it ’s called in the higher grammarspeak , is correct ; so is our preferred was .
“ In informal style , Standard English substitutes ‘ was ’ for the irrealis ‘ were , ’ ” Pullum explained .
This simply regularizes the verb to the pattern of other English verbs , which all use the past tense form for the subjunctive : “ If I went out and robbed a bank . ”
And someday , he predicted , the difference will disappear .
“ The irrealis form is clinging by its fingernails to the cliff of extinction .
Only ( unlike with most species extinctions ) its final extinction will not matter : absolutely nothing will be misunderstood and there will be no ill effects . ”
Until then , we can choose either formal “ were ” or less formal “ was ” in almost every case .
Bad news , perhaps , for editors and anyone else who prefers uniformity , but it ’s very good news for those of us already defaulting to was whenever we get the chance .

The massacre at Kunduz and the policy of targeted killings
28 December 2009
The massacre which took place at the beginning of September in Kunduz , Afghanistan , taking the lives of up to 142 people , continues to dominate the German media .
But while considerable attention is given to what happened and the cover - up which followed , barely anything has been said about the political , historical and international implications of the bloodiest military strike ordered by a German commander since 1945 .
This is the case despite the fact that leading military commanders and politicians are clearly intent on using the massacre to circumvent the restrictions imposed on the German military as a consequence of the crimes it committed in the Second World War .
It is now regarded as certain that a German colonel , Georg Klein , gave the order for an air strike on two hijacked tankers in the early hours of September 4 , with the intention of killing the people who had gathered near the vehicles .
There was no immediate danger to German soldiers or the German field camp located seven kilometers away .
Apparently , the colonel hoped to strike down the leaders of local militias who were opposing the international occupation force .
In a note to his superiors written one day after the attack , Klein acknowledged that he intended to “ annihilate insurgents through the use of air strikes . ”
In its edition of last week , Der Spiegel names some of the targets : “ Mullah Shamsuddin , an experienced commander of the Pashtun , ” as well as the “ four Taliban leaders Mullah Abdul Rahman , Maulawi Naim , Mullah Siah and Mullah Nasruddin . ”
The latter were “ local leaders , who each commanded around 15 fighters and controlled small areas around Kunduz , ” the magazine reports .
They had been tracked down and pursued over the preceding days by members of the top - secret KSK unit .
Klein consulted with at least one KSK soldier before he gave the command to attack .
This indicates that he clearly hoped to “ annihilate ” one or several of the local leaders .
In so doing -- even though he may not have spoken directly with his superiors — Klein “ had good reason to believe that his superiors and the German government would approve of his robust actions , ” notes Der Spiegel on the basis of its investigation .
Two state secretaries , August Hanning ( Interior Ministry ) and Peter Wichert ( Defense Ministry ) , traveled to Kabul on October 21 , 2008 in order to confront the government of Hamid Karzai , following an escalation of attacks on German soldiers .
On their return to Berlin , they had confidential discussions with representatives from the Chancellery and the Interior , Defense and Foreign ministries over how to proceed .
Der Spiegel comments on the discussions : “ Hanning is for a harder course , he wants to hunt down those backing the Taliban .
Hunt down or be hunted , that is the alternative according to Hanning . ”
Since this initial meeting there have been further discussions by this group aimed at organizing a behind - the - scenes transformation of the role of the German army .
In May 2009 , KSK units began hunting down alleged Taliban for the first time .
In April , the Defense Ministry had deleted an exception from the NATO operations plan which prohibited German troops from practicing “ the use of deadly force ” except in cases of self - defense .
During the summer , the deployment rules were changed accordingly .
The so - called “ pocket cards ” carried by every German soldier were reworded to allow soldiers to respond with deadly force “ against individuals who are planning , preparing or supporting attacks , or who exhibit other forms of hostile behaviour . ”
The term “ other forms of hostile behavior ” is so broad that it allows German soldiers to retaliate against practically anyone opposed to the presence of the German military .
Colonel Klein therefore could quite rightly feel he had the backing of his superiors when he gave his order to attack and “ annihilate ” insurgents on September 4 .
In adopting a policy of deliberate liquidation , the German army is reverting to methods which are characteristic of modern colonial warfare and stand in flagrant violation of elementary principles of law .
“ Targeted killing ” has become an established military term .
Entire books and numerous legal papers have been devoted to the topic .
A search for “ targeted killing ” on Google generates over one million hits .
A contribution on the web site of the Council on Foreign Relations , the most important foreign policy think tank in the US , defines the term as follows : “ Targeted killings are used by governments to eliminate individuals they view as a threat .
Generally speaking , a nation ’s intelligence , security or military forces identify the individual in question and carry out an operation intended to kill him or her .
Though questionable , the practice has been used by defense and intelligence operations by governments around the world and has been viewed with increased legitimacy since the start of the so - called war on terror . ”
In other words , “ targeted killing ” is aimed at the execution of political opponents without accusation or judgment .
Denunciation by a secret service is sufficient to arrive at and carry out a death sentence .
The weapons used — precision bombs as in Kunduz , remote - controlled missiles or remote - controlled explosive devices — are such that the victims ( and those around them ) have no chance to defend themselves .
Such methods are not new .
But for a long time they were regarded as the reserve of the secret services of totalitarian regimes .
The Soviet secret service GPU , for example , regularly hunted down and killed political opponents of Stalin abroad .
During the Cold War , the CIA also carried out assassinations of selected politicians , but was later required — at least officially — to abandon such practices .
In 1981 , an executive order of the president declared : “ No person employed by or acting on behalf of the United States Government shall engage in , or conspire to engage in , assassination . ”
In the course of the 1980s and 1990s , however , these guidelines were increasingly abandoned .
In 1986 , US President Ronald Reagan ordered a missile attack on the house of the Libyan head of state , Muammar Al Gaddafi , in Tripoli , and in 1998 , US President Bill Clinton ordered missile attacks on an alleged terrorist camp in Afghanistan and a factory in Sudan .
The justification for the attack on Gaddafi was the bombing of a disco in Berlin frequented by US soldiers , while the strikes ordered by Clinton were prompted by attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
A pioneer of the policy of “ targeted killing ” is the Israeli government .
Already in the 1970s , the Israeli secret service Mossad had hunted down and murdered alleged terrorists .
It directed its operations , in particular , against the political leadership of the Palestinian nationalist movement .
Several leaders of Yasser Arafat 's Fatah were murdered by Israeli commandos .
Following Fatah 's arrangement with Israel in the 1993 Oslo Agreement , the leaders of Hamas , as well as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Amal , were targeted by Mossad .
According to a report in the Middle East Quarterly , in the first twelve months of the Intifada rebellion that began in the occupied areas in September 2000 , Israel carried out “ at least forty cases of assassinations of middle - and high - level Palestinian activists . ”
The Israeli armed forces proceeded with the utmost brutality , bombing cars on public roads in densely populated areas or destroying houses , killing entire families of the targeted victims .
Due to their flagrant illegality , the Israeli murders were a source of international criticism , but behind the scenes the Israeli government could rely on official backing , particularly from the US .
The attacks of September 11 , 2001 were used by the Bush administration to drop any official reservations standing in the way of targeted killings .
Since then , the cold - blooded liquidation of political opponents , purported to be “ terrorists ” or “ Taliban , ” has become common practice of the American forces occupying Iraq and Afghanistan .
This policy has been extended into Pakistan , where opponents of the US or the Pakistani government have become the targets of remote - controlled US drones .
Bush 's successor , Barack Obama , has not only continued this policy , he has intensified it .
“ It is a slight exaggeration to say that Barack Obama is the first president in American history to have run in part on a political platform of targeted killings — but not much of one , ” writes law professor Kenneth Anderson in a contribution for the Brookings Institution .
He adds in praise : “ Obama was right as a candidate and is correct as president to insist on the propriety of targeted killings — that is , the targeting of a specific individual to be killed , increasingly often by means of high technology , remote - controlled Predator drone aircraft wielding missiles from a stand - off position .
The strategic logic that presses toward targeted stand - off killing as a necessary , available and technologically advancing part of counterterrorism is overpowering . ”
Although there is no shortage of pundits prepared to justify this practice , it is patently illegal .
Not only does it violate the abolition of the death penalty in numerous civilized countries , it also contravenes the basic and internationally recognized legal principle that nobody may be executed without a valid trial .
There is no limit once targeted killings have been recognized as legitimate .
Where is the dividing line between a terrorist and a freedom fighter ?
How is one to differentiate between legitimate and illegitimate resistance ?
In which countries are targeted killings permissible — they have been deemed acceptable by imperialist governments in relation to Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iraq , Sudan and recently Yemen — and in which countries are they not ?
It is the arbitrary decisions and geo-strategic interests of aggressor governments that determine how the lines are drawn .
Under such conditions , the turn of the German army to a policy of targeted killings must ring the alarm bell .
The German army was responsible for the most abominable crimes on its Eastern front during the Second World War .
It murdered huge numbers of civilian hostages in retaliation for fallen German soldiers , carried out the summary execution of partisans and prisoners of war , and participated in the annihilation of the Jews .
Most of these crimes remained unpunished because they were allegedly not covered at the time by international law .
After the war , however , numerous provisions were introduced into international law to prevent a recurrence of such atrocities .
These provisions are now being systematically circumvented and undermined .

Afghanistan election debacle deepens as Abdullah pulls out of runoff
By Bill Van Auken
2 November 2009
The Obama administration ’s crisis over its planned escalation of the war in Afghanistan deepened over the weekend with the decision by President Hamid Karzai ’s challenger , Abdullah Abdullah , to pull out of a US - engineered election runoff .
Abdullah , a former “ foreign minister in exile ” for the warlords of the Northern Alliance , who , after the US invasion of 2001 , occupied the same position in the Karzai regime , announced Sunday that he would not participate in the runoff election scheduled for next Saturday .
Washington forced the runoff on Karzai in an attempt to whitewash the massive fraud committed in the presidential election last August .
A United Nations panel confirmed that nearly a third of Karzai ’s votes were fraudulent and that he had fallen just short of the absolute majority needed to avoid a second round .
Abdullah indicated that there was no reason to believe that similar ballot - stuffing would not take place in the runoff .
In talks with Karzai , he had demanded that the Afghan president ’s allies in charge of the country ’s election commission , who engineered the fraudulent vote last August , be dismissed .
Karzai rejected the demand .
Abdullah , whose campaign also engaged in ballot - stuffing , stopped short of calling for a boycott of the runoff election and urged his supporters not to stage protests .
He repeatedly appealed for “ national unity ” and insisted that he had made his decision “ to give the people of Afghanistan a chance to move on . ”
He denied that he had withdrawn “ in exchange for anything from anybody . ”
The Obama administration and its allies have responded to Abdullah ’s withdrawal with the absurd contention that the fact that the challenger in the runoff has refused to participate because of his conviction that the vote will once again be stolen in no way affects the “ legitimacy ” of the Afghan electoral process .
This has been combined with unmistakable signals that Washington wants to see the second round cancelled altogether in favor of a court decree proclaiming Karzai the winner .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has provided the most laughable justifications for the electoral fiasco in Afghanistan , insisting that there is really nothing illicit or even unusual involved .
On a stop in the United Arab Emirates , she argued that the Afghanistan election was little different than those held in the United States .
“ We see that happen in our own country where , for whatever combination of reasons , one of the candidates decides not to go forward , ” she said .
Clinton repeatedly insisted that Abdullah ’s withdrawal in no way affected the legitimacy of the election .
When President Karzai bowed to US demands to accept a runoff , she claimed , “ that bestowed legitimacy from that moment forward , ” regardless of whether the vote took place .
A statement issued by the State Department over Clinton ’s signature praised Abdullah for waging a “ dignified and constructive campaign . ”
It continued , “ It is now a matter for the Afghan authorities to decide on a way ahead that brings this electoral process to a conclusion in line with the Afghan constitution . ”
Appearing on the CBS News program “ Face the Nation , ” Obama ’s senior advisor David Axelrod indicated that the administration wants a quick end to the election controversy .
“ We are going to deal with the government that is there , ” he said .
“ And obviously there are issues we need to discuss , such as reducing the high level of corruption .
These are issues we ’ll take up with President Karzai . ”
There was no indication that anyone in the US administration was appealing for Abdullah to reconsider his action and take part in the runoff election .
This poses the obvious question of why Clinton , Senator John Kerry , Obama ’s Afghanistan - Pakistan special envoy Richard Holbrooke and others spent days browbeating Karzai into accepting the runoff , which they insisted was the only way to legitimize the election .
Whether Washington ever really wanted the runoff to transpire , it certainly appears to want no part of it now .
According to the Washington Post , US Ambassador to Afghanistan Gen. Karl Eikenberry , together with the chief UN official in the country , Kai Eide , had attempted to negotiate a power - sharing deal between Karzai and Abdullah , continuing talks into Saturday night .
“ During the talks , Abdullah demanded the removal of three key election officials , suspension of three cabinet members and constitutional changes that would give him a say in the appointment of ministers and in major policy decisions , ” the Post reported .
Karzai rejected the deal on Sunday morning , with Abdullah announcing his withdrawal shortly thereafter .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a deliberately vague statement in response to Abdullah ’s withdrawal , saying he was confident that “ Afghanistan ’s leaders will support the remaining steps of the democratic process . ”
Only a week before , Brown was among those insisting a runoff was indispensable .
The collapse of the runoff election that the Obama administration had insisted would grant the puppet regime legitimacy , marks another setback in the US drive to defeat the resistance to its occupation of Afghanistan .
No vote could have eliminated the stench of corruption from Karzai and his cohorts .
But the fact that Washington , having chosen Karzai as Afghanistan ’s president and dictated his regime ’s policies for eight years , is incapable of even staging such an election is indicative of the crisis dominating US policy in the country .
If the runoff were held , it would be every bit as much an illegitimate farce as the first round .
Turnout was expected to be significantly lower than last August , when barely a third of eligible voters cast ballots .
And the same kind of ballot - stuffing was inevitable .
With the Taliban threatening to disrupt any vote with armed attacks , it would have required a major redeployment of US troops and entailed another potential spike in casualties .
The apparent collapse of the runoff has created further confusion around Obama ’s protracted deliberation on strategy and troop levels for Afghanistan .
Administration officials had indicated that he was waiting for the results of the November 7 ballot to make a decision , and it was expected that he would announce his policy after that date and before he is to embark on a nine - day Asian tour on November 11 .
Now it appears it will be pushed back further .
In his television appearance Sunday , Axelrod said that he expected “ the president to make a decision within weeks . ”
Last Friday , Obama met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the White House to discuss the proposal of Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the senior US commander in Afghanistan , to send another 44,000 troops into the country to wage an intensified counterinsurgency campaign .
Obama reportedly asked the chiefs what the impact of such a deployment would be on the all - volunteer military , which has been placed under prolonged strain by the simultaneous wars and occupations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
According to the Washington Post , Obama asked the chiefs to “ provide him with more options for troop levels , ” suggesting that the administration may be considering sending less troops than requested by McChrystal .
It is generally acknowledged , however , that whenever the final decision is made it will involve the deployment of tens of thousands of additional soldiers and Marines .
Two more US soldiers were killed Saturday by roadside bombs in southern Afghanistan , bringing the death toll to 59 for October , the bloodiest month for American forces since the war began eight years ago .
At the present rate , the number of US troops killed in the Afghan war will top 1,000 before the end of the year .
Another explosion Sunday claimed the life of a British soldier in Helmand Province , bringing the number of British troops killed over the last eight years to 224 .
A further indication of the costs of the US war was provided by an article published in the Washington Post Saturday indicating that 1,000 US troops have been wounded in Afghanistan over the past three months , with a “ dramatic increase in amputees and other seriously injured service members . ”
US troops in Afghanistan are being wounded at a higher rate than in Iraq at the highpoint of US casualties there in 2007 , the Post reported .
According to the Pentagon , between 70 and 80 percent of casualties suffered by US and other occupation troops are the result of roadside bombs .
“ Walter Reed ’s Ward 57 provides wrenching proof of the devastating effectiveness of the bombs , with patients suffering amputations , spinal cord damage , traumatic brain injuries and fractures , ” the Post reported .
“ The ward is pretty full now , ” Tracy Glascoe , a physician ’s assistant at the Washington , DC Army hospital told the newspaper .

When evidence of war crimes is produced , you might expect states that claim to defend the rule of law to want those crimes investigated and the perpetrators held to account .
Not a bit of it .
The decision by a London judge to issue a warrant for the arrest of Israel 's former foreign minister Tzipi Livni over evidence of serious breaches of the laws of war in Gaza has sparked official outrage in Britain .
The court 's behaviour was " insufferable " , foreign secretary David Miliband declared .
The Times called it " repugnant " .
Gordon Brown yesterday assured Livni that action would be taken to ensure no such thing ever happens again .
As it turned out , Livni had cancelled her visit and the warrant was withdrawn .
But for the British government , it seems , it is n't the compendious evidence of war crimes during the Gaza bloodletting – including the killing of civilians waving white flags , the use of human shields and white phosphorus attacks on schools – that is insufferable .
It 's the attempt to use the principle of universal jurisdiction Britain claims to uphold to bring to book the politicians who ordered the onslaught .
Of course , it would make more sense if Israel itself held an independent investigation into its soldiers ' conduct in the Gaza war .
That was what the UN's Goldstone report called for , on both sides – failing which , other states should start their own investigations .
Instead , Israel is demanding Britain change its laws without delay , and the British government is falling over itself to oblige .
No doubt both Britain and the US , with their own record of war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan , fear that if universal jurisdiction is applied to Israel it could be catching .
This was a principle that was apparently only intended to apply to countries that challenge western power or African states , not a " strategic partner " and " close friend " , as Miliband described Israel this week .
But Israel 's claim that it is being singled out does n't stand up to scrutiny ; on the contrary , it is trying to put itself beyond the reach of international law .
Attempts to hold US or British leaders to account over the Iraq and Afghan wars have also been swatted away , but there have been official inquiries and convictions lower down the chain of command .
In the case of this year 's Gaza war , the only Israeli convicted has been a soldier for stealing a credit card .
Nor does the argument that peace negotiations will be undermined if some Israeli politicians are unable to travel abroad cut much ice .
Government ministers have legal immunity , and are therefore unaffected .
And a viable Middle East settlement no more depends on the travel arrangement of Israeli opposition figures than on those of Hamas leader Khalid Mish'al .
It does , however , depend on western states starting to apply common standards to both sides in the conflict .
The conviction that no such move is in prospect is what has led supporters of the Palestinians ' six decade - long struggle for justice to explore any and every way to fill the gap : hence last weekend 's visit to the London courts .
It 's not hard to see why they feel like that .
A year on from the onslaught on Gaza – which Livni described as Israel " going wild " – nothing has changed .
The rockets that were supposed to be the justification for Gaza 's devastation have been virtually silent all year , as they were for much of the six months before the assault , policed by Hamas .
In fact , armed resistance throughout the occupied Palestinian territories has been minimal .
So evidently that 's not the block on achieving a just peace , as often claimed .
But the barbaric siege of the Gaza strip continues unabated , backed by the US , Britain and the European Union , leaving 70 % of Gazans living on less than a dollar a day , without clean water or the means to rebuild the 21,000 homes , 280 schools and 16 hospitals partially or completely destroyed last December and January .
That might be thought repugnant and insufferable .
But far from encouraging the easing of the blockade to reward the ceasefire , the US has prevailed on Egypt to build a new wall on its border with Gaza to prevent the tunnel - smuggling that keeps Gazans from utter destitution .
Meanwhile , on the occupied West Bank , illegal Israeli land seizures and settlement building are proceeding apace , especially in Jerusalem .
Barack Obama 's peace initiative has already run into the sand .
Having insisted on a complete freeze on settlements , his bluff was called by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu , and the US is now trying to bamboozle the hapless Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas into swallowing Obama 's failure .
At the same time , the US and EU are bankrolling , training and directing a Palestinian security apparatus which is systematically imprisoning without trial and torturing its political opponents , in collusion with Israel .
Several hundred Hamas activists have been arrested in the last fortnight alone .
It is widely understood that no genuine peace settlement can stick without Palestinian unity , but by requiring a crackdown on Hamas under the guise of fighting " terror " , the US and Europe are making reconciliation impossible .
If , as expected , Israel releases hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Gilad Shalit , the captured Israeli soldier , the dynamic of Palestinian politics is likely to shift , probably in Hamas 's favour .
Confidence in further negotiations delivering real progress is at rock bottom .
As one veteran Fatah leader and ostensible Abbas ally , Jibril Rajoub , told me : " If the Americans were serious , they would encourage national reconciliation .
But they are not , they are making excuses . "
If that continues , the Palestinians will have to " consider other options " , Rajoub says , though he specifies he does n't necessarily mean armed resistance .
" But the occupation has to be made painful for the Israelis , they can't have occupation and security . "
That is far clearer for Hamas , which certainly wo n't maintain a ceasefire that is only answered with blockade and violent repression .
There is talk of another intifada if the present drift continues .
As has been demonstrated this week , Israel is treated with impunity by its western allies , and neither is going to shift course unless the price gets significantly higher .
There 's no point in western handwringing when the next upheaval comes – or crying foul if it spills over beyond the Middle East .

A relationship counsellor who refused to offer sex therapy to gay couples has lost his unfair dismissal appeal .
Gary MacFarlane , 47 , from Bristol , was sacked by marriage guidance service Relate after he said he could not do anything to promote gay sex .
He alleged Relate had refused to accommodate his Christian beliefs .
The service 's chief executive Claire Tyler said : " The appeal judgement validates Relate 's commitment to equality of access to our services . "
Mr MacFarlane , a former church elder , was appealing on the grounds of religious discrimination at the Employment Appeal Tribunal in Bristol .
' Homophobe ' label
He started training with Relate in May 2003 and said he enjoyed good relationships with clients and colleagues .
Mr MacFarlane was suspended in October 2007 after meetings with his manager , in which he claimed he was asked to state his views regarding same - sex couples .
After the suspension was lifted he said he was labelled a " homophobe " and , following a further disciplinary hearing , was dismissed on 18 March .
We cannot allow anything to damage our clients , or to undermine the principle of trust that underpins our work
Claire Tyler , Relate
The tribunal , chaired by employment judge Toomer , dismissed Mr MacFarlane 's claims of harassment .
Ms Tyler , from Relate , added : " Relate 's trusted service , both in Avon and across the country , relies on making sure that all members of society , regardless of their gender , age , race , religion , sexual orientation or relationship status , are able to access respectful and professional counselling and sex therapy .
" Relate is committed to supporting all religious beliefs working within Relate .
" However , our primary consideration is to our clients who often need complex advice and assistance .
" We can not allow anything to damage our clients , or to undermine the principle of trust that underpins our work . "

An aerosol known as " black carbon , " a primary component in soot , looks to be a key driver of anthropogenic global warming in tropical locations around the world -- most notably , in the Himalayan region .
... new research , by NASA ’s William Lau and collaborators , reinforces with detailed numerical analysis what earlier studies suggest : that soot and dust contribute as much ( or more ) to atmospheric warming in the Himalayas as greenhouse gases .
This warming fuels the melting of glaciers and could threaten fresh water resources in a region that is home to more than a billion people . [...]
Nicknamed the “ Third Pole ” , the region in fact holds the third largest amount of stored water on the planet beyond the North and South Poles .
But since the early 1960s , the acreage covered by Himalayan glaciers has declined by over 20 percent .
Some Himalayan glaciers are melting so rapidly , some scientists postulate , that they may vanish by mid-century if trends persist .
Climatologists have generally blamed the build - up of greenhouse gases for the retreat , but Lau ’s work suggests that may not be the complete story .
He has produced new evidence suggesting that an “ elevated heat pump ” process is fueling the loss of ice , driven by airborne dust and soot particles absorbing the sun ’s heat and warming the local atmosphere and land surface .
Globally , black carbon looks to be the second most - important warming agent after CO 2 .
Here 's the twist : much of the production of black carbon comes from the combustion of biofuels and diesel , the two leading " greener " fuel technologies .
Aerosols last for months in the atmosphere , as opposed to the decades that greenhouse gases can last .
This is good , as it means that policies that reduce the production of black carbon can start showing positive results in a matter of weeks .

I think I destroyed someone ’s faith yesterday .
Or , in truth , I think I may have struck the definitive blow .
This does n’t bother me .
Unlike what many atheists espouse , for fear of being labeled evangelical proselytizers of disbelief , I actively seek the de-conversion of humanity .
I actively seek to destroy religion .
Not spirituality , but organized religion .
I believe that if we do not destroy it , it will destroy us .
And , when I say de-conversion I mean just that .
I mean de-conversion , not conversion to an atheist creed or dogma or doctrine , because none exists .
Atheism is simply the absence of faith .
It is not a similarly blind faith in science or logic or reason or philosophy or individualism or liberal constitutional democracy or anything .
But , I admit , I am feeling some qualms since yesterday .
I am struggling through some pangs of conscience since egging on a crisis of conscience .
In order to protect the innocent , I have altered all identifying characteristics .
Amina is a beautiful black French Muslim girl .
She is a French citizen , but her family hails from Guinea in West Africa – a former French colony .
She speaks Mandinka .
She is Mandinka .
She also speaks fluent French , decent Arabic , and very little English .
She is very proud .
She is very religious .
She is also very sweet and loving .
She would never wish to hurt anyone ’s feelings , but she does not hesitate to defend her faith , even from the mildest of chastisements .
She does not wear the hijab or headscarf .
She looks like a typical French teenager in her blue - jeans and t- shirts .
Amina was struggling with the burqa question .
She supports women ’s rights , but she feels the possible ban in France as an attack on her religion and her culture .
She does n’t want to think about Islam as inherently misogynistic .
She still believes that Islam is God ’s ( Allah ’s ) final revelation to man .
She still believes that the Quran is the infallible word of Allah .
If Islam is inherently misogynistic , then that means that Allah hates her , because she is a woman .
She cannot cope with the dissonance that this creates in her head .
She asserts that women absolutely do freely choose to don both the niqab and the burqa as expressions of their love for Allah .
She avers that women absolutely do freely choose to fulfill their God given roles as women in Islam according to the Quran .
She asked me what I thought about the potential burqa ban in France .
I paused and sighed deeply .
She said that it is a difficult question .
I agreed .
I told her many things .
I told her that I am an atheist .
I told her that I abhor all religions as the sexual slavery of women and the psychological torture of children .
I told her that I do not believe any of them to be true .
I told her that I have read all of the so - called holy books , and that I was not convinced that any of them could have been divinely inspired or dictated .
Not in the least .
I told her that I think religion must be destroyed in order for humanity to survive .
She told me many things .
She told me that she does not think that religion is the problem .
She told me that she thinks men pervert and misapply and manipulate religion for their own aims , sometimes knowingly , sometimes unknowingly , and sometimes disingenuously .
We looked upon one another with the same vaguely supercilious , rather patronizing pity .
We felt sorry for one another .
I pitied her ignorance and inculcation , and she pitied my ignorance and inculcation .
The difference being that I had escaped the iron grasp of a cult through years of struggle and effort .
I could fully demonstrate my knowing choice to be free of dogma and superstition .
She told me that she had not read the Bible , but that when she reads the Quran , she knows that she is reading the words of Allah .
She spoke of so many of the same arguments one hears by Christians defending the Bible .
The alleged way - ahead - of - its - time science in the Quran , including something about salty seawater and fresh ground water , and something about the earth being round , and something about embryology .
She spoke of the evil and dissolution of the surrounding societies during Mohammed ’s time and how Mohammed introduced an as yet unheard of morality .
And , she spoke of women ’s rights .
She told me that the Quran lists right after right for women .
She told me about the entire chapter on Mary , the mother of Jesus .
She told me that men pervert the message of the Quran , but that the Quran itself is perfect .
Needless to say , I was hardly won over by these arguments .
And , even after having told me that she had never read the Bible , she began to compare the Quran to the Bible and disparage the biblical text .
Of course , this is neither here nor there to me , as I find both texts equally unconvincing .
She told me that the Bible contradicts itself and is incoherent .
I agreed .
She then told me that the Quran has a single , singular and coherent message from beginning to end .
I was silent .
She told me that the Bible was written and assembled by the clergy .
This is why there are so many perversions and errors and mistranslations of God ’s intended revelation .
She told me that there is no clergy in Islam to muddy the waters of the direct conduit between Allah and man , as , originally , there were no intermediaries between Allah and Mohammed ( save Gabriel ) .
She proudly proclaimed Mohammed ’s illiteracy as ostensible proof of the Quran ’s greater authenticity .
This claim has always left me perplexed .
First of all , there is most assuredly a clergy class in Islam .
It just is n’t referred to as such .
( Much in the same way that Muslims do in fact worship Mohammed ; they just say that they do n’t . )
In fact I have seen very little evidence of the vaunted ijtihad in Islam , which is individual study and reflection and interpretation .
In my opinion , Islamic scholars have a stranglehold on Quranic exegesis and doctrinal interpretation , including the hadiths , Sharia and issuing fatwas .
Second of all , the fact that the Quran is allegedly the secondhand account of a series of direct revelations to an illiterate peasant does n’t seem to be much of an improvement over the Bible ’s divinely inspired theory .
But , I agreed with her arguments regarding the Bible .
I saw an opening .
I lambasted the Bible and Christianity mercilessly and , in particular , the divinity of Jesus .
I told her that the Bible is ridiculous .
She nodded fervently .
I told her that the Bible contradicts itself relentlessly .
She nodded and smiled assiduously .
I told her that the Bible excludes many apocryphal texts , which were left out for this or that reason by men .
She nodded and smirked avidly .
I told her that the Bible was obviously written by and for men in the pursuit of their earthly preoccupations , namely conquering lands and raping and enslaving women .
She nodded forcefully .
She beamed .
I understood .
I moved on to Jesus .
I spoke of the seemingly limitless number of almost identical Sun God myths floating around the Mediterranean and the Middle East for thousands of years before Jesus Christ showed up .
She concurred .
I spoke of all of the ways in which Jesus ’ story matches these other Sun God tales of virgin birth , crucifixion and resurrection .
She agreed .
I rattled on about the Nicene Creed and the Council of Nicaea and Constantine and the Roman Empire .
I spoke of Constantine ’s desire to unify his empire under a single Christian creed .
I spoke of how the divinity of Jesus was brought to a vote at the Council of Nicaea , along with other doctrinal elements of this new religion .
And she nodded approvingly and encouraged me .
I spoke about how the gospels were written at the very least 3 or 4 decades after the supposed death of Jesus Christ .
How they conflict with one another .
How they are plagiarisms of one another .
I spoke about how Paul and the other earlier , but still not contemporaneous , biblical authors , wrote not of an earthly man who had been born , lived , performed miracles , preached , and died , but of the same Mediterranean and Middle Eastern Sun God as heavenly archetype as everyone else had done .
Then , I hit her with the punch line .
Given all of this information , all of these facts , many , not all , but many scholars do not believe that there is any evidence at all that anyone by the name of Jesus , as described in the Christian Bible , ever existed .
Jesus was an archetype .
He was an amalgamation of the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern Sun God myths .
Not a single contemporaneous historian ever speaks a word about anyone named Jesus who even comes close to matching the Jesus in the Christian Bible .
First century Palestine is a very well documented era and geographic location .
Had someone actually been walking around performing miracles , causing turmoil for the Jewish and Roman leadership , been crucified , and , finally , been resurrected , in front of eyewitnesses , someone would have recorded it .
Someone .
Anyone .
But , no one ever did .
He never existed at all .
No man .
No rabbi .
No preacher .
No traveling salesman .
No prophet .
No farmer .
No leader .
There was no Jesus .
No one at all .
Her beautiful , proud eyes that had flickered with the fire of her religious conviction fell into a momentary downward glance as she grappled with a fleeting spasm of doubt .
I read the doubt on her face , clear as day .
She caught herself after just a moment , just as she was about to fall off the edge of her flat earth .
One of her flailing hands caught a shrub , and she was able to pull herself back up to a more secure footing .
She became an automaton .
She fell back into her rote , prepared spiel .
She said , “ Me , I believe that he existed .
But , he was just a man .
I do not believe that he was the Son of God .
He was a great teacher . ”
But the hairline crack of doubt remained in the slight , barely visible furrow of her brow .
I decided to lessen some of her pain .
I explained to her that , for the most part , the scholars who believe that there might have been an actual Jesus believe so for a single reason .
This reason is the great labors and pains taken to match Jesus ’ personal history with the Messianic prophecies of the Old Testament .
If there had n’t been an actual Jesus , there would not have been any need to go to such arduous lengths to get him to Bethlehem , for instance , and into the house of David .
I suddenly felt a spasm of guilt .
What had I done ?
Had I tricked her ?
I knew what I was doing .
I had manipulated her .
I argued my point in such a way as to lure her into a boxed - in corner .
I was n’t upset , because I had caused her to doubt her faith .
On the contrary , that was a victory .
But , I was upset , because of my methods .
I felt slimy and smarmy and unctuous .
I felt like a Jehovah ’s Witness .
I was reminded of all of my childhood witnessing tricks of the trade – the specious and disingenuous arguments , the rhetoric gymnastics of semantics and semiotics , the fatuous and fallacious non-logic .
I was a little bit disgusted with myself .
But , I had n’t said anything untrue .
My only sin was the fact that I knew where my argument was heading , and she did not .
Predestination in microcosm .
I think I just empathized with her emotional pain .
I know it .
I knew it .
Leaving one ’s faith can feel like tearing one ’s self in two .
Then , something occurred to me , which I am sure is no great revelation to anyone else , but it was a tremendous personal revelation .
Jesus is the key .
Jesus is the key to destroying the three great monotheisms .
Judaism is out of luck .
The Messianic ship has sailed .
No one in their right mind could ever be made to believe that someone yet to come is the Messiah .
Anyone from here on out claiming to be the Anointed One will be sent straight to the loony bin .
Unless , of course , some as yet unknown alien civilization attempts to take advantage of our credulity and shows up in a space ship more advanced than our wildest sci-fi fantasies .
Islam is a very poorly cobbled together plagiarism of both Judaism and Christianity .
Despite their seeming antipathy for one another , Islam is wholly reliant upon the other two .
Islam is discredited the second that either or both Christianity and Judaism are discredited .
Jesus ’ existence is the easiest to discredit .
There is n’t a shred of evidence that he ever existed at all , while there is a mountain of evidence that he was merely a knock off Egyptian Osiris .
While Mohammed may have been a bloodthirsty pedophile warlord , he was also an actual flesh and blood human being who managed to hold sway over the minds of thousands upon thousands of credulous souls .
But Jesus probably did n’t exist at all .
Muslims want desperately to concur with all of the criticisms of Jesus , every single one , right up to the point where you say that he did n’t exist at all , not even as a lowly man .
And , the Quran lives and dies with Jesus .
Every word of the Quran is supposedly the infallible word of Allah .
The Quran is all about Jesus .
Jesus , Jesus , Jesus .
Thank you Jesus .

As a former SR - 71 pilot , and a professional keynote speaker , the question I ’m most often asked is “ How fast would that SR - 71 fly ? ” I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend .
It ’s an interesting question , given the aircraft ’s proclivity for speed , but there really is n’t one number to give , as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to .
It was common to see 35 miles a minute .
Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions , and never wanted to harm the plane in any way , we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed .
Thus , each SR - 71 pilot had his own individual “ high ” speed that he saw at some point on some mission .
I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way , and max power was in order .
Let ’s just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we had n’t previously seen .

So it was with great surprise , when at the end of one of my presentations , someone asked , “ What was the slowest you ever flew in the Blackbird ? ”
This was a first .
After giving it some thought , I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before , and relayed the following .
I was flying the SR - 71 out of RAF Mildenhall , England , with my back - seater , Walt Watson ; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base .
As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes , we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR - 71 flypast .
The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot , and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR - 71 perform a low approach .
No problem , we were happy to do it .
After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea , we proceeded to find the small airfield .
Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat , and began to vector me toward the field .
Descending to subsonic speeds , we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze .
Like most former WWII British airfields , the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure .
Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field , but I saw nothing .
Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze .
We got a little lower , and I pulled the throttles back from the 325 knots we were at .
With the gear up , anything under 275 was just uncomfortable .
Walt said we were practically over the field — yet , there was nothing in my windscreen .
I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field .
Meanwhile , below , the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the flypast .
It was a quiet , still day with no wind and partial gray overcast .
Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us , but in the overcast and haze , I could n’t see it .
The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle , the slower we got .
With our power back , the awaiting cadets heard nothing .
I must have had good instructors in my flying career , as something told me I better cross -check the gauges .
As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots , my heart stopped and my adrenalin - filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward .
At this point , we were n’t really flying , but were falling in a slight bank .
Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame ( and what a joyous feeling that was ) , the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower .
Shattering the still quiet of that morning , they now had 107 feet of fire - breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated , in full burner , on the tower side of the infield , closer than expected , maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife - edge pass .
Quickly reaching the field boundary , we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident .
We did n’t say a word for those next 14 minutes .
After landing , our commander greeted us , and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings .
Instead , he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR - 71 flypast he had ever seen , especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking .
He said that some of the cadet ’s hats were blown off and the sight of the planform of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable .
Walt and I both understood the concept of “ breathtaking ” very well that morning , and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach .
As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits , we just sat there — we had n’t spoken a word since “ the pass . ”
Finally , Walter looked at me and said , “ One hundred fifty - six knots .
What did you see ? ”
Trying to find my voice , I stammered , “ One hundred fifty - two . ”
We sat in silence for a moment .
Then Walt said , “ Do n’t ever do that to me again ! ”
And I never did .
A year later , Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer ’s Club , and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR - 71 flypast that he had seen one day .
Of course , by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows .
Noticing our HABU patches , as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands , he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred .
Walt just shook his head and said , “ It was probably just a routine low approach ; they ’re pretty impressive in that plane . ”
Impressive indeed .
Little did I realize after relaying this experience to my audience that day that it would become one of the most popular and most requested stories .
It ’s ironic that people are interested in how slow the world ’s fastest jet can fly .
Regardless of your speed , however , it ’s always a good idea to keep that cross-check up … and keep your Mach up , too .

European Internet users accused of illicit file - sharing will not be disconnected on the whims of the entertainment industries .
After an all night session European Union lawmakers agreed on a compromise text .
Those accused will be entitled to a " fair and impartial " procedure , which will include the right to be heard .
Last night a committee comprised of EU government representatives , Members of the European Parliament and the European Commission settled their differences , which will now lead to a vote on acceptance of the controversial EU Telecoms Reform Package , aimed at boosting competition .
With a vote of 407 in favor , 57 against , with 171 abstentions , EU lawmakers sent the package back to the Council in May , due to concerns that Internet users would not have their rights sufficiently protected .
After all night negotiations the deadlock was broken after a compromise agreement was reached .
Internet users in all 27 EU states will be entitled to be put through a “ fair and impartial procedure ” ( although what that means exactly is far from clear ) , including the right to be heard in response to allegations before being subjected to the ultimate sanction – disconnection .
Christian Engström of The Pirate Party helped to shape the modified text that was accepted in a unanimous vote last night .
“ The Telecoms Reform Package neither demands nor prohibits the implementation of three - strikes legislation to disconnect alleged file - sharers by member states , ” Engström told TorrentFreak , adding that if they do implement such measures , they will have to be within the parameters of the directive .
As reported by Engström , the exact text reads :
3a . Measures taken by Member States regarding end - users ’ access to or use of services and applications through electronic communications networks shall respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons , as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and general principles of Community law .
Any of these measures regarding end - user ’s access to or use of services and applications through electronic communications networks liable to restrict those fundamental rights or freedoms may only be imposed if they are appropriate , proportionate and necessary within a democratic society , and their implementation shall be subject to adequate procedural safeguards in conformity with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and with general principles of Community law , including effective judicial protection and due process .
Accordingly , these measures may only be taken with due respect for the principle of presumption of innocence and the right to privacy .
A prior fair and impartial procedure shall be guaranteed , including the right to be heard of the person or persons concerned , subject to the need for appropriate conditions and procedural arrangements in duly substantiated cases of urgency in conformity with European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
The right to an effective and timely judicial review shall be guaranteed .
Engström said the vote for the text was a positive surprise as he thought this agreement would never happen .
Although in an ideal world it is not everything he could have hoped for , it is a big step in the right direction .
“ We would never have been able to achieve this without all the work that the community of net activists has put in , ” he further notes .
“ We have shown that ordinary citizens working together can make a difference .
And this is only the beginning .
The Internet community has begun to flex its muscles . ”
Engström told TorrentFreak that although he is happy with the outcome , there are still many battles to be fought .
“ Nobody should be disconnected from the Internet in an open and free society , ” he said .
The European Parliament and Council is due to make a decision on the Telecoms Reform Package in late November , with the laws coming into force early 2010 .
Member countries will then have 18 months to pass the legislation into their own national laws .
The following blog post , unless otherwise noted , was written by a member of Gamasutras community .
The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company .
I 've worked as a pixel artist for close to 4 years now , on microscopic no - name mobile games , popular flash games , iPhone games , and even on a certain highly anticipated WiiWare title .
I 've worked for as little as $ 5/hr , and for as much as $ 50 / hr , doing basically the same stuff .
I 've done UI design , background art , tilemaps , sprites , the whole thing .
For the last couple years , while running my own companies , I 've been responsible for hiring and collaborating with some of the top pixel artists in the world .
The opinions that follow are based on my own personal experience as well as the experience of my clients and friends over the last few years , and include making a wide variety of art assets for almost every available game platform .
Introduction
Between the growing iPhone , Nintendo DS , and PC / console digital distro systems , there remains in these days of normal maps and light bloom a strong and steady market for the economy , clarity , and nostalgia of pixel art .
There are a lot of talented new faces on the art end of things , and a lot of eager new faces on the business end of things , which is awesome but can also lead to some misunderstandings or confusion .
I will try to address most if not all of the pixel - art specific issues with freelancing and contract work , but I will also be covering some general issues that can crop up when outside help is involved .
This article is for contractors and employers alike .
Unless clearly noted , every section should be useful for both freelancers and producers to read and digest .
It is important for contractors to understand the risks and realities of the people that are doing the hiring , and equally important for the employers to understand the pressures and responsibilities of their freelancers !
Why use or make pixel art ?
Pixel art has a lot of strengths , even in this age of multi- core bla bla blas .
Well - executed pixel art has unparalleled clarity and visual control , especially on small screens that are n't always the highest quality .
The palettized ( limited to certain colors ) images are also extremely memory efficient ; a few hundred kilobytes is more than enough for a small to medium - sized game .
Perhaps the most prevalent reason is the inherent charm and nostalgia of using a medium that was invented to accomodate the limited technology of two decades ago .
So what ?
Touché , sir , but you are correct .
From the perspective of the artist or the employer , it helps to know not just what pixel art is good at , but what is easy to achieve in pixel art , because this will more directly affect how much time and effort you have to expend .
The places where you really gain some time are in color and animation .
Since pixel art is palettized , it 's very easy to manipulate the colors in a way that is quite difficult to achieve with higher color count images .
If you want to make red and blue variants of your yellow creature , you do n't have to make special masks , or pull up the layered PSD , or any of that stuff .
There are so few colors that you can manipulate them directly , quickly and easily .
This means making alternate versions of game objects can be almost trivial .
Due to the limited number of colors , many people find animating pixel art to be much faster or easier than in other 2D mediums , and many pixel art programs directly incorporate the ability to animate as a key feature .
Generally speaking , pixel art can be a very efficient way to produce a lot of artwork in the same style , especially at small sizes .
Sounds great !
Let 's use pixel art for EVERYTHING FOREVER
Well ...ok hang on a sec .
While pixel art does some things better than other 2D mediums , there are many things that can be unexpectedly expensive in terms of time and effort .
Not recognizing or identifying these things early enough in your project can result in some serious difficulties at later stages of your project , both as an artist and as a producer or employer .
Most of the problems with pixel art all stem from one basic ... thing , which is size .
First , it is expensive and time - consuming to change the size of pixel art assets after they 've been produced .
If you 're handpainting your assets with soft brushes and an unlimited palette , it 's very easy to change the size and sharpness of the asset ( within reasonable boundaries ) well after the asset has been stamped and approved .
This is absolutely not the case with pixel art under any imaginable circumstances .
Unfortunately , a facet of this problem extends even to well - planned , well - intentioned projects .
It 's a quadratic problem ; that is , doubling the resolution of your project actually quadruples the size of the art assets .
After all , you can fit four 64x64 images into a 128x128 image .
In many 2D mediums that just means using a bigger brush , no big deal , but in pixel art the ramifications are pretty serious .
When you are painting your lines and details and anti-aliasing pixel by precious pixel you have 4 times as many elements to manipulate with tender , obsessive care .
Size also causes some serious animation problems .
Let 's say you have a walk cycle at 16x16 ( like Link from the original Legend of Zelda ) .
You can coax a fairly smooth walk animation out of this character with just 4 frames , because his legs only move a pixel or two each frame .
However , at 32x32 the legs will be moving much farther , up to 10 or 12 pixels per frame if you only have 4 frames .
To maintain relative smoothness , you have to bump it up to at least 6 frames .
Not only are you painting 4 times as many pixels per frame now , but you need to add 50 % additional frames !
This is a massive workload increase .
As your characters get larger , this problem continues to grow .
If you need large pieces of art , and you do n't have large pieces of money and time laying about , you need to think about some alternatives , which brings us to ...
Oh I see , so pixel art is actually a pain in the -
No , it 's still awesome , especially if you 're working on a small screen .
You just have to think about what you 're trying to achieve with your style choice , and think about what you 're planning for or asking for .
So how can you mediate some of the potential pixel art pitfalls we just outlined ?
Plan , plan , plan .
Minimize major size changes by planning , sketching , prototyping , and just generally figuring out what it is you really need for the project .
This means you , too , freelancers !
This is n't just the client 's responsibility ; if you are looking for jobs , look over the requested image sizes , make sure they make sense .
If you need to , help the client understand if part of their plan is way off course .
Otherwise you 're both screwed once you sign that contract .
Get creative .
If you need a 1080 p image for your background image , commissioning an original , completely unique span of pixel art is going to break your bank .
Period .
But there are so many different ways to tackle this problem !
The nice thing about the size problem is that it works in reverse , too .
If it 's even half the size , it 's four times easier to put together .
Can it use repeating elements ?
Being able to copy - paste houses or trees or something can be a huge time saver and not come off looking cheap .
Finally , just because your smaller foreground elements are pixel art does n't mean the background needs to be .
Metroid Zero Mission shipped with buckets of non-pixel art backgrounds .
Anything else ?
Oh man , so much .
I 'll try and touch on the most pragmatic of the ancillary concerns :
Design Time :
If you need 8 enemy creatures and 2 backgrounds , have they been designed yet ?
If they have n't , this is not a trivial process .
This is a substantial investment in time and creative energy and your budget should accomodate this , no matter if you 're the contractor or the employer .
I am afraid I do n't have a great mechanic for estimating this process , but for many artists designing the actual object or creature or character can take longer than actually creating the final pixel art , especially if there is n't much animation .
What does this job offer ?
Not all jobs pay money !
Legitimate forms of payment do include prestige , experience , and networking .
Getting to put a high profile title on your resume and portfolio will end up paying you back ten times over , even if it does n't pay much up front .
However , these things need to be carefully considered before they are traded for the more immediately useful cash money .
A good rule of thumb is to leave that decision up to the contractor .
Remember , as an employer , if you have to actually explain that your gig is a good trade for prestige , chances are it is n't prestigious enough !
Well how much should I charge ?
That 's the million dollar question , no pun intended , and probably the most common question among new contractors and people new to hiring .
And it does n't have an obvious or simple answer .
I 'll try and tackle it from a couple of different perspectives :
Hourly rates :
In the US , hourly rates for pixel artists vary from $ 15 per hour up to a cap around $ 50 per hour for the best artists on the most well - funded projects .
This can be a lot of money for somebody in New Zealand , but sometimes not very much if you 're in mainland Europe .
However , a useful median that you 'll see from large , respectable companies is about $ 30 / hr for talented artists to work on high profile projects that look pretty hot on your portfolio .
The format for keeping track of these agreements can sometimes be as informal as a weekly email or as formal as logging in to a timekeeping app on the web .
NB : these are the price caps that I am familiar with for the game industry .
Other , tangential industries ( like advertising or publishing ) can pay up to ten times as much !
I love you , ad industry .
Project rates :
The other obvious option is to charge for the whole project , and this is where things get ... tricky .
An open , hourly tab is a rare thing to find at a small company especially , and you 're going to have to take a lot of things into consideration to figure out what to charge or how much to pay .
As the contractor , think about how long it will take to do the job ( then multiply it by 2 ) , think about who is doing the hiring ( big company ?
small ?
well - connected ? ) , then consider what else you can get out of this job ( new art style , prestigious project ) .
As an employer , make sure you have an actual budget and did all your planning !
Remember , offering prestige as a trade for money can be problematic .
Your best option is to go into the project with a clear plan and a good budget ( more on this later ) .
Per asset rates :
It 's also common , especially near the end of projects , for companies to farm out their remaining assets to a few different artists , to finish the last big push in massive parallel .
Treat these just like a series of small projects , as far as rates go ; all the same reasoning applies .
What if the freelancer only works part - time , as a hobby ?
If they 're doing great work and helping companies ship products for which the company receives actual revenue shares in perpetuity , the artist still deserves fair compensation for their contributions .
For a successful game , the art budget can be less than 1 % of the total revenue earned , even if you 're paying your artists VERY well .
For employers only : what if you can't afford these rates ?
Your options are limited , but there 's still a lot you can do .
Downsize your game idea , bring an artist on as a partner ( creatively , not just financially ) , save up for a real budget , call in favors , or man up and learn to draw !
There are a lot of ways to present your game that do n't require a fantastic grasp of anatomy , volume , or lighting .
Which brings me to ...
The issue of quality .
If the budget is half what it should be , think really seriously about the quality of the art that the job requires .
Can it be done with fewer colors ?
Does it require an accomplished artist ?
How polished do the final pieces need to be ?
Can you use a more simplistic style ?
As a producer or client , you should have some options like these in mind .
As the freelancer , you need to constantly be asking yourself these questions too .
If it 's a cheap job , is it also easy , with a simplistic style ?
If so , it can totally be worth it , especially if it 's project - pricing .
Attitude and reputation are extremely important .
Before you take a job or hire an artist , it is up to you to do your research .
Talk to your friends and acquaintances , check out your intricate web of professionals and see if anybody has any feedback about your decision before you sign the papers .
Just because it 's a big company does n't mean they are trustworthy or prompt .
Just because they have a great portfolio does n't mean they will be a responsible contractor !
Is that it ?
For the artists , sure .
For the employers , almost .
If you 're still reading this , I 'd like to bust a myth or two that you might be tempted to fall back on , especially if you have a tight budget :
" Leave it up to the artists to pick the budget ; it 's a free market ; capitalism bla bla bla . "
Between the excitement and desperation of living job to job and the relative difficulty of gaining experience when you 're running solo , it can be really hard for an artist to get up the guts to charge completely sane , fair rates for their work .
Humans in general are notorious for underestimating the amount of work that 's required to complete anything , much less design and execute animations of invented monsters .
By paying competitive rates , you are more likely to find experienced professionals , and having a reputation as a solid employer will pay itself forward in a big way on future projects .
Fair rates are a win -win situation .
" I need a logo design , but I only have $ 100 .
I know , I 'll hold a contest ! "
No .
" Since hiring someone is risky , I will mediate that risk by just reducing the pay . "
It sounds reasonable at first .
Why pay full price for something that might not pan out ?
So follow me through a scenario here .
Let 's say you have an art budget of $ 5000 , but you play the risk card and only pay out $ 2500 .
If the deal falls through , you just lost half your art budget .
You 're boned either way , and in the meantime you 've earned yourself a reputation as a tightwad and shady dealer .
Do your job , assume the risk , do the research , and find the right artist .
A final , more personal note ...
In my experience , especially if you have a family and a house , doing contract art for the game industry is not a sustainable career .
Like I mentioned in my earlier blog about freelancing , the ideal freelancing schedule is about 20 hours per week .
At the median art rates , I was barely pulling enough to cover our meager mortgage , food , and school loans .
I was definitely not making enough to pay for health insurance , and we do n't even have kids yet !
For me , freelancing was a really great way to meet some amazing people in the game industry , build a skill set that I both wanted and needed , and not starve in the meantime .
My goal throughout was to ensure that I always made time for internal or collaborative projects that I owned but had no up - front , monetary reward .
It was these projects that eventually allowed me the flexibility to write bigass articles for Gamasutra in my free time !

DALLAS , TX , October 5 , 2009 ( LifeSiteNews.com ) - A Dallas judge ruled last Thursday to hear a " divorce " lawsuit between two men whose same - sex " marriage " was performed in Massachusetts , declaring the state marriage amendment and the state 's Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional .
District Judge Tena Callahan issued her ruling in a state court in Dallas last week to strike down the Texas marriage amendment , as well as the state DOMA , stating that the state ban on same - sex " marriage " violates the federal constitutional right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution .
This ruling marks the first time that a state court judge has struck down marriage laws based on the U. S. Constitution .
The two men seeking the Texas " divorce " were " married " in Cambridge , Mass. in September 2006 , and then returned to Dallas .
This lawsuit to dissolve their partnership was filed in January .
Immediately after ruling , Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott announced that he would appeal Callahan 's attack on the laws and constitution of the Lone Star State and defend the traditional definition of marriage that Texas voters overwhelmingly approved in 2005 .
Texas Gov. Rick Perry , who supported the amendment four years ago , stated that he is confident that the voters ' and lawmakers ' affirmation of marriage as between one man and one woman in the state of Texas would remain standing after this recent challenge .
Alliance Defense Fund ( ADF ) attorneys said they are planning to file a friend - of - the - court brief opposing the Texas court 's ruling .
" The government cannot consider issuing a ' divorce ' for a ' marriage ' it does n't recognize .
Seventy - five percent of Texans in 2005 made it perfectly clear that marriage in their state is solely between one man and one woman , " said ADF Senior Legal Counsel and Texas native Austin R. Nimocks .
" The Texas voters understand that marriage laws promote children having both a mother and a father .
This ruling runs contrary to the voice of Texans and the historic purposes behind the state 's marriage laws . "
A similar attack on marriage as the one in Texas is also currently taking place in Oklahoma , where voters approved their state amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman by 76 percent in 2004 .
In O'Darling v. O'Darling , a " divorce " is being sought by two women allegedly " married " in Canada .
That matter is currently pending before the Oklahoma Supreme Court .
In 2007 the Rhode Island Supreme Court refused issue a " divorce " to two women " married " in Massachusetts .
Just last month , two women " married " in Canada were denied a " divorce " in Indiana because it would have violated the state 's existing law .
Currently , only the states of Massachusetts , Vermont , Connecticut , and Iowa permit same - sex " marriages . "
New Hampshire 's same - sex " marriage " law is set to goes into effect on January 1 , 2010 .
Maine 's same - sex " marriage " law , enacted this year , is currently on hold , pending a vote by the citizens of Maine in November on the issue .
Washington , D.C. voted in May to recognize same - sex " marriages " performed outside of the district .
The Truth About Self - Deception
Can we pull the wool over our own eyes or do we see through our mind games ?
In theory the one person we should never , ever , lie to is ourselves .
Surely lying to ourselves is counter - productive ?
Like calmly and deliberately shooting yourself in the foot or taking a hot toasting fork and plunging it into your eye ?
But look around and it ’s not hard to spot the tell - tale symptoms of self - deception in other people .
So perhaps we are also deceiving ourselves in ways we can’t clearly perceive ?
But is that really possible and would we really believe the lies that we ‘ told ’ ourselves anyway ?
That ’s what Quattrone & Tversky ( 1984 ) explored in a classic social psychology experiment published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .
Lies , damn lies and psychologists
Any study of self - deception is going to involve a fair amount of bare - faced lying , and Quattrone & Tversky ’s ( 1984 ) research was no different .
They recruited 38 students who were told they were going to take part in a study about the “ psychological and medical aspects of athletics ” .
Not true , in fact the researchers were going to trick participants into thinking that how long they could submerge their arms in cold water was diagnostic of their health status , when really it showed just how ready people are to deceive themselves .
This is how they did it .
The participants were first asked to plunge their arms into cold water for as long as they could .
The water was pretty cold and people could only manage this for 30 or 40 seconds .
Then participants were given some other tasks to do to make them think they really were involved in a study about athletics .
They had a go on an exercise bike and were given a short lecture about life expectancy and how it related to the type of heart you have .
They were told there were two types of heart :
Type I heart : associated with poorer health , shorter life expectancy and heart disease .
Type II heart : associated with better health , longer life expectancy and low risk of heart disease .
Half were told that people with Type II hearts ( apparently the ‘ better ’ type ) have increased tolerance to cold water after exercise while the other half that it decreased tolerance to cold water .
Except of course this was all lies only made up to make participants think that how long they could hold their arm under water was a measure of their health , with half thinking cold - tolerance was a good sign and half thinking it was a bad sign .
Now time for the test : participants had another go at putting their arms into the cold water for as long as they could .
The graph below shows the average results before and after all the blatant lying ( in the name of science of course ! ) :
As you can see the experimental manipulation had a strong effect .
People who thought it was a sign of a healthy heart to hold their arms underwater for longer did just that , while those who believed the reverse all of a sudden could n’t take the cold .
That ’s all well and good , but were these people really lying to themselves or just the experimenters and did they believe those lies ?
Hook , line and sinker
After the arm - dunking each participant was asked whether they had intentionally changed the amount of time they held their arms underwater .
Of the 38 participants , 29 denied it and 9 confessed , but not directly .
Many of the 9 confessors claimed the water had changed temperature .
It had n’t of course , this was just a way for people to justify their behaviour without directly facing their self - deception .
All the participants were then asked whether they believed they had a healthy heart or not .
Of the 29 deniers , 60 % believed they had the healthier type of heart .
However of the confessors only 20 % thought they had the healthier heart .
What this suggests is that the deniers were more likely to be truly deceiving themselves and not just trying to cover up their deception .
They really did think that the test was telling them they had a healthy heart .
Meanwhile the confessors tried to tell a lie back to the experimenter ( seems only fair ! ) , but privately the majority acknowledged they were deceiving themselves .
This experiment is neat because it shows the different gradations of self - deception , all the way up to its purest form , in which people manage to trick themselves hook , line and sinker .
At this level people think and act as though their incorrect belief is completely true , totally disregarding any incoming hints from reality .
So what this study suggests is that for many people self - deception is as easy as pie .
Not only will many people happily lie to themselves if given a reason , but they will only look for evidence that confirms their comforting self - deception , and then totally believe in the lies they are telling themselves .
Explains a lot , do n’t you think ?
As well as losing TSB , Lloyds is also likely to sell Cheltenham and Gloucester bank and Intelligent Finance , its online banking arm .
RBS is likely to sell its NatWest branches in Scotland and its card - payment business , as well as its insurance arm including Churchill , Direct Line and Green Flag .
There is still a debate about RBS 's American retail bank , Citizens , which Mr Hester has said is not on the table .
Few people understand the real significance of Climategate , the now - famous hacking of emails from the University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) .
Most see the contents as demonstrating some arbitrary manipulating of various climate data sources in order to fit preconceived hypotheses ( true ) , or as stonewalling and requesting colleagues to destroy emails to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) in the face of potential or actual Freedom of Information requests ( also true ) .

LONDON Nov. 16 , 2009  --
The most celebrated high class hooker in the world has revealed herself to be a high class cancer scientist and says she is proud of the good old days .
Dr. Brooke Magnanti revealed herself this weekend in the Sunday Times saying that she is the real - life Belle du Jour , the $ 500 an hour London call girl whose life was documented in three books , a TV show and her ongoing blog .
Magnanti , who wrote " Secret Diary of a Call Girl , " told the paper she turned to prostitution for more than a year while writing her Ph.D. thesis in 2003 .
While she reveled in her job and her nom de plume , she chafed at the anonymity of her story .
" Being anonymous is no fun .
No jolly lunches to celebrate the book 's success .
I could n't even go to my own launch party , " she told the paper .
According to her interview with the Sunday Times , Magnanti decided to give up her anonymity so she would not have to keep the " massive secret " any longer .
The interviewer also mentioned " an ex-boyfriend with a big mouth lurking in the background " who might have inspired her to beat others to the punch .
But now that she is as famous as Belle du Jour , Magnanti is asking people to keep their distance from her new workplace , the Bristol Initiative for Research of Child Health where she is a specialist in developmental neurotoxicology and cancer epidemiology .
" Please do not come to my workplace as this compromises the security of patients and staff .
Thank you for understanding , " she wrote today on her blog Belle de Jour : Diary of a London Call Girl .
She also took a moment on today 's blog to answer what has apparently been a big question since her Sunday revelation : " Also , so much curiosity about my tax situation !
Yes , I did pay taxes on sex work earnings . "
Magnanti told the newspaper that she first outed herself to her co-workers a month ago , who were " amazingly kind and supportive . "
She then revealed her true identity to her agent a week before her interview , and did not get the nerve to tell her mother until this week .
Despite trepidations over telling her mother , Magnanti insists she is proud of her old profession and what she wrote about it .
" The people , the places , the actions and feelings are as true now as they were then , and I stand behind every word with pride , " she says on her blog .
" Thank you for reading and following my adventures . "
Her adventures began when she left Scotland for London where she would write her Ph.D. thesis , but she found London more expensive than anticipated .
" The difference between living in the Highlands and living in London is massive .
I had n't really thought that one through , " she told the Sunday Times .
" I started to think : what can I do that I can start doing straightaway , that does n't require a great deal of training or investment to get started , that 's cash in hand and that leaves me spare time to do my work in ? "
Unable to find a professional job without a Ph.D. and unwilling to accumulate debt , she decided her answer was prostitution .
She found a London escort agency and charged £ 300 an hour for her services , £ 200 of which she kept for herself .
During her time as a sex worker , she said she slept with " somewhere between dozens and hundreds " of men .
" I did have another job at one point as a computer programmer , but I kept up with my other work because it was so much more enjoyable , " she said .
She started blogging about her sexual exploits early in her career under the name Belle de Jour , an alias inspired by a character in a Luis Buñuel film .
In the film , a bored housewife played by French icon Catherine Deneuve turns to prostitution to explore her sexual fantasies .
' Being Anonymous is No Fun '
The British press created a long and varied list of possible suspects for the London - based Belle de Jour .
Some even believed Belle was actually a man , speculating that Toby Young , the author of How To Lose Friends and Alienate People , was writing secretly under her name .
Other suspects included Lisa Hilton , a British journalist based in America , and Rowan Pelling , the former editor of the Erotic Review .
Magnanti says it feels good to step out from behind the curtain of secrecy .
It feels so much better on this side .
Not to have to tell lies , hide things from the people I care about .
To be able to defend what my experience of sex work is like to all the skeptics and doubters .
" Anonymity had a purpose then .
It will always have a reason to exist , for writers whose work is too damaging or too controversial to put their names on .
But for me , it became important to acknowledge that aspect of my life and my personality to the world at large , " she wrote .
She then signed off with , " I am a woman .
I lived in London .
I was a call girl . "
New York Mayor Bloomberg to spend more than $ 100 million to secure third term
By Fred Mazelis
7 October 2009
The reelection campaign of New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is on course to spend well over $ 100 million , setting a new record for any local race .
Bloomberg has already spent $ 65 million of his own money on this campaign , according to the New York Times .
Official financial disclosure data released last week shows that the billionaire mayor has paid out $ 22 million for television ads in the last few months , along with $ 10 million on campaign mailings , which have been inundating voters ’ mailboxes for some time now .
There is still a month to go before Election Day .
Four years ago Bloomberg spent nearly half of his total during the same period .
If he maintains that pace , the sum will be a record - setting $ 117 million .
This is only a small fraction — about 0.7 percent to be more precise — of Bloomberg ’s estimated net worth of $ 16 billion .
It is 16 times as much , however , as the $ 3.8 million spent by Bloomberg ’s Democratic opponent , City Comptroller William C. Thompson .
Thompson , whose party supposedly has the support of four out of every five New York City voters , has only a few million dollars left .
In the month of September he raised the grand total of $ 114,000 , which is about as much as Bloomberg has been spending every two hours .
In 2001 , when he first ran for mayor , Bloomberg ’s spokesmen explained that as a “ non-politician ” he had to spend generously to become better known .
That is obviously not the situation eight years later .
Although he is leading in the polls , Bloomberg has reasons to be concerned .
He is running for a third term in the midst of the greatest economic crisis in generations .
Millions of working people are angry and anxious over the conditions they face and their future and are increasingly directing their ire at Wall Street , with which the mayor and his fortune are closely identified .
There is also the issue of Bloomberg ’s hypocritical and dishonest maneuvers last year to overturn the city ’s term limits legislation twice upheld by voters in citywide referendums .
While City Hall has done its best to suppress any public discussion on this issue , the move was widely unpopular and seen as politically corrupt .
Bloomberg is taking nothing for granted precisely because he knows that he cannot count upon any genuine enthusiasm among voters .
He is trying to give his campaign the aura of inevitability .
He seeks to mobilize his wealthy and middle class supporters , who can be counted on to come to the polls in numbers that are far disproportionate to their small percentage of the population , while discouraging the much larger number of working class voters who are looking for an alternative but see none whatsoever .
Depending on turnout , he could wind up spending as much as $ 50 or $ 100 for each vote .
Above all , Bloomberg is counting on the political bankruptcy of his supposed opposition .
The spending juggernaut is aimed at demoralizing any of the Democrats who may have hopes of defeating the incumbent .
William Thompson , who won the Democratic nomination against City Councilman Tony Avella in last month ’s primary election , is a product of the Brooklyn Democratic Party machine and whose father was a state senator and later an appellate court judge .
Thompson was president of the city ’s Board of Education during the 1990s , and has served as comptroller during both of Bloomberg ’s terms in office .
For the last eight years , neither Thompson nor any of his fellow Democrats had any fundamental policy differences with Bloomberg .
When the mayor announced such policies as forcing homeless families to pay rent for living in shelters , the Democrats said little and did less .
During Bloomberg ’s “ business - friendly ” two terms in office , there were few complaints because the Democrats , holding 48 out of 51 City Council seats as well as most other local offices , had no differences with the billionaire mayor , a Democrat - turned - Republican - turned - “ Independent . ”
In September 2008 , for instance , in the week after the collapse of Lehman Brothers , and a month before Bloomberg rammed his term limits repeal through the City Council , the mayor ordered spending cuts of $ 1.5 billion over the next two years .
Thompson , in his capacity as city comptroller and with an eye toward running to succeed Bloomberg when the mayor left the stage , backed the attacks on jobs and public services .
“ It is responsible to take action now to address this problem , ” Thompson declared , adding , in a plea with which Bloomberg could easily agree , that “ it is my hope that any reduction will be managed in a way that minimizes the impact on critical services provided to New Yorkers . ”
Thompson suddenly discovered that Bloomberg was a scoundrel who was “ out of touch ” with ordinary New Yorkers only when the mayor double - crossed those who were expecting that he would leave after his allotted two terms in office .
When the City Council revised the term limits law to allow for a third term , Thompson , in his own words , “ felt betrayed . ”
He had waited his turn and played by the rules , but was now being snubbed .
Another indication of the moribund state of New York ’s Democrats is the voter turnout in the primary that Thompson won on September 15 .
Less than 11 percent of the city ’s enrolled Democrats cast ballots , a record low .
Thompson became the party ’s standard bearer with perhaps 3 percent of the city ’s eligible voters .
The current state of New York City politics is about far more than the personal pique of Thompson or the report that Bloomberg decided on a third term after his quixotic hope of a campaign as a third - party presidential candidate fizzled .
Bloomberg ’s position in New York politics is a vivid expression of the increasingly hollow character of capitalist democracy in an American political system that is of , for and by a narrow financial elite .
In a recent issue of the weekly Village Voice newspaper in New York , reporter Tom Robbins reveals some of the mechanisms by which this social layer exercises a political stranglehold with little concern for democratic sensibilities .
Robbins refers to a new political biography of Bloomberg by New York Times reporter Joyce Purnick .
Much of the material in the book is already fairly well known .
The mayor was apparently thinking of making an end run around term limits as early as February 2008 .
He commissioned a public opinion poll that spring that suggested that a move to overturn previous ballots in favor of term limits would go down to defeat .
So instead of taking the issue to the voters , Bloomberg bided his time , waiting until the eruption of the financial crisis in September of 2008 to announce that he felt compelled to stay on as mayor because he was uniquely qualified to confront the economic emergency .
( Not so coincidentally , Bloomberg ’s predecessor , Rudy Giuliani , attempted to grab a third term eight years ago , claiming that only he could deal with the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks . )
Having waited until less than two months before the general election — in which a large turnout would assure the defeat of a ballot initiative overturning term limits — Bloomberg insisted that there was no time to organize such a referendum , and instead turned to the City Council seeking legislation allowing him , as well as other city officials , a one - time pass on term limits .
As this gave incumbent City Council members facing the end of their terms a chance to keep their jobs , it was not difficult to pull together a majority vote for the measure .
Robbins ’s article provides an account of the behind - the - scenes deliberations which solidified Bloomberg ’s decision to seek a third term .
In July 2008 , he met with Rupert Murdoch and other billionaires at an annual tycoons ’ retreat in Sun Valley , Idaho .
Bloomberg , Robbins writes , “ mingled with Murdoch and other pro-third term chums , including investment mogul Henry Kravis and Time Warner ’s Richard Parsons .
The mayor was apparently treated to a full - court press from those moguls , who were in turn consulting with real estate big Jerry Speyer and investment strategist Steven Rattner , both of whom were aggressively pushing a third term . ”
While the official Republican or Democratic Party primaries get most of the media attention , the real primary is that described by Purnick and Robbins — the discussions in which the unelected plutocrats confer and bestow their support on their political representatives .
In the case of Bloomberg , it is one of their own , and the discussions are almost not necessary .
Of course Bloomberg , the wealthiest man in New York , does not occupy a subordinate position in relation to Murdoch , Kravis and the rest .
It would be safe to say , however , that his plans would have been altered if for any reason these figures had told him that they would withhold their support .
In fact , the example of the one billionaire who differed with Bloomberg on the term limits maneuver proves this point in another way .
Cosmetics magnate Ronald Lauder told the mayor he would not go along and planned to run ads against the term limits change .
Bloomberg then negotiated a deal in which Lauder agreed to make “ an exception . ”
In return , the mayor promised a seat on the city Charter revision commission that will be formed next year , a quid pro quo arrangement that many see as a brazen violation of the city ’s ethics laws .
Bloomberg ’s quest for a third term exposes a political system in which plutocratic rule is less and less disguised .
The super - rich prefer increasingly to hold the reins of power directly rather than through political representatives who must make an attempt to win the support of broader masses of the population .
Bloomberg ’s status as the overwhelming consensus candidate of the ruling class is also highlighted by the apparent decision of the Obama White House to sit out the New York mayoral race .
Under conditions where Obama has shown no hesitation in strongly intervening in both this year ’s governor ’s race in New Jersey and next year ’s in New York , this amounts to a backhanded endorsement of the Republican mayor .
Even if Obama eventually endorses Thompson , it will surely be a pro forma gesture .
The president is already on record as calling Bloomberg an “ outstanding mayor . ”
The rallying around Bloomberg for an unprecedented third term is a sign of the weakness of the existing political setup , not its strength .
Especially in the wake of the worldwide economic collapse and the clear indications that the future is one of deepening unemployment , budget cuts and home foreclosures , the ruling elite is increasingly aware that it is sitting on top of a powder keg .
Whether Bloomberg wins a third term or not , these social and class contradictions will continue to grow and will inevitably explode in a new period of mass political struggle .
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele on Tuesday urged the president to delay healthcare reform until the job market considerably improved .
In a letter to the White House this morning , Steele predicted " Democrats and Republicans would stand with [ President Barack Obama ] and proudly so " if he announced he no longer wanted to pass healthcare reform by the year 's end .

" You would n't advise any American to bet the rent check now if they did n't know whether they would have a job next spring .
You certainly would n't advise them to borrow money to put at risk , if they had no clue if they would be employed , " the chairman wrote .
" Much the same , Congress can't afford to throw the American people further in debt now and splurge on a risky health care bill when we may need all the resources at our disposal next year to rebuild a sagging economy , " Steele added .
Ultimately , it may not require the president 's intervention to keep healthcare reform from passing this year .
Senate Democrats are still squabbling over a number of contentions issues in their own bill -- from the shape and scope of the public option , to whether the proposal should include tough abortion language , to many of the taxes included to offset the bill 's costs .
The majority party has stressed since Monday that it is beginning to make progress on those fronts , especially with the public option debate .
But those compromises are not guaranteed to satisfy all Democrats , further complicating Senate Majority Leader ( D - Nev. )
Harry Reid 's already daunting task of cobbling together 60 votes to avoid a filibuster .
But as that debate raged on at the Capitol this morning , Steele stressed Obama should steer his party away from healthcare reform , for now , and towards labor market reforms and deficit reduction .
Only then , the chairman wrote , could the country embark on true economic recovery .
" Until we are sure job creation has begun in earnest , we should put aside our differences on health care , " Steele said .
" We should watch our spending .
We 've got an economy to rebuild and restore . "
A long hot summer could suck Wellington dry as unexpected population growth strains the region 's water supply .
Greater Wellington regional council 's long - term plan says the council must be able to withstand a one - in - 50 - year drought .
But it failed to hit that target in the past financial year , managing only a one - in - 26 - year standard , prompting alerts to residents to start conserving water now to avoid restrictions later .
Marketing analysis manager Andrew Samuel said the standard was worked out from projected population growth and water usage against climate records , but in recent years , Wellington 's population growth had continually exceeded projected levels .
Growth modelling done by the council in 2000 indicated the population of the region 's four cities would not reach 377,000 till 2020 .
By June this year the estimated population was 389,700 .
Because the region 's water came from rivers and an aquifer , supplies would be severely stretched if there was a lack of rain , Mr Samuel said .
" It really starts to put extra pressure on the system . "
That would mean cracking down on water use .
For most of the year the region used about 150 million litres of water a day , but that leapt to 200 million litres during peak days in summer .
The easiest way to avoid restrictions was to start conserving water now , he said .
" It 's the difference between a soft landing and a hard landing . "
The council had started a programme of identifying and fixing leaks , but chairwoman Fran Wilde said it was up to residents to take responsibility .
" People can actually use less water voluntarily ...
It saves the ratepayers having to build a big dam straight away . "
Wellington City Council infrastructure manager Maria Archer said getting into good habits would delay the need for water meters .
" If nothing changes , we 'll have to start thinking about it quite seriously in four or five years . "
Get Conserving :
Target watering – only water gardens in the morning and evenings , and aim the water at the roots .
Be a sensible flusher – where appropriate , use the half - flush option .
If your toilet does not have one , fill a litre bottle with sand , and place it in the cistern to reduce the amount of water used in each flush .
Nozzle your hose – this stops unnecessary spraying even if you leave the tap on .
A hose uses 150 litres every five minutes .
Quicker cleans – showers and clothes washing are the biggest water wasters .
Take shorter showers , and wash only full loads of clothes .
The same goes for dishwashers .
Stop leaks – check for leaks and fix them promptly .
You could potentially save up to 5000 litres a month .
Turn the tap off – when brushing your teeth you use five litres .

Harman 's equality law ' will hurt white male jobseekers '
Backing : Harriet Harman has pushed the equality bill through the Common
White job applicants could be overlooked because of the colour of their skin under proposed equality laws , the Tories warned yesterday .
They said unclear wording in Harriet Harman 's Equality Bill could lead employers to start discriminating in favour of minority candidates - rather than hiring on merit .
Men could also lose out if the legislation goes unchanged , Conservative business spokesman John Penrose told the Commons .
The Bill will make it legal for employers to choose a black or female candidate above a white man , as long as they have the same qualifications .
It is designed to thrust more women and minority applicants into senior posts .
But business leaders say the equality minister 's Bill risks introducing positive discrimination - and would mean jobseekers are hired ' because of who they are , rather than what they can do ' .
Mr Penrose told the Commons yesterday that the wording of the Bill - ' as qualified as ' - should be rephrased to ' equally qualified ' .
He argued that the words ' as qualified ' would mean that a black or female candidate could be discriminated in favour of .
During report stage debate on the Bill , he said : ' We are worried that it might mean that you might have two candidates who are both adequately qualified - they clear a certain threshold required for that particular role . '
But , he added , the better candidate may not be given the job because the employer ' will be perfectly within their rights ' to favour a less well qualified applicant who has passed the threshold and is from an ethnic minority .
' And that seems to us to breach this important distinction between positive action - giving people a hand in preparation - and positive discrimination which is allowing the decision on who is offered the job to be made on any other grounds other than strictly and purely merit , ' he said .

There are a number of reasons why a person might want to jailbreak their iPhone .
This list includes data tethering , using it on another carrier and running unauthorized apps .
Of course if you are n’t careful , you could leave your device vulnerable to a rather simple attack .
Recently a number of people discovered a rather troubling message on their jailbroken phones , informing them that they had indeed been hacked .
The message , seen to the right , was left on a number of people ’s phones with a link to the hacker ’s website .
Originally the hacker was asking for € 5 in exchange for a fix , though he has now simply posted the fix on his site .
So how did he pull it off ?
It ’s simple really .
He used port scanning on the T - Mobile network ( in the Netherlands ) to find iPhones running SSH .
This is something generally necessary when jailbreaking an iPhone .
Armed with the knowledge that many people do n’t bother changing the default password , he was able to gain access to a number of phones .
He then changed the wallpaper to make it look as though there was an SMS alert being displayed .
It ’s good that the hacker changed his tune and made the fix available for free .
It does bring up a very , very valuable point .
Regardless of what we ’re talking about , be it desktop , phone or server ; change the root password !

This is just weird .
Not only can the Canadian government not account for more than 15 million dollars worth of gold bars that were supposed to be sitting in their version of Fort Knox but after weeks of investigation they still are n’t sure if they were robbed .
At least that ’s what they ’re claiming :
OTTAWA â€ ”
The distinct possibility that precious metals may have been stolen from the Royal Canadian Mint is “ inexcusable , ” the federal minister responsible for the Crown corporation said Monday .
The findings of a long - awaited external audit , released earlier in the day , concluded that $ 15.3 million in missing gold is not the result of accounting or bookkeeping errors , raising even more questions about the whereabouts of the metals from what has been touted as one of the most secure facilities in Canada .
“ The mint ’s still unexplained loss of precious metals is inexcusable , ” Transport Minister John Baird and Minister of State for Transport Rob Merrifield , whose department is responsible for the mint , said in a joint release .
“ The mint will be held accountable . ”
The Royal Canadian Mint says the precious metals seem to have vanished from its inventory in the 2008 fiscal year , according to the third - party review conducted by Deloitte & Touche LLP .
External auditors have been working since early March to determine whether theft or an accounting error is behind an “ unreconciled difference ” between the mint ’s 2008 financial records and its physical stockpile of gold and other precious metals at its downtown Ottawa headquarters .
The report released Monday concluded that “ the unaccounted - for difference in gold does not appear to relate to an accounting error in the reconciliation process , an accounting error in the physical stock count schedules , or an accounting error in the record - keeping of transactions during the year . ”
It is not clear at this stage whether any gold is physically missing from the inventory , the corporation said in a release .
“ All possible explanations for the inventory difference need to be investigated . ”
The Mint is claiming that the missing amount is a small portion of their total “ stock ” but the Mint ’s total stock , as I understand it , includes non -gold precious metals ( some of which are also missing ! ) and gold certificates .
That means that A ) the missing stock should have been noticed rather quickly and B ) this loss may not be so nominal if it turns out Canada has more precious metal commodity contracts than gold on hand .
Either way this is a heist of historic proportions , even if it turns out not to have been a heist in the traditional sense .
Countries , like investors , have been buying up gold to weather the recession and like many investors countries have been accepting paper in lieu of physical gold .
Of course there is much more paper representing gold out there than actual gold ( which is why there ’s a market for your crap necklaces – they need those scraps to honor their commitments ) so a big chunk of a country ’s gold horde that ’s gone missing may not be easily replaced even if Canada had the cash to do so .

Astronomers announced today the discovery of at least four -- and as many as six -- planets orbiting two nearby stars .
These planets are relatively low mass , ranging from 5 to 25 times the mass of the Earth .
For comparison , Jupiter is over 300 times more massive than the Earth , and Uranus 15 times our mass .
Three of these extrasolar planets orbit the nearby star 61 Virginis , which is only about 28 light years away ( that 's a stone 's throw in galactic terms ) .
61 Vir has been a target for planet hunters for some time because it 's very much like our Sun : while it has slightly less mass and is a tad less bright , its temperature is almost the exactly the same as the Sun's .
It 's about 6 billion years old , 1.5 billion years older than the Sun .
It 's bright ( easily visible to the unaided eye from a dark site ) , making it easy to study .
It also has a very similar chemical composition as the Sun , which may be important in the planet - making business .
And now we know it has planets !
Little ones , too .
Here is a schematic of the system :
Inner planets in our solar system are shown with dotted lines , and the three 61 Vir planets as solid lines .
As you can see , they all orbit closer than Earth does to the Sun , and the third one out has a fairly elliptical orbit .
In order from their star , the planets have masses of approximately , 5 , 18 , and 24 times the Earth 's mass ( they may be somewhat more depending on our viewing geometry , which is difficult to determine ) .
They orbit 61 Vir in 4 , 38 , and 124 days respectively .
While all of these are far more massive than the Earth , they represent big steps forward in finding more Earthlike planets , since they are in fact low mass compared to other planets found , and the outer one takes longer to orbit than usual as well .
Interestingly , recent Spitzer Space Telescope observations indicate a fairly hefty ring of dust around 61 Vir as well , at a distance of about twice the distance of Neptune from the Sun .
This probably comes from collisions of comets and asteroids , meaning that this system 300 trillion kilometers away really does look a lot like our own solar system .
On top of that , another sunlike star , HD 1461 , was found to have at least one planet orbiting it .
The planet has about 7.5 times the Earth 's mass , and orbits close in , taking six days to circle the star once .
There may be two other planets orbiting this star as well , but the signals from them are just a bit too weak to be sure .
All of these planets were found by analyzing the stars ' light and looking for a periodic Doppler shift .
As a planet orbits its star , it in turn pulls the star around very slightly , and that can be seen as a teeny shift in the wavelength of the starlight .
And by teeny , I mean really teeny ; it 's only been the past 15 or so years that this method has been refined enough to yield results .
So this is very cool , and brings us another step closer to what we all really want to find : a terrestrial planet orbiting a star in an Earthlike orbit .
That does n't guarantee life -- heck , it does n't even guarantee the planet will look anything like Earth at all ( just take a peek at Venus and Mars to confirm that ) , but this new discovery does mean that lower - mass planets are abundant in the galaxy .
And that 's very cool news indeed .

The story of this little kitty ’s adoption began in Lakewood but spanned the world , virtually speaking , before she found a home just a few miles away , via Reddit.com , a social news aggregator .
It began with Sandra Lawrence .
She is a Redditor , as Reddit ’s regular contributors and readers identify themselves .
Checking the news on Reddit is one of the first things she does every morning .
“ I pretty much ask Reddit whenever I have a problem , ” said Lawrence .
Last month , her problem was an abandoned kitten rejected by a no-kill shelter .
“ In this neighborhood , people want kittens for dogfighting bait and snake food , so I took her in , temporarily , but I could n’t keep her , so I thought I ’d ask Reddit , ” Lawrence said .
Using her alias Saydrah , Lawrence put up a post on Reddit .
It read , in part , “ Anyone want a sweet tabby kitty who says , “ Om Nom Nom ” when she eats ? ”
That phrase was a bit of calculated catnip for Redditors .
“ Om Nom Nom ” — slang for enthusiastic dining — is a hot Internet meme ( a bit of pop culture propagated via e-mail , word of mouth and links ) derived from Lolcats , another wildly popular Internet meme featuring digital images of cats , with quirky captions .
Fifty Redditors responded in less than an hour .
They included a wag who , referencing “ The Incredible Journey , ” suggested releasing the kitten into the wild .
There , the Redditor wrote , “ It will team up with a wise old golden retriever and a young naive bulldog .
Together , they will brave the wilds of the Rockies , fighting for their lives while learning important life lessons for the whole family . ”
More than 170 comments , including other offers to take the cat and remarks from people in Europe , went up within the next 12 hours .
One of them was from Ben Jones , a Metro State student and devout Redditor .
( He also logs onto the site as soon as he gets up . )
Jones , who lives in a studio apartment near downtown Denver , already was thinking about getting a pet .
With his compact home and taut schedule — stretched between his job at Telax and his classes at Metro State — he needed a low - maintenance animal .
The “ very sweet little brown tabby ” described in the Reddit post sounded perfect .
The Om Nom Nom part did n’t hurt .
“ I claim this kitten , ” Jones wrote in the Comments section , about an hour after Lawrence posted her appeal .
The deal was done on the Saturday after Thanksgiving , when Lawrence interviewed Jones and checked out his spare apartment .
She approved of the nerdy posters on its walls and his stash of programming books .
Jones named the cat “ Kaylee . ”
She likes to nap on his computer chair .
“ She found a home on Reddit , and we delivered her on Caterday , ” Lawrence said .
“ She ’s a Web 2.0 cat . ” Claire Martin , The Denver Post
Interesting .
So Dodd 's proposal would effectively remove Sheila Bair 's role as one of the few senior administration officials advocating for consumers .
( We already know bankers do n't like her . )
Still , it sounds like a few good ideas here , I 'll wait to see how this shakes out .
Nov. 10 ( Bloomberg ) -- Senator Christopher Dodd will propose creating a single U.S. regulator that would strip the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. of bank - supervision authority , said a person familiar with the matter .
Dodd , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , would eliminate the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision and fold the Treasury Department units into the new bank regulator , according to the person , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plan is n’t public .
The Connecticut Democrat is scheduled to release a draft of his financial - regulation overhaul plan today in Washington .
“ It makes sense to have one regulator that deals with supervision , ” Gilbert Schwartz , a former Fed attorney and a partner at Washington law firm Schwartz & Ballen LLP , said in an interview .
“ You ’ll see a real battle by the Fed and the FDIC to retain their supervisory authority . ”
Dodd has faulted the U.S. bank regulation system , saying it encourages charter shopping and a “ race to the bottom ” by agencies to win oversight roles .
His proposal goes further than proposals by President Barack Obama and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank to merge the OTS and OCC .
[...]
Dodd will also propose creating a Consumer Financial Protection Agency , a council of regulators to monitor large firms for disruptive effects on the industry and the economy , and giving the FDIC power to unwind failed firms whose collapse in bankruptcy could shake the economy , the person said .
The waste produced by Arab cities is among the highest in the world .
Dubai , United Arab Emirates – “ The short version of the story is that we ’re not doing a very good job of managing waste , ” says John Roosen , Technical Director of AECOM Environment Middle East .
“ Nowhere in the world does .
We are going to drown in waste . ”
Roosen ’s words hardly overstate the scale of the problem faced by the engineers , scientists and government officials gathered this month at the first annual IQPC City Waste forum in Dubai .
According to a recent report by the Arab Foundation for Environment and Development ( AFED ) , the Arab world produces approximately 250,000 tons of solid waste every day , most of it dumped untreated in makeshift landfills , if it is collected at all .
Skyrocketing income levels in areas such as the UAE have resulted in increased consumer spending which has had a direct effect on waste levels .
To drive home the point , Roosen pulled out his briefcase , which he found in a Dubai dumpster unsoiled , in the original packaging and with the tags still attached .
The per capita production of solid waste in Arab cities such as Kuwait , Riyadh , and Abu Dhabi is over 1.5 kg per day , placing them among the highest waste producers in the world .
In urban areas , waste management is particularly pressing .
Over the last few generations the Arab world has seen a rapid increase in its urban population , with some countries , such as Kuwait and Qatar ’s population being urbanized at over 90 % .
Governments in those regions are struggling to keep apace with population growth .
Consumer waste , however , is not the only , or even the main , culprit .
“ Construction waste is hugely dominant .
It ’s the main component of waste in the region , ” said John Wigham , CEO of Cracknell , a sustainable landscaping firm .
At the height of the building boom , 2500 trucks a day made their way to Dubai ’s landfills loaded with waste from building sites .
Among the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) , 55 % of waste is estimated to come from construction and demolition .
Less than 5 % recycled
Across the region overall , less than 20 % of solid waste is properly treated , and less than 5 % is recycled .
Most waste ends up in landfills , most of them poorly managed and doomed to pollute their surroundings for years to come .
Glenn Platt , a Senior Project Manager for KEO International Consultants , cautioned that poorly ‘ capped off ’ landfills can produce , among other dangers , toxins that leach into groundwater and nearby lakes and streams , ‘ virtually unstoppable ’ fires , vermin , and injury from buried objects protruding from the land .
According to Platt , planning for landfill sites should incorporate the capping off strategy and include the costs for the monitoring of the site for 30 years after it closes .
There is a cheaper option though , which is gaining currency in the Middle East .
“ For thousands of years , people have been composting material , and now there is tremendous opportunity for using that material , ” said John Roosen .
The agricultural domain would particularly benefit , since the region ’s sandy soils often lack the requisite level of organic material for optimal plant growth .
Counting on the economics of composting
Sayed Ali Shah , Head of the Compost Plant for Sharjah Municipality , said that the economics of composting were straightforward for the Emirate , since “ every ton of waste we divert is accounted for .
We save on the disposal side and we save on the compost itself …we produce compost almost free , and our main customer is the municipality . ”
In most cases , governments are forming strategic partnerships with the private sector .
In some areas , waste management is the province of specific segments of society .
For instance , for over 50 years the streets of Cairo have been cleaned by a majority Christian caste of self - appointed waste collectors called the Zabaleen , who recycle solid waste and use the organic waste to feed their herds of swine .
According to The National Newspaper , there is now a major backlog of waste since the Egyptian government undertook a major swine cull this summer .
Foreign companies hired by the government have not been able to do the job as effectively .
In affluent regions , the government has stepped in with lucrative tenders .
Sharjah has signed an agreement for a 25 million cubic meter recycling plant called Al Saja’ah , which will turn an existing landfill into a waste management solution , while Qatar has awarded two multi-billion waste contracts to international firms .
Most specialists agree that looking at waste as an income generator is the key to combating the problem .
“ We must make changes to encourage businesses to sort waste … perhaps waste handlers could be encouraged to sort waste as a financial bonus , ” John Wigham said .
“ If you can find ways of keeping the profit motive in the process , the private sector will stay involved . ”
Start with sorting and collecting
The initial sorting and collecting is key to the success of any recycling program , he maintained , since it is the most labor intensive stage of the recycling process and also the most crucial .
A success story in this regard is Dubai ’s small - scale paper recycling industry , which allows entrepreneurs to collect paper waste , package it , and sell it to a larger company for recycling .
Wigham pointed to plastic as another kind of waste that could be processed using this model .
The plastic sheeting used to coat the half - constructed glass towers dotted around Dubai ’s landscape is worth AED800 a ton , but , he asked , “ how do we get the relatively small values back to the guy who would actually peel the waste plastic off the building and put it somewhere ? ”
Numerous businesses have sprung up in the Emirates to make innovative use of the massive quantities of plastic that would otherwise fill landfills around the country , particularly the ubiquitous plastic water bottles .
A company called EcoWood uses them to make a wood - like material that is durable , weather proof and can be used and worked exactly like wood .
Getting hold of the raw material is an issue however .
Plastic water bottle recycling is labor intensive : the cap , the ring around the neck , and the label all need to be separated from the bottle itself .
Recyclers rely on private sector collectors and environmental NGOs like the Emirates Environment Group to fill the gap .
Many municipalities have embraced bus - stop recycling bins in a bid to encourage the population to dispose of waste responsibly .
However , specialists like Wigham and Roosen say that curbside recycling bins are not a panacea .
Recycling bins often confuse users if they are not adequately labeled , and they require a great deal of regular collection and transport for what amounts to a small haul .
Looking for public action in Arab world
Clearly , the issue will require public action , which will in turn require that consumers in the Arab world pay attention to an area of life that receives little attention .
Most of the specialists at the conference concurred that consumers in the Arab world were still not motivated to take action .
“ Environmental issues in general and waste management in particular are recent issues on the Arab World ’s agenda , ” said Dr. Mohammed Aboelenein , Chairman of the Department of Sociology at UAE University .
“ Currently , there are n’t clear environmental policies in most Arab countries … perhaps some Arab governments think that environmental issues are trivial compared to severe economic conditions and the economic problems they face . ”
The recently announced mega projects announced by governments around the Gulf are heartening , but in the end the race against waste will rely on individual consumers moving toward ‘ zero waste ’ solutions .
Dr. Aboelenein advocates a three - pronged approach combining education from the grade - school level , awareness - raising campaigns in major media , and the profit motive , where consumers would be given cash incentives to sort or recycle their trash .
“ Attitudes are not easy to change .
It took years for the US to alter people ’s attitudes towards waste .
The Arab governments should study –and maybe copy - successful models around the world . ”

Do n’t Settle with the Insurance Company Too Early
It is vital that you speak to a lawyer before discussing your case with the other party ’s insurance company .
Their only goal is to settle your claim as quickly as possible , and for as little money as they can manage .
Without a car accident attorney by your side , it can be hard to tell just how much money you are entitled to for your injuries and losses .
For this reason , we ask you to get in touch with the team at The McClellan Law Firm as soon as you have been injured .
We can negotiate with the insurance company on your behalf to ensure you get the money you deserve .
If the insurance company is unwilling to offer a reasonable settlement , we will not hesitate to take your case to trial .
Having recovered tens of millions of dollars for our clients , our attorneys know how to navigate a difficult case .
Do n’t settle for less than what you deserve .
Fight for the Compensation You Deserve
Recovering after an accident is challenging in many ways .
Among the physical challenges , there can also be significant financial issues .
Current medical costs , future rehabilitation costs , car repairs and income loss from days out of the office — it all adds up .
How can you ensure your family has the money it needs during this time of recovery ?
Through a lawsuit , you may be able to recover compensation for more than just your car damage .
You may be entitled to financial compensation for the following :
Economic Damages / Special Damages
Economic damages are tangible losses that can be calculated .
They include :
Medical bills : Including past , current , and future medical expenses .
Including past , current , and future medical expenses .
Lost wages :
You may be able to recover compensation for the income you lost during your recovery and / or will lose as a result of being unable to return to the same job .
Non-Economic Damages / General Damages
Non-economic damages are damages that cannot be calculated , but compensate the victim for very real losses , including :
Pain and suffering
Reduction in quality of life / loss of enjoyment of life
Loss of sexual relations / loss of consortium
Punitive Damages
In some cases , you may be able to recover punitive damages , which exist to punish a driver for his or her negligence .
Unlike other forms of compensation , punitive damages exist to punish the defendant rather than compensate for the victim 's loss .
It is common to recover punitive damages in a drunk driving accident case , for example .
Working with a law firm that understands the best ways to navigate a car accident lawsuit will put you in the best position to secure the maximum compensation possible .
At The McClellan Law Firm , we have experience handling all types of cases .
Frequently Asked Questions
What should I do if the insurance company calls me ?
You should never speak directly with an agent from the other driver ’s insurance company .
If they call you , politely decline from discussing the claim and direct them to speak with your insurance company or attorney .
The other party ’s insurance company can use anything you say over the phone against you later to reduce the amount of damages you are owed .
What if the other driver is uninsured ?
It is unfortunately very common in California to run across drivers that do n’t have insurance on themselves or their vehicles .
If the driver who hit you is uninsured , there are still other avenues our firm can investigate in order to recover the compensation you deserve .
Speak with our firm today to see how we can help you !
How do I find out the value of my claim ?
The value of a car accident claim is determined by a number of different factors , such as your policy limit and that of the other driver , the severity of your injuries , and damage to your vehicle .
An experienced attorney from our firm can review your case during a free consultation and pursue the maximum compensation you are eligible to recover .
How long do I have to file a car accident claim in San Diego ?
The California statute of limitations for personal injury lawsuits is two years from the date the injury occurred .
If the statute of limitations expires it may not be possible for you to file a lawsuit at all .
Not every car accident claim necessitates the filing of a civil lawsuit , but since the time frame is only two years it ’s critical that you speak with an attorney as soon as possible to prevent you from missing on the compensation you deserve .
Can I still recover compensation if I share fault for the accident ?
Not every accident is straightforward .
Sometimes the other driver ’s insurance company will claim that you were partially at fault for the accident in order to avoid paying a larger settlement .
Our experienced car accident lawyers in San Diego can fully investigate your accident to discover who was really at fault .
Even if you do share some blame for the circumstances that caused the accident , California comparative negligence laws still allow you to recover the damages you are owed .
In a personal injury lawsuit , the court will determine what percentage of the fault you are liable for , and then deduct that amount from the total compensation .
Our San Diego car accident attorneys are experienced in dealing with insurance companies , so you can know that the at - fault party 's insurance company , and even your own insurance company , will not take advantage of you .
Property Owners Affected by Car Accidents
Car accidents do not only affect motorists and their passengers .
Property owners , including homeowners and business owners , may be at risk of suffering serious injuries or damage to their homes or offices if vehicles veer off the road into their properties .
Local residents and business owners who are struck by motorists or whose property is damaged in car accidents may be able to seek financial compensation for their injuries and losses .
The McClellan Law Firm is available to help with these specific cases .
If this has happened to you , our San Diego car accident lawyers can talk to you about the incident and work to identify at - fault parties to help you seek justice .
Depending on the case , it may be the driver of the vehicle or another party who is responsible .
If a vehicle part was defective , an auto manufacturer may be liable .
If a defective roadway or traffic sign was to blame , the county or city government responsible for the roadway may be held accountable .
We thoroughly investigate every case we take on .

Two alleged mercenaries from Europe are facing the death penalty in the Democratic Republic of Congo after being accused of murder and spying .
Looking pale behind unkempt beards , Joshua French , 27 , and Tjostolv Moland , 28 , both from Norway , were charged with murder , attempted murder , espionage , conspiracy and armed robbery after their driver was found dead with a gunshot wound to his head in May this year .
" May it please the garrison military court to say that the accusations against Tjostolv Moland and Joshua [ French ] are established and to sentence them ... to the death penalty , " the prosecutor , Major Jean Blaise Bwa Mulundu , told the court last week , according to Reuters .
Norway has strongly expressed concerns that the men are not receiving a fair trial .
French himself said : " I do n't think any recognised nation would accept this trial in any way or accept any of the evidence . "
A murky chain of events led the two men to the grim military courtoom of Kisangani in the lawless east of Congo .
French and Moland were reportedly in the country to set up their own security company .
The website Private Military Herald , which monitors the private security industry , claimed that Norwegian military ID cards , counterfeit UN hats and employee ID badges with both correct and false names were found by police at an apartment shared by the two men in Uganda .
The employee badges were believed to use the logo of a Norwegian security company , Special Interventions Group ( SIG ) , on false pretences .
A source at SIG said : " We were supposed to have a partnership with these guys a year ago but it did n't happen .
They decided to try it for themselves and start their own company .
Unfortunately they chose our name and used our ID cards . "
The source added : " We do n't believe for a second these guys killed anyone .
They 're just kids who went abroad , tried to think big and set up a company .
I do n't have a bad word to say about them .
They loved Africa and they did not want to be mercenaries . "
French and Moland had previously served in Norway 's armed forces .
Norwegian diplomats say there has been no contact between the accused and their country 's military or any other official organisation since 2007 .
It is not clear what the two accused were doing in the area .
Former soldiers are frequently taken on by private security companies who have stepped up interest in the region due to oil discoveries under Lake Albert , which lies on the border between Congo and Uganda .
French and Moland have said that 47 - year - old driver Abedi Kasongo was shot and killed when their car was attacked by gunmen on the road , 60 miles east of the town of Kisangani .
The men were travelling in Congo 's north - eastern Orientale province , which is still unstable and plagued by armed groups six years after the country 's war officially ended .
But the region is starting to attract investors after the discovery of billions of barrels of oil on the Ugandan side of the border by London - listed Tullow Oil and Heritage Oil .
The prosecution demanded last week that Norway pay Congo $ 500bn in damages over the incident .
Mulundu requested the death penalty for each of the five charges against the two defendants .
The verdict is expected to be handed down by the military court this week .
While researchers have struggled for half a century to push down the cost of solar photovoltaic modules , an innovative web service is creating communities of customers who pay less for solar panels through collective bargaining with installers .
One Block
Off the Grid collects groups of would - be solar purchasers in cities with good solar access and brokers a deal between them and a local installer .
It 's internet - based environmental organizing , and it appears to be working .
In a campaign running in San Diego , their customers will pay just $ 5.29 per watt of power capacity .
Even after paying for an inverter to convert the DC power the panels generate into the AC power appliances use , the total One Block Off the Grid price is substantially lower than the San Diego County average .
According to California Energy Commission statistics , the average total cost of a solar photovoltaic system is almost $ 8 per watt .
Now , they are launching a new tool that will provide instantaneous solar price estimates , the first online tool to do so .
The new interface went live Sunday .
" The power of the internet has not been harnessed by the solar industry , " said Brad Burton , who heads up products and strategy at 1BOG .
" The components of viral growth and immediate person - to - person contact have n't been explored at all . "
The Bay Area company Sungevity provides cost information via an online form , but they are ultimately parsed by a human being , so the quotes are not real - time .
Sungevity 's solar price estimator does allow for a lot more system customization , while One Block Off the Grid 's setup is clearly designed for accessibility .
Nonetheless , some questions in 1BOG 's tool require some knowledge about your house , such as the material out of which your roof is made .
The ease of either system , though , is impressive relative to earlier methods of getting solar panels .
Usually , getting a quote required that a contractor come to your house .
Not only was that a hassle for homeowners , but it cost the solar installers money , too .
Many people asked about solar but few ended up installing it .
One Block Off the Grid participants are different , said Scott Gordon , whose company Helio Power worked with the company on the San Diego project .
" The leads from One Block Off the Grid are probably twice as good , " Gordon said .
" They have twice the close rate from the sales perspective of the leads you get from anywhere else . "
1BOG 's Burton claimed some of their installers are closing 25 percent of the leads that emanate from their company .
" We do eliminate a lot of their marketing costs and cost of acquisition and the other thing that we 're able to do is verify the quality of the deal as an independent objective third party , " he said .
The arrangement , all facilitated by the internet , helps squeeze some of the soft and difficult - to - quantify costs that help make distributed solar power more expensive than centralized fossil fuel - based electricity .
There are two big components to the cost of installing solar panels on a house .
The one technologists talk about is the solar module itself , the hardware .
Researchers can push that cost down by increasing the efficiency of the cells or using less or cheaper materials .
Early solar cells were something like $ 200 a watt , not including installation costs .
Now , the average solar module costs $ 4.34 per watt , according to SolarBuzz , a tracking service .
But all the other stuff that goes into putting that module at your house costs money , too .
Solar people call this the " balance - of - system " cost and that 's where One Block Off the Grid is making an impact .
By creating volume for solar installers and doing some of the sales and marketing work , they can get those installers to offer lower prices to their customers .
The net result is cheaper solar power , even if the technology does n't shift at all .
" These costs do vary so it 's hard to say how real the cost savings might be , but their story is credible , " said Chris Marnay , who researches distributed energy systems at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , in an e-mail to Wired.com .
Still , there 's a ways to go .
Analysts estimate that to be as cheap as electricity coming out of the socket and produced by fossil fuels , the total installed cost of a photovoltaic system would have to be $ 3.50 per watt .
To get there , the solar industry will have to change .
Much like home building before the 1950s , solar installations are put in one by one .
The personalized service might be nice , but it 's a costly way of doing business .
After the war , major home building companies , like the iconic Levitt and Sons , rose to prominence .
They standardized parts , equipment , procedures and marketing .
It led to a lot of homes that looked the same , but were cheaper than anything that had been available before .
Larger solar companies doing many , many installations would presumably benefit from similar economies of scale and push the total cost down .
Marnay said solar installing has been a cottage industry with many installers doing small amounts of business , but he expected that to change as solar installations grow .
Still , One Block
Off the Grid is n't big enough yet to change the economics for a whole region or state .
It has only facilitated about 500 solar installations since they were founded in summer of 2008 , though the company plans to " really , really scale up our operation , " Gordon said .
And that could be wise , too , because unlike most internet startups , One Block Off the Grid is already profitable .

Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama on Saturday praised US President Barack Obama for taking up the issue of Tibet “ very seriously ” with Chinese leaders on his recent trip to China .
During a meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao last Tuesday , Obama discussed the thorny issue of Tibet and urged early resumption of talks between China and representatives of the Dalai Lama over the region ’s future .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ He , actually publicly as well as behind the scenes , has really taken up the issue of Tibet with Chinese leaders very seriously , ” the Dalai Lama told reporters in the Indian capital .
The Dalai Lama has been living in India since he fled Tibet following a failed uprising in 1959 against Chinese rule .
In Beijing on Tuesday , Obama said the United States recognised Tibet as part of China .
But Obama added Washington “ supports the early resumption of dialogue ” between the Dalai Lama ’s envoys over Tibet where violent protests erupted last year against Chinese rule .
The Dalai Lama ’s office said after Obama ’s comments that the Tibetan leader was ready for the resumption of discussions with China .
ADVERTISEMENT
China in March said it was open to fresh talks over Tibet with the Dalai Lama .
But it repeated demands for the spiritual leader to renounce “ separatist ” activities .
The spiritual leader has consistently denied claims by China he is seeking independence for Tibet , saying he is only seeking “ meaningful autonomy . ”
China has stepped up pressure on world leaders , including Obama , not to meet the Dalai Lama .

Obama came under fire from critics who accused him of caving in to Chinese pressure for not meeting the Buddhist leader when he visited Washington in early October .
But officials said the two leaders were likely to meet after Obama ’s trip to China though no date has been set .
Never a pleasant statistic , the American Bankruptcy Institute today released the numbers for American bankruptcies that occurred in October .
Bankruptcies are on the rise , despite previous legislation that made it harder to file :
ABI ( via Reuters ) :
The 135,913 consumer bankruptcy filings in October represented a 27.9 percent increase over last October ’s monthly total of 106,266 , according to the American Bankruptcy Institute ( ABI ) , relying on data from the National Bankruptcy Research Center ( NBKRC ) .
The October 2009 consumer filings represented an 8.9 percent increase from the September 2009 total of 124,790 .
Chapter 13 filings constituted 28.5 percent of all consumer cases in October , a slight increase from the September rate .
“ The nearly 9 percent increase in consumer bankruptcy filings in October , together with a 7 percent jump reported in business cases , demonstrates the sustained stress on the U.S. economy , ” said ABI Executive Director Samuel J. Gerdano .
ABI forecasts that total bankruptcies this year will exceed 1.4 million , the highest number since 2005 .

Forget the Thick of It .
The truth of what goes on in Westminster is always better than fiction .
Cows were to be sacrificed on the altars of environmentalism and fitness
Let me tell you the story of a classic Whitehall farce , a tale of how the government came within a whisker of advocating bovine genocide .
It all began when officials at the Department of Health decided to part - fund a piece of independent research looking at how health professionals could help combat the effects of climate change .
The scientists came up with a rather courageous idea .
Why not kill 30 % of Britain 's cows and sheep ?
Not only would this help save the environment ; it would also make us healthier .
The theory goes like this : if you have less ruminant livestock , you emit less climate - damaging methane into the atmosphere .
You also have less meat to eat , which means less saturated fat in our diets and thus less heart disease .
Policy on the hoof ?
Officials liked the wheeze so much they decided Health Secretary Andy Burnham should give a speech at the launch of the report by the Lancet medical journal .
There Mr Burnham congratulated the Lancet on its " timely report " .
The Department of Health put out a handy press release summarising the report 's conclusions .
It even rang up the Department of Energy and Climate Change and got it involved .
A useful quote from Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband was included on the press release .
Andy Burnham was forced to assert his carnivorous credentials
Not to be outdone , a quote from international development minister Mike Foster was produced .
All agreed that health and climate change could be two sides of the same coin .
There was only one problem : no one had bothered to tell the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) and , as its name suggests , it is in charge of cows .
Defra officials gently pointed out that perhaps the " kill - a- cow , save - the - world " policy might have a few flaws .
First , the farming community would be a tad unhappy .
And sure enough the National Farmers ' Union was apoplectic , raging at the " ill - informed and simplistic report " , condemning ministers for their " poor judgement " .
Second , cutting livestock in this country will not mean people eat less meat .
We will just import more from places like Brazil and Argentina , who will cut down more rainforest to satisfy this lucrative extra demand from Europe .
Third , how exactly was the government going to go about culling 30 % of Britain 's ruminant livestock ?
Not surprisingly the media began asking questions .
Was Andy Burnham really advocating killing cows ?
For the Conservatives , shadow environment secretary Nick Herbert said that " careless demands like this do n't just undermine farming , they erode public support for action on climate change " .
Moo-ving on
As the penny slowly dropped , the screech of brakes could heard across Whitehall .
The Department of Health press office rang to make clear that Mr Burnham was not endorsing the Lancet report .
Nothing he had said could be read as endorsing it .
It was not government policy to cut Britain 's livestock .
Other officials rang to emphasise that Mr Burnham was a meat - eater and not a vegetarian .
Perhaps , it was suggested , the press office had mistakenly elided the two events .
The climate change department rang to make the same points .
In the meantime , Defra acted to calm worried farmers .
A senior official sent out an email telling them not to worry about the Lancet report : " This , as we know , rather over - simplifies a complex issue and I do n't think that Andy Burnham has actually said anything that supports the headline that govt supports a 30 % reduction in farm animals . "
So , at the end of the day , there was no story .
The government did not take on the farmers .
Another report gathered dust on Whitehall 's shelves .
No cows died on the altar of climate change .
What we learned , though , is that the left hand of this government does not always know what the right hand is doing .
And , when it comes to turf wars , Defra can occasionally punch its weight .

When you use anti-bacterial soap , there ’s a good chance there ’s an ingredient called triclosan in it .
It ’s also added to things like body washes , some toothpastes , and dishwashing soap .
You can find it listed as an ingredient on the label for many of those products .
But the Food and Drug Administration says there ’s no evidence that using soap with triclosan in your home or office is any better at keeping you from getting sick than regular soap and water .
( Health experts say a good rule of thumb is to wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds : the length of time it takes to sing the “ happy birthday ” song twice . )
The FDA says triclosan is not known to be hazardous to humans .
But the agency is re-evaluating the safety of triclosan in light of animal studies showing the chemical alters hormone regulation … and also because of studies suggesting that triclosan contributes to making bacteria resistant to antibiotics .
A new study in the journal Environmental Science and Technology finds triclosan is showing up in freshwater lakes , including Lake Superior .
Bill Arnold is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Minnesota and an author of the study , and he joins me now .
Professor Arnold , you and your team took core samples from the sediment of eight lakes of different sizes in Minnesota .
What ’d you find ?
Arnold : “ We found that in all the lakes there ’s triclosan in the sediment , and in general , the concentration increased from when triclosan was invented in 1964 to present day .
And we also found there are seven other compounds that are derivatives or degradation products of triclosan that are also in the sediment and also increasing in concentration with time . ”
RW : How are these compounds getting into the lakes ?
Arnold : “ So triclosan goes through the wastewater treatment system , and the wastewater treatment plant actually does a pretty darn good job of removing it .
90 to 95 percent of it is taken out , but we use so much triclosan that the rest of it gets through , and three of the compounds we found are chlorinated triclosan derivatives , and they ’re formed in the last step of wastewater treatment , when the wastewater is disinfected before it ’s discharged and the disinfectant is chlorine .
So that creates these three new compounds .
And then triclosan and these three new compounds , when they ’re exposed to sunlight , each of them undergoes a reaction that forms a dioxin , so that ’s where the other four compounds come from .
RW : Are these at levels that could be of concern ?
Arnold :
“ The triclosan appears to be approaching levels that could be of concern , because it ’s known to be toxic to algae .
So – we did n’t look at the levels in the water , but in the sediment , but in some cases they ’re rather high in the sediment .
For the other compounds we ’re not sure , because the toxicity of them really has n’t been studied .
RW : The trade group for the cleaning products industry continues to maintain the safety of triclosan .
But at the same time … both the FDA and the Environmental Protection Agency are re-evaluating the effects of triclosan on human health and the environment … at this point , from your perspective , what ’s the bottom line here for consumers ?
Arnold : “ I think this is a case where consumers can certainly put pressure on the market .
So if consumers look at their products and do n’t buy things with triclosan , they ’re making their voice heard .
Or they can also talk to the retailers and the manufacturers and tell them they do n’t want this product if that ’s the choice they make , if they do n’t like the fact that it ’s going beyond their sink and into the environment . ”
RW : Do you think that we know enough yet to evaluate whether it ’s hazardous – either to human health or to other organisms ?
Arnold : “ I do n’t think we know quite enough yet .
The toxicologists need to get involved and look at the full suite of compounds that are formed and then the human health people need to do their thing as well .
I ’m not qualified to do either of those .
That said , Canada has decided they ’ve got enough information and last year , deemed it toxic to the environment . ”

I recently learned from Ivan Herman ’s blog that O’Reilly has begun publishing RDFa in their online catalog of books .
So if you go and install the RDFa Highlight bookmarklet and then visit a page like this and click on the bookmarklet you ’ll see something like :
Those red boxes you see are graphical depictions of where metadata can be found interleaved in the HTML .
In my screenshot you can maybe barely see an assertion involving the title being displayed :
<urn:x-domain:oreilly.com:product:9780596516499.IP > dc:title " Natural Language Processing with Python "
But there is actually quite a lot of metadata hiding in the page , which can be found by running the page through the RDFa Distiller ( quickly skim over this if your eyes glaze over when you see Turtle ) :

So that ’s a lot of data .
The nice thing about rdf is that you can look at the vocabularies that are being used to get an idea of the rough shape of the underlying data .
Just looking at the namespace prefixes we can see that O’Reilly has chosen to use the following vocabularies :
I was curious so I wrote a little crawler ( 41 lines of Python+rdflib ) to collect all the metadata from the O’Reilly Catalog pages .
Yes all the pages !
It ended up pulling down 92,101 triples .
A nice side effect of having the data as a big ntriples file is you can do unix pipe tricks with sort , cut , uniq like this to get some ballpark numbers on what types of resources are in the rdf graph :
ed@curry:~/Projects/oreilly-crawler$ rdfsum catalog.nt 6803 < http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#TypeAndQuantityNode>
5861 < http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Offering>
4564 < http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#UnitPriceSpecification>
4065 < http://vocab.org/frbr/core#Manifestation>
2100 < http://vocab.org/frbr/core#Expression>
2023 < http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person>
Another nice thing about pulling the RDFa down with rdflib is you end up with a little berkeleydb triple store which you can query with SPARQL , say to pull out all the authors and titles :
SELECT ? title ?author WHERE { ?
title_uri dct:title ? title .
?
title_uri dct:creator ?author_uri . ? author_uri foaf : name ?author . }
And adding a little bit of networkx judo you can get an xmas - friendly graph of authors ( the green dots are books and the red ones are authors ; I limited author labels to authors who had written more than 2 books ) .
Admittedly this is not very readable , but I imagine someone with more network visualization skillz could do something nicer in short order .
There ’s a lot that could be done with the data .
This exercise was mainly just to demonstrate how layering some new stuff into your HTML can really open up doors for how people use your website .
Clearly O’Reilly did some deep thinking about what data they had , and what vocabularies they wanted to model it with .
But once they ’d done that they probably just had to go add 50 lines to an HTML template somewhere , and it was published ( props to David Brunton for this turn of phrase ) .
It ’s a really good sign that a tech publisher with the stature of O’Reilly is giving this method of data publishing a try .
My only suggestion ( for anyone at O’Reilly who might be reading ) would be that it would be nice if they used HTTP URLs instead of URNs for People , Works and Expressions .
I understand why they did it : using URNs eases deployment somewhat since you do n’t have to worry about httpRange - 14 stuff .
But I think they could easily use a hash URI instead of an URN , and make it easy for people to link to their stuff in other data .
The Cool URIs For the Semantic Web has some other patterns they might want to consider , but simply adding a hash to their existing page URIs should do the trick .
So for example , consider if OpenLibrary wanted to link their notion of of a book to O’Reilly ’s notion of a book with owl : sameAs .
If they used they URN they ’d have :
< http://openlibrary.org/b/OL23978297M>
owl:sameAs <urn:x-domain:oreilly.com:product:9780596516499.IP > .
but if O’Reilly identified their expressions with a URL they would enable something like :
< http://openlibrary.org/b/OL23978297M>
owl:sameAs < http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596516499#expression> .
This may seem like a minor point , but it ’s really important to be able to follow your nose on the web–particularly in Linked Data .
If a piece of software ran across the O’Reilly URL in a chunk of OpenLibrary RDF , the program could HTTP GET it , and learn more stuff about the book .
But if it got the URN it would n’t really know how to fetch a representation for that resource without some special case logic that mapped the URN to a URL .
There is a reason why Tim Berners - Lee included the following as the second of his design principles for Linked Data :
Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names .
Anyhow , hats off to O’Reilly for putting RDFa into practice .
I hope the rest of the publishing ( and library world ) take note .
If you are looking to learn more about RDFa Ben Adida and Mark Birbeck ’s RDFa Primer : Bridging the Human and Data Webs is a really nice intro .
The demands placed on enterprise applications continue to increase .
An ever more connected and integrated world makes growing demands on scalability and availability .
Users demand richer interfaces and more sophisticated feature sets .
Development teams become even more distributed .
Offshoring is commonplace .
Yet at the same time , IT needs to be more agile , to respond more quickly to changing business needs and priorities , to do more with less .
In response to these challenges a new set of ideas and technologies is arising that threaten to disrupt established patterns of enterprise Java application development .
In this Jazoon talk , Adrian Colyer will discuss these trends and the responses to them , including the drive towards more dynamic and modular deployment models , dynamic languages , productivity frameworks that operate at higher levels of abstraction , virtualization technologies , cloud , and more .

Introduction
A very personal story of mine has been brewing in my head for a long time .
I have written , deleted , rewritten , and re-deleted it many times trying to find the best way to piece it together in my mind , and on paper .
I have fought for closure and peace of mind for over 7 months .
I finally decided just to lay it out there whether or not it makes sense .
I started an iPhone app company with my friend and room mate ; and it was manipulated , stolen , and destroyed by one of the best con men I have ever met .
My room mate , Ryan ( who worked as an iPhone game developer at the time ) , had a great idea to make OpenGLES based yoga / fitness applications .
Because yoga is something we practiced , it seemed only natural to couple this with our love for animation , graphics , and programming .
He put together a working prototype and we went out and got the license and development tools necessary to begin production .
Ryan had been going to a Mind - Body fitness class for a couple of months that was run by a knowledgeable , charismatic guy who had been purportedly practicing meditation , qigong , and martial arts for his entire life .
This dude even got his black belt from a man trained by Chuck Norris ( I ca n’t prove this ) .
Ryan pointed out that using his name / reputation in the field as well as his guidance for a cut of the revenue could really help boost sales and increase our legitimacy .
Enter “ Tanner ” and the Zen Club
Ryan brought me to Tanner ’s ( his operating alias was “ Sensei ” )
Dojo , a small gym tucked away in the wealthy suburbs of Austin , Texas .
It was a rented office of about 600 - 700 square feet with weights , bands , punching bags , mats , mirrors , etc .
As I entered I could tell it was a martial arts school , with shoes all sprawled out by the door and a sign that said “ Leave your shoes , and your ego , at the door . ”
I tried to be on my least - arrogant behavior knowing the environment that I just walked in to .
Then I saw him .
Tanner .
I could tell it was him because he walked up to the front desk like he owned the place .
He had a perfectly shaven flavor savor and well modeled , bowl cut with West Hollywood frosted tips .
My immediate visceral reaction was “ what a douche . ”
But remembering the sign at the door , and that we were soon going to be working with him , I set my natural conceptions aside .
After his class ended , Ryan , Tanner and I went into the adjacent office that was not leased at the moment .
I later learned that Tanner had talked the property owner into letting him “ squat ” there ( his words , not mine ) so he could have privacy while classes were going on next door .
And let me tell you , this guy blew me away .
He was 20 years older than both me and Ryan , but I felt like he was right there .
There was no distance , no generation gap .
He said all the right things .
He was a mentor , friend , and brother all at the same time .
I had simply never met anyone like him .
I felt like we were the luckiest guys in the world .
As we talked we discussed what type of applications we wanted to make .
We showed him our portfolios , told him about our backgrounds , what we were capable of , and what we wanted from him .
He was all for it .
He even wanted to be a partner in our company to help us grow and watch us succeed .
One of the things Tanner stressed the most at the beginning ( and this is important ) , was that our applications should be designed to help people first and foremost .
If we made some quick cash in the process , more the better , but it was not our primary motive .
( This was also during the time iFart ’s success was sprayed all over the headlines of every tech outlet on the Internet , January 2009 ) .
He related a story to us about an old mentor of his that was n’t practicing what he preached , and it really disappointed him .
He finally had to confront his mentor and ended up leaving the school .
Since then , Tanner said he has been practicing contributing to society for the good of all those involved .
This was right around the time the scope of the credit default swap scandal and bailouts were in full swing , so to meet someone so genuinely good was both surprising and refreshing .
Hook set , the Rabbit hole begins
Ryan and I were actively developing our Satori Yoga application .
Tanner had pulled a favor from one of his students who was a professional photographer to get Tanner ’s wife , Samantha , in the yoga poses we needed using a high quality CLR camera .
He was doing a photo shoot for his Zen Club clothing line , and brought us in after to do our iPhone shoot .
He was pulling out all the stops .
He let us use his hot tub , invited us to fancy dions ” – truly involving us in his world , treating us like equals , and had even called Ryan and I geniuses to the lady at the DBA office when we were reserving our business name .
The three of us would go disc golfing , drink beers together , and go to the driving range .
We were like three peas in a pod .
It felt so strange , yet so right that we could relate to someone significantly older than us .
It must be the spirituality , the meditation , the mindset – I thought to myself .
I realized that I wanted to be just as tuned in as he was .
Just as good .
Just as spiritual .
Good things would come my way .
Sometime during this period , I joined Zen Club .
It was the mind - body fitness class Ryan had met Tanner through .
Its a mix of meditation , interval training , weight training , and stretching .
( In hindsight , I believe it to be no more than an overpriced ( $ 150 a month ) repetitive work out with trite spiritual messages designed to make you feel good about yourself . )
You read that right , we were bringing a revenue opportunity to our business partner , and paying him $ 150 a month for a guided gym membership ( and Ryan even ended up paying Tanner a full $ 40 for his meditation DVD series ) .
But I ’m getting ahead of myself .
The First Sign of Trouble , and the Smooth Talking Begins
We would constantly have meetings with Tanner .
He would call them probably 2 or 3 times a week .
Despite the fact it was originally Ryan ’s idea , and the two of us were doing most of the work , it seemed as though Tanner was running the show somehow .
Ryan and I were working as hard as we could to get all of the graphics and bootstrapping done so we could really hit the ground running .
Within 3 weeks , we had created an entire OpenGL framework that would really allow us to harness the power of the iPhone in a way that most non -game application developers did n’t bother with .
Tanner ’s third , non-developer eye helped us create something a little more polished as he was n’t married to the code and graphics like Ryan and I were .
During one of the many meetings the three of us had , Tanner began talking about revenue splits ( way before we even finished the Yoga application ) .
Because the IP “ technically ” belonged to Zen Club , the company would get its own share .
Wait .
Was n’t he already getting a cut because he was a partner ?
Would n’t giving Zen Club a cut be effectively paying him twice , despite the fact he does n’t even know how to write code ?
Did he think I was stupid ?
This began to worry me , especially since we did n’t even have a contract in place .
I knew this was an amateur mistake ( even at the time ) , but because I felt like I could trust him completely , I thought I was just being paranoid .
The entire business was supposed to be a “ spiritual revolution of goodness in the world ” , why would he screw me over ?
I came to him open and honest with my concerns in an important meeting late one night at my and Ryan ’s house .
If we were going into business together we needed all emotions out on the table .
I told Tanner I did n’t think he was really pulling for this company .
I told him I felt like he wanted to maximize his profits by taking a partnership cut , and paying out to Zen Club , and that once revenue dried up and the iPhone App boom was over , the company would dissolve and he would take his profits and continue with his seemingly successful gym business .
He told me of course he was pulling for it , he was a partner and had already invested so much time and energy into it ( and even some money – he paid $ 300 for a manual on how to make money on Twitter and gave it to me ) .
He told me I was living in fear , I did n’t know how to recognize success .
That I could trust him .
Ryan was n’t much help – he had known
Tanner for 4 or so months before I ever met him and was already completely convinced by his charisma .
This left it 2 against 1 .
Because I had n’t invested any money into it beyond my iMac for development ( which was mine ) , and programming was something I loved – I continued , worries quelled .
The Secret , The Master Teacher , And the iZenStudent Daily Meditations
For the uninitiated , there was a cult classic hit movie “ The Secret , ” that came out not to long ago .
It was a self - help phenomenon .
The basic tenet was that you attract everything that happens into your life , be it positive or negative , by your thoughts .
The first time I watched the movie , my naive jaw hit the floor – “ it was just so true ” I convinced myself .
I could instantly recall where negative thought patterns manifested exactly what I was trying to avoid , and that positive visualization had brought me everything that was right in my life to fruition .
It was the basis of all of the spiritual teachings I had been learning during my time at Tanner ’s Zen Club .
I truly was a spiritual maverick ready to make a difference in the world .
I started positive visualization , created a vision board – nothing could freaking stop me from success as long as I was focused .
I was having severe back problems during this time , and because Tanner supposedly had a back injury he had healed with meditation and qi gong , he found this as a perfect opportunity to regain my trust after my previous skepticism about his intentions .
Helping me with breathing , visualization , and actually even a little Active Resistance Training and massage ( no , really ) I felt just as close to him as I did before he tried siphoning money through our application revenue back into Zen Club .
( In the end none of this helped and I ended up in back surgery , but that is a different story for a different day ) .
And then it happened .
The law of attraction “ worked ” .
Through some business connections I am to this day not really clear on , we landed a phone call with Joe Ansaldi – master teacher from The Secret , proven business guru and multi-millionaire .
And he was interested in working with us on our iPhone Applications .
To cut a long process , long coding nights , long pitch planning sessions , web site creation , and meditation short – he was instantly interested and we were now using his endorsements and ideas to sell our iPhone Apps .
Joe .
Freaking .
Ansaldi .
Needless to say – we listened to Joe .
The days of the Satori Yoga application were long gone .
We were now working on a series of iPhone applications based on Joe Ansaldi ’s Daily Meditations .
We coined our name , iZenStudent , and were “ on our way to making millions ” .
Yet somewhere along the way , and I can’t exactly discern when , the dynamics of our triad partnership had changed .
We started reporting to Tanner like he was a boss , not a guide .
Ryan had been completely indoctrinated into Tanner ’s world view and became an echo of his ideas and mantras .
The Secret ’s doctrine had the propensity to blame the victim .
Ryan even tried to convince me that my herniated disc pain was actually in my head .
This mentality made negotiating and brainstorming an absolute nightmare .
Meetings and business decisions were completely useless .
Prudent business outlooks I offered along with the positive vibes of our “ synergistic ” style were ignored by both Tanner and Ryan as negative vibrations .
In the end it always came down to Tanner ’s ideas , parroted by Ryan , in direct opposition to me ( even if my suggestions benefitted us as a whole ) .
I had always been the voice of prudence during the operation – the least “ spiritual ” of the three ( or at least that ’s how I had been cornered to feel ) , some negative naysayer .
Knowing there was about to be the potential for some serious cash on the table , coupled with the working vote - count monopoly Tanner had acquired , I demanded that we get a contract set up , get some lawyers in on the deal , and get legit .
I also suggested that we get a helping hand from my girlfriend who had done business taxes and books before so we can keep everything straight .
I wanted to start keeping track of expenses and logging hours .
Tanner immediately shot that down saying “ getting loved ones involved in business always ends up messy ” ( this becomes important later ) .
The Invisible Lawyer and the Boilerplate Contract
Upon demanding a contract , Tanner instantly offered a lawyer who owed him a favor in return for free classes , who was “ the best partnership lawyer in Austin , ” who could draw us up a contract at no cost .
“ Sweet ! ” I thought , considering I did n’t have the money for the consulting or the fees involved in drawing it all out .
I never saw the guy .
Not even once .
I could n’t even find the “ best partnership lawyer in Austin ” on Google .
Weeks later , after endless questions and arguments about the stalling ( all while Ryan and I spent late nights coding , neglecting life duties like cleaning the house , doing the dishes , and paying attention to my girlfriend ) , Tanner finally delivered a “ contract ” for us to sign .
Luckily for me , my girlfriend is a very intelligent tax consultant / accountant , with one of the best intellectual property expert witnesses in the country as a father .
Needless to say , I had someone with my best interest in mind who could read legalese .
It was a completely boilerplate contract that anyone with access to the internet could have either downloaded or created using a service like LegalZoom .
I sent the changes that were suggested by my girlfriend , who I trusted more than anyone else at this point , to Tanner for review .
That was the last I heard of it .
By this point , my skepticism was mounting , but Tanner tried one more maneuver to get me sold .
He informed Ryan and I that he was talking with Joe Ansaldi ( which he had started doing more often without us ) and he could possibly be interested in seed funding us – get us out of our day jobs to develop full time .
We discussed it late one night in the abandoned office he was still squatting in , and we came up with a number .
$ 250,000 .
I went back to my girlfriends place the next night and did some numbers , comparing it to our current salaries , splitting it up three ways , taking away tax and operating costs , etc .
I realized that walking away from my comfortable and rewarding corporate job on nothing less than a complete gamble was a waste of time .
And financially dangerous .
Tanner tried to convince me I was living in fear .
That I was not taking necessary risks for greatness .
What he failed to realize was that I knew if the runway ran out , I ’d be left with no income and no job in a down market .
He , on the other hand , would still have his Zen Club and an army of participants willing to pay $ 150 a month .
The spiritual renegade was over – this was certainly not for the good of all those involved , as Tanner had preached and “ practiced ” every day of his life .
He was trying to walk me off a cliff on a gamble that would screw me and Ryan if we failed , while leaving him down only a couple hundred bucks .
“ Oh well , thats business . ”
It had become obvious to me that this was a low - overhead operation and if Tanner could get us to quit our jobs , our best bet would be to work as hard as we can on iZenStudent to make it successful .
The iPhone millionaires kept showing up in the headlines , a lage incentive for Tanner to drive us – and really the only thing keeping us motivated despite the fact it had been 4 months and we were n’t any closer to a contract or a product .
This was n’t even taking into account the countless articles of App Store submission nightmares and developers going unpaid for sold applications .
I Quit !
And That ’s When the Fun Begins
Tanner had kept me running for the carrot on the string long enough .
We had a meeting a couple days later where I told Ryan and Tanner I was no longer interested in working on iZenStudent .
Tanner was obviously working us like dogs , for free , at the expense of our own life balance , for his direct benefit .
He did n’t seem upset .
Rather , he was probably elated considering I was a complete thorn in his side ever since I became wise to him , despite the fact that Ryan was still working enthusiastically as if the cash had already arrived ( which is what Tanner tried to teach us both to become successful – Step 2 of the law of attraction is to feel as though what you wish for has already arrived ) .
Within 2 weeks of quitting , the website I built from the ground up on the domain that Ryan purchased was moved to a similar ( however less intuitive ) domain that was under Tanner ’s control .
My iZenStudent e-mail and ftp accounts were deleted ( along with all of the records within ) .
Tanner named himself CEO of iZenStudent on the website without discussing it with Ryan at all , and got his wife , Samantha ( remember her ? ) , in as COO and creative director ( whatever happened to leaving loved ones out of business ? )
Ryan was one of my closest friends for 2 years , I felt as though I needed to warn him .
Tanner always had a way with spinning his words , and Ryan was really good at believing him .
I wrote Ryan a long , descriptive e-mail trying to outline everything Tanner had done up to this point – including , but not limited to , trying to double pay himself through Zen Club , going from a partner interested in helping people first and foremost to convincing us we were just steps away from millions of dollars , moving the website off a domain Ryan controlled , and naming himself CEO of the operation .
His response was little more than a proverbial middle finger to our relationship .
He trusted Tanner and his ability to lead “ iZenStudent to the App Store stratosphere ” over his best friend .
Defeated on that front , I wrote another long , descriptive e-mail to Tanner , telling him I was aware of everything he was doing .
I told him I thought he was not practicing any of the spiritual tenets he preached , and was – very simply – a manipulative con man .
What happened next ?
First , I was banned from his online Zen Club community ( I ’ll let you speculate why ) .
Tanner then e-mailed Ryan , saying , that due to my behavior and “ drama , ” that iZenStudent was done .
It was over .
No more .
He was just going to end the “ millions of dollars everyone was going to make ” because my e-mail hurt his feelings .
A day later Tanner contacted Ryan again – saying he would give Ryan one more chance at iZenStudent , if Ryan promised that I would no longer be a problem .
Here , Tanner created a lose - lose - win situation .
First , it almost immediately destroyed any remants of the relationship I had with Ryan because Tanner painted a picture that I was the cause of iZenStudent ’s near death experience .
Two , it made Ryan ’s compliance as a sign of complete loss of control of the company he originally founded .
To add a cherry on top , it got me completely out of the way so he could continue to manipulate the situation without further interference .
Ryan could no longer afford to pay rent ( due to the layoff ) and had to move back in with his parents .
I moved out and got my own apartment .
The iZenStudent website that I created slowly morphed into a tacky quick - fix - for - all - your - problems promotional page , and I can only now vaguely recognize the products we were producing ( minus some of my code and original artwork which is obviously there either pixel for pixel or in direct spirit thereof ) .
In The End
I recently met up with Ryan ( now 6 - 7 months after that last altercation ) to catch up now that the steam had settled .
He related to me that the eventual contract that did end up getting inked gave Ryan a whopping 5 % of the company for the 11 applications he made after I had left .
Apparently , Joe Ansaldi said Ryan should be lucky to get even that ( I believe this was probably due to how Tanner framed Ryan ’s involvement – as just a developer ) .
Tanner and Samantha cited in the contract over 10 thousand dollars of business expenses to fly to the west coast to meet with Joe Ansaldi , all the while staying at 5 star hotels and renting BMWs .
If Ryan really wanted to , he could take them to court over it .
Hell .
If I wanted to , I could take them all to court for my back wages .
I have all of the digital proof sitting on this very laptop .
In the end its not worth the effort and it would be too soon if I ever saw Tanner or his wife again .
To this day I simply can’t believe that someone out there exists who would con and manipulate people like this .
I ’ve definitely lost my innocence during the process .
“ Shit like this only happens in Hollywood ” .
Oh wait , that ’s where Tanner is from .
Heres a small bulleted list of some of the things that happened throughout the 5 months I was working with Tanner and involved in the Zen Club that rubbed me the wrong way :
Tanner started a Sunday Meditation class , where you could sit on pillows and discuss meditation and go through guided lessons .
The next week – you could n’t use the pillows unless you bought them for $ 30 .
He created a series of seminars – from foam rollers , to qi gong , martial arts , etc. that cost $ 40 to attend .
These were things that were supposed to be offered as part of the overpriced Zen Club bootcamp ( $ 150 a month ) .
He heavily recruited Zen Club members during lessons and made me feel uncomfortable a number of times when I declined .
In fact – the entire Zen Club is kind of run like a cult .
There is a definite in - out club mentality and if you were negative or somehow challenged Tanner ’s lessons or views it would piss him off .
Everyone wears the same black workout clothes , and while not required , I was questioned numerous times from his assistant as to where my black Zen Club shirt had gone when I failed to wear it .
For a guy who approaches life with a “ contemporary zen ” view , he and his wife drove a BMW 5 series and a Mercedes Benz .
Samantha once related to me that she spent over $ 900 in a weekend putting potted plants in their back yard .
The inside of their house looks like a Orienental Decor catalogue – pulling out all stops with large decorative pieces with absolutely no function .
I have witnessed , with full admittance by Samatha , that she was driving with a glass of wine .
When Tanner showed up at a FedEx where we were meeting to terminate our DBA ( after I quit ) , he got out of his car at 5 pm in the middle of the week , and killed the end of his Corona Light .
Checking the property tax records reveals that Samantha ( although an alias for the purpose of this article ) is n’t even her real name .
Tanner ( also an alias for this article ) , is n’t his real legal name either .
Any internet search on either of the two will not turn up anything between 1994 to 2007 .
Using Samatha ’s real name reveals her previous acting career ( despite claiming being in a zen - like meditation community for 17 years - making it 1992 - , where they gave up all possessions and were training not even to enjoy their food .
That said , she did tell everyone she used to act but found it weird how I could never find any information about it ) .
Typing all of that stuff out , I feel almost stupid that I trusted this guy with my business for as long as I did .
In reality , none of these little things clicked , none of the dots were connected until months later and only after I regained some emotional clarity on the subject .
Are they a con couple ?
I ca n’t really tell .
Maybe they just got greedy amist the iPhone gold rush after they realized they had two talented developers under their control who were already working for free and without a contract .
I could speculate for months ( and I have ) .
I ’m ready to put this thing to rest .
Typing this out and organizing my thoughts has been largely theraputic for me .
I hope it serves as a warning to anyone who is going into a business partnership to remember what they say is true – its worse than marriage .
Hell , its like all of the work with none of the sex .
And if you meet a complete stranger who is more than willing to help you make a bunch of money – they are probably trying to screw you .
I guess even the “ good ” people in this world can turn out to be bold face liars .
Now there ’s a concept .
Keep your businesses real , and stay safe .
Epilogue
There has been quite and interet response to this article so I ’m going to clarify a couple of things , as well as draw up some clearer conclusions and lessons learned .
1 . I never really thought that what we were doing was revolutionary .
We were creating cool looking applications on a new device and that excited me .
Once we had a reputable name that had the marketing acumen , I thought that we could push a lot of $ 0.99 units .
2 . I continued on despite what looked like a bad deal out of loyalty to my friend .
His arrogance was n’t helping , I probably stayed too long , and in the future I will definitely pick my friends a little more carefully .
3 . My fascination with “ The Secret ” was true and simple naivety .
Had I had walked around the block a couple more times I would have realized that this was complete snake oil wrapped in a snappy , marketable message .
4. “ Tanner ’s ” relationship with Ryan rotted after the poor handling of their eventual contract and his Dojo ’s attendance has been suffering as it has apparently clearly affected his charismatic performance .
I ’ve been told he is in a mountain of personal and business debt .
This is merely what I was told by a source I trust but take from it what you will .
5 . I made a lot of dumb mistakes and wanted to “ play business ” like it was some game and that if I sat in my room and wrote code all day the mail man would deliver a pile of money to my doorstep .
I was an ass hat and I ’ve learned a great deal of humility since then .
6 . It was emotional , and maybe I played that up a bit here .
Its a personal story and its taken a long time to get over it .
Simply knowing I ’ve had people read my story is enough .
It was my first true business endeavor outside the safety of a large corporate structure and I got burned .
7 . The company is still operating , but still have n’t managed to get even one of their 12 applications onto the app store .
They have since produced zero revenue , the seed money was probably a lie from Tanner , and there ’s so many cuts in the pie these days that I ’d be surprised if anyone made their investment back .
( As of November 9 , 2009 ) .
8 . A lot of people speculate that “ con man ” is probably inaccurate .
And after reading a lot of perspectives via personal e-mail and comments on Hacker News .
I ’d say that ’s a fair assessment .
I did n’t protect myself and Ryan and I were simply taken advantage of .
The story conveys my emotions about the issue , and how terrible it made me feel .
Half of me had wished I had posted for advice earlier on ( I did eventually get the advice I needed from my girlfriends Dad ) , I get the feeling I would have been served up a large slice of reality pie .
I ’m doing my best not to walk around with my head so far up my own ass this time around , seeking professional advice where needed .
Thanks for taking the interest and time to read and respond to my story .
Hopefully someone avoids making the same mistakes I did .

Thousands of years of human activity along the Upper Peninsula 's Lake Superior shoreline have come into sharper focus after three years of research .
Scientists from Northern Michigan University 's geography department recently completed a project at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore that located 23 new archaeological sites .
The researchers also helped define the shoreline as it existed 4,500 years ago .
Department head John Anderton said the National Park Service - backed effort was designed to find cultural resources so they can be protected during future road building and other developments .
" In the first year of the project , satellite imagery was used to identify distinct land forms , notches , ridges and barriers created by wave action , to map the older shorelines , " Northern Michigan spokeswoman Kristi Evans wrote on the school 's Web site .
" They found that the water was 30 - 40 feet higher than it is today . "
Anderton said today , the federally protected land is n't very habitable .
" But if you go back a while , there were nice places for people to live , " he said .
" There were embayments , or shallow water lagoons , that had a variety of fish and plants — everything a hunter - gatherer would need . "
In the second year of the project , colleague Robert Legg carried out modeling of archaeological sites , using known sites to help find new ones with similar features .
Detailed digital elevation models made by professor Robert Regis let Anderton and students pick likely places to dig .
According to Anderton , past researchers " might do a hundred tests and find nothing .
But one out of four of ours unearthed artifacts .
That 's called smart archaeology . "
NASA 's Spirit Rover just is n't having much luck , between sand storms and broken wheels , with a second wheel presumed broken and the threat of an icy - cold winter freezing the Spirit " to death " if it does n't move on soon .

Stuck in a soft patch of sand since April , its whole right side sounds damaged , thanks to the front - right wheel which has n't worked since 2006 , and now the back - right wheel that has seized up trying to get out of the sand .

Solar - powered , the Spirit Rover normally rests up each winter with its solar back angled towards any available sunlight , with enough power soaking in to keep its inside - bits from freezing .
But if it can't move out of the sand pit it 's stuck in , the Spirit Rover wo n't be able to soak up those vital rays of light .
NASA , if we all collected enough tinned soup and woolly jumpers to send to Mars , would that help ?

Utah Republican Orrin Hatch has a reputation as a classy conservative .
A trusted voice for right - wing causes , he is a stalwart foe of abortion who voted against Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor .
But Hatch , a Mormon , is also part of what might be called the Civil Caucus in Congress , often pairing up on legislation with liberal Ted Kennedy , supporting stem cell research , immigration reform and a DREAM
Act that would allow children of illegal immigrants to attend college .
So it came as something of a surprise to hear Hatch , in an interview Monday night with Cybercast News Service , attribute the Obama White House passion for healthcare to a ploy by the Democratic Party to take over the political system .
He seemed to suggest that healthcare reform will be so popular that Americans will come to rely on Democrats to keep it coming .
Take a listen and let us know what you think .
The 75 - year - old Hatch also said he thought the Democrats ' healthcare reform was unconstitutional , arguing that if the federal government can force Americans to buy health insurance “ then there is literally nothing the federal government can’t force us to do . ”

Everyone likes to complain about Python packaging , me included .
It ’s no fun , and it ’s confusing , and it seems to be in a constant state of flux , and the languages and the distros can’t agree on who ’s in charge , etc , etc .
I ’ll add just one small observation : setuptools is widely used as a way to install Python packages .
Look at its latest version : 0.6c11 .
In case it ’s not familiar to you , that “ c ” in there means this is the eleventh release candidate for version 0.6 .
What !?
Do we really believe that a release engineer is closely monitoring the health of this package , and is about to release 0.6 , but needs this code tried first ?
And that this is their eleventh attempt at building an acceptable 0.6 kit ?
This is crazy .
According to PyPI , the first release candidate of 0.6 was posted 3 years 4 months ago , and the first beta was posted 14 months before that .
What are we waiting for ?
Considering how widely adopted this package is , and how dependent we are on it working properly , and how little it has changed , this latest code should have just been called 1.1 .
I ’ve long held that it ’s a plague on open source that so many project insist on staying in the zeros .
But setuptools takes it even further than most with this insane charade that somehow these are release candidates .
It ’s just one more small reason I say , Welcome to Distribute .
The parents of Charlotte Avenall , an eight - year - old found hanged in her bedroom , were arrested today in connection with her death .
Charlotte , who had severe learning difficulties , was found dead by her parents , Simon and Susan Moody , at their home in Mansfield , Nottinghamshire , on 12 September .
A police spokesman said : " A 32 - year - old man and a 24 - year - old woman were arrested today in connection with the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of eight - year - old Charlotte Avenall from Mansfield .
They are currently being questioned by police . "
He would not confirm the identity of the pair .
The parents were interviewed under caution by detectives at the time of Charlotte 's death .
Nottinghamshire county council 's social services department has said it is reviewing the care and support it offered the girl and her family .
Mick Burrows , the chief executive of the authority , said at the time : " We are very sorry to hear of the death of this young girl .
It is a tragedy .
It is clear that our children 's services had been involved with her family .
" We will investigate this matter thoroughly .
We take the protection of vulnerable children very seriously .
We were working with her family , who were receiving support from the county council and a number of other agencies . "
She was known to social services from birth and attended Birklands primary school in nearby Warsop .
A postmortem examination carried out at Leicester royal infirmary last night confirmed the cause death as hanging .
As public discussion and media coverage of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement continues to mount ( Search Engine , Angus editorial ) , it is worth considering whether Canada will play host to an ACTA meeting next year .
The locations and dates for the next two meetings in 2010 have already been disclosed : Mexico ( week of January 25th ) and New Zealand ( week of April 12th ) .
Given the determination to conclude the talks next year , it seems likely that there will be three additional rounds of talks , likely in June / July , September , and November / December .
By April , there will have already been meetings in the U.S. , Japan , Korea , the EU , Mexico , Morocco , New Zealand , and Switzerland .
That leaves just three countries : Australia , Canada , and Singapore .
While June seems unlikely for Canada ( already hosting the G8/ G20 ) , a fall meeting - perhaps the meeting to wrap up the talks - seems a distinct possibility .

" Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught , that he may be able
by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers . "
- Titus 1:9
There was a time when investment decisions had more to do with fundamentals than whether Bernanke would wake up tomorrow and decide it is time to stop the liquidity spigot ( arguably , the only thing that matters these days ) .
Indeed , if in the odd chance Bernanke is not reconfirmed by the Senate , the huge drop the market experienced last year when Congress refused to get Paulson 's first TARP version to be shoved down its throat , will seem like a Sunday morning picnic .
In those long gone days when there was more to valuation than persistent bubble liquidity , investors used to look at arcana such as cash flow statement and balance sheets ( and income statements as well , before the FASB decided to make a total mockery out of the joke that are " reported earnings " ) .
One recent topic that Zero Hedge has discussed has been the increase in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet .
We have highlighted how this increase in cash has been primarily a function of increasing debt and decreasing capital expenditures ( both maintenance and growth ) , as companies have bunkered down while the recessionary storm rages .
Today , we analyze a broader set of metrics of the combined balance sheet of the 500 companies in the S&P 500 index .
We have compiled key data on a quarterly basis for both the asset and liabilities side of the broadest cumulative balance sheet in the world .
The table below highlights all the data compiled via CapIQ :
Total assets have grown by 30 % over the past 4 years , from $ 19 trillion to $ 24.6 trillion as of September 30 , 2009 .
And while cash has exploded by 74 % from $ 872 billion at the end of 2005 to $ 1.5 trillion most recently , as a percentage of total assets it has been relatively flat , rising from 4.6 % to just 6.2 % .
Ironically , goodwill growth has been substantial , accounting for nearly $ 400 billion of total asset expansion , from $ 1.2 trillion to $ 1.6 trillion .
How to believe this " growth " in the face of one the roughest revaluation periods for corporate acquisitions is a different story .
It is likely that many companies are far overdue for major goodwill writedowns , which lax accounting standards keep permitting to be indefinitely put off into the future .
On the liabilities side , there are no major surprises : debt has grown by nearly triple the amount that cash increased during the observed period .
Debt grew by $ 1.8 trillion from $ 5 trillion to $ 6.8 trillion in the past four years .
This is nearly 2.7 x greater than the comparable increase in cash .
This should be a major concern to all who claim that corporate deleveraging is ongoing , and that the corporate cash increase is sufficient to offset the debt increase .
Yet what likely is the most relevant observation is the disproportionate need to constantly lever up to extract ever declining cash out the asset base , as well as the broadly declining quality of S&P assets as measured by their actual cash generation capacity .
The graph below shows the material increase in both total and net leverage in the S&P as calculated by Total and Net Debt to EBITDA - the one metric that still has some credibility even as Earnings and EPS have been rendered practically meaningless courtesy of ever more toothless GAAP rules .
Total leverage has increase from 4.6 x to 5.8 x in the last two years , and even factoring for the cash increase does not present a rosier picture : Net Leverage is up 20 % , from 3.8 x to 4.5 x .
In essence the entire S&P is one big High Yield credit , and would likely be rated in the B2 / B area by the rating agencies ( assuming these had any credibility ) .
As such , the cost of debt of the combined S&P if it were a standalone company would be around 7.5 - 8.5 % .
That it is currently much lower due to the Fed 's intervention in the interest rate market is an aberration : look for cost of debt ( and , by implication , overall capital ) to spike broadly over the next several years , as normalcy ( hopefully ) returns .
Lastly , an unpleasasnt picture emerges when analyzing the ( adjusted ) return on assets and equity ( however with EBITDA instead of earnings in the numerator ) .
Both the return on assets ( EBITDA / total assets ) and return on equity ( EBITDA / Shareholders ' Equity ) has plunged , with the first dropping to 4.7 % from a four year average of 5.8 % , an 18.3 % reduction , while ROE has dropped from a 4 year average of 29.2 % to 24.1 % : a comparable 17.4 % plunge .
The preliminary conclusion is that companies are scrambling to beef up the asset side of their balance sheets even as debt continues to be a major threat .
The problem , however , as this brief exercise has shown , is that incremental assets are of lesser and lesser quality ( even assuming no major goodwill impairments in the future ) , and the actual cash they generate continues eroding .
Absent a major secular breakthrough in economic efficiency , look for cash flow reduction trends to continue even as the S&P labors under ever increasing debt loads .
And with the shadow banking and asset system still solidly dead , it appears that creating asset returns out of thin air will not be an option for the corporate world for a long time .

Prepared Remarks of President Barack Obama Weekly Address Washington , DC October 3 , 2009
When I took office eight months ago , our nation was in the midst of an economic crisis unlike any we ’d seen in generations .
While I was confident that our economy would recover , we know that employment is often the last thing to come back after a recession .
Our task is to do everything we possibly can to accelerate that process .
And we ’ve certainly made progress on this front since the period last winter when we were losing an average of 700,000 jobs each month .
But yesterday ’s report on September job losses was a sobering reminder that progress comes in fits and starts , and that we will need to grind out this recovery step by step .
That ’s why I ’m working closely with my economic team to explore additional options to promote job creation .
And I wo n’t let up until those who seek jobs can find them ; until businesses that seek capital and credit can thrive ; and until all responsible homeowners can stay in their homes .
It wo n’t be easy .
It will require us to lay a new foundation for our economy – one that gives our workers the skills and education they need to compete ; that invests in renewable energy and the jobs of the future ; and that makes health care affordable for families and businesses – particularly small businesses , many of which have been overwhelmed by rising health care costs .
This is something I hear about from entrepreneurs I meet – people who ’ve got a good idea , and the expertise and determination to build it into a thriving business .
But many ca n’t take that leap because they ca n’t afford to lose the health insurance they have at their current job .
I hear about it from small business owners who want to grow their companies and hire more people , but they can’t , because they can barely afford to insure the employees they have .
One small business owner wrote to me that health care costs are – and I quote – " stifling my business growth . "
He said that the money he wanted to use for research and development , and to expand his operations , has instead been " thrown into the pocket of healthcare insurance carriers . "
These small businesses are the mom and pop stores and restaurants , beauty shops and construction companies that support families and sustain communities .
They ’re the small startups with big ideas , hoping to be the next Google , or Apple , or HP .
Altogether , they create roughly half of all new jobs .
And right now , they are paying up to 18 percent more for the very same insurance plans as larger businesses because they have higher administrative costs and less bargaining power .
Many have been forced to cut benefits or drop coverage .
Some have shed jobs or shut their doors entirely .
And recent studies show that if we fail to act now , employers will pay six percent more to insure their employees next year – and more than twice as much over the next decade .
Rising health care costs are undermining our businesses , exploding our deficits , and costing our nation more jobs with each passing month .
So we know that reforming our health insurance system will be a critical step in rebuilding our economy so that our entrepreneurs can pursue the American Dream again , and our small businesses can grow and expand and create new jobs again .
That is precisely what the reform legislation before Congress right now will do .
Under these proposals , small businesses will be able to purchase health insurance through an insurance exchange , a marketplace where they can compare the price , quality and services of a wide variety of plans , many of which will provide better coverage at lower costs than the plans they have now .
Small businesses wo n’t be required to cover their employees , but many that do will receive a tax credit to help them pay for it .
If a small business chooses not to provide coverage , its employees will receive tax credits to help them purchase health insurance on their own through the insurance exchange .
And no matter how you get your insurance , insurance companies will no longer be allowed to deny your coverage because of a pre-existing condition .
They wo n’t be able to drop your coverage if you get too sick , or lose your job , or change jobs .
And we ’ll limit the amount your insurance company can force you to pay out of your own pocket .
By now , the urgency of these reforms is abundantly clear .
And after long hours of thoughtful deliberation and tough negotiation , the Senate Finance Committee – the final congressional committee involved in shaping health care legislation – has finished the process of crafting their reform proposal .
As we move forward in the coming weeks , I understand that members of Congress from both parties will want to engage in a vigorous debate and contribute their own ideas .
And I welcome those contributions .
I welcome any sincere attempts to improve legislation before it reaches my desk .
But what I will not accept are attempts to stall , or drag our feet .
I will not accept partisan efforts to block reform at any cost .
Instead , I expect us to move forward with a spirit of civility , a seriousness of purpose , and a willingness to compromise that characterizes our democratic process at its very best .
If we do that , I am confident that we will pass reform this year , and help ensure that our entrepreneurs , our businesses , and our economy can thrive in the years ahead .
Thank you .
So let 's say that you live in a nice neighborhood in downtown San Diego , for instance .
And under your neighborhood someone discovers there is a rich pool of oil .
Well if your next door neighbor is a fast mover , he might drill his well and suck all the oil out of your particular bit of that pool , before you can blink , and yup !
It 's his ( or hers ) .
So what do you do to counter this and get what 's yours before it is half - inched ?
The obvious answer is to drill your own well , and ( rather like two siblings drinking a soda through straws into the same glass ) whoever sucks hardest gets the most .
Which does all sorts of nasty things to the idea of holding a resource until it 's value goes up - but then , that 's the oil and gas business .
Well over the last century that obsessive attitude has ameliorated a tad , and now when wells are drilled ( particularly since they are a bit more expensive ) we try and space them at intervals so that each gets to drain out to the point where it naturally runs out of ability to drain further .
There are intricate mathematical equations for this ( which I long ago deliberately forgot ) but as a first rule of thumb the industry uses a baseline of 40 acres per well .
Which means that if you were looking to drill a second well you mightand drill the next well some 440 yds away from the first .
( A quarter of a mile , for those of us who think that way ) .
Which way would you go ?
Well that depends very much on the information that you managed to get from the well that you just put in .
And this will rely on logs that you ran after drilling , and the map that you were given of the underground geology before you drilled the first well .
Some of that information will relate to the permeability of the rock , and the quality of the oil .
The lighter the oil and the higher the permeability then the further apart you may want to space the wells ( given that they are becoming just a tad expensive these days ) .
Generally in more favorable fields you may space at greater intervals ( gas wells tend to be about a mile apart for example ) .
On the other hand , in some cases , having drilled a very well spaced set of wells you may discover that the permeability is n't quite as good as you had thought , and then you might go in and put wells at closer intervals than originally drilled , the well pattern .
But there are places where this is not an easy option .
One such , of course , is the current spate of discoveries and development in Deep Water .
But one of the earlier places where this came about was in Western Siberia .
After all , here you are , finally established on a man-made island in the marsh , and producing oil , and to drill the next well you have to drive another road through the swamp , build an island , move the equipment , recreate the drill site , before you can start drilling .
As Ivan Ivanovich might have said , " why do n't you be a good Comrade and let me drill over to my patch , from your site ?
" And thus we get into ( and the entirely " accidental " occasional happening of " subsurface trespass " ) .as a term is quite often used now to refer to techniques for putting pipes under rivers Historically wells were drilled , to as great a degree as possible , vertically downwards .
There was the occasional meander , and this had to be corrected , after running a borehole survey , to make sure that the drill eventually arrived at the intended target .
But in making those corrections , so a technology evolved that allowed wells to be steered at deliberate angles , and then the light dawned , andcould be steered away , at designated angles from the initial well , and out to some additional nearby possible sources .
When directional drilling first was developed , the process occurred in a series of steps .
Remember that the wells are usually cased with a steel liner .
So the first thing that had to be done was to cut a window in that casing .
There are several ways to do this , one of the more efficient of which is to use a high - pressure stream of mud from a jet nozzle , that has had a certain amount of sand added to the mud .
This abrasive jet can eat through the steel and cut out a segment or window so that the drill bit can reach and attack the rock .
5,000 psi pressurized abrasive waterjet cut through steel , concrete and rock , as could be used to cut a window in a casing
Now we have to make the drill deflect , and the easy way to do this was to slide a wedge into the hole right at the point where the window had been cut .
This wedge , known as awas very carefully aligned and set into the borehole with the inclined side set so that as a new drilling bit slid down the hole it would beinto the , and began to drill and penetrate the rock in the required direction .
The hole could be started with a smaller bit until the hole is well established ( maybe several feet into the new well ) and then thiswas removed and a full - scale bit put on the bit to allow the drill to continue creating a new hole moving out from , and down from , the new start to reach the new target either by a straight shot , or by drilling over to the vicinity of the new end point , and then kicking back over to the vertical to drill down into the new oil reservoir .
The process is not that complicated , and with practice one could then drill a number of different wells out in different directions from that original hole .
And from one location , or platform , one can then collectively extract the oil from an increasingly large surrounding area of the reservoir .
More recently there are services available such as the Autotrak system where , just behind the drill bit ( which is rotating – as are the main pipe segments – yellow in the picture below ) a non-rotating piece of equipment is located ( blue ) that has three small rams that can push out against the well bore and direct the drilling head over in the direction required .
Autotrak assembly ( Oil Museum in Stavanger ) – you can see one of the pads pushed out as though it was pushing the head over .
And thus it is now possible , through computer sensing of the position of the head , and control of the rams , to steer the drilling head to where you want it to go .
I said " historically " just before talking about Autotrak because when they tried the older system in Western Siberia they ran into a problem .
The quality of Soviet steel was not , at that time , that good at keeping the bit turning down and through the bend it had to follow to deviate the well .
And so they had to come up with a different approach .
And that I ’ll leave perhaps for next week 's chapter .
This is a series of highly informal posts that are aimed at giving some background to what goes into drilling and production from oilwells .
To keep them simple and short I have sometimes simplified a little more than I should to make the description clear , so if it is n’t , please ask .
And while the site had been running of its own volition , a recent mishap inspired Ryan to begin redesigning and restructuring the site .
Today , that work resulted in the launch of a brand new Foodgeeks .
[ HTML2 ] Many of you know Ryan Snyder as one of the folks behind Shizzow , the Portland - based location - sharing app .
But what you may not know is that before Shizzow — way , way before , in fact — he was the guy behind Foodgeeks , a popular site designed to help folks share , rate , and generally geek out about recipes and food .
And while the site had been running of its own volition , a recent mishap inspired Ryan to begin redesigning and restructuring the site .
Today , that work resulted in the launch of a brand new Foodgeeks .
Now , I realize that Foodgeeks may be a new thing to you .
But it ’s been around for a long time .
A long , long time .
Like it may be older than some of you .
Like since December of 1998 .
So what ’s it take to bring a social but still fairly dotcom site up to today ’s social Web standards ?
It ’s safe to say that takes a lot of rethinking and then a lot of tweaking .
And probably introducing some new features , to boot .
“ Even after 10 years , it ’s a project that I ’m still passionate about , ” said Ryan .
“ It ’s cool to see that it still has a place , today . ”
But where to begin ?
Well , having the site crash is always a helpful motivator .
35 days after the big crash , and with the gracious help of Crystal Beasely and her amazing design talents , Foodgeeks has been rebranded and relaunched in time for Thanksgiving .
Foodgeeks includes most of its original features , as well as some new offerings , such as activity streams , badges , tags and the lovable Mr. Yummy .
In my spare time , I ’ll continue to crank out features for Foodgeeks , and will soon rebuild Winegeeks as well .
File it under “ every cloud has a silver lining . ”
It ’s also worth noting that Nate DiNiro has been helping with the rebuild , adding video content to the site — and that content has really brought some of the recipes to life .
So , if geeking out about recipes with your fellow would - be chefs is of interest to you , head on over to Foodgeeks to peruse and rate the more than 10,000 recipes that have already been submitted by folks just like you .
Or you could always start following Foodgeeks on Twitter .

The officials declined to name the other former military officer in the case , who is suspected as a co-conspirator .
He is said to have recently left the Pakistani Army and held the rank of colonel or brigadier general , higher ranks than Mr. Kashmiri held .
Prosecution documents in the case said that the officer was arrested earlier this past summer in Pakistan on unspecified charges and later released .
However , another official said that the officer was discharged only after his associates pressured the Pakistani authorities to free him .
In the complaints against Mr. Headley and Mr. Rana , the officer is identified as an uncharged conspirator by the letters “ A ” and “ B . ” The complaints describe him as “ associated with Kashmiri , as well as with Lashkar - e - Taiba . ”
One official who has been briefed on the investigation said that Pakistani authorities had arrested as many as five other people in connection with the plot in recent weeks , including some former or current Pakistani military officials .
Those people remain in custody , but it was unclear what role they played in the expanding plot .
American military and intelligence officials said the case involving Mr. Headley and Mr. Rana reflected a new and evolving pattern of individual militants with different backgrounds and experience , rather than terrorist groups , teaming up to plot and carry out attacks .
“ In a lot of ways , it ’s moving beyond the mainline activities of individual groups to elements of various militant groups or terrorist organizations that have spent time together , have fought together , maybe trained together , that now have associations with certain facilitators that now come together to plan and execute attacks , ” said a Defense Department official who is following the case closely .
“ The present and future is less about individual groups conducting attacks , and more about combinations of individuals , and groups and facilitators that come together , ” said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the criminal investigation .
“ Together they have the resources , the means , the insights to execute those attacks . ”
“ im not biting my tongue about [ expletive ] else … the industry can kiss my [ expletive ] .
… yeah i said it and i aint retracting [ expletive ] ”
“ the[y ] didnt even have my album in the back … not on shelves , saw for myself ... im tired of this [ expletive ] .
major stores r blackballing my cd. not stockin the shelves and lying to costumers .

But the fact that Brown has apparently quit Twitter over that slight -- essentially cutting off that basic celebrity need to solicit adoration on demand -- provides a telling window into fame .
When stars join Twitter , they show us how they communicate without publicists ' hand - holding .
But when stars quit Twitter , they unveil how petty they can really be when they do n’t get what they want or ca n’t control what others do .
You know -- his new album ?
The one featuring Brown in the high - waisted tally - ho pants and Cylon gauntlet ?
No ?
Well , then , maybe Brown has a point about stores not stocking his album .
Like Miley Cyrus before him , Brown has quit Twitter , shortly after airing a tirade this week about music stores not visibly stocking his new album .
“ we talked to the managers and the[y ] didnt even know anything .
wow !!!
but they had alicia keys album ready for release for this tuesday comin … the manager told me that when there are new releases its mandatory to put em on the shelves ..
BUT NO SIGN OF # GRAFFITI .
BS . ” “ no disprespect to alicia at all , ” he continued .
“ just givin an example to whos album is loaded and ready to go next week . ”
Brown ’s final tweet ?
" I WANNA THANK MY FANS FOR ALL THE SUPPORT , I LOVE YALL .
GOODBYE !!!!!!!!!!!! "
So exactly why did Brown quit ?
Unclear at this hour , though apparently the idea that some stores do n’t feel like doing business with woman - beaters had something to do with it .
But there ’s one other , larger factor : that control thing I mentioned .
" Honestly , Twitter has done nothing but get me into trouble , " Brown told MTV News last month .
( Not his own tweets that always come back to bite him , mind you ; it 's that infernal Twitter service that 's the problem . )
He also said he did n’t like the " backlash " that can come with having a Twitter account .
When Miley Cyrus left Twitter earlier this year , she seemed to have similar reasons .
In a goodbye rap -- yes , really -- she said , “ Everything that I type /
And everything that I do / all those lame gossip sites take it and make it news . ”
So , those , like , media people took what Cyrus posted in a public forum , and , like , said whatever they wanted about it .
Whatever they wanted .
Like , all the time .
I know , rude right ?
Sometimes I do n’t like the stupid stuff that know - it - alls defecate onto my Twitter page .
Sometimes I say stuff that gets me into a world of pain with my fans , or I do n’t get the reaction I was hoping for out in the wider world .
But I do n’t throw a fit and end my connection to the people who , at least , indirectly , pay my bills .
At this hour I have no doubt that Brown will issue some sort of statement or interview about his Twitter abandonment within the next week or two .
Something tells me it ’ll be crafted by his publicist .

On the first day , Katie and her husband saw 13 homes .
Only three were anywhere close to move - in condition , despite the fact that all of the homes were built in 2005 or later .
All were foreclosed properties .
" People find out a year before they 're ever kicked out , so what do they do for that year ? " says Katie .
" Completely destroy their homes . "
I know we 've already heard about this , as had Katie , but the destruction was even beyond her expectations .
" There 's no cleaning that would help . "
There was dirt rubbed on the walls , graffiti , holes in the walls and garbage deposited inside the holes .
The smell ?
" I could n't get past it . "
Obviously there was no hardware on the doors and no appliances , kitchen cabinets , stovetops ... whatever could go went .
75 percent of the homes she went into were an instant no .
But here 's the crazy part :
" We went to a home that had been on the market for one day , and the key was stolen out of the lock box .
Our Realtor said immediately , ' You want this home . '
She told us another Realtor had stolen the key because they wanted their client to get it .
So what did my Realtor do ?
She broke in .
And sure enough this was the home we fell in love with .
It was on for $ 132,000 so we decided to be really aggressive and offered $ 160,000 , plus we had government backing on our loan .
Well our Realtor called that night and said , ' You 're not going to get the home .
They got 30 offers and half are cash offers , so the bank is not even going to look at you . '
The banks just want the cash to unload these places . "
Finally , on day 7 of looking , and after having 7 offers ignored by the banks ( who owned all the homes ) , the Realtor called Katie with " a gold mine . "
Yes , an owner - occupied , regular home .
A rare non-foreclosure .
They went immediately and put in an offer .
The owner claims to like them , but she ended up with 10 offers and is still mulling .
Ironically , in a market still flooding with new foreclosed properties every day , at the end of their week Katie and her husband met with a local builder .
" We know our money will not get us as much , but they 're giving away the granite and hardwoods for free . "
It 's not in their ideal location , and they would n't be able to move in until March , the month their first baby is due .
But at least they do n't have to deal with the banks , the filth and the competition .
Oh , and by the way , a fun factoid on Katie 's Realtor :
She bought her brand new home in 2005 for $ 240,000 .
According to the comps she runs daily , she says it 's now worth between $ 90 - 110,000 .
So in January she decided to stop paying her mortgage .
No financial hardship , she just figured she was throwing money away .
The bank has n't gotten to her yet , so she 's just been living there for free .
At some point , she knows , her bank will foreclose , but she 's fine with that .
She says she 'll do far better financially renting for a while .
This is what the housing market has come to .

Canada ’s border guards are holding prints of three films destined for a gay film festival in Ottawa , and they wo n’t release them until they ’ve had the chance to watch them from beginning to end .
That poses a problem for Inside Out , a Toronto - based film festival with an annual Ottawa satellite program .
They intended to show all three films this weekend .
Without the prints , they ’re left scrambling to find grainy lower - quality copies to show audiences .
They ’re pissed .
“ I was roving mad today , ” says Jason St - Laurent , Inside Out ’s programming director .
If they ca n’t find a solution , the festival stands to lose thousands of dollars .
All three movies have been shown in Canada before .
Patrik 1.5 is a PG - rated film about a gay couple ’s foibles adopting a child in Sweden .
Clapham Junction is R-rated , but by no means obscene .
I Can’t Think Straight , the other film seized , is a relatively mainstream movie which had a theatrical release this summer .
It stars Lisa Ray .
Read reviews of :
“ It seems biased at some times , and at other times random , ” says St - Laurent .
“ But to me , this time , it is not a random event , ” he adds , pointing out that all three movies are distributed by the queer - focussed American entertainment company Here !
It ’s impossible to say for sure , he says , because the federal agency has not given the festival any reason why it detained the films .
Initially , staff at the Canada Border Services Agency ( CBSA ) flagged Clapham Junction , a film that contains some nudity .
Then they added the two other films to the list of what they seized .
Because prints on film — rather than DVD copies — are so expensive , many smaller films only have one or two sets .
Prints are shipped from festival to festival around the world , often with only a few days to get from one screening to another .
CBSA officials told Inside
Out it could be four days until the films are vetted , meaning the prints wo n’t make it to the festival at all .
At Friday night ’s screening of Patrik 1.5 , St - Laurent delivered the news to a packed house of queer film enthusiasts .
The audiences hissed and booed at mention of the CBSA .
The gay community and the CBSA ( formerly Canada Customs ) have a long and checkered past .
Border cops spent two decades harassing gay bookstores , with books and magazines arriving in Canada delayed by months or even shredded .
Vancouver - based bookstore Little Sister ’s took them to court and in 2000 won a partial victory .
At the time , the Supreme Court of Canada acknowledged that material was routinely being stopped at the border because of its gay content , and ordered the government agency to stop .
“ It does n’t only happen to Little Sister ’s , ” St - Laurent told the audience , before playing a watermarked DVD copy of the film .
This is not Inside
Out ’s first time being hassled when trying to bring films into the country .
They regularly use a customs broker to get films that are stuck at the border released .
Inside
Out has located a DVD copy of Clapham Junction , but is still scrambling to find a copy of I Ca n’t Think Straight .
Each screening represents as much as $ 4,000 in revenue .
According to the good folks over at Stones Throw , one of the niftiest independent labels around , DOOM and Madlib are reportedly in Los Angeles working on a follow - up to their 2004 cult classic Madvillainy .

Check out snippets of new Madvillain goodness below .
As big DOOM and Madlib fans , we are wildly optimistic about this fortuitous development .
about this card
It 's ALMOST AMERICAN THANKSGIVING .
And this card ?
I created it in 2012 - SEVEN YEARS AGO !
It was n't supposed to be all that relevant .
I mean this is Wrongcards not TOTALLY - PRESCIENT -CARDS .

I did not , however , predict the rise of gumboots as a fashion accessory .
But only because I 'm sane .
The Rosetta probe will fly by Earth on Friday ( Illustration : ESA / C. Carreau )
Update : On 23 November , ESA reported that no anomaly was detected during Rosetta ’s 13 November fly - by , deepening the mystery of why some fly - bys show unexpected changes in velocity .
To date , the only fly - by to show an anomaly occurred at a distance of less than 2000 km from Earth , while those that went as planned were farther away , suggesting distance from Earth may play a role .
What ’s causing spacecraft to mysteriously accelerate ?
The Rosetta comet chaser ’s fly - by of Earth on 13 November is a perfect opportunity to get to the bottom of it .
The anomaly emerged in 1990 , when NASA ’s Galileo spacecraft whizzed by Earth to get a boost from our planet ’s gravity and gained 3.9 millimetres per second more than expected .
And the European Space Agency ’s Rosetta spacecraft had an unexpected increase of about 1.8 millimetres per second during a previous fly - by of Earth in 2005 .
Scientists have ruled out various mundane explanations like atmospheric drag or the effect of deviations in Earth ’s shape .
This has led some to propose that exotic new physics is involved , such as modifications of Einstein ’s general relativity , the currently accepted theory of gravity .

Comet - chaser clue
All eyes are now on Rosetta , which is set to swing by Earth again at 0745 GMT on 13 November .
It is en route to a comet , and will travel around 2500 kilometres above our planet ’s surface at over 13 kilometres per second .
If it gains an extra 1.1 millimetres per second relative to Earth , it would vindicate a formula that reproduces the anomalies seen so far .
The formula , published in 2008 by ex-NASA scientist John Anderson and his team , hints that Earth ’s rotation may be distorting space - time more than expected and thus influencing nearby spacecraft , though no one can explain how .
General relativity predicts that spinning bodies distort the fabric of surrounding space , but the expected amount is far too small to explain the observed anomalies .
“ I am definitely looking forward to this one , ” says Anderson , who is working with members of the Rosetta team to watch for an anomaly .
However , any anomaly will not be immediately obvious because the expected change is tiny .
“ I anticipate a few days or weeks before we know if an anomaly occurred , ” he says .
Curiously , Rosetta ’s 2007 flyby of Earth produced no anomaly .
That might be because of its much higher altitude , about 5300 kilometres above Earth ’s surface , Anderson says .
He suggests the effect may get weaker with distance from Earth : “ There is most likely some dependence on distance – we just do not know what it is . ”
It 's like the geeked - out version of West Side story .
You have netbooks , which simply took the world by storm , bullying bigger laptops into rethinking their game , slashing prices , and taunting others about long battery life .
Then CULV laptops rolled into town , snapping their fingers and bragging about how their bigger screens and batteries make them the ones to beat .
And somehow , these two groups are rivaling each other and are now running the entire ultraportable scene .
Well , that 's how I 'm portraying it .
If netbooks has taught us anything is that light , inexpensive laptops , with long battery life sell furiously fast .
Their small screens and cramped keyboards , however , were and still are their biggest downfalls .
AMD tried to address these shortcomings by introducing its
Neo processor , a low voltage chip aimed at laptops that were marginally bigger than a netbook , which subsequently gave rise to the HP Pavillion dv2 ( 1030us ) .
But soon after , Intel came down with the hammer .
CULV , which stands for consumer ultra low voltage , is n't a new technology for Intel .
In fact , these processors commanded high premiums two years ago and were found in ultraportables that range upwards of $ 2,000 .
With CULV , Intel merely re-branded these processors , created new ones in the process , and began selling them in laptops that are less than an inch thick , average 13 - inch widescreens , and do n't necessarily include optical drives .
Most compelling of all , CULV laptops cost between $ 600 and $ 900 and delivered great battery life
The began its aggressive campaign with these two things in mind : Great battery life and cheap prices .
And soon everyone else followed .
The list of CULV processors are mind numbing and confusing .
They vary by brand Core Solo , Pentium , and Core 2 Duomodel number , and the number of processor cores built - in ( single or dual core ) .
Performance - wise , they 're certainly a step above netbook processors .
On the heels of the Acer Timeline series , other PC makers have toyed with different designs :
The uses textures reminiscent of a piece of designer luggage , while both the and employ aluminum metals .
The is literally a knock - off of the Apple MacBook Air , as its razor thin frame can also slide into a manila envelope .
Other qualities like full size keyboards , HDMI - out ports , and 13 - inch widescreens also help broaden their appeal over netbooks .
Great battery life is another quality all CULV laptops can agree on .
Of course , they still need a big battery to achieve this .
Both the UL30A - A1 and the have big batteries and amassed 7 hours and 10 hours of battery life in our tests , respectively .
And all of them cost under $ 900 .
CULV laptops are meant to combine sleek , lightweight design with strong performance and long battery life .
Maybe there 's one out there with your name on it .
Check out some of the most recent models .
Featured in this Roundup :
( $ 775 street )
The UL30A - A1 is an amazing ultra - thin laptop that gives 10 hours of battery life for less than what everyone else is charging .
ASUS UL80Vt - A1 ( $ 823 Street )
The CULV - equipped ASUS UL80Vt - A1 laptop is loaded with lovable features , including switching graphics technology , a huge battery , and a metallic design .
Acer Aspire Timeline AS3810T ( $ 900 street )
An Intel CULV processor and thin metallic frame makes it one of the most battery efficient and stylish ultraportables in the business .
Lenovo IdeaPad U350 ( $ 650 direct )
Lenovo's ultra - thin ultra-low voltage IdeaPad U350 is stylish and cheap ; just do n't expect it to win any performance races .
Toshiba Satellite T135 - S1300 ( $ 600 street )
The T135 - S1300 is a well designed , inexpensive CULV laptop with which performance is its only Achilles ' Heel
MSI X340 ( 021US ) ( $ 900 Street )
The X340 is a blatant knock - off of the Macbook Air , but it does come with more ports and a removable battery
Summary :
The smears against the GPL need tracing back to their roots
FOR people ’s awareness , it seems important to alert that attacks on the GPL have risen in number .
These are not the typical attacks and they are accompanied by personal attacks , as stated earlier .
We found out that a PR agency from the United States is sending people semi-personalised press releases about a debate which seems hostile towards the GPL , based on the participants ( what ’s called a “ stacked panel ” ) .
Somehow they ended up getting my E - mail address , scooping it from somewhere and then striving to promote this nonsense , which they did .
It came from IDG ( which relies on Microsoft as a large revenue source [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] and also employs Microsoft / Apple investors as writers ) .
IDG is being mentioned in the form of InfoWorld , which also fed this to the news feeds .
It was IDG that published and spread an article which was moronic , boldly stating in the headline , “ is the GPL irrelevant ? ”
“ It was IDG that published and spread an article which was moronic , boldly stating in the headline , “ is the GPL irrelevant ? ” ” That was of course a nonsensical contention to start an article with .
The GPL is used by most Free / open source software projects and it is by far the most ubiquitous software licence in the world .
How does irrelevance come into it ?
Attacks on the GPL and anything and anyone associated with it are not news .
Black Duck — with some roots in Microsoft — was funneling in Microsoft - centered code automatically ( no filtering ) to saturate its pool and then claim a dip in GPL .
This deceptive claim is still being parroted today and also today we ’ve heard of private stories where similar anti-GPL actions were taken in Europe .
Programmers are being pressured by bosses ( maybe Microsoft - guided ) to abandon the licence , maybe because of all the FUD , some of which comes from Microsoft lawyers [ 1 , 2 ] .
Such dissemination of lies ( or myths ) about the GPL leads to further misuse and misappropriation , as expressed in the following new story :
A report published Sunday in The New York Times says Aleynikov told FBI investigators that he had inadvertently taken about 32 MB of proprietary Goldman Sachs software while taking open - source code that he said can be used freely by anyone .
Aleynikov , a high - level developer for Goldman Sachs , was arrested by the FBI on July 3 on charges of stealing computer code that automates the firm ’s high - volume trading on stock and commodities markets .
As Sam Dean puts it :
The case discussed in the post concerns a Goldman Sachs Group programmer , Sergey Aleynikov , who was arrested –by the FBI , no less–and charged with stealing computer code designed to automate Goldman Sachs ’ massive trading business .
Aleynikov ’s defense was that he was only trying to download open source software governed by the GPL .
The truth — or at least the verdict — remains to be seen , but why is it that the perception of free as " illegal " lives on ? █

Distributed Clojure Using RMI
The Java Remote Method Invocation API , or RMI is the Java way of doing remote procedure calls ( RPC ) .
Remote Method Invocation ( RMI ) facilitates object function calls between Java Virtual Machines ( JVMs ) .
JVMs can be located on separate computers , one JVM can invoke methods belonging to an object stored in another JVM .
I have been meaning to play with RMI from Clojure for a while , so I have put together a distributed " Hello , World ! " application .
A RMI application is made up of three parts ,
Remote Interface
Server
Client
Remote interface contains the methods that are exposed by the server that can be called from another JVM , and it is the only part of code that can't be written in Clojure , every method in the interface must throw RemoteException , this can't be done with gen-interface macro .
If you create your interfaces with gen- interface you will get exceptions .
package stub ; import java .
rmi .
Remote ; import java .
rmi .
RemoteException ; public interface Hello extends Remote { String sayHello ( ) throws RemoteException ; }
Our interface exposes a single function called sayHello , when called , it will return the " Hello , World ! " string .

javac Hello.java
and place it in a folder called stub , place this stub folder anywhere on your classpath .
First thing , server has to do is to start remote object registry , servers and clients locate each other using this registry mechanism .
( def rmi-registry ( java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry / createRegistry 1099 ) )
We start the RMI registry on port 1099 , if we need to programmatically stop the registry for any reason we can use the following function ,
( defn stop-rmi [ ] ( java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject /unexportObject rmi-registry true ) )
We need to create an instance of the interface we defined , containing the implementations of the functions we exposed in the interface ,
( defn hello - server [ ] ( proxy [ stub .
Hello ] [ ] ( sayHello [ ]
" Hello , World ! " ) ) )
Server needs to be registered with the RMI registry before it can be called from another JVM .
( defn register - server [ ] ( .bind ( java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry / getRegistry ) " Hello " ( java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject /exportObject ( hello - server ) 0 ) ) )
We bind the name " Hello " to our hello - server , now server is ready to accept connections , we register the server and wait for incoming connections .
( register - server )
On the client side , first we locate the registry ,
( def rmi-registry ( java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry /getRegistry " 127.0.0.1 " ) )
Replace 127.0.0.1 with the IP of the server machine if the server is on another IP .
Now that we have located the registry , we can lookup objects by name .
( let [ hello ( .lookup rmi-registry " Hello " ) ] ( println ( .sayHello hello ) ) )
Thats all the code that is needed for a distributed " Hello , World ! " .
To put it all to action , run server.clj , it will start listening for incoming connections , on the same machine or on another machine on the same network , run client.clj , you should get " Hello , World ! " returned to the client .

Ford had bad luck -- his presidency coincided with a down phase of the business cycle .
But other than Ford , the contrast between the Democrats and the old - style Republicans ( Eisenhower and Nixon ) on the one hand and the new - style Republicans on the other is quite striking .
Also worth noting is that after this recession is over we do not have a pre-2020 deficit problem -- if output grows as projected , and if congress sticks to PAYGO , both of which are very big ifs .
While the surfing spotlight has focused on Oahu's North Shore and most recently on the spectacular action at Waimea Bay , the tow - surfing chargers have been busy at Hawaii 's outer reefs and particularly at Jaws off Maui , where the waves were ... well , watch the video .
This El Niño - supercharged winter is shaping up to be one for the ages and it's nice to see Jaws , or Pe'ahi , breaking so large again after a seemingly long period of relative dormancy .
The surf was larger at Jaws than it was at Waimea Bay , which is typical during the right swell and why the Jaws crowd requires jet - powered personal watercraft to tow surfers onto fast - moving swells , and to use the vessels for rescues .
Sean Collins , chief forecaster for Surfline.com , said the swell is one of the five largest ever to slam Oahu's North Shore , comparable to El Niño - fueled episodes in 1998 and 1969 .
The extreme surf is expected to continue for several days in Hawaii and it will reach California and elsewhere on the West Coast beginning Wednesday .
In fact , several of the surfers who competed in the Quiksilver in Memory of Eddie Aikau contest on Tuesday planned to catch red-eye flights to San Francisco for the short drive to Mavericks near Half Moon Bay .
It remains to bee seen whether it 'll be too stormy to hold the Mavericks contest this week .
The greatest performances at all these locations , and many others , will become entries in the Billabong XXL Global Big - Wave Awards , a yearlong contest that ends in the spring .
Judges , this time around , will have their hands full deciding winners in several categories .
But they 're not complaining .

This week 's landmark settlement on behalf of as many as 500,000 native Americans , in which the US agreed to pay $ 3.4 billion to right a century of wrongs that cheated Indians out of the proceeds from their properties , took 13 years , countless lawyer hours , and the persistence of one Elouise Cobell .
A Blackfeet Indian who worked as a banker , Mrs. Cobell is the original plaintiff in a lawsuit that claimed the US government for generations failed to pay royalties , totaling tens of billions of dollars , for mineral and grazing leases on land it held in trust for native Americans and tribes .
The settlement falls short of what she and others say is owed native Americans , but it is nonetheless the biggest class - action Indian award ever against the government , according to Attorney General Eric Holder .
Cobell has called her suit " the largest case of fiscal mismanagement on behalf of citizens in US history . "
" Elouise represents the best in all of us .
We 're talking about a single individual from rural Browning , Montana , who took on the full power of the US government and won , " her attorney , Dennis Gingold , said in a phone interview Wednesday .
" It is a story of epic proportions , and in my 35 years as a lawyer , her demand for justice is unparalleled . "
' She never backed down '
Cobell 's pursuit of justice began during the Reagan administration , when her own audits of Indian Land Trusts turned up not only a gap in the amount of monies collected by the US Treasury but not dispersed to Indians , but also alleged sloppy bookkeeping and a corresponding cover - up .
The case proceeded through the Clinton and Bush administrations , with a federal judge proposing a $ 455 million settlement last year .
" She endured intimidation of witnesses who were afraid to testify and egregious lying noted even by a district court judge , but she never backed down , " says Mr Gingold .
" This is a lesson in perseverance for all of us . "
Cobell was often frustrated , first with the Clinton administration and then with the Bush Interior Department that managed the trust accounts , as the government sought to downplay the case as merely a bookkeeping problem .
Incredulous , US District Judge Royce Lamberth , who presided over a series of hearings , wrote scathing opinions , including one that said : " I have never seen more egregious misconduct by the federal government . "
He added : " Real justice for these Indians may still lie in the distant future ; it may never come at all .
This reality makes a statement about our society and our form of government that we should be unwilling to let stand . "
Obama spurred the parties to action
The pivot point may have been candidate Barack Obama 's campaign visit to the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana .
While there , he was symbolically adopted into the tribe by two elder members , Hartford and Mary Black Eagle , who spoke to him of the Cobell case .
After Obama became president , he instructed Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to make Cobell 's case a priority .
Mr. Salazar alluded to Mr. Obama 's sense of urgency Tuesday , in announcing the agreement .
" I heard from many in Indian Country that the Cobell suit remained a stain on the nation - to - nation relationship I value so much , " Obama said Tuesday in a statement .
He called it " an important step towards reconciliation . "
The settlement must be approved by a federal judge and Congress .
The settlement benefits native people coast to coast .
Part of the award will be distributed to individual tribal members or their heirs , and some $ 60 million will establish a fund to advance college education for native young people .
The US would spend some $ 2 billion to buy back and consolidate tribal land broken up in previous generations .
' Considerable vindication '
Cobell , now a senior citizen , is a former banker and a recipient of a coveted " Genius Award " of the MacArthur Foundation .
She said Tuesday at the announcement in Washington that she believes the royalties withheld from native people can now be applied to investment that can rebuild lives and hope .
Unfortunately , she said , thousands of defendants who awaited restitution have died , and that was a factor in the decision to push for a settlement now .
" My every sense is that this judgment probably falls far short of the true financial loss .
At the same time , this is an important moment , " says Charles Wilkinson , an expert on Indian law and senior professor at the University of Colorado - Boulder Law School .
" The award is substantial , and it shows that when Indian people organize and bring their complaints to the government they can be heard .
This is n't total justice , but there is considerable vindication here . "
" We 're obviously proud of her but we 're glad it 's over , " says Cobell 's son , Turk Cobell , who is a hospitality industry executive in Las Vegas .
" My mother is tremendously relentless when it comes to doing what she believes is right .
Maybe now she can finally enjoy a normal life again and get something she has n't had : rest . "

The recovery in the local steel industry is painstakingly slow .
The only drivers keeping the industry afloat are Eskom power station and government low - cost housing and infrastructure development spending .
Unfortunately , any hopes of a recovery in the steel industry will be diminished should the proposed electricity price increases be approved for the next three years .
South African monthly crude steel production in August fell 32,2 % year - on - year to an estimated 600 000 tons from 885 000 tons .
The production in the first nine months of 2009 was down 25,9 % to 5,16 - million tons from 6,97 - million tons for the first nine months 2008 .
( Source B.Day 26.09.2009 )
These figures clearly indicate that SA 's steel industry has gone through a considerable de-stocking exercise in 2009 .
In addition , a general lack of activity , demand and business confidence contributed further to the low production levels in 2009 .
As the year comes to an end , any hopes of increases in production or in the price of steel are dwindling fast .
Recovery in the industry will take longer that anticipated , leaving steel suppliers with limited cash resources and in extremely vulnerable positions .
The low demand for steel , combined with the low steel price and no major reductions in production costs will erode profits in many companies .
While the rest of the world 's steel production has improved since April 2009 , SA clearly lags behind by at least six to nine months .
In addressing the problem , government needs to stimulate the steel industry through infrastructure and energy spending .
Even more vital , contractors must be paid by government on time for work completed .
This would contribute to inspiring much needed confidence required to revive the steel industry .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - A U.S. human rights activist trying to raise global attention about the suffering of the North Korean people has crossed into the reclusive state , other activists and South Korean media said on Saturday .
Robert Park , 28 , speaks during an interview with Reuters in Seoul December 22 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Lee Jae-Won
There has been no comment from North Korea , which usually arrests foreign border crossers on site , or from U.S. officials .
Activists told Reuters that Robert Park , 28 , had crossed into North Korea from China on Friday , while South Korea ’s Yonhap news agency and the Kukmin Ilbo newspaper quoted activists who went with him to the border as saying he had crossed at a sparsely patrolled point near the northeast border city of Hoeryong .
Park was quoted by activists who went with the border as shouting when he went across : “ I am an American citizen .
I am bringing God ’s love .
God loves you . ”
The activists asked not to be named due to security concerns .
Park told to Reuters in Seoul earlier this week that he saw it as his duty as a Christian to make the journey and did not want the U.S. government to try to free him .
“ I do n’t want President Obama to come and pay to get me out .
But I want the North Korean people to be free , ” Park said on Wednesday before departing for China .
“ Until the concentration camps are liberated , I do not want to come out .
If I have to die with them , I will .
( For ) these innocent men , women and children , as Christians , we need to take the cross for them .
The cross means that we sacrifice our lives for the redemption of others , ” he said .
Western governments and human rights activists say North Korea maintains a network of political prisons to crush the possibility of dissent where brutality is the norm and deaths are commonplace .
The North uses unlawful and arbitrary killings and stages public executions to intimidate the masses , critics say .
They say it prevents free speech , controls all media and crushes nascent attempts at reform by executing or imprisoning those who oppose the state .
Park , a Korean - American , has joined various campaigns calling on North Korea to improve its rights record and said he would carry a message calling for leader Kim Jong - il to step down , the closure of prison camps and compensation paid to victims .
Park said he wanted to be arrested in order to pressure governments including the United States , South Korea and Japan to address the suffering of the North Korean people .
“ Through the media and through sacrifice we are looking for the global leaders to be forced to give an account .
There is no excuse , ” he said .
Earlier this year , former U.S. President Bill Clinton made a high - profile journey to North Korea to win the release of two U.S. journalists who were held by the state for about four months for suspected illegal entry .
The journalists , Euna Lee and Laura Ling , of U.S. media outlet Current TV , were arrested in March working on a story near the border between North Korea and China .
The two said they crossed into the North by accident and were taken into custody in China by North Korean guards who chased them back across the border .
A flamboyant farmworker organizer who called himself a modern - day Emiliano Zapata has been slain in a brazen ambush that also killed 14 members of his family and staff , officials said Saturday .
Prosecutors in the border state of Sonora , where the slayings occurred , said they were investigating a number of possible motives .
Sonora , like much of Mexico , has been hit by a wave of killings tied to drug - trafficking gangs .
The union leader , Margarito Montes Parra , was killed in the southern part of Sonora bordering the state of Sinaloa , a major center for the production and transport of marijuana and heroin .
The farmers whom Montes represented often find themselves trapped in the drug war , with traffickers forcing them to work illicit crops .
But Montes also had chalked up numerous enemies in tumultuous land disputes over more than two decades .
Advertisement
Montes , his wife and two children were traveling in a small convoy with at least 11 other relatives and staff members to a rural hacienda Friday afternoon when they were ambushed by several assailants armed with large - caliber weapons , investigators said .
All 15 were shot to death , they said .
Red Cross workers arrived at the scene to find bullet - riddled bodies on the side of the road .
There were reports that three people in the group had survived .
The killings sent a chill through peasant activist groups that often have a testy relationship with the Mexican government .
Several organizations joined Saturday to demand a thorough investigation “ to the final consequences ” and to ask for protection for leaders .
“ This was an attack not just against a union leader but against the work we do , ” said Norma Patino , an official with COCYP , an umbrella group of peasant and popular organizations .
“ This hurts the work of all of us . ”
Advertisement
Montes was the head of the General Popular Union of Workers and Farmers , which has tens of thousands of members .
He has led peasants and squatters in claims for vast chunks of countryside , disputes that have on occasion turned violent .
A university - educated engineer , Montes got his start in the late 1980s , and quickly rose to prominence , styling himself after Zapata , the Mexican revolutionary land reform hero , and recovering thousands of acres of property for union members .
His enemies , including major landowners , branded him a thuggish thief .
And other critics who at one time shared his goals of agrarian reform complain that Montes became the kind of rural chieftain that he had long challenged .
At the time of his death , he owned properties that included a thoroughbred horse ranch .
Montes was always aware of the wrath he inspired and the dangers that it brought .
Before Friday ’s killings , he had already lost a son and a brother to violence .

Landowners “ certainly have participated in press campaigns against me and conspired in meetings where they said they must eliminate the cancer that I represent , ” Montes told The Times in 1991 , after his brother ’s death .
“ I carry a gun because they carry a gun . ”

Below the fold is a brief guest posting by Altaira , who is employed at an NGO working on issues related to sustainable development .
She has a Masters Degree in Agricultural Science .
Previously on TheOilDrum , Altaira wrote Can the Wealthy Have a Separate Peace ?
A Shock Doctrine for Sustainability ?
My circle of friends includes many professionals in the world of environmental NGOs .
I have noticed something about the way they view the importance of their work and the likelihood of its success that I ’d like to share .
In brief , many now admit openly that human overshoot has gone way too far and that the programs they run are like band aids when the wound calls for a tourniquet .
They lament the rise of expectations for a narrowly defined version of progress that will only deepen our predicament .
It now seems undeniable that structural and psychological requirements for global economic growth have much more sway than any rhetoric about sustainability .
Although the depth of despair is greater than usual , most of these thoughts are old news .
However , a couple of new conversational memes have emerged .
First of all , my friends are turning inwards , becoming concerned about personal and family security .
Second , they are considering adopting a new strategy that plans for responses to crisis and breakdown , rather than their usual fare , which is advocating for course corrections to avoid troubles .
In these conversations , I see a parallel with what Naomi Klein discussed in her book Shock Doctrine .
http://www.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine/the-book
She documents how a particular wing of neoclassical economists , based primarily out of the University of Chicago , took advantage of disasters to push through legal , policy and business agreements that would never be accepted otherwise .
The take home message is that radical changes may only be possible during a crisis , and that in chaotic times the advantage goes to whoever has a response plan available .
I do n’t see that these discussions have made it into any official programs of the environmental movement , but perhaps they need to be .
The existing system does a great job of protecting itself and will be unlikely to change sufficiently to ahead off a crisis .
If breakdowns are now inevitable , the standard role of environmental groups may be necessary but insufficient .
Here are questions for campfire :
1 . Are you noticing similar conversations , where well - educated and generally well off people are worried about the security of very basic needs , such as food and water .
2 . Do you think a kind of “ Shock Doctrine for Sustainability ” is a good idea ?
3 . What real - world scenarios might lead to the opportunity to make major structural changes in society ?
4 . Can you outline what the elements of such a plan would look like ?
5 . Who might be able to actually make these plans and get them adopted at the right time ?
6 . Should such plans be kept largely undisclosed and un-promoted until needed ?
Gavin Newsom , mayor of San Francisco who made national headlines in 2004 when he challenged California state law by allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry , has quit the governor ’s race in California .
Newsom is withdrawing from the Democratic primary amid lackluster poll numbers and meager fund - raising receipts .
His withdrawal leaves state Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown , who is expected to run even though he has not officially entered the race , with little opposition in the Democratic primary .
“ It is with great regret I announce today that I am withdrawing from the race for governor of California , ” Newsom said in a statement .
“ With a young family and responsibilities at City Hall , I have found it impossible to commit the time required to complete this effort the way it needs to — and should be — done .
This is not an easy decision .
But it is one made with the best intentions for my wife , my daughter , the residents of the city and county of San Francisco , and California Democrats . ”
Although Newsom had been effectively running for more than a year , his campaign never gained much traction .
Even in his hometown , which Newsom touted as a model of cutting - edge policies , his candidacy was widely derided among civic insiders .
The Onkyo ND - S1 iPod dock is a new arrival to Onkyo's extensive range of Hi-Fi and AV gear , and includes some distinctive technologies of its own .
The ND - S1 is more accurately described as a ' digital media transport ' and in the manner of the Wadia 170i bypasses the digital to analogue conversion of the iPod and will output a digital signal to the DAC of your choice .
The Onkyo is in many regards an even more minimalist proposition to the Wadia , as it has no analogue audio out at all and is entirely reliant on a DAC or AV receiver to function .
This paring back of features does mean that the ND - S1 is less than half the price of the Wadia and comfortably the cheapest iPod transport on the market .
It does have some interesting additional functionality , however , including a USB input that not only allows the connected iPod to sync with a PC whilst in situ , but will also play material from the PC by converting the signal to output over optical or coaxial .
This is a boon for anybody wishing to incorporate a PC into a hi- fi system that does not have a USB DAC .
The unit feels well constructed and has some clever touches such as the dust cover for the iPod mounting and a remote link that allows it to be controlled by other Onkyo products .
The ND - S1 was tested with a latest generation iPod classic and an iPhone into the digital inputs of a Cambridge Audio 840C and an Audio Note DAC Zero .
With a variety of material ripped to AAC lossless , the ND - S1 gave a thoroughly convincing demonstration of the potential of the iPod as a digital transport .
Flicking between the CD in the transport of the 840C and the digital input , where the ND - S1 was plugged in , revealed no real difference in presentation between the two , while listening to the excellent , self - titled One eskimO album .
The ND - S1 reproduced the album with the same gorgeous sense of space and realism as the CD had and there was no sense of a softening of the bass , or lack of detail that can occur with analogue output docks even replaying AAC lossless .
Essentially , the ND - S1 only has the sonic properties of the DAC it is connected to – be that the calm detailed sonics of the 840C or the more soulful , if less accurate warmth of the Audio Note .
Equally impressive was the performance of the ND - S1 with more compressed material .
MP3s at 320 K and AAC tracks were still an entertaining listen and even smaller files were not rendered unlistenable by the Onkyo .
The ND - S1 then destroys any equivalent CD player in terms of convenience – the iPod classic will hold roughly 170 lossless albums , which can be browsed at leisure via the Onkyo remote ( and any additional albums in iTunes could be replayed via USB ) and , of course , you can then pop a pair of earphones into the iPod and keep listening on the move .
The ND - S1 also demonstrated an unusual feature in which it is capable of replaying the Spotify application on an iPhone and therefore accessing a vast collection of music held online .
The limited bit -rate is clearly apparent , but the ND - S1 demonstrates the principle of a music on - demand server admirably .
That this functionality is not achieved at the cost of sound quality and is available for £ 150 is all the more impressive .
This then , is a brilliantly thought - out and well - executed product that should appeal to many listeners , both as an addition to an existing digital setup , or for the bold , a complete replacement for a CD transport .
A Republican and Democrat have put forward legislation that would rescind the automatic pay increase lawmakers are slated to receive in 2011 .
Reps .
Harry Mitchell ( D - Ariz . ) and Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) introduced a bill late Thursday night that would freeze the automatic cost of living increase for Members in 2011 , citing the ailing economy .
“ With unemployment high and so many families struggling to make ends meet , it is unconscionable to think that Congress is considering giving itself a pay raise , ” said Mitchell in a statement .
ADVERTISEMENT
Congress froze 2010 automatic pay increase earlier this year , after more than a dozen lawmakers , including Mitchell and Paul , had put forward legislation similar to the bill introduced this week .
“ Turning down our automatic pay increase is the least Congress could do to demonstrate fiscal responsibility and solidarity with our constituents in these tough economic times , ” said Paul in a statement on Friday .
“ Much more needs to be done to reduce the size and expense of government , but passing this legislation would be a start .
” Congress has abided by a process approved in 1989 , which stipulates that lawmakers will automatically receive a cost of living pay increase every January unless members vote specifically to reject the raise – a politically precarious position .

The Marriage of Fractals and Splines
Video description :
Fractals and splines have very different geometric features .
Fractals can be continuous everywhere , yet differentiable nowhere .
Fractals are often self - similar curves with fractional dimension .
And fractals are also attractors , fixed points of iterated function systems .
In contrast , splines are piecewise polynomial curves , so well behaved that they are often used for large scale industrial design and manufacture .
Splines are essentially polynomials , so splines are one dimensional curves that are differentiable everywhere .
Splines have control points -- polynomial coefficients -- that can be used to control the shape of the spline in an intuitive fashion .
Moreover , unlike fractals , splines have parametrizations .
Nevertheless , the goal of this talk is to marry fractals and splines : to demonstrate that fractals and splines share many geometric properties and algorithms .
We shall show that just like splines , fractals can be parametrized and fractals have control points that allow us to adjust the shape of the fractal in an intuitive manner .
Moreover , just like fractals , splines are attractors , fixed points of iterated function systems .
We shall show how to apply fractal algorithms to generate splines and spline algorithms to generate fractals .
We conclude that fractals and splines are not really that different after all .

During Glenn

Apparently , either Kremer or the national organization is resisting a call for accounting from its membership .
According to a series of posting on the TPP mail list :
Date : Tues , Nov 10 2009 8:32 pm From : [ redacted ]
I sent this letter ( * certain personal information has been removed from the attached text that does not pertain to my *

The letter was sent in an effort to understand where TPP money is / has / was going .
TPP receives donations from across the Country , and know that a very large amount of money was received in Washington DC on 9/12 .
Where is it ?
How much do we have in the bank ?
What are we spending the money on ?
Where are the records ?
I believe that this is my right as someone who has supported this movement not only with my time but my money .

where is ours ?
I did not ask any hard questions and should not have been
ignored .
We have been asking our government for transparency , where is ours ? ...
Here 's a bit of the original email to TPP 's board , essentially saying , " show me the money " :
On Sun , Oct 11 , 2009 at 10:49 PM , [ redacted ] <[ redacted]@gmail.com > wrote : ... I have had questions / concerns since I got involved with TPP .
I voiced some of my concerns on September 28 on the 6 + hour call and never really got complete / good answers .
I asked the several questions about finances .
How much money does TPP have ?
How much did we make in DC ?
Where are the
financial statements ?
Do board members get paid and if so who ?
Who signs
the checks ?
Where does our money go ?
I refer to " our " because just like
the Government the money comes from the people , TPP does n't have any money .
I got a lot of " I do n't know " for answers and having worked in the corporate world for the past 35 years find this unacceptable ...
Did you know that Tea Party Patriots is a tax exempt organization ?
I wonder if the IRS will have any interest in the teabagger 's finances ?
During the genesis of any idea , whether a political idea or new product idea , it 's always about control - control of the message , the intellectual properly , and ultimately , the money .
Seems like there 's a little internal war going on .
And yes , there is more .
Basically , it comes down to an internecine fight for control of the teabagger message between the Dick Armey front group , FreedomWorks Foundation ( which started the Tea Party Express bus ) and true , grassroots activists of the Tea Party Patriots group .
Pass the popcorn - because there 's much more coming ...
Update : Just a bit more information that I forgot to include - apparently this whole thing started when Kremer used her admin privileges on teapartypatriots.com , .net , and .info to redirect to blank pages after the initial little dustup - and then , wanted to sell the domains .
Updated update : from the teabagger group list ...

Absurd , I tell you .
Absurd .
Update to the updated update : Well , well - now the story 's been picked up by HuffPo - which almost ensures that this will make KO and / or Rachel tonight ( since the story has made the trifecta of Politico , Dkos , and HuffPo ) .
Again , get the popcorn ready ...
Many have decided to counter the BLM movement with protests of their own because they believe that George Flloyd was a felon whose life was n’t as important as police officers who have been killed in the line or duty , or even other African Americans —
“ All lives matter , ” they say , in the ultimate example of missing the point entirely .
These protests that have expanded across the globe are not about one example of police brutality .
They are about all examples of police brutality , regardless of race .
Many dissenters have said that the police would leave African Americans alone if they would stop doing things wrong or start obeying police orders .
Tell that to Breonna Taylor , who was shot dead while sleeping in her own home .
Not only was she murdered by the police who invaded her home , but they also openly admitted that they had no reason to be there ( much later ) .
The United States has far more victims of police brutality than any other developed country in the world .
One might ask , “ Why is this the case ? ”
One reason is the obvious lack of training .
A few weeks at a police academy and a cursory background check , and you ’re essentially given a license to kill .
Another reason harkens back to George W. Bush .
When the United States military bought a whole bunch of equipment it did n’t need for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , it was shipped back to the United States and given to police departments across the country — whose budgets were already skyrocketing .
We gave a policing organization military equipment by the truckload .
What did we expect them to do ?
… Act timid in full body armor ?
But those are just secondary reasons .
The underlying cause of many killings is racism , pure and simple .
We kill African Americans a far disproportionate rate to Caucasians .
That ’s why defunding the police will soon be on dockets across the country , and why at least one has already been disbanded .
Yikes , this is probably one of the coolest and most frightening things I ’ve ever heard .
Just try to imagine your piano doing this at home while you ’re alone .
Instant insanity !

Why does Patriarchy separate women into ' Madonna ' and ' Whore ' ?
VIRGIN / WHORE
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH & WOMEN
CAN'T LIVE WITH 'EM , CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT 'EM
BY GREG BURK
LA WEEKLY
ILLUSTRATED BY PATRICK MARTINEZ
H eard the one about the liberated Catholic girl ?
Still pregnant , still barefoot , but she gets to wear snowshoes on Sunday .
In the USA , where many consider Hillary Clinton and Condi Rice credible presidential candidates , it may look like the battle for women 's rights has been won .
Well , the mission ain't accomplished .
Women did n't even get the vote here until 1920 , they still get paid less , and their right to govern their own bodies stands under growing threat .
Over most of the planet , women remain virtual slaves .
And the Catholic Church , though it can look like Germaine Greer Estates compared to clitoris - hacking Islamic backwaters , has been a steady manufacturer of the shackles .
Pity the pope ?
It 's tempting - you never saw a garbage man with arms as trash - encumbered as Benedict XVI 's .
Catholic Church membership : down heavily in Western Europe and the Americas .
Clergy : dwindling to less than a skeleton crew .
Mood : sour .
Pope John XXIII 's Vatican II Ecumenical Council of the 1960s , hyped at the time as a window on revitalization , looks like a fake - out now that successive pontiffs have retreated behind ancient bulwarks of dogma and mysticism .
Most of the faithful worldwide , grappling against real - world pitchforks of overpopulation , tribalism , political chaos and economic collapse , are giving the big finger to Rome 's medieval pronouncements on birth control .
And you might 've heard a word or two about priests and boys - kind of a pain in the ass , not to mention the wallet .
The Holy Father 's even under legal assault for molester shielding .
Pity the pope .
Or , what the hell , piss on the pope .
Especially if you 're a woman .
The Catholic Church , the world 's largest non-governmental property owner , is also the world 's most entrenched patriarchy .
Among the articles of faith set down in its 800 - page catechism lie the much - contested tenets that a woman may not be ordained as a priest , and that couples may not practice any form of mechanical or chemical contraception .
Not only do women get left holding the baby , but it 's the church 's official position that use of condoms is forbidden even when a husband is HIV - positive .
And the person most visibly responsible for holding the line during the last 24 years , as Pope John Paul II 's chief monitor of dogma and as the chairman of the aforementioned catechism 's compiling committee , is Joseph Ratzinger , a Bavarian priest we now call Benedict .
Gender issues are hardly the only gripe that 's caused millions worldwide to flee screaming from Roman Catholicism ; lots of people just are n't locating much God of Love in it .
But women , who 've always ( always ) been the primary keepers of the religious flame , have led the stampede .
In Los Angeles , many come from immigrant communities ; you 'll hear from some of them in the accompanying interviews ( " Women Talk About Why They Left " ) .
And in another sidebar , Weekly music editor Kate Sullivan remembers her time in a Catholic girls ' school during an era of feminist - inspired upheaval .
Why is the Catholic Church nailed to the image of women as separate and unequal ?
When Ratzinger took the steering wheel , I started thinking about that .
And I came to believe the church is a prisoner of its own history , of its own traditions , and even of the unacknowledged myths from which it sprang .
It 's not like there has n't been progress .
When I was a pimply altar boy in the early ' 60s , I scraped my fingers raw in preparation for Palm Sunday , cutting up the palm fronds that would be displayed and distributed to commemorate Christ 's triumphal donkey ride into Jerusalem .
I helped Father Willenborg haul the stiff , dry foliage over to the ugly modern church , where an old woman was reverently depositing flower arrangements by the altar rail .
Why , I asked the pastor , did n't she just put the posies up by the tabernacle , where they belonged ?
Well , he said , women were n't allowed on the altar .
( That 's changed ; there have even been female Mass servers since 1994 . )
He never quite got around to explaining .
I remember kneeling for daily Mass in seventh grade at St. Leo's School .
I would jockey into the row behind lovely Sue Bortoluzzi and meditate on the downy back of her neck below her bobbed hair , which was surmounted by a mysterious white doily .
The doily was a relic of the days when women , as brides of Christ , had to wear veils in church .
Boys and men , as always , could bare their Brylcreemed locks to God.
Today , American women can go either way .
Covering heads is an outward sign for placing women at a comfortable distance - which makes sense if you want to reinforce a male hierarchy whose priests have taken a vow of chastity .
Funny :
When it comes to sexual and marital conduct , the celibate clergy are the ones stuck with the job of expounding the church 's rules .
And the head cleric , Joseph Ratzinger , is a special case - chosen , perversely it seems , for his lack of such qualifications .
ASTARTE
BRAZEN HUSSY
Ratzinger was born on Holy Saturday , the weighty day of prayer and renewal that sets the stage for Easter , Christianity 's defining feast .
His parents happened to be named Mary and Joseph - the one a woman considered too frail to be consulted about a family household move ( " We did not want to make her needlessly anxious " ) , the other . . . a cop .
Small , unathletic and unhealthy , young Joe Jr. was first drawn to the things of Catholic ritual - the icons , the vestments and especially the books .
Having determined early to be a priest , he progressed rapidly in his studies and writing , barely slowing for his mandatory stint in Hitler 's armed forces , where his job was to help shoot down the Allied aircraft that were closing in on the German homeland at the end of World War II .
His peculiar scholarly talent was analyzing and synthesizing the arcana of church theologians , especially the monumental thinker St. Augustine , and he ripped through the world of academia , landing position after position at Germany 's best universities ;
Paul VI named him both archbishop of Munich and cardinal in 1977 , when he was just 50 .
As a dogma enforcer , Ratzinger bent an attentive ear to revisionists , to anti-authoritarians , to liberation theologians who wanted to fuse the ideals of Christ with those of Che .
Then he quietly told them to shut up or ship out .
Some chose the latter .
Though he had been a booster of and participant in Vatican II , and rendered the council favorable lip service through the years , he came to view liberalization as a menace to the church 's identity .
He even said that the hemorrhaging of Catholic membership was largely Vatican II 's fault .
Attitudes like that won him friends in Rome - particularly a certain charismatic Polish gentleman who longed for the days of abundant saints and frequent miracles .
Books and boardrooms have been Ratzinger 's universe .
Aside from a year as an assistant pastor immediately after his ordination , he has never sniffed the daily sweat of the masses .
What he knows about women is pretty much what he knows about his mother and his sister .
About other things , however , Ratzinger knows a lot .
I ate up his Salt of the Earth , the '90s apologia published in response to widespread growling over his intractability as doctrinal hellhound .
The format is key : Interviewer Peter Seewald plays devil 's advocate as a kind of inquisitorial Randy Johnson , serving up a steady succession of blazing fastballs , never curves or knucklers .
( " The Cross - a ghastly symbol ? " )
And Ratzinger not only gets his bat on the ball most of the time , he hits quite a few line drives .
Having been out of the papist loop for a few decades , I was refreshed by the realization that Catholicism is not entirely an exercise in willful absurdity and magickal unrealism .
Ratzinger 's knack for theology , obviously , is boggling - not only does he know his Jerome and Aquinas , but he's hot to cross-reference them in the secular realm with Heidegger and Marx .
Through his meetings with regional bishops , he 's gleaned solid clues about why Catholics all over the world , from fundamentalist Africans to self - indulgent Americans , are going nuts .
He confesses to the reality that the church is a stodgy bureaucracy and a rotten communicator .
Though his quiet dogmatism can come off as arrogance , Ratzinger is a likable uncle ( if not papa ) who describes himself as " God 's donkey " - not the creator of doctrine , but the animal who carries it around .
His obsession with history gives him a perspective on the church as an institution built by the careful ponderings of smart people over two millennia .
If its clockwork seems rusty to us , it may be only because we 're too wrapped up in our present tensions and can't discern the slow hand of God 's revelation at work .
Ratzinger 's beliefs have a lot to do with the partnership of deity and humanity ; his faith is founded on more than simple bolts from the sky .
Regardless of whether you agree with him , you can't say he 's a dumb-ass .
But when the subject is women , Ratzinger flops around like a beached shark .
Saving the worst for nearly last , Salt of the Earth gets extremely dodgy on gender questions ; Ratzinger 's logical acrobatics are a marvel to observe .
He assumes that the demand for women 's ordination is a grab for some kind of illusory " power " rather than a simple request for equality .
He quotes the Catholic feminist Elisabeth Schussler - Fiorenza as ultimately rejecting the idea because , " Ordination is subordination , and that 's exactly what we do n't want . "
Should contraception be permitted to lighten the burden of caring for children you can't support ?
As with his stance on prolonging the lives of the moribund , he thinks people underappreciate the value of suffering , which can be , as parenthood always is in his view , a divine gift .
Can be .
But I started to wonder if I should abstain from SPF - 40 so I might offer up my sunburn for the glory of God .
Unfortunately , unlike one 's nth starving and diseased child , the sunburn itself can't suffer along .
Does Ratzinger himself struggle to believe some of this ?
You get the sense that maybe he does .
But he feels it 's his duty to believe it .
And yours .
With popes making the ultimate decisions , popes being elected by cardinals from among their own number , and cardinals being appointed by conservative popes , the Roman viewpoint is not likely to change much prior to the refrigeration of Hades .
Ratzinger sees Catholic belief as bound up in the history of the church .
And history does n't change .
To think that rigidly , though , you have to embrace a pretty selective view of history - a viewpoint that , for instance , marks time from Christ 's birth .
The funny thing is that history itself has changed the church .
Changed it a lot .
ARTEMIS OF EPHESUS
PAM ANDERSON GOT NOTHIN ' ON THIS GODDESS
I do n't know exactly why I needed to visit Ephesus a few years ago , but history had something to do with it .
My wife , our kid and I were going on vacation to Turkey ; obviously we had to hit Istanbul ( Constantinople , Christianity 's first earthly throne ) , and we had time for one more stop .
I 'm a sucker for ruins , of which Ephesus possessed great gleaming piles , Roman and Greek .
I was jazzed .
But I was n't prepared for the Artemis of Ephesus .
I got up early and took a cab from the dingy beach town of Kusadasi into the little municipality of Selçuk , which , compared to the ruins I 'd seen the previous day at adjacent Efes , came off as something like , say , Indio .
I wanted to visit the archaeological museum ; my family wanted to sleep .
The driver dropped me off and said he'd wash his car while he waited for me .
In this land of little water , he washed it twice daily .
Inside the cool marbled halls , I was the only patron .
There was a whole room dedicated to gladiators , including skeletons that showed exactly what stabbings and smashings had killed them .
There was a frieze of Odysseus gouging out Polyphemus ' eye .
There were images of the jolly god Bes , with his everlasting boner .
My favorite , though , was the Goddess in her multifarious forms - this was the Giver of Life .
Little clay pregnant figures called back to an age 8,000 years ago when humans first sought a transcendence they could touch .
A representation of the Phrygian goddess Cybele ( known elsewhere as Ishtar , Isis , Astarte , Anat , Inanna ) displayed above her head the horns of the crescent moon , which were also the horns of the Cretan Minotaur , the horns of the bull that raped Europa , the horns that Christians made into the horns of Satan on one hand and the pedestal of the Virgin of Guadalupe on the other .
This moon goddess , ruler of the menstrual cycle , " mother of the gods , " drove her lover mad ; he castrated himself and died , but arose from the earth again each spring .
At Cybele 's feasts , which were consecrated with ritual prostitution , frenzied young gallants would unman themselves with sacred swords .
Too much myth for a mind to contain .
But then I walked around a corner , and the Artemis of Ephesus appeared .
Her largest and newest statue , dating from the Roman period of around A.D. 150 but untypical of Western art , was half again as tall as a woman of flesh .
A necklace represented the crescent moon .
A pillared temple crowned her head .
Her dress was adorned with all the earth 's animals , of which , as hunter , she was mistress .
Most mysterious was her chest , which sprouted three rows of . . . breasts ?
eggs ? moons ?
mushrooms ?
bull testicles ?
In any case , the fertility symbolism was unmistakable .
She was the Greco - Roman Artemis , and she was the Ionian Cybele .
She was the moon and the womb , the virgin and the whore .
The Lydians , the Persians , the Greeks and the Romans came and went , but the Mother Goddess , in one form or another , always stuck around .
ISIS
THE ORIGINAL MADONNA
Now , Ephesus has a significant history .
As a mosquito - ridden seaport at the mouth of the river Cayster , it was a mixing bowl for cultures from all over the Mediterranean and points east - something like Los Angeles .
Every modern tourist sees the engraved sign that once guided sailors to the local brothel , located near both the Temple of Artemis and the library .
Ephesus competed early in the philosophy sweepstakes of the fifth century B.C. via its own pre-Socratic heavy hitter , Heraclitus , the flux champ who said you can't step into the same river twice .
( The Cayster ended up mocking him by silting up into swampland ; you could step into its motionless waters repeatedly , no problem . )
St. Paul , recognizing the city 's particular challenges , had his work cut out for him there ; he wrangled for two years with the local goddess cults and eventually got tossed in the slammer .
Ephesus also owns an especially wonderful Christian legend , which holds that the apostle John brought Mary , Jesus ' mother , to live there after the Crucifixion .
Busloads of pious tourists ( who have included Popes John Paul I and II ) still visit Mary 's house daily .
Think about it : Mary , another virgin ( Artemis ) and " mother of God " ( Cybele ) , the main target of Protestant complaints about Catholic idolatry , was installed as a pagan - friendly icon in the most literal way , at the capital of goddess worship .
She became nothing more than the latest mask of Cybele .
The Goddess Mary has long been hiding in plain sight .
Martin Luther recognized her , but many today still do n't .
In the bust - out 2003 bestseller The Da Vinci Code , for instance , novelist Dan Brown 's characters endlessly analyzed the Catholic Church 's suppression of the primeval " sacred feminine , " airing every crackpot conspiracy theory about the " hidden " role of Mary Magdalene .
Meanwhile , Brown completely ignored that other Mary , the Mom o' God .
The truth is that the Church did n't suppress the sacred feminine , it embraced the Goddess , along with the patriarchal system that sanctified and objectified her .
Brown was right about one thing , though : Real women got the shaft - or the blade , if you will .
Goddesses are so much easier to deal with .
Typical : Christianity has always taken the world as it is .
Jesus told the Pharisees to pay their taxes ( " Render unto Caesar . . . " ) , and Paul exhorted Christians to obey authorities , who are " appointed by God . "
There 's no percentage , as the slaughtered and dispersed Jews learned , in fighting the power .
Accommodation , though , can run you into some dark , dark alleys .
And along the way , women as a gender have gotten raped .
There 's always been extreme tension between the church 's veneration of the fair sex as saints and martyrs ( virgins ) and its suspicion of them as unruly agents of the Tempter ( whores ) .
It all starts with Eve , of course .
For moderns , it 's hard to believe that this primordial myth of snake and tree , already inconceivably old when it was incorporated into the Hebrew tradition some three millennia ago , has been taken as literal justification whenever men thought the bitches needed a whippin ' .
Periodically , women have indeed gotten uppity .
In the biblical Deborah , Jael and Judith , we hear echoes of women who could act as judges , commanders , prophets and killers in service to their God and tribe - roles that receded into the background once Judea 's lawmakers closed ranks after the Babylonian exile and centered religious identity on the custom of circumcision .
( Women were often the source of undesirable racial admixture , anyway .
At least they can be thankful that the bris is one religious rite they were n't privileged to enjoy . )
From earliest Christian times , Jesus ' inner circle contained females ; he even communed with prostitutes .
The fact that all his apostles were male looks less like discrimination than like a recognition of which gender , in those heavily patriarchal times , would be accepted as a gospel authority .
A number of St. Paul 's auxiliaries were women ; in the century or so before a firm church hierarchy was established , some women led services and acted in much the same capacities as men .
Then women got sucked into the propellers of Christianity 's success .
Success , in this case , actually meant the young religion was devoured and digested by the mammoth Roman Empire .
After the Roman - instigated martyrdoms of early Christian women such as Perpetua and Blandina , it was another woman , Helena , the mother of the Emperor Constantine , who brought empire and Messiah together .
The process involved a little compromise .
Before converting to Helena 's religion , and before winning his crucial battle over Maxentius to become emperor under the sign of the cross in A.D. 312 , Constantine was a devotee of Mithraism , an Eastern monotheistic sun religion .
Its main symbol was an astrological circle segmented by a cross ; the birth of its deity was celebrated on December 25 .
Well established among the military , Mithraism excluded women .
Its primary ritual , like Cybele 's , involved the slaying of a bull .
It was n't much of a stretch for Constantine to adopt Christianity , and his mother reinforced the cross as a symbol by searching out and " recovering " the original lumber in Jerusalem .
Christianity could have gone a lot of different ways after Constantine made it the state religion .
But the way it went after the emperor ( not the bishops ) convened the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325 was toward ancient patriarchy , toward a stratification like that of the Roman legions , toward the burning of Christian writings that contradicted the new Creed , and toward the slaughter of thousands of freshly delineated heretics .
Every tribe and religion marks its boundaries , determining the signs and beliefs that separate it from its neighbors - who are not generally perceived as people to love as thyself .
In primitive times , that process was a path to survival .
The question in the case of Christianity is :
What exactly was it that survived ?
GODDESS OF CRETE
WOMAN GOT A THING FOR SNAKES
To mark the turnings in the road that affected women , you could n't do better than to consult Elaine Pagels ' Adam , Eve and the Serpent , where the pronouncements of influential early Christian thinkers speak for themselves .
The church father Tertullian asked of his " sisters in Christ , " shortly after A.D. 200 : " Do you not know that every one of you is an Eve ?
The sentence of God on your sex lives on in this age . "
Toward the close of the Roman Empire , St. Augustine , a sex addict in his youth , excused his obsession by inventing the amazing doctrine of original sin , which postulates that the transgression of Adam and Eve - imaginatively transformed by the great African bishop into a sexual offense - has infected us all with an irresistible penchant for wrongdoing , especially lust , that no man can conquer without the grace of God .
Some women , in fact , were glad to go along with the idea of divorcing themselves from sex ; chastity was attractive to wives and slaves whose previous condition closely resembled whoredom .
Authorities at the time of Constantine , though , felt they might be dealing with an undesirable mass movement .
It was all right for men to obey Christ 's dictum to leave everything and follow him , but women . . . ?
What would happen to existing families ?
Where would future Christian babies come from ?
Would n't the whole fabric of ( Roman ) society be at risk ?
From Constantine to Hitler , Christianity has found ways to tolerate ( if not necessarily encourage ) tyranny , imperialism , slavery and prostitution .
Female emancipation was not high on the agenda .
According to St. Paul ( not Jesus , whom Paul never met ) , woman was made from man 's rib for man 's use ( 1 Corinthians 11:9 ) .
And Nicaea 's power elite felt strongly enough about this natural order of things that they reinforced it by putting further words in Paul 's mouth , incorporating into the sacrosanct Word of God a spurious epistle that had been circulating for more than 100 years ( significantly addressed to the goddess - loving Ephesians ) that opined , " Wives should be submissive to their husbands as if to the Lord " ( 5:22 ) .
Even more dubious inclusions in the New Testament canon were " Paul's " Epistles to " Timothy , " who in real life was Paul 's main delegate to - you guessed it - dread Ephesus .
One passage ( 1 Timothy 2:11 - 15 ) reads so little like Paul ( or Jesus ) and so much like Andrew Dice Clay that it 's worth quoting in full :
" A woman must listen in silence and be completely submissive .
I do not permit a woman to act as a teacher , or in any way to have authority over a man ; she must be quiet .
For Adam was created first , Eve afterward ; moreover , it was not Adam who was deceived but the woman .
It was she who was led astray and fell into sin .
She will be saved by childbearing , provided she continues in faith and love and holiness - her chastity being taken for granted . "
Christianity had already done a lot of assimilating by the time Constantine came around ; Nicaea just codified the strains of power that were most conducive to what would become , forevermore and truly , Roman Catholicism , though Rome was now ruled from Constantinople .
That meant the church would be keeper of the ancient world 's superstitions about women - as childlike , capricious creatures who nevertheless represented the underworld and the night , who possessed fearful seductive powers , and whose menses , used properly , could either cure or kill .
( In Byzantine Christianity , menstruating women were excluded from the Eucharist . )
The die was cast .
History was made , and it would be maintained .
The Roman Empire fell , but the church carried on , providing a bridge over which Ostrogoths and Franks could march to gain faint union with the far more advanced civilization they supplanted .
Popes fought heresies , fought schism , fought kings ( or joined them ) , fought corruption , fought reform .
Women - sorry , Joan - stayed where they were .
With Vatican II , the door creaked open a crack .
In response to feminist pressure and the revolution brought on by the Pill , the council ordered the formation of the Papal Birth Control Commission , whose deliberations concluded in 1966 .
Up to that point , the only form of contraception the church considered acceptable was the remarkably unspontaneous and unnatural rhythm method ( intercourse when the woman is n't ovulating ) .
After hearing an avalanche of testimony from frustrated congregants and physicians , the commission voted 52 - 4 to recommend that artificial contraception be permitted .
That 's when the thumbscrews started turning .
The church 's strong remnant of conservative cardinals got Paul VI in the backroom , leaned on him and broke him .
Far from ratifying the findings of the commission he 'd appointed , in 1968 the pope lashed out with Humanae Vitae , an encyclical that slammed the gate on birth - control reform .
Thenceforward the rule would be , as Monty Python so eloquently sang , " Every sperm is sacred / Every sperm is great / If a sperm is wasted / God gets quite irate . "
In the mid-'90s , a lengthy attempt to bring inclusive language into the church 's liturgy - substituting " people " for " man , " for example - met with general approval among English - speaking bishops .
Then Cardinal Ratzinger appointed his own 11 - member supervising commission , which featured no scriptural scholars and two parties whose native language was not English .
Most of the more significant changes were quashed .
Worst :
In 1995 , John Paul II issued the apostolic letter Ordinatio Sacerdotalis , in which he made it crystal clear that the church could not ordain women as priests , end of discussion .
One admirer liked the message so much that , though the letter was n't intended as an infallible papal pronouncement on a matter of faith and morals , he tried to get it designated as such - essentially unchallengeable for all time .
The eager advocate : Joe Ratzinger .
Ratzinger likes to take the long view from behind the dark , inquisitorial eyes he inherited from his dad , the constable .
He 's comfortable with the idea of " the truth " - the one truth , actually - and feels he 's got it pretty well sewed up .
No ego thing , it 's just that Christians / Catholicshave been after the truth for a couple of millennia , aided by God 's small but bright flashlight .
And if they have n't found it . . . well , you can't allow suspicions like that to loiter in your brain .
So : Women have their place and should stay there ; this whole feminism thing may be just a bump in the road .
Sex is for procreation - do n't have too much fun , okay ?
And you 're not here to be happy , you 're here to serve God .
So quit whining .
See you in heaven .
And reason ?
Well , that has its place , too .
If the subject is evolution , it 's all right to admit , as John Paul II did , that the creation account in Genesis might not be a literal blow - by - blow .
On the other hand , women 's subservient position as suggested in Genesis - pure dogma .
If that seems like a contradiction , it 's only because , as a single feeble human being , you can't understand how God reveals truth .
It 's a mystery .
Ask Ratzinger , and he 'll tell you that centuries of scriptural interpretation actually carry more weight than the scripture itself .
And the ever - heavier burden requires a succession of good , strong donkeys .
Keep in mind one other thing about women that may be in the back of Ratzinger 's mind .
The priestly sex scandals bring new perspective to the idea of ordaining women .
Though some male priests ' misdeeds have ultimately come to light , and the damage has been considerable , we always figured that a lot of them fooled around - and not just with boys .
If celibate women were in the pulpit , and no contraception were permitted , the priests ' little secret would fly straight out the stained - glass window .
The swelling physical results of sin , no matter how loose the cassock , would be there for everyone to see .
My family went to Rome last year .
I could n't help it , I guess - old stuff called .
This was where they threw the Christians to the lions .
This was where Peter and Paul are supposed to have been martyred .
And this was the seat of some 500 popes .
We stood in Vatican City inside St. Peter 's Basilica , built atop the foundations of Constantine 's original edifice - the first big church Christianity could afford .
Behold : If God 's magnificence can be expressed in gold , then St. Peter 's shows Him to be a glorious Deity indeed .
Every pillar , arch , altar railing and picture frame drips with gold foliage .
The paintings and statues , of course , from Raphael 's to Bernini's , represent the best the Renaissance could offer .
Michelangelo's
Pietà , the sculpture that depicts so movingly the resigned anguish of a woman mourning over her dead son , sits quiet in its niche before a stream of pilgrims , who this day included the queen of Belgium .
The decorum of my wife , named Deborah after the Old Testament judge , suffered somewhat in comparison to the queen's .
She 'd sneaked past the monitors , really , in shorts , bare - shouldered and bare - headed , her tangle of hair sticking out every which way .
Of Jewish descent , an attorney for non-mainstream religions and a mace - wielding atheist , she was the kind of person who , 500 years ago , would have been dragged off to the dungeon and clapped in irons .
My knobby knees were sticking out from under tourist shorts , too , but I had a gender dispensation .
An elderly nun , draped in an impressive all - black habit , justifiable fury stamped on what we could see of her face , approached Deborah and hissed disapproval at the exposed body parts .
For the rest of our visit , as we observed Alexander VII 's sculpture of Death , the chapel of St. Petronilla ( according to legend , the first pope had a daughter ) and the rows of pontiffs encoffined in the vault below , Deborah wore a Mao hat on her head and a sweatshirt around her legs , while clamping a baseball cap on each shoulder .
She was not happy .
But happiness is for the life beyond .
Many ardent fans of Mahatma Gandhi have won the Nobel Peace Prize with the latest being US President Barack Obama , but why was not the ‘ Apostle of Peace ’ bestowed with the honour despite being nominated five times ?
Though he was shortlisted thrice , the selection committees had given different reasons why Gandhi was not conferred the honour , like “ he was too much of an Indian nationalist ” and that he was “ frequently a Christ , but then , suddenly an ordinary politician “ .
One of the committees was also of the view that he was “ no real politician or proponent of international law , not primarily a humanitarian relief worker and not an organiser of international peace Congress “ .
Gandhi , who showed the world that anything can be achieved through ‘ Satyagrah ’ ( passive resistance ) and non-violence , was nominated for the award in 1937 , 1938 , 1939 , 1947 and finally a few days before he was martyred in January 1948 .
When Gandhi was first nominated in 1937 , the selection committee ’s adviser Prof Jacob Worm - Muller was critical about him .
“ He is undoubtedly a good , noble and ascetic person -- a prominent man who is deservedly honoured and loved by masses .
“ There are sharp turns in his policies which can hardly be satisfactorily explained by his followers ... He is a freedom fighter and a dictator , an idealist and a nationalist .
He is frequently a Christ , but then , suddenly an ordinary politician , ” he had commented , according to the Nobel Foundation .
Worm - Muller also referred to Gandhi ’s critics in the international peace movement and maintained that he was not “ consistently pacifist ” and that he should have known that some of his non-violent campaigns towards the British would degenerate into violence and terror .
He was referring to Non-Cooperation movement in 1920 - 1921 when a crowd in Chauri Chaura attacked a police station , killed many of the policemen and then set fire to the police station .
Worm - Muller was also of the view that Gandhi was too much of an Indian nationalist .
“ One might say that it is significant that his well - known struggle in South Africa was on behalf of the Indians only , and not of the blacks whose living conditions were even worse , ” he said in his report to the selection panel .
Though Gandhi was nominated for the Prize in 1938 and 1939 , he made it to the shortlist for the second time only in 1947 after India gained independence .
Freedom fighters Govind Vallab Pant and B G Kher were among those who nominated him .
The then Nobel Committee Advisor Jens Arup Seip ’s report was not as critical as that of Worm - Muller but panel chairman Gunnar Jahn wrote in his diary : “ While it is true that he ( Gandhi ) is the greatest personality among the nominees -- plenty of good things could be said about him -- we should remember that he is not only an apostle for peace ; he is first and foremost a patriot .
“ Moreover , we have to bear in mind that Gandhi is not naive .
He is an excellent jurist and a lawyer , ” Jahn said .

PARIS : A court yesterday convicted the French branch of the Church of Scientology of organised fraud .
The Scientology Celebrity Centre and a related bookshop in Paris were fined a total of € 650,000 ( $ 1 million ) .
The court did not restrict the church 's activities in France .
Spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology Danielle Gounord speaks to the media after the hearing .

'' No one recruited or sold for their own benefit , it was all for the organisation , '' said Judge Sophie - Helene Chateau .
'' It is more expedient to punish with a large fine and by alerting future members with widespread publication of the ruling . ''
The case stemmed from complaints by two women that the church harassed them to buy products including vitamins and enrol in classes .
An investigating judge sent the group to trial against the recommendations of the Paris prosecutor .

Matthew Trivia Question :
Matthew 12
Jesus 's disciples pluck grain on the sabbath
12:1
At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn ; and his disciples were an hungred , and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat .
Jesus 's disciples were hungry on the Sabbath .
So they plucked and ate some grain .
12:2 But when the Pharisees saw it , they said unto him , Behold , thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day .
Your disciples are breaking the sabbath .
When the Pharisees saw it , they said to Jesus ,
12:3
But he said unto them , Have ye not read what David did , when he was an hungred , and they that were with him ; 12:4
How he entered into the house of God , and did eat the shewbread , which was not lawful for him to eat , neither for them which were with him , but only for the priests ?
Have n't you read what David did when he and his men were hungry ? [ 1 ]
He entered the house of God and ate the bread that only priests are supposed to eat .
Jesus said to them ,
12:5
Or have ye not read in the law , how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath , and are blameless ?
Have n't you read in the law that priests may profane the sabbath .
12:6 But I say unto you ,
That in this place is one greater than the temple .
Well , this place has a person who is greater than the temple .
( Me . )
12:7 But if ye had known what this meaneth , I will have mercy , and not sacrifice , ye would not have condemned the guiltless .
If you knew what this means , " I will have mercy and not sacrifice " [ 2 ] , you would n't condemn the innocent .
12:8 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day .
Because the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath . [ 3 ]
Jesus heals a man with a withered hand
12:9
And when he was departed thence , he went into their synagogue : 12:10 And , behold , there was a man which had his hand withered .
And they asked him , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days ?
that they might accuse him .
Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath ?
Next Jesus then went to their synagogue and saw a man with a withered hand .
The Pharisees asked Jesus ,
12:11 And he said unto them , What man shall there be among you , that shall have one sheep , and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day , will he not lay hold on it , and lift it out ?
If a sheep that falls into a pit on the sabbath day , would you lift it out ?
Jesus answered ,
12:12 How much then is a man better than a sheep ?
Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days .
Well , a man is better than a sheep .
Therefore , it is lawful to do good on sabbath days .
12:13 Then saith he to the man , Stretch forth thine hand .
And he stretched it forth ; and it was restored whole , like as the other .
12:14 Then the Pharisees went out , and held a council against him , how they might destroy him .
Hold out your hand .
Jesus then said to the man ,
And the man held it out , and it was healed .
Then the Pharisees held a council to plot how they could destroy him .
Jesus claims to be God 's chosen servant
12:15-21 12:15-21
12:15 But when Jesus knew it , he withdrew himself from thence : and great multitudes followed him , and he healed them all ; 12:16 And charged them that they should not make him known : 12:17 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet , saying , 12:18 Behold my servant , whom I have chosen ; my beloved , in whom my soul is well pleased : I will put my spirit upon him , and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles .
Jesus left , since he knew what they were up to .
A great crowd followed him , and he healed them all .
Jesus told them not to tell anyone [ 4 ] to fulfill the words of Isaiah [ 5 ] , saying , Look at my chosen servant , my beloved , in whom I am well pleased .
I 'll put my spirit on him , and he will show judgment to the Gentiles .
12:19 He shall not strive , nor cry ; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets .
He wo n't strive or cry ; no one will hear his voice in the streets .
12:20 A bruised reed shall he not break , and smoking flax shall he not quench , till he send forth judgment unto victory .
He wo n't break a bruised reed or quench smoking flax , until he judges in victory , .
12:21 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust .
And the Gentiles will trust in his name .
Jesus heals a man possessed with a devil , and makes a little speech
12:22 Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil , blind , and dumb : and he healed him , insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw .
Then they brought to Jesus a man possessed with a devil , who could neither see nor speak .
And Jesus healed him . [ 6 ]
12:23 And all the people were amazed , and said , Is not this the son of David ?
Is n't this the son of David ?
Everyone was amazed , and said ,
12:24 But when the Pharisees heard it , they said , This fellow doth not cast out devils , but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils .
This man casts out devils through the power of Beelzebub , the prince of devils . [ 7 ]
When the Pharisees heard about it , they said ,
12:25 And Jesus knew their thoughts , and said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand :
A kingdom or city divided against itself will not stand .
Jesus read their thoughts , and said to them ,
12:26 And if Satan cast out Satan , he is divided against himself ; how shall then his kingdom stand ?
If Satan casts out Satan , he is divided against himself and his kingdom will fall .
12:27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your children cast them out ?
therefore they shall be your judges .
And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do you and your followers cast them out ?
12:28 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God is come unto you .
12:29
Or else how can one enter into a strong man 's house , and spoil his goods , except he first bind the strong man ?
and then he will spoil his house .
But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God is upon you .
12:30 He that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad .
Whoever is not with me is against me . [ 8 ]
And whoever does n't gather with me , scatters .
12:31 Wherefore I say unto you ,
All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men : but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men .
Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven -- except for blasphemy against the Holy Ghost , which will never be forgiven .
12:32 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this world , neither in the world to come .
Whoever speaks against the Son of man will be forgiven .
But whoever speaks against the Holy Ghost , will never be forgiven , not in this world or the world to come . [ 9 ]
12:33 Either make the tree good , and his fruit good ; or else make the tree corrupt , and his fruit corrupt : for the tree is known by his fruit .
Either make the tree good , and the fruit good ; or make the tree bad , and the fruit bad .
A tree is known by its fruit .
12:34 O generation of vipers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ?
for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh .
12:35 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things : and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things .
You generation of vipers ! [ 10 ]
How can you , being evil , speak good things ?
12:36 But I say unto you ,
That every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment .
Every idle word that people speak will be used against them on the day of judgment .
12:37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified , and by thy words thou shalt be condemned .
For by your words you will be either justified or condemned . [ 11 ]
12:38 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered , saying , Master , we would see a sign from thee .
Master , could you give us a sign .
Some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Jesus ,
12:39
But he answered and said unto them , An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given to it , but the sign of the prophet Jonas :
An evil generation and adulterous generation asks for a sign . [ 12 ]
You 'll get no sign , except for the sign of Jonah .
Jesus answered ,
12:40 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale 's belly ; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
For as Jonah lived three days and three nights in the whale 's belly , so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth . [ 13 ]
12:41 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : because they repented at the preaching of Jonas ; and , behold , a greater than Jonas is here .
The men of Nineveh will condemn this generation , because they repented at Jonah 's preaching .
And someone greater than Jonah is here .
( Me . )
12:42 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and , behold , a greater than Solomon is here .
And the queen of the south will condemn this generation [ 14 ] , because she heard the wisdom of Solomon .
And someone greater than Solomon is here . ( Me . ) [ 15 ]
12:43 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest , and findeth none .
12:44 Then he saith , I will return into my house from whence I came out ; and when he is come , he findeth it empty , swept , and garnished .
12:45 Then goeth he , and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation .
When an unclean spirit goes out of a man [ 16 ] , he walks around looking for another body to inhabit .
When he does n't find any , he says to himself , I guess I 'll just go back to the body I left .
But when he gets back into that body , he finds it empty , clean , and swept .
So he finds seven other spirits even more wicked than himself , and they enter that body and live there .
And the last state of the man is worse than the first .
That is the way it 'll be for this wicked generation , .
12:46 While he yet talked to the people , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , desiring to speak with him .
While Jesus was busy talking , his mother and brothers came by and wanted to talk with him .
12:47 Then one said unto him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to speak with thee .
Your mother and brothers would like to talk to you .
So someone said to Jesus ,
12:48 But he answered and said unto him that told him , Who is my mother ?
and who are my brethren ?
Who is my mother ?
And who are my brothers ? [ 17 ]
Jesus said ,
12:49 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples , and said , Behold my mother and my brethren !
These are my mother and brothers .
He then stretched out his hand toward his disciples and said ,
12:50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother .

Although they ’re a little bit off the usual topics here , two items in today ’s New York Times caught my attention .
First , there ’s an article by Rod Norland on the use of dowsing rods ( !!!! ) by Iraqi police and military to detect explosives .
The Iraqis have spent tens of millions of dollars on these dowsing rods , called the ADE 651 .
Dale Murray , head of the National Explosive Engineering Sciences Security Center at Sandia Labs , which does testing for the Department of Defense , said the center had “ tested several devices in this category , and none have ever performed better than random chance . ”
The Justice Department has warned against buying a variety of products that claim to detect explosives at a distance with a portable device .
Normal remote explosives detection machinery , often employed in airports , weighs tons and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars .
The ADE 651 ’s clients are mostly in developing countries ; no major country ’s military or police force is a customer , according to the manufacturer .
Dowsing is a well known and well debunked form of pseudoscience , so it was going the extra mile for the Sandia Lab to test more such devices , yet , the Iraqis still swear by them .
James “ The Amazing ” Randi offered a million dollars to the English manufacturer of the device if it passed a fair experimental test , but with the money they are making off the Iraqis , they have no monetary incentive to have the device tested .
The Times reporter even ran a couple of small tests on the device ( bringing licensed weapons past a checkpoint ; trying the device himself ) , and of course it did n’t work , but this did not shake the Iraqi general ’s faith .
It ’s often claimed that pseudoscientific beliefs are harmless , but here ’s a case where , according to the Times , suicide bombers were able to get past a dowsing checkpoint and kill 155 people in an attack last month .
In another example of how pseudoscience hurts real people , a second article in the Times , by John Schwartz , records how a deputy sheriff in Texas is using “ dog- scent lineups ” to put people in jail .
As is well known , eyewitness testimony is a very problematic source of evidence ( see also the work of Elizabeth Loftus ) , and lineups have their own particular problems ( as the Times has noticed before [ summary – full article no longer online ] ) .
But “ nosewitness testimony ” , by a dog , presents further complications .
The police told Mr. Bickham they had tied him to a triple homicide through a dog - scent lineup , in which dogs choose a suspect ’s smell out of a group .
The dogs are exposed to the scent from items found at crime scene , and are then walked by a series of containers with samples swabbed from a suspect and from others not involved in the crime .
If the dog finds a can with a matching scent , it signals — stiffening , barking or giving some other alert its handler recognizes … .
Mr. Bickham spent eight months in jail after being identified in a scent lineup by Deputy Pikett ’s dogs , until another man confessed to the killings .
The Times article records other such cases , including one in which the dog - scent lineup evidence was contradicted by DNA evidence .
A British canine police unit expert who watched video of the dog - scent lineups , stated
“ If it was not for the fact that this is a serious matter , I could have been watching a comedy . ”
Both these stories remind me of previous pseudoscientific fads that have swept over small ( or in the Iraqi case , large but not very knowledgeable ) police departments in the past : “ fuel stabilizers ” and other alleged devices that “ align the fuel molecules ” to save gas , and satanic ritual abuse .

Representative Barney Frank is one of the most powerful Democrats in the House of Representatives .
As chairman of the Financial Services Committee , he ’s overseeing the spending of hundreds of billions of dollars to bailout Wall Street and stave off the mortgage crisis .
The White House needs him , and he ’s been a dependable ally so far .
Now he ’s leaning on President Barack Obama to cut the Pentagon budget .
On Tuesday , two days before Obama presents a proposed budget to Congress , Frank ( D - Mass . ) and other House Democrats called on the Obama administration to reduce military spending , setting up a potential clash between House liberals and the White House .
At a White House summit on fiscal responsibility the day before , Obama had cast doubt on the future of an $ 11.2 billion project to upgrade the fleet of presidential helicopters .
But Obama has shown no indication that he plans to reduce , or even freeze , overall defense spending , which will be around $ 650 billion this fiscal year .
Frank says that ’s a mistake .
“ To accomplish his goals of expanding health care and other important quality of life services without ballooning the deficit , ” Frank noted , Obama has no choice but to decrease military spending .
He said that spending excessive amounts of money on the defense budget “ precludes ” the Obama administration from addressing other priorities : “ If we do not get military spending under control , we will not be able to respond to important domestic needs . ”
Acknowledging that Obama does plan to save hundreds of billions of dollars by withdrawing from Iraq , Frank said the President must go further and take big whacks at big - ticket military projects .
He pointed to programs like the Air Force ’s F - 22 fighter , the Osprey troop transport , and missile defense as expensive , unnecessary Cold War-era boondoggles .
He singled out missile defense in Eastern Europe as a particularly wasteful use of American taxpayers ’ money .
“ I will confess that I am not a regular reader of Iranian - issued fatwahs , ” Frank quipped .
“ And probably one of the ones I missed was the one where they threatened devastation against Prague .
We plan to spend several billion dollars to protect the Czech Republic against Iran .
That ’s either a great waste of money or a very belated way to make up for Munich . ”
Other House liberals , including Reps. Lynn Woolsey ( D - Calif. ) , Barbara Lee ( D - Calif. ) , and Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) , joined Frank ’s call .
They noted that having the influential and sharp - tongued Frank leading the effort would help them in the always - tough battle against Pentagon waste .
But do n’t look to Congress to reduce military spending on its own , Frank said : “ Left entirely on our own , the Congress will not do the cuts in the military budget that ought to be there . ”
Military spending cuts will only come , he said , if there ’s grassroots pressure for them .
Frank noted that in the Pentagon budget fight he ’s up against some heavy hitting Democrats — including Rep. Ike Skelton ( D - Mo. ) and Sen. Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) , who chair the House and Senate Armed Services committees , respectively , and who “ are not where I am ” on military spending .
Asked whether he could win over the Blue Dog Democrats and other “ fiscally conservative ” legislators who often oppose domestic spending but rarely complain about military expenditures , Frank flipped open his suit jacket , and asked , “ Do you see a magic wand here ? ”
He insisted that voters who live in the congressional districts of the members should “ help us . ”
Presumably , Frank would like to see grassroots pressure also applied to Obama .
He spared the White House any tongue - lashing .
And , no doubt , he realizes that it will be an uphill battle to downsize the Pentagon significantly .
He ’s not new to this struggle .
For years , Frank has railed against excessive military spending .
This time around , he has more clout then ever .
Will he use it ?
Updated A DellConnect
IT specialist has been accused of intercontinental sexual hijinx for remotely flashing a woman client with a nude photo - of herself .
According to a report in The Orange County Register out of Santa Ana , California , 45 - year - old Stacy Gore received the boobular surprise when she was working with an India - based Dell tech - support drone to disinfect her virus - infected PC .
After a reported two and a half hours of remote ministrations to the ailing computer , Gore was surprised to find herself staring at her own breasts - onscreen , that is .
" It creeped me out , " she told the OCR .
The DellConnect tech had found the dishabille digital depiction on Gore 's computer - a phone - shot image , she claims , that she had forgotten about .
From the OCR report , however , it might be argued that Gore could have been tipped off that something was not quite right earlier in her DellConnect session .
During the alleged two and a half hours of alleged disinfection , the tech - who identified himself by the not - so - Mumbaish name of Jack Neos - had repeatedly used her laptop 's camera to snap pictures of her ( clothed , we must assume ) and display them to her on her laptop screen .
After the breast - revealing display trick , Gore received an email from Jack telling her : " I saw ur NUDE pics i m really sry I could n't say that over the phone that is y I m saying it now .
N u look very very very very cute ... it boosted me up and hope to have a good , sweet , cute , adorable , friend like U : ) "
What Jack lacks in English - language skills he more than makes up for in enthusiasm - and to be fair we must credit him for the new - to - us engorgement euphemism of " boosted me up . "
Up to this this point , Gore had pretty much taken the whole incident in stride .
" Look , I 'm a pretty mellow person , " she told the OCR , " If some guy wants to look at a nude picture of some 45 - year - old chick who was hot 20 years ago , then I say go ahead - that 's fine with me .
But two days after her marathon customer - service experience , Gore fired up her laptop only to discover that her wallpaper had been changed to - you guessed it - those same jubblies .
And that 's when Gore called the cops .
" What concerns me is that other women and minors everywhere are probably using this DellConnect service , and this guy could be a predator , " she said , not unreasonably , seeing as how Jack 's email mentioned her daughter .
Gore does n't have a daughter - which raised her suspicion that the email was a cut - and - paste job , and one of many that busy Jack had been gifting to Dell owners worldwide .
Gore also called Dell , where she worked her way up the managerial ladder through India and Malaysia until she found a woman who could help her get rid of not only her personal - mammarian wallpaper , but also four email messages that Jack had sent her .
That helpful manager also told her that Jack was " one of our best " techs - although best at exactly what may not have been discussed . ®
Bootnote
A Dell representative has posted a comments to this story , saying : " Just wanted to join the conversation by saying that Dell takes its privacy and ethics policy very seriously and is investigating the situation .
All employees are required to take and pass ethics related training in order to be in good standing within the company . "
In this week ’s This Week ’s Find in Mathematical Physics ( Week 286 ) Baez describes a construction of a rational homotopy circle .
Thought it would be interesting to take a look at a the beginnings of the simplest “ huge nightmarish space ” .
Edit : But as Josh clued me in , this is n’t exactly it .
I ’ll mainly just show some pictures and direct you to Baez ’s post for details .
His construction is just above the pirates .
In red , orange , and green are the first , second , and third cylinders .
This is an abstract space , so the particular immersions shown are rather irrelevant .
It ’s the attaching that matters .
Edit :
The attachings shown here are reversed from the ones Baez describes .
Here are a couple other different configurations .
There ’s a few more in this set .
Would ’ve done one more stage , but the quick way of doing it made my computer unhappy by the third stage and the not - so - quick way would ’ve been a bit tedious in the fourth .
Regardless , doubt it would ’ve been enlightening .
There ’s surely a slicker way of doing it , but I did n’t think too much about it .
Edit :
Here are some newer pictures with the gluing maps going the correct direction .
And perhaps it ’s best to see the colored parts as cones of the gluings while the cylinders have been retracted to just black curves .
Then the black curve on the free end of the red is the original circle , the red is the first gluing map , and the black curve between the red and orange is the first cylinder .
And so on …
Seem to have gotten myself somewhat turned around and confused by this .
Still a bit unsettled ….
The original circle is homotopic to 2 times the curve between the red and orange and thus homotopic to 6 times the curve between the orange and green .
So if the original circle is the loop g and n=3 , then where ’s the loop h such that g=3h ?
Edit :
One more pic to better show the progression of the construction .
Oh , and I found h .

Still a Long Way to Go
TAIPEI , Nov 17 ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Taiwan researchers have invented an robot that can act as a receptionist , tour guide , security guard and doctor ’s aide , the latest offering from an island seeking to make its name in the global robotics market .
The 60 kg ( 132 lb ) interactive robot named Monica can film , then recognise people well enough to admit them into an office building or send an emergency text message to a human security guard , project leader Ren Luo said on Tuesday .
Sensory functions also allow it to interact remotely between doctors and patients , especially when a patient falls .
Tourists could also use the 100 cm ( 39.4 inch ) tall robot to give them directions .
“ Within the robot community , this is pretty impressive because it can replace so many human functions , ” said Luo , a professor at National Taiwan University .
Long a powerhouse for personal computers , Taiwan is eyeing a share of the $ 18 billion robotics market , taking on larger foreign rivals such as Japan as margins in the island ’s chip and PC industries come under pressure .
[ ID : nTP312488 ]
Taiwan aims to take a 7 percent share of the global robotics market and exports worldwide , worth T$ 250 billion ( $ 7.8 billion ) by 2015 , according to Taiwan ’s Precision Machinery Research & Development Center .
Four university instructors , funded by T$ 58 million ( $ 1.81 million ) from the Taiwan government , spent the past year building a pair of Monica robots , which powered up on Monday .
The researchers have already spoken with a manufacturer about mass producing Monica for consumers , Luo said .
Current price tag is T$ 400,000 Taiwan dollars ( $ 12,500 ) , he said .
Developers globally are also working on robots for household assistance and dangerous tasks normally performed by humans , including bomb detection and disposal .
Senior British Airways managers last night warned they were in a " fight to the death " with unions over plans for an unprecedented 12 - day strike by cabin crew which threatens to wreck the Christmas travel plans of over 1 million passengers .
Virgin Atlantic , easyJet and Ryanair are set to make a fortune at the expense of BA after unions chose the nuclear option announcing a walkout from 22 December to 2 January following a 9 - 1 vote in favour of industrial action .
Last night the lowest economy return fare on the world 's premier intercontinental air route , Heathrow to New York JFK , on the first day of the strike , rose to £ 3,300 .
Other flights had more than doubled in price .

No UK airline has ever faced such a long strike which will wipe 7,000 flights from the airline 's schedules .
But despite a loss of revenue of between £ 300 m and £ 400 m – and a great deal of goodwill – Willie Walsh , BA 's chief executive , has the strong backing of the board in taking on the cabin - crew unions .
British Airways lost £ 401 m in the last financial year , and is set to lose even more in the current year .
Its losses are thought to be around £ 1,000 per minute .
BA announced earlier in the day that its pension fund deficit had increased by 75 per cent in the past three years to £ 3.7bn .
The board believes that unless they can substantially reduce staff costs – which are far higher than its rivals – BA does not have a sustainable future .
One source close to the company said it could not back down and would " fight to the death " .
Some members of cabin crew were alarmed by the " nuclear option " that the unions had adopted .
The ballot merely asked : " Are you in favour of industrial action ? " and many were surprised it had chosen such extreme tactics .
" In the past we 've only gone on strike for a couple of days , " said one stewardess .
" I 'm going to have to spend Christmas fixing up my CV . "
With the exception of a relatively small number of services from London City , all flights will be cancelled .
The new flagship service from the Docklands airport to New York will be hit .
For the past month , nearly 13,000 cabin crew have been balloted for industrial action .
The majority – 92.49 per cent , on a turnout of 80 per cent – was described as " unprecedented " by union officials .
" This is an incredibly high return by any standard , " said Len McCluskey , assistant general secretary of Unite .
" The decision has been taken to have the maximum impact . "
The strike was announced at a mass meeting at Sandown Park racecourse in Surrey organised by the two unions involved , Unite and the T&G .
British Airways said it was " extremely disappointed " with a strike it called " completely unjustified and a huge overreaction to the modest changes we have announced for cabin crew " .
" It is very sad that they are seeking to use the Christmas holiday plans and family reunions of hundreds of thousands of people to try to pursue their case , " said Mr Walsh .
" We will not be reversing our changes to onboard crew numbers . "
The unions say that they have 18 separate issues in dispute with BA .
But the main concerns are over new rosters unilaterally imposed by management on Heathrow cabin crew for the past four weeks – reducing by one the number of crew on each flight – and plans to recruit new staff on inferior terms and conditions .
The strength of feeling was summed up by a cabin services director at the meeting , who said : " BA 's loyal cabin crew are very angry at the way this leadership is destroying a company we were so proud to work for with impositions [ of new cabin - crew rosters ] and bad management decisions . "
An anonymous cabin - crew contributor to an online forum posted the message " Trust BA management ?
I 'd rather let Dr Shipman look after my folks for the weekend . "
BA employs 14,000 cabin crew – more than 95 per cent of whom are union members .
Most belong to Unite , with a small percentage in the T&G .
Much of their fury is directed at Willie Walsh , who has been the target of a bitter personal campaign .
Yesterday he described the Unite union as " bent on self - destruction ... like King Canute , it sits by the water 's edge shouting at the waves of recession and competition to go back . "
Frances
Tuke , a spokeswoman for the travel organisation Abta , said : " The strike announcement is bad news for the travel industry .
People who have booked Christmas and New Year package holidays involving British Airways flights will find that tour operators will either have to rearrange flights for them or give them a refund . "
Bob Atkinson , from Travelsupermarket.com , said : " This is a double disaster for BA .
Its customers are now going to be significantly affected and the airline will take a financial hit from the action . "
Jim McAuslan , leader of the British Airline Pilots ' Association , said : " There can still be a resolution of this conflict even at this , the 11th hour .
The last thing we want to see is the travelling public inconvenienced and BA 's long - term future damaged . "
Paul Simmons , easyJet 's UK general manager , said his airline still had seats available over the Christmas and New Year period .
One passenger , whose flight from Heathrow to Glasgow on 27 December is now likely to be cancelled , said : " This will be my last ever flight with BA .
When other carriers are adopting a much less selfish approach to their job prospects and the needs of their customers at this special time of the year , I refuse to ever again subsidise over - inflated salaries for BA cabin crew . "
The Government ’s chief scientific adviser said today that he agreed with the sacked drugs “ tsar ” Professor David Nutt when he said that cannabis is less dangerous than alcohol and cigarettes .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Professor John Beddington , the most senior scientific adviser in Whitehall , said that the scientific facts support the view that alcohol and tobacco are more dangerous than cannabis , which the Government has upgraded from a class C to a class B drug , putting it on a par with amphetamines .
Asked in an interview with the BBC whether he agreed with Professor Nutt ’s view that cannabis was less harmful than cigarettes and alcohol , Professor Beddington said : “ I think the scientific evidence is absolutely clear cut .
I would agree with it . ”
However , Professor Beddington would not be drawn on whether the Home Secretary Alan Johnson was right to sack Professor Nutt from his post as chairman of the Advisory Committee on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) for repeatedly stating that it was wrong to ignore the scientific evidence by upgrading cannabis to class B .
“ The key thing here is that there has been a breakdown in communication between the Home Secretary and Professor Nutt and that is to be regretted .
The Home Secretary clearly has no trust in Professor Nutt and I can't see how that could go on , ” Professor Beddington said .
There are more than 75 scientific committees advising goverment on a range of issues and all but one of these committees is working well with the advice being accepted by the Government , he said .
“ This has been a single instance where there has been a problem .
In my two years in government there has only been an instance about the ACMD , ” Professor Beddington said
“ The government should take into account scientific advice where it is given even when that advice is not a complete consensus , if there is disagreement between scientists , but the government needs to take that into account , ” he said .
“ But of course there are other considerations and it needs to be clear , when governments go against scientific advice , what is the basis for going against that advice because it is perfectly proper that there are other considerations .
I think it 's important to get transparency in these issues , ” Professor Beddington said .

Fabio Capello ’s first major task as England boss was to qualify for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa .
Job done .
But now he must consider the final stages of an equally tricky proposition – picking his squad for next summer .
England cantered through their qualifying campaign , booking their place in South Africa with their eighth straight group stage victory , winning 5 - 1 against Croatia .
The signs are very promising , with few nations able to handle the starting line - up at Capello ’s disposal , but one area that still needs to be ironed out is the strikeforce .
Without a shadow of a doubt , Wayne Rooney will be on the plane , injury permitting , and will spearhead the attack .
He loves the big occasion and will be desperate to make amends for his rush of blood in Germany in 2006 .
However , beyond Rooney , there are questions to be answered in terms of Capello ’s preferences and the recent friendly against Brazil , which England lost 1 - 0 , did not make the situation a lot clearer .
Capello has taken a good look at Peter Crouch , Jermain Defoe and Emile Heskey while the fleet - footed Gabriel Agbonlahor has also featured .
Then there is Darren Bent , who already has eight goals to his name for Sunderland this season , Carlton Cole , who is developing nicely at West Ham , and Michael Owen , who continues to be ignored .
Capello will probably look to cut that list down to just four , including Rooney .
And that means some players face major disappointment .
It goes without saying that playing in a World Cup is every youngster ’s dream , but eight into four does not go .
Putting Rooney , whose awareness , technique and work ethic make him one of the first names on the teamsheet , to one side as a certainty , Defoe appears to be next in the pecking order .
With his pace and clever movement , the Tottenham man works well with Rooney and is a clinical goalscorer .
Defoe played well during the qualifiers , scoring regularly , and could well get the nod in the starting line - up when England play their first group game in South Africa next summer .
Then there are the three big men .
Crouch and Heskey have the experience from playing in previous tournaments with England .
The former has pushed his way into the Spurs attack and is back scoring goals again .
He is a nuisance aerially and is surprisingly mobile and skilful on the deck .
Heskey too is a talented target man as shown by the form that earned him a recall while at Wigan .
However , he is currently seeing limited minutes for Aston Villa owing to the brilliance of Agbonlahor and John Carew .
This may well count against him if it continues as Capello will rightly be reluctant to pick a player who is lacking match practice and would therefore be somewhat rusty .
Cole , meanwhile , is a wildcard .
He has the all - round physicality to terrorise defences and he is a far better athlete than Crouch or Heskey .
His finishing needs polishing but he has started the season well , despite West Ham ’s sluggish start , and is leaving defenders battered and bruised .
The question is : how many big men will Capello want to take ?
Could he take both Crouch and Cole , for instance , without harming the balance of the attack ?
Agbonlahor , meanwhile , appears to be enhancing his credentials each week .
Prospering from the creativity of Ashley Young and James Milner on the flanks for Villa , he is proving a constant threat but his return to form may be coming a little too late to make the squad this time .
However , he could yet make a statement with big performances in the coming weeks .
With the clock ticking , Bent is also giving it his best shot .
His move to Sunderland has revived his career and his running off the ball is excellent .
Against him , though , is the fact that he is a similar type of striker to Defoe and as a result the argument returns to the balance of the squad .
Bent was handed a chance against Brazil and , though the service was poor , he did not really do enough to alter Capello ’s thinking .
And things look bleaker still for Owen .
The former Liverpool striker has given glimpses of his pre-injury form since joining Manchester United but he remains injury - plagued and is not logging enough first team minutes when it counts .
Capello will keep an eye on Owen but he is a huge outsider to be in the final squad and many feel his omission for the Brazil friendly was the final nail in the coffin .
Given the various arguments for and against each of the strikers chasing a spot , one thing is for sure : this is a nice problem for Capello to have .
He has eight talented front men fighting to represent their country and all of them will be pushing to further their chances before the Italian makes his final decisions .
That said , Capello will have a good idea of his plans for the World Cup by now .
There are plenty of options but expect to see Rooney , Defoe and Crouch taking their seats on the plane with Cole sneaking into the fourth and last spot as England chase World Cup glory next summer .

Of the 20,000 genes in the human genome , few are more fascinating than FOXP2 , a gene that underlies the faculty of human speech .
All animals have an FOXP2 gene , but the human version ’s product differs at just 2 of its 740 units from that of chimpanzees , suggesting that this tiny evolutionary fix may hold the key to why people can speak and chimps cannot .
FOXP2 came to light in a large London family , half of whose members have severe problems in articulating and understanding speech .
All turned out to have a mutation that disrupted this vital gene .
This year , one inquiry bore fruit , although of a somewhat ambiguous nature , when biologists in Leipzig , Germany , genetically engineered a mouse with the human version of FOXP2 substituted for its own .
The upgraded mice squeaked somewhat differently from plain mice and were born with subtle alterations in brain structure .
But mice and people are rather distant cousins  their last common ancestor lived some 70 million years ago  and the human version of FOXP2 evidently was not able to exert a transformative effect on the mouse .
What is it :
This is my grandfather , Murray Anderson , in 1942 at age 17 , pointing his gun directly at the photographer .
Why is it Awesome ?
Okay , let ’s get a closer look at this .
You tell me , what ’s interesting about this image ?
Is it the bit where you can see directly down the barrel of what is almost certainly a loaded firearm ?
I ’ll admit , it makes for an interesting picture –especially once I was assured the photographer is not now dead and quietly buried in a shallow grave somewhere out in the forest– but what is the wider context ?
What can this photo tell us about the life and times of the generation that grew up during the Great Depression ?
Let ’s take a step back and remember what we ’re talking about here .
This is not a couple of teenagers horsing around with firearms .
Well , okay , it is teenagers horsing around with firearms , but it ’s also one of those things that disconnects the Greatest Generation from my own .
Even the Baby Boomers can’t really wrap their head around the idea that in the Great Depression , you fed your family however you could .
Everyone had a garden .
If you lived near a lake or a river , you fished .
If there were wood lots around you , you hunted .
You did n’t do it because you were starving .
You did it because it was something you could do to make things easier on the family budget .
It was n’t a question of desperation so much as independence .
My grandfather is the youngest of eight children , five boys , three girls .
That ’s a lot of mouths to feed .
Their family was fairly well off , as far as things went :
His father was an engineer , and his grandfather was a fishing trawler captain , but that did n’t mean every penny was n’t pinched .
Look at the photo of my grandfather and two of his brothers about to go fishing .
Who ’s the best dressed ?
Who ’s second ?
Who ’s third ?
That ’s based strictly on age .
The eldest brother got the new clothes , because he outgrew his old stuff , which went to the next eldest , and the next , and so on down the line .
Every photo I have of my grandfather before he joins the navy , the collars and sleeves of his sweaters are all stretched out and irregular .
Hand - me - downs are n’t a completely foreign concept to my generation , but they certainly do n’t extend into a boy ’s late teens anymore .
In his day and age it was viewed as perfectly normal , even for the middle class .
It was just one more way of scrimping and saving and relying on your own family ’s resources .
So what does this have to do with the Great Depression Generation ’s view of gun safety ?
My grandfather and great uncles were expected to hunt and to fish to supplement the food their father ’s salary put on the table .
Again , that was absolutely normal , whereas today it would be considered very unusual outside of the most rustic areas .
Everyone with access to a rod or reel helped out .
Up in Muskoka , over four hundred kilometers away from the Anderson family down in Windsor , My grandmother ’s brother Wilfred ‘ Pip ’ MacDonald was praised for his efforts to always shoot rabbits in the head , so the fur would be of some use after the little guys had been butchered .
It was a lifestyle that held sway over vast stretches of North America : Frugality , but also a tangible sense of self - reliance .
Today , if I wanted to have a boat like the Anderson brothers had , I ’d have to take a course on water safety , write an exam , and get my license .
Do you know what those boys did ?
Their father took them out from the time they were old enough to stand , and when they were old enough to work a struggling pole to haul in a fish worth catching , he trusted them to go out on their own .
It was just the same with firearms .
There ’s no doubt in my mind that my great - grandfather showed his sons how to load a rifle , unload it , work the safety and the sights .
It never occurred to him to send them to an actual officiating body where they would learn the cardinal rule , “ ALWAYS TREAT A GUN AS IF IT WERE LOADED . ”
I imagine the frugal Anderson clan ’s cardinal rule about firearms was , ‘ Do n’t lose that gun .
It ’s expensive !’
My grandfather has n’t held a rifle in years .
I believe he gave it up shortly after almost shooting his wife .
Sometime in the 50s ( the story is hazy , as it is not often repeated ) , my grandmother was on her hands and knees , scrubbing the kitchen floor .
My grandfather was cleaning his gun at the kitchen table .
He neglected to check the breech because he was ‘ Sure that it was empty . ’
The gun went off , sending a bullet within a foot of my grandmother Serena ’s head .
There are no pictures of my grandfather holding a gun after that .
I asked him , “ Did n’t they teach you gun safety in the Navy ? ”
My own knowledge of firearm handling is largely through my time in the air cadets .
“ Sure , ” he said .
“ But I did n’t pay attention .
There was a war on , you know ! ”
My grandmother leapt to her husband ’s defense .
“ Our generation used guns all the time , growing up .
Not like your generation .
We never used our shotguns to shoot up a school . ”
You ca n’t really overcome an argument like that .
Her generation could be trusted with guns without lessons .
Ours ca n’t even be trusted to hold them .
That ’s how far the zeitgeist has gone when it comes to kids and firearms .
When I see that picture of my grandfather pointing his gun directly at the camera , I feel an electric shock run through me .
He is only slightly embarrassed about the photo , and that ’s because of an accident that would happen almost twenty years later .
To my grandfather , the rifle was just a tool he needed to do a job .
In many ways his youth was a simpler time , despite being a harder time .
Our rules and education have made us safer , but they ’ve also taken away some of the freedom of being young and trusted .
Anyway , the picture got me thinking , and as I have over a hundred of these old photos to put up on this blog sooner or later , I thought I ’d start off with these ones .

The real scandal of Tom DeLay
WASHINGTON , D.C. ( Creators Syndicate ) -- Forget the freebie trips across the Atlantic and the Pacific .
Forget the casinos and the allegedly illicit contributions -- they represent only degrees of avarice .
To grasp the moral bankruptcy of the public Tom DeLay , the House majority leader , you only have to know about Frank Murkowski and Saipan .
Today , Frank Murkowki is the governor of Alaska , but from 1980 to 2002 , he was a conservative Republican senator from Alaska .
How conservative ?
His voting record earned him zero ratings from organized labor 's AFL - CIO and the liberal Americans for Democratic Action , and perfect 100s from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Conservative Union .
But as chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee , Frank Murkowski became furious at the abusive sweatshop conditions endured by workers , overwhelmingly immigrants , in the U.S. territory of the Northern Mariana Islands , of which Saipan is the capital .
Because they were produced in a territory of the United States , garments traveled tariff - free and quota - free to the profitable U.S. market and were entitled to display the coveted " Made in the USA " label .
Among the manufacturers that had profited from the un - free labor market on the island were Tommy Hilfiger USA , Gap , Calvin Klein and Liz Claiborne .
Moved by the sworn testimony of U.S. officials and human - rights advocates that the 91 percent of the workforce who were immigrants -- from China , the Philippines , Sri Lanka and Bangladesh -- were being paid barely half the U.S. minimum hourly wage and were forced to live behind barbed wire in squalid shacks minus plumbing , work 12 hours a day , often seven days a week , without any of the legal protections U.S. workers are guaranteed , Murkowski wrote a bill to extend the protection of U.S. labor and minimum - wage laws to the workers in the U.S. territory of the Northern Marianas .
So compelling was the case for change the Alaska Republican marshaled that in early 2000 , the U.S. Senate unanimously passed the Murkowski worker reform bill .
But one man primarily stopped the U.S.
House from even considering that worker - reform bill : then - House Republican Whip Tom DeLay .
According to law firm records recently made public , lobbyist Jack Abramoff , paid millions to stop reform and keep the status quo , met personally at least two dozen times with DeLay on the subject in one two - year period .
The DeLay staff was often in daily contact with Abramoff .
DeLay traveled with his family and staff over New Year 's of 1997 on an Abramoff scholarship endowed by his client , the government of the territory , to the Marianas , where golf and snorkeling were enjoyed .
DeLay fully approved of the working and living conditions .
The Texan 's salute to the owners and Abramoff 's government clients was recorded by ABC - TV News : " You are a shining light for what is happening to the Republican Party , and you represent everything that is good about what we are trying to do in America and leading the world in the free - market system "
Later , DeLay would tell The Washington Post 's Juliet Eilperin that the low - wage , anti-union conditions of the Marianas constituted " a perfect petri dish of capitalism .
It 's like my Galapagos Island . "
Contrast that with what then - Sen .
Murkowski told me in a 1998 interview : " The last time we heard a justification that economic advances would be jeopardized if workers were treated properly was shortly before Appomattox . "
The " Made in the USA " label means standards of quality and standards of conduct .
But more important than how a product is made is how the people who make that product are treated -- as human beings with innate dignity -- who are free to organize and entitled to a living wage .
Did somebody say something about moral values ?
