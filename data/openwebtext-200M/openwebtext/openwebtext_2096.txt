The Mother of all Telephotos Canon only made a handful of these puppies and we got one !
By Allan Weitz
If you 're into bird watching , the holy grail would have to be the Ivory - Billed Woodpecker , a huge ( 20 " tall with a 30 " wingspan ) , yet incredibly elusive woodpecker that despite reports of extinction , is spotted every now - and - then deep in the boonies of Florida and Arkansas .
It 's also known as the ' Lord G - d ' woodpecker because that 's what spotters have been known to blurt out - often accompanied by soiled trousers - when dive - bombed by one .
' Lord G - d ' has also been exclaimed - minus the soiled trousers - by those seeing a Canon 1200 / 5.6L USM for the first time .
At 36 lbs , 33 " long and 9 " wide at the front element , calling this lens a ' tele ' is like calling King Kong a monkey .
Photo Credit : Henry Posner The Canon 1200 / 5.6L USM ( priced at $ 120,000 ... and if you live out of state we do n't need to charge you tax ! ) has been built on a special - order basis since 1993 , and the ‘ official word ’ is there are " more than twelve , less than twenty " of them in existence .
With a price tag equivalent to a pair of his - and - her sports coupes , they were produced at the rate of about 2 - per - year and a delivery time of about 18 months .
National Geographic magazine , Sports Illustrated , Canon Professional Services , and a few well - heeled enthusiasts are counted among the fortunate few who own these unique optics .
A box of donuts says the Feds probably have a few squirreled away somewhere , but this is something we can neither confirm nor deny .
What you get for your money is a monster lens with an angle of view of about 2° on a full - frame 35 mm camera .
For the record , the Canon 1200 / 5.6L USM contains 13 elements ( including 2 Fluorite ) in 10 groups , stops down to f32 , and has a minimum focus of 45.9 ' .
As for filtration , 48 mm drop - in filters can be inserted towards the aft section of the lens barrel .
And before you start kvetching ' it 's not an IS lens ' keep in mind this hefty pup demands the sturdiest tripod and pan / tilt head you can muster up .
An EOS Mark III mounted on this thing looks like a rear lens cap with handle bars .
Folks , we 're talking big here … really big .
To facilitate a measure of user - friendliness , a center - balanced , rotating handle / tripod collar assembly was smartly designed into lens barrel .
If for whatever reason you prefer using a ball - head , make sure you have a firm hand on the lens handle before you loosen anything because the results can be painful in more ways than one .
Upper West Side Manhattan -
About a mile away Shooting with a 1200 mm lens is not a casual affair .
The reinforced aluminum case is heavier than the lens and requires a wheelie cart to get around .
For negotiating curbs , stairs , and cargo bays there are rubber - padded handles on three sides of the case .
If you have visions of slinging this baby over your shoulder and going a stroll along the promenade be advised it ain't happening .
And remember ... lift with your knees .
The viewfinder is surprisingly bright , and though somewhat sluggish as compared to the latest - generation Canon EF lenses , the 1200 was usually able to nail the focus on the first pass .
The hard part is figuring out what you ’re focusing on because the angle of view is so narrow .
If you ’re not familiar with the landscape you ’ll find yourself peering out over the top of the camera every so often trying to figure out what you ’re looking at .
As for image quality , even wide open it 's quite lovely .
Stopped down to f/8 and f/11 it 's actually quite remarkable .
How remarkable ?
From midtown Manhattan we were able to read the street signs on the corner of JFK Boulevard East and 43rd St. in Weehawkin New Jersey when viewing image files at pixel resolution .
It 's important to keep in mind when you are shooting images of objects literally a mile away or further you start contending with haze , smog , and heat radiation that can greatly diminish the image quality of the best optics , especially during warmer months .
Even on a cold , clear winter day we were able to detect heat distortions in some of the photos .

A Canon Extender EF 1.4 x boosts the beast up to a 1680 / 8 , and the Canon Extender EF 2 x will get you to a 2400 / 11 .
For what it 's worth , if you couple this lens to a Rebel XTi or EOS 40 D you end up with the 35 mm - equivalent of 1920 / 5.6 , a 2688/ 8 with a 1.4 x extender , and a 3840/11 with a 2 x extender .
If you need to focus any tighter to your subject you 'll have to hop a plane and fly there .
Apart from a few very minor cosmetic blemishes , this lens is tight and extremely clean inside and out .
Included with this lens is a leather slip - on ' lens cap ' , a fitted aluminum shipping case , and a prodigious measure of ego satisfaction .
And how much will this honey set you back ?
A cool $ 120,000 .
But keep in mind we guarantee you ’ll be the first and only one on your block to own one of these awesome creations .
Operators are standing by .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israeli troops were unable to identify Reuters News cameraman Fadel Shana as a journalist before they fired at him from a tank , the Israeli army said on Wednesday , citing the preliminary results of an investigation .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Shana died while filming on a road in central Gaza on April 16 .
Five other Palestinians also died in the attack .
Shana had been traveling in a vehicle that was marked with large press and TV stickers on the front and sides and was wearing blue body amour with “ Press ” in large blue letters on a white fluorescent panel on the front .
Responding to repeated requests for an official explanation of the incident , Israeli military spokeswoman Major Avital Leibovich said the army had not yet completed its investigation but would provide a full account as soon as possible .
“ The initial investigation showed they were not identified as members of the press , ” she said .
Nineteen Palestinians died that day after militants killed three Israeli soldiers who were on a raid into Gaza .
Doctors said 24 - year old Shana was killed by metal darts sprayed from a tank shell .
His final moments of footage show the shell being fired by a tank around 1.5 km ( 1 mile ) away .
His colleague Wafa Abu Mizyed was wounded by a dart .
Reuters News editors met Leibovich and representatives of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ’s office on Wednesday to urge the Israeli military to share the findings of its investigation .
“ We owe it to the family of Fadel Shana and journalists working for Reuters and other media organizations to establish exactly what happened two weeks ago , ” said Mark Thompson , Reuters News managing editor for Europe , Middle East and Africa .
“ We urge the Israeli army to conduct its investigation as thoroughly and speedily as possible . ”
Down In The Mass Grave With A Calculator *
Christopher Hitchens is very , very angry at Hillary Clinton :
[ W ] hat had happened to the 1992 promise , four years earlier , that genocide in Bosnia would be opposed by a Clinton administration ?...
Let me quote from Sally Bedell Smith 's admirable book on the happy couple , For Love of Politics : Taking the advice of Al Gore and National Security Advisor Tony Lake , Bill agreed to a proposal to bomb Serbian military positions while helping the Muslims acquire weapons to defend themselves — the fulfillment of a pledge he had made during the 1992 campaign .
But instead of pushing European leaders , he directed Secretary of State Warren Christopher merely to consult with them ... The key factor in Bill 's policy reversal was Hillary ... The United States took no further action in Bosnia , and the " ethnic cleansing " by the Serbs was to continue for four more years , resulting in the deaths of more than 250,000 people .
I can personally witness to the truth of this , too .
Whatever the truth of the Clintons ' behavior , the actual number of people who died during the Bosnian War was about 100,000 , or 40 % of what Smith states .
I feel ill just bringing this up , but as the noted political writer Christopher Hitchens says :
It may be distasteful , even indecent , to argue over " body counts , " whether the bodies are Armenian , Jewish , Cambodian , or ... Timorese .
But the count must be done , and done seriously , if later generations are not to doubt the whole slaughter on the basis of provable exaggerations or inventions .
On the other hand , it 's not like Hillary Clinton can complain about Smith getting this wrong .
Here 's Clinton herself , in her speech justifying her 2002 Iraq vote :
We and our NATO allies did not depose Mr. Milosevic , who was responsible for more than a quarter of a million people being killed in the 1990s .
All those people in Bosnia were probably sad to die ... at first .
But later I bet they felt it would all be worth it if their deaths could provide fodder for American polemicists to bludgeon each other with .

Anything on E85
City / Highway : Minus 25 percent
E85 , a blended fuel consisting of 85 - percent ethanol and 15 - percent gasoline , has been championed ( by GM in particular ) as a viable and green solution to the petroleum problem .
Unfortunately , both adjectives are a stretch .
You could fill volumes with debate over the benefits and social , fiscal , and environmental costs of ethanol , at least the starch - derived strains , so we wo n’t .
What you need to know is that E85 reduces the fuel economy of any vehicle burning it by about 25 percent .
For example , the grand - prize glugger of the full - size - truck segment , the Dodge Ram 1500 , gets 12 mpg in the city and 16 on the highway .
Fill ’er up with E85 , and the fuel “ economy ” falls to 9/12 .
That ’s right , a single - digit mpg number , something the average person only experiences in Uncle Dwayne ’s RV or when renting a U - Haul truck .
Or take the Dodge Avenger V - 6 , which gets a semi- respectable 19 city / 27 highway .
Pour in the corn juice , and watch mileage drop to an SUV - like 13/20 .
Pres. George Bush recently announced a proposed mandate for 35 billion gallons of ethanol production by 2017 , so you ’ll probably see more vehicles so equipped , regardless .
An upshot of an ethanol / alcohol future is that we tired journalists will have a whole new hamper of words and terms involving alcoholism and ethanol overindulgence to reach into .
2008 Jeep Liberty
3.7 - liter V - 6 , 4 - speed auto , 4 - wheel drive
15 mpg city / 21 mpg highway
Jeep makes it known its Liberty is indeed a Jeep by offering two all - wheel drive systems , the part - time Command - Trac and full - time Selec - Trac II .
It ’s too bad the only available engine is a stinker , and not because it ’s a diesel ; the previously available diesel did n’t meet 2007 emissions standards .
The 3.7 - liter PowerTech V - 6 follows in a grand Chrysler tradition of dubiously optimistic names like Caravan Sport .
Plenty of equally sized engines make more power — Nissan ’s 3.7 - liter VQ37 makes 120 more horsepower — and although it does have overhead cams , that ’s about where the tech ends .
The only Jeep worth having is one with four - wheel drive , and most customers choose an automatic .
So equipped , the Liberty returns fuel economy of 15 mpg in the city , 21 on the highway .
The Liberty ’s mechanical ( and arguably aesthetic ) twin , the Dodge Nitro , is offered with a 4.0 - liter V - 6 producing an additional 50 horsepower and 30 pound - feet of torque , with just a 1 mpg highway penalty .
Much like the Wrangler , the Liberty ’s salvation lies in the return of a diesel or doing something about the more than two - ton curb weight .
Chrysler might , however , have it right : People would rather line the pockets of the oil barons every time they fuel up rather than pay more money up front for a more - fuel - efficient vehicle .
With an average national fuel cost currently hovering around three bucks for a gallon of regular , fuel economy matters .
Over the past decade , the driveways of mainstream America filled with SUVs whose fuel - swilling was , at the time , not a concern .
Fuel costs almost doubled from 1996 to 2006 and grew another 20 percent in the past year .
The average U.S. household income , meanwhile , rose only 35.8 percent in the same 10 - year period .
The associated shift in vehicle sales is telling .
In 2007 , sales of Chevy ’s Tahoe full - size SUV fell by 9.4 percent from 2006 , while retail sales for the unlovable but frugal Chevrolet Aveo leaped by 82 percent .
GM ’s John McDonald wrote this off as these vehicles ' being “ deferrable purchases , ” implying that land barges hold some kind of inherent allure and that Americans would prefer to drive dump trucks if gas were free .
This is , of course , entirely possible .
But gas is not free , and we do n’t drive dump trucks , and as car buyers search for better fuel economy , they increasingly do n’t want to drive trucks of any kind .
R&D dollars are focused on unibody crossovers that ad campaigns tout as more fuel efficient than the trucks they replace , with even Ford ’s Explorer headed for a frame - free future .
It ’s not just big trucks that get lousy fuel economy , either .
The culprits of poor fuel economy are many , but common underlying causes include portly curb weights , older drivetrains , and the conscious exclusion of fuel - saving technologies to keep production and purchase prices down .
Before you spend your money on a new car , make sure you pay attention to the equipment list , because with the wrong engine or transmission choice , heinous fuel economy is sometimes just a checkbox away .
2008 Saab 9 - 7X Aero
6.0 - liter V - 8 , 4 - speed auto , 4 - wheel drive
12 mpg city / 16 mpg highway
Saab has expanded its ranks by making stepchildren of some decidedly un-Saabish vehicles .
It started with the 9 - 2X , a.k.a. the Saabaru , a Subaru WRX wagon with a Saab schnoz and nice interior .
Then came the 9 - 7X , a Chevy TrailBlazer with only slightly more - becoming clothes .
As any Saab purist will tell you , it ’s not a real Aero unless you need Popeye forearms to do battle with the huge , turbocharged torque steer , absent here in spite of 395 pound - feet , thanks to the TrailBlazer ’s four - wheel drive .
The 9 - 7X Aero is fast , however , as you ’d expect of nearly anything with a 390 - hp Chevrolet LS2 V - 8 under the hood .
If you need more evidence that the 9 - 7X is as Swedish as General Tso ’s chicken , it comes with 20 - inch polished wheels .
Ostentation is to Swedish culture what showmanship is to the NFL ’s Manning family .
The 9 - 7X is the first Saab ever not to feature unibody construction , instead relying on body - on - frame technology proven road - and trailworthy by the Donner Party .
Although lesser 9 - 7Xs already manage only questionable fuel economy — the thriftiest engine is rated at 14/20 mpg — let yourself be talked into the top - of - the - line 9 - 7X , and you ’ll be looking at quite a bottom line at the gas pump .
The Chevy LS - series V - 8s can be relatively frugal when properly geared , but with a four - speed automatic , all - wheel drive , and 4800 pounds to lug , this 6.0 - liter returns a bottom - of - the - list 12 mpg in the city and 16 on the highway .
2008 Jeep Wrangler
3.8 - liter V - 6 , 4 - speed auto , 4 - wheel drive
15 mpg city / 19 mpg highway
That Chrysler ’s most rugged product , the Wrangler , is capable of transporting you farther into the wilderness than almost any other production vehicle while doing a knock - up job of spoiling it is a head shaker .
We understand that a Wrangler is heavy by virtue of super - extra - beefy parts and a frame that could double as a railroad truss , that a rock crawler ’s engine needs to be dead reliable and much proven , and that this true mudslinger needs to be held to a low price point , but c’mon .
We realize it ’s cheaper to use really thick steel than forge stuff , but if the compact Wrangler did n’t weigh two tons , it might get better gas mileage than the much - larger six - cylinder Grand Cherokee .
Jeep ’s “ modernization ” of the Wrangler ’s powertrain for ’07 meant replacing the venerable 4.0 - liter straight - six , not much evolved from what you got with an AMC Rambler American in 1965 , with the 3.8 - liter pushrod V - 6 designed to have its oil - change intervals neglected by 1991 Chrysler Imperial owners .
Mileage is stuck at 15 city / 19 highway regardless of transmission choice .
No one expects a Wrangler to be anything but torquey , something easily accomplished with things such as engine stroke and proper gearing but also quite well handled by diesels .
As a known spray - tan solvent , that fuel might compromise the lucrative fraternity market , but we ’d love to see Jeep drop in a Mercedes diesel or wait for DDC Cento , which supplied the unit in the now - extinct Liberty CRD , to clean up its act .
2008 Saturn Vue XE
3.5 - liter V - 6 , 6 - speed auto , 4 - wheel drive
15 mpg city / 22 mpg highway
Not unlike much of the population , too much curb weight is the main culprit affecting the Saturn Vue ’s efficiency .
How GM could pack 4350 pounds into a vehicle fewer than three inches longer than a Honda Civic is beyond us ( perhaps it got a great deal on leaded Chinese paint ) .
The 222 - hp , 3.5 - liter pushrod V - 6 in the all - wheel - drive XE is from the same “ High Value ” engine family as the 3.9 - liter in the Pontiac G6 on this list , but any value buyers see up front will be quickly negated by the 15 / 22 mileage figure .
Spend a bit more cash for the XR or Red Line model , and you get a 3.6 - liter V - 6 that , despite being only 74 cubic centimeters larger , makes 35 more horsepower and 29 more pound - feet of torque and returns better city fuel mileage ( if only barely ) .
That engine is a lower - horsepower version of the same all - aluminum , direct - injection “ High Feature ” V - 6 found kicking ass in the Cadillac CTS .
The mileage issue is a shame , because the Vue is a surprisingly good vehicle , offering tremendous value , luxurious appointments , and refinement beyond others in this class and some more expensive SUVs .
The Vue does n’t have to be such a lush , as proved by the front - wheel - drive Green Line hybrid version , which gets 25 mpg in the city and 32 on the highway .
Moreover , the Vue will shortly receive GM ’s excellent two - mode transmission and will be the first genuine plug - in hybrid sold by the General .
2008 Pontiac G6 GT Convertible
3.9 - liter V - 6 , 4 - speed auto , front - wheel drive
15 mpg city / 22 mpg highway
Pushrods are really not okay .
There , we said it .
GM gets special dispensation for its LS - series V - 8 , which is so good that conspiracists should look into extraterrestrial involvement in its development .
The 3.9 - liter V - 6 under the hood of the Pontiac G6 GT hardtop convertible gets a double raspberry for unimpressive power production and subpar fuel economy .
GM calls this its “ High Value ” engine family , which means it ’s GM 's coffers receiving the value , not yours .
At least the 222 thundering horsepower — 15 fewer than found under the hood of a Honda S2000 , despite an extra 1.7 liters — sound decent .
The G6 still only 15 mpg in the city and 22 on the highway .
This is n’t just the engine ’s fault :
It ’s not unfair to round the G6 GT ’s curb weight to two tons , and with only four gears in the automatic transmission , some compromises have been made in ratio selection .
As long as your days do n’t cover many miles , the G6 GT offers good value and comfort , but if you ’re a hardtop - down road tripper , the similarly priced VW Eos offers roughly 40 - percent - better fuel economy .
2008 Mazda RX -8
1.3 - liter 2 - rotor , 6 - speed manual , rear - wheel drive
16 mpg city / 22 mpg highway
The little Japanese automaker that can , Mazda consistently produces vehicles that make us smile .
No other company imbues its entire product line — including entry - level vehicles — with such focus on driving fun .
This focus apparently is n’t lost on the public , as Mazda ’s sales numbers grew more than any other major automaker 's in 2007 .
An unavoidable trade - off for entertaining driving , though , is fuel economy .
The RX - 8 scores worse than some might expect because of its rotary engine , a design inherently thirstier than a piston engine .
Displacing just 1.3 liters , the RX - 8 ’s 232 - hp Renesis rotary with 159 pound - feet of torque sucks down fuel like Homer Simpson chugging Duff at Moe ’s — returning just 16 mpg city and 22 highway .
We like the RX - 8 enough that it made our 10 Best list from 2004 to 2006 and won its last comparo despite being in its fifth year of production , but the rotary is certainly not without its compromises .
The bingo - and - buffet - express Honda Accord V - 6 runs a quicker and faster quarter - mile , and the Chevrolet Corvette makes 204 more horsepower and 269 more pound - feet of torque yet bests the RX - 8 by 4 mpg on the highway .
It is rumored that the RX - 8 will receive the next iteration of the Renesis rotary , dubbed the 16X .
It weighs less than the current 13 - B but gets a bump in displacement , and with the more precise fuel metering of direct injection , it is entirely possible that more horsepower and torque could be coupled with more mpg .
We love 9000 - rpm redlines and hope the rotary ’s flatulent exhaust note will pour from generations of Mazda vehicles to come .
2008 Mazda CX - 7
2.3 - liter inline - 4 , 6 - speed auto , 4 - wheel drive
16 mpg city / 22 mpg highway
The best interpretation of the term crossover we ’ve seen yet , the Mazda CX - 7 appeals to people who want something that looks sporty and drives better than most cars while providing some pretense of outdoorsiness and a DIY spirit to perpetuate the great SUV lie .
Good thing they require only pretense , as the latter two requests are pretty much quashed by a modest amount of usable space and limited off - road talent .
The CX - 7 shares its engine with the late Mazdaspeed 6 and various chassis bits and layouts with the Mazda 3 .
Depending on equipment , it weighs an Al Pacino or Calista Flockhart less than two tons .
The high - tech , direct - injection 2.3 - liter turbocharged four - cylinder produces a sporty 244 horsepower , helping produce a respectable 7.9 - second 0 - to - 60 time but , unfortunately , gulps a gallon of premium every 16 miles in the city and 21 on the highway .
The competing Toyota RAV4 V - 6 with all - wheel drive , however , sprints to 60 an immense 1.6 seconds faster , yet gets three more mpg in the city and four more on the highway .
It does not , however , look anywhere near as cool or drive nearly as well .
The CX - 7 is Mazda ’s first mid-size SUV since it rebranded the Ford Explorer as the Navajo — not a high point for the Mazda .
Despite the poor fuel economy and questionable utility , the CX - 7 is undoubtedly a Mazda , and the most rewarding crossover to helm .
2008 Volvo S80
3.2 - liter inline - 6 , 6 - speed auto , front - wheel drive
16 mpg city / 24 mpg highway
If you need proof of interdepartmental political wrangling in the automotive industry , look no further than to head scratchers such as the following :
The all - new - for - ’07 ( but you might not notice unless we told you ) S80 , Volvo ’s top - of - the - line Ã¼ber - sedan , is offered with three engines — all of which get within 1 mpg of one another .
There is , however a spread of 76 horsepower and 89 pound - feet of torque between the least and most powerful offerings .
In the best - case fuel - economy scenario , the S80 with the 3.2 - liter , naturally aspirated inline - six gets 16 / 24 mpg ; competitors such as the Lexus GS and Mercedes E - class provide better fuel economy with more powerful engines .
An obvious solution is a diesel , such as the 2.4 - liter turbo - diesel five - cylinder available in the European S80 that generates 182 horsepower and 295 pound - feet of torque .
Volvo wants to launch a diesel here by “ around the end of the decade , ” according to company reps .
Even equipped in its most expensive guise with the sculptural and guttural Yamaha - built 311 - hp , 4.4 - liter V - 8 , a C/D editor described the S80 as offering “ all the flavor of Wasa crisp bread , which is like eating particle board . ”
For those whose driveways are littered with bricks that refuse to die and who will buy a Volvo regardless , our advice is this :
If you ’re going to spend $ 40,000 on a 235 - hp , 3.2 - liter S80 , spend $ 43,000 and get the 281 - hp turbocharged 3.0 - liter .
2008 Pontiac Solstice / 2008 Saturn Sky
2.4 - liter inline - 4 , 5 - speed auto , rear - wheel drive
19 mpg city / 24 mpg highway
Talk about lose / lose :
The naturally aspirated versions of the Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky twins get worse gas mileage than the significantly faster and more interesting turbocharged Solstice GXP and Sky Red Line .
As equipped with the forced - induction 2.0 - liter Ecotec and an automatic , the pair streaks to 60 in a screaming 5.2 seconds .
With the base 2.4 - liter Ecotec under their sculpted hoods , they ’re two seconds slower to 60 and lose 2 mpg on the freeway .
It comes as little surprise that Lotus Engineering was responsible for much of the Ecotec ’s development , certainly having a greater impact on versions such as those installed in the GXP and Red Line .
The turbo 2.0 - liter — also installed in the Cobalt SS and HHR SS — is a techno powerhouse , featuring cutting - edge bits such as direct injection and a twin - scroll , quick - spooling turbocharger .
The 2.4 - liter features high - compression variable valve timing and makes decent numbers , but decent is n’t good enough when your little roadster weighs a ton and a half .
Even the porkmeister A4 cabriolet gets 21 city and 30 highway .
Given the environmental benefits , it ’s obvious to us that the turbocharged Ecotec should fill the role of base engine , with a 300 - hp twin - charged version taking over for the hot - rod Red Line and GXP .

Suddenly , the economic consensus seems to be that the implosion of the housing market will indeed push the U.S. economy into a recession , and that it ’s quite possible that we ’re already in one .
As a result , over the next few weeks we ’ll be hearing a lot about plans for economic stimulus .
Since this is an election year , the debate over how to stimulate the economy is inevitably tied up with politics .
And here ’s a modest suggestion for political reporters .
Instead of trying to divine the candidates ’ characters by scrutinizing their tone of voice and facial expressions , why not pay attention to what they say about economic policy ?
In fact , recent statements by the candidates and their surrogates about the economy are quite revealing .
Take , for example , John McCain ’s admission that economics is n’t his thing .
“ The issue of economics is not something I ’ve understood as well as I should , ” he says .
“ I ’ve got Greenspan ’s book . ”
Listen to uncut MP3 of this talk ( 45 mins. , 25MB )
Gin Blossoms frontman Robin Wilson is , no doubt , one of the nicest people to ever sell five million albums worldwide .
He ’s genuine , warm , and gregarious .
When I first approached ( accosted ? )
Robin about this interview outside a brewpub in Tempe , Arizona , I closed our brief meeting by apologizing for my intrusion .
“ No problem , ” he said , handing me his business card .
“ Just shoot me an e-mail . ”
Matt Okie : Now , if I ’m not mistaken , you were 23 years old back in 1988 when you first joined the Gin Blossoms as a guitarist .
You turn 43 this summer .
You ’ve been in the band almost 20 years .
How do your goals both as a songwriter and as a band change as you get older ?
Robin Wilson :
As a songwriter , they have n’t really changed at all .
My goals are the same : to write great songs that express what I feel , that have melody , and are based on my influences — people like Tom Petty and Cheap Trick .
That ’s the kind of music that I like to write , and I think is appropriate for the Gin Blossoms .
So in that sense , my goals as a songwriter really have n’t changed .
I ’m just as ambitious as ever .
With the band — when you ’re young — all you can think about is getting on MTV and getting a Buzz Clip .
But actually , when we first started , our goals were even more humble than that .
It was , like , if we could just headline The Mason Jar on Friday night , we ’d be a pretty big deal .
And then it ’s , well , if we can get a record out and go to South By Southwest .
And then it evolves to , we need a “ deal ” and a song on the radio .
And then , all of a sudden , you ’re trying to follow up a platinum record and your goal is to not drop the ball , to come up with something that can hold up to your original release .
And — you know — anymore , the goal is n’t so much about the Buzz Clip and the platinum record .
It ’s about maintaining a career and maintaining a following and not having to go back and get a job at the record store again .
MO : Did you ever work at Zia Records [ an Arizona / Nevada CD chain ] ?
RW : I worked at Zia .
I worked at Tower .
And I worked at Rockaway .
I ’ve been fired from every decent record store in Arizona .
MO : Was it the Zia Records near Arizona State University ?
RW : Yeah , I worked there for a couple of years .
Those were great days .
Actually , I was working there when I joined the Gin Blossoms .
Bill Leen , the bass player , was working over at Tower , and I had worked with him over at Tower Records .
And he called me up when I was at work one day at Zia and asked me to audition for the band .
Told me that they were firing one of the original members and that they needed another guitar player .
And , you know , I tried to convince him that I was n’t a very good guitar player .
But they wanted me to try out anyway .
And so when Jessie and I first sang together , we sang a couple of BoDeans songs .
And everyone in the room right away could feel it was working .
It was very exciting .
We all went down to Long Wong ’s [ infamous Tempe , AZ bar ] and had a drink .
And I walked into the bathroom , and they were all in there , like , in a huddle , you know , going , “ Let ’s get him .
Let ’s ask him to join . ”
I was all , “ Are you talking about me ? ” Really exciting .
Really great time .
MO : Now I ’m a relative newcomer to Tempe : where is the Long Wong ’s that birthed the Gin Blossoms ?
RW : It used to be at Mill and Seventh in downtown Tempe , and now it ’s a parking lot .
But it had been there for a long time .
And we became sort of the house band in ’ 88 and ’ 89 .
We played there every Tuesday for a couple of years , and we played a lot of weekends , too .
It ’s estimated in 1989 that we played at Long Wong ’s something , like , one hundred forty , one hundred fifty times .
We just basically lived there .
I also did acoustic happy hours there for years and years .
You know , it was our Star - Club .
It was our Hamburg , as it were .
MO : On YouTube , there ’s a brief , student - produced film entitled Robin Wilson in which you say that “ it feels good to sing . ”
Do you mean that singing is simply cathartic , or is it grander than that ?
RW : What I think I was referring to was actually the physical and emotional sensation of singing .
I mean , physically it feels great , like getting a back rub , or jerking off .
It ’s really pleasant .
And aside from that , I really enjoy performing .
MO : I was struck by those comments .
As many different interviews as I ’ve read and as many different MTV News clips as I ’ve seen over the years , I ’ve never heard a singer say that .
It seems like the most obvious thing .
At some physiological level , it literally feels good to sing .
I ’ve never heard that before .
RW : I meant it , and I still do .
In fact , last night , I played here on Long Island .
I live on Long Island now part - time .
And I have n’t done my acoustic show in years and years , so I found a place here on Long Island .
I ’m doing a series of three Wednesday night gigs .
I ’m basically doing all the same material that I used to do at Long Wong ’s .
Now I ’m singing those same tunes on Long Island .
That ’s the reason I do it — I enjoy singing .
I enjoy entertaining .
It was important to me also to share all of these songs with my friends and family on Long Island .
It was kind of shocking to a few people .
Like my brother - in - law , for example , had no idea that I had any interest in some of the tunes I did — oldies from Dion and The Belmonts , Sam Cooke , people like that .
My brother - in - law assumed that I did n’t have any knowledge of that type of music , so he was particularly impressed .
And that ’s kind of why I did it , so I could share my influences with my friends and family .
MO : Does your musical ability come more from your mother ’s side of the family or your father ’s side ?
Or is there no musical lineage in the Wilson family ?
RW : I do n’t really feel there is a musical lineage in the Wilson family , although my father was a drummer .
But I never saw him play the drums .
I never saw him play in a band .
And it was n’t something that he particularly encouraged me to do .
But certainly a lot of the songs I sang last night came from the stack of singles he used to pile on the turntable every weekend .
He ’d play the same ten singles , and then he ’d flip ’em over , and they would all drop down one at a time .
Those songs have resonated for my entire life .
And , you know , I sang a handful of ’em last night .
So I suppose my dad did have some influence , but as I said , he was n’t thinking I should be a musician or anything like that .
He ’s far too stodgy to think that ’s a practical way to go .
MO : What happened between Dusted ( 1989 ) , your original self - released album , and New Miserable Experience ( 1992 ) , your major label debut ?
Dusted feels a little more raucous to me , a little more “ from the hip , ” while New Miserable Experience feels a lot more polished , a lot more streamlined .
Does that have a lot to do with Memphis - based producer John Hampton [ who has also worked with Jimmie Vaughan , The White Stripes , North Mississippi Allstars , etc. ] , or was that purely something you guys were looking to do — change directions ?
RW : John Hampton had a huge influence on us .
We ’ve always thought of him as the sixth member of the band .
He ’s always been a mentor and close friend , and his advice has always guided us .
But a lot of that is just a natural evolution of a band .
When we recorded Dusted , we were kind of all on our own , and we did it in , like , a day .
We basically just played our set , and we did n’t think to slow it down a little bit or anything like that .
We just charged into the studio and started drinking and played our songs .
When the record came out , we were all like , “ Why did n’t we slow it down a little ? ” I ca n’t listen to that record because it just sounds like we ’re The Chipmunks .
We ’re just blasting through everything at a hundred sixty beats - a- minute .
There ’s just no discipline , and we were undisciplined — we were a bunch of young , drunken rock - n- rollers .
MO : Some of Dusted does have an almost Uncle Tupelo , alt - country feel .
RW : I can hear that too actually .
One group that I realized a number of years ago that had really influenced us — without any of us ever really acknowledging it or talking about it — was The Long Ryders .
I dug up one of their records like six years ago , and I put it on , and I thought , “ Holy crap , that ’s us !
This is where we came from . ”
And I realized then that all of us had been fans of The Long Ryders .
I think that they had some measurable influence on us without us ever really realizing it .
We were always more focused on the obvious influences like The Byrds and Petty and Cheap Trick .
The Church was another group that I always thought that we did a lot to emulate .
I know that Doug [ Hopkins ] and Bill [ Leen ] were very big fans of The Church .
I was a big fan of The Church .
I thought that they influenced Doug Hopkins ’ songwriting quite a bit .
MO : To me , one of the primary lyrical themes of Gin Blossoms , as indicated by titles such as New Miserable Experience and Congratulations I ’m Sorry , is the idea that joy and grief go hand in hand — that they ’re ultimately inseparable .
How much of that philosophy , at the time , was just twenty - something angst , and how much of it can be attributed to the fact that at the Gin Blossoms ’ commercial apex in 1993 - 94 , the band was also dealing with the death of former guitarist Doug Hopkins ?
RW : You nailed it .
It was not only just angst and humor , but that ’s also what we felt .
And then when it came time to come up with a title for [ the follow - up to New Miserable Experience ] , Bill , our bass player , came up with [ Congratulations I ’m Sorry ] .
And it ’s because that is what people were saying to us in those days right after Doug Hopkins ’ [ suicide ] .
Literally , someone would say , “ Congratulations on your success ” and “ I ’m really sorry to hear about your friend . ”
It just became a poignant way to describe what we were feeling .
MO : During those initial shows in 1993 after Doug Hopkins ’ death , how difficult was it to take the stage and play “ Hey Jealousy , ” “ Found Out About You , ” “ Pieces Of The Night , ” etc . ?
Can you remember what it was like to have to play those songs ?
RW : I ’ll never forget what it was like — it was grueling .
The whole experience of losing Doug Hopkins was a gut - wrenching , heart - wrenching experience .
Nobody wanted to fire him ; there was simply no way around it .
It was either break up the band , or try and find another way to do it .
And I wish we could go back in time and try to find a way for Doug to become a Brian Wilson - type character , where he was still a part of the band and still writing songs and still recording with us , but maybe we had somebody else out on the road .
I do n’t know if that would ’ve worked , but it was something that we did n’t know to even try and explore .
But there ’s no doubt in my mind , though , that Doug would ’ve never made it .
He would ’ve been one of those guys that the first time you go to MTV , he would ’ve been , like , spilling beer and peeing in the hallway .
As brilliant as he was , he just did n’t have the discipline to really be a professional .
The work that we had to do to break the record and become a national act was far , far beyond anything we had to do playing one hundred fifty shows at Long Wong ’s in a year .
You just cannot compare .
You know , it ’s like the difference between going to med school and actually doing your residency .
That ’s what it ’s like : when you get signed to a major label , and you get out there in the van for the first time , and you ’re away from home for months at a time — you just have no idea as a local band what that is really going to be like .
And that is why so many groups end up breaking up after their first tours .
Until you ’ve spent two months in the van , fighting it out on the road , and living with each other in a smelly van , you just ca n’t know what it ’s going to be like .
And there ’s no doubt in my mind that Doug Hopkins never would ’ve been able to survive that .
He would ’ve either quit or …there ’s no telling what would ’ve happened .
MO : Do you still play “ Pieces Of The Night ” live ?
I think that ’s really the most underrated Doug Hopkins song on New Miserable Experience .
RW : You ’re right ; it ’s a beautiful , beautiful song .
It ’s been a few years , but we were playing that a few years back .
We had a really nice version of it .
And it ’s my hope to bring it back into the set this summer .
But , you know , as a group , we have a lot of songs in that tempo .
We have to sort of pick and choose which mid-tempo ballads we ’re going to play , and for the last couple of years , we ’ve been focusing on those that are on our latest record .
MO : One final Doug Hopkins question .
Is it true that Doug Hopkins ’ original lyric for “ Hey , Jealousy ” was “ you can trust me not to drink ” instead of “ you can trust me not to think ” ?
RW : That is true .
It ’s just that we had so many booze references in our lyrics in those days .
I suggested to Doug why do n’t you just let me sing “ think ” this time .
MO : There seems to be a veiled quality to many of your lyrics , as if the characters who inhabit your songs are afraid to reveal too much of themselves and their stories to the audience .
For example , in the song “ Allison Road , ” it ’s unclear if Allison Road is a place of ruin , redemption , or both .
In “ Not Only Numb , ” it ’s unclear why the narrator is so distraught over his apparent homecoming .
Why this veiled quality — is it something you ’re shooting for , or is it merely accidental ?
RW : It does come naturally ; it ’s not something I have to think about too much when I write lyrics .
I ’ll admit I have attempted to cultivate a persona , or at least , express a certain type of lyrical vision .
But I ca n’t admit that I try really , really hard to think of brilliant things .
I just kind of do what comes naturally , and I ’m fortunate that every once in a while even I think something I wrote is kind of clever .
MO : You do n’t consider yourself a poet ?
RW : Yeah , I do n’t even really consider myself a musician .
I ’m more of a rock - n- roller .
MO : In your song “ Allison Road , ” is Allison Road a place that enlivens or ruins the narrator ?
RW : Allison Road is more a place of joy , I suppose .
I was in a good place when I wrote that .
I was thinking very romantic thoughts when I wrote that song and those lyrics .
MO : Allison Road is not a literal road , is it ?
Allison is the love interest ’s name in the song ?
RW : There really is an Allison Road ; the girl ’s name was Channon .
It just kind of worked out .
There are specific references in that song to events …
MO : Is Allison Road in Phoenix somewhere ?
RW : No , it ’s actually on I - 10 between Austin and the West Texas border , somewhere .
A friend of mine was driving back from South By Southwest — and his sister ’s name was Allison — and he passed this road sign that said “ Allison Road , ” and for whatever reason , he took a photograph of it .
I do n’t know how , but somehow , I ended up with this picture .
It was just a picture of a road sign that said “ Allison Road . ”
As soon as I looked at it one day , all of a sudden I heard that melody in my head [ sings the lyric “ On Allison Road ” ] and I was just like , “ Holy crap , where ’s my guitar ? ”
MO : According to Wikipedia — and I realize that Wikipedia is not exactly the best source of information — your two A&M albums sold five million copies .
RW : That ’s more or less right .
Worldwide : yeah .
In the states , New Miserable was triple - platinum , or eventually eked up to triple - platinum .
It was double - platinum back in our heyday , but it ’s always continued to sell , and since then , it ’s gone over three million .
And then Congratulations I ’m Sorry sold about a million - and - a - half .
Combine that with our international sales , and I guess we ’re somewhere around five - million records sold .
MO : After those two records — and I ’m thinking now about your third album Major Lodge Victory [ released August 2006 by New York - based indie label Hybrid Recordings ] — is it frustrating to have produced such a great record …and to put it out there knowing that the same marketing muscle that helped make New Miserable Experience and Congratulations I ’m Sorry so huge is no longer in play ?
RW : Yeah , that is frustrating — yes ( laughs ) .
MO : I ’ve literally been blown away by Major Lodge Victory .
I was a huge fan of New Miserable Experience back in my undergraduate days .
And I liked Congratulations I ’m Sorry — I ’ve actually come to love that record more in the last few years than I did in my twenties .
But when I picked up Major Lodge Victory , I was just blown away that ten years had passed since 1996 ’s Congratulations I ’m Sorry , and you guys were as good , if not better , than you ’d ever been before .
The melodies on Major Lodge Victory are just stunning .
RW : Thank you very much .
Well , that ’s what we were shooting for : we wanted something that was going to hold up to our catalog .
We ’re very proud that we managed to pull that off and satisfy ourselves in that sense .
And , yes , you ’re right — it ’s very frustrating .
You know , just last night , I was playing at that club on Long Island , and afterwards , I was signing some autographs for these three ladies , and one of ’em said , “ Well , I sure hope you ’re still doing something with your voice . ”
And I ’m like : the Gin Blossoms are together .
We released a record last year ; we ’re playing at B.B. King ’s in New York City this May .
And these girls are , like , “ Really , you guys are still together ? ”
Most of the people in this country do not realize that we ’re back together again .
That ’s the major frustration for me , because I believe — with genuine humility — that if people knew we were back together again , and we were in the public consciousness that we would be considered contemporaries of groups like Counting Crows and Live , those bands from our era and our ilk that never broke up .
It ’s very frustrating to me that most people do n’t know .
We ’re still very fortunate that we have a career and that we can make a good living playing our music .
And we ’ve got thirty - something - thousand MySpace friends , which is a great number .
But , you know , I hang out with these young bands , like this group from Pittsburgh called Punchline — they ’re friends of mine — and they ’ve got seventy - five thousand MySpace friends .
What it works out to , basically , is however many MySpace friends you have : that ’s about how many records you can sell — at least …on your own .
And so , right now , with the way things are changing — record stores across the country are closing , CD sales are down , digital downloads are up .
You do n’t necessarily need a record company to sell .
We do n’t need a record company to sell our music to those thirty thousand people .
We can do it directly .
And thirty thousand people are more than enough to support our records and to keep our career going .
We ’re very seriously considering how to release our next album , and whether or not we ’re going to do it on our own , you know , Radiohead - style .
We ’re exploring all that right now .
And we ’re working on new material as we speak .
We ’ll definitely have something out this year ; I do n’t know if we ’re going to get it out this summer .
But , now again , if we decide to do it ourselves , we do n’t need to rely on a record company to put it on their calendar and three months of preparation or any of that .
We can pretty much just finish it , master it , and put it up online .
The only places it seems anymore that you really need to sell CDs are : at your shows and through your website .
In the past , it always took so much effort and [ money ] to get a band into record stores across the country .
That was one of the main things you needed a record company for — so that you could be in every Tower Records .
But , obviously , Tower Records is gone .
And most of the others are shutting down .
It does n’t make any sense now to spend any money …or effort trying to get CDs into stores across the country .
We ’re in a really good place right now .
We ’re very fortunate to have our thirty thousand MySpace friends .
We ’re one of those bands … that are in a position to do it on their own .
Major labels will always exist ; there are always going to be huge pop stars who require that type of machinery , but …we do n’t need that .
I would like to be on the radio around the country , and I would like to be back in the public consciousness .
But again , if that never happens , as long as we can maintain our current level of career , then we ’re more than satisfied and very fortunate .
MO : Is the album — at this point in history — mostly just a freebie giveaway that entices fans to attend a show , where bands make the lion ’s share of their cash ?
RW : No , no , I do n’t think so .
It ’s certainly a great promotional tool .
That ’s how we make our money : by playing live .
Licensing our music to TV and movies is an important avenue for us to fully exploit .
I think selling records is still a viable way to make a living and [ a way ] for bands to get their music out there .
There are always going to be promotional freebies , you know .
We gave away sampler cassettes back in the early days .
And I ’m sure that we ’ll come up with some sort of free bonus tracks or something along those lines when we release the next record .
MO : I ’ve read that you ’re a huge , huge Tom Petty fan .
And I think I read too that when you ’re on stage , you sort of pretend that you are Tom Petty .
RW : I do n’t remember saying that exactly , but , yes , that ’s certainly in my consciousness .
This all started with me lip - synching in front of the mirror when I was eight years old .
I do this because those people were my heroes , and I want to be like them .
I want to make people feel the way that those people made me feel .
MO : Who else , besides Petty , has inspired you ?
RW : Freddie Mercury of Queen is certainly one of my heroes .
I would not be a musician if it was n’t for Queen ’s influence .
In fact , when I saw the video for “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” on Midnight Special … that was the moment I knew I wanted to be a singer in a rock band .
I ’ve just never turned away from that desire .
I ’m incredibly fortunate that I ’m doing what I dreamed about doing when I was eight .
MO : Do you think that as adults , we are all , more or less , chasing dreams hatched during our youth ?
Is that a staple of modern American existence ?
RW : If we ’re lucky .
Absolutely .
I hope that everyone has the opportunity to …do what they want and contribute something positive to the world without having to [ work ] some depressing day - to - day job .
I know that I ’m very fortunate to be doing what I do , and I do n’t take it for granted at all .
MO : Is the word “ victory ” in the title of Major Lodge Victory a metaphor for the creation of the album and the state of the band itself ?
RW : No , that whole title is an inside joke that goes back years and years , back to when Doug was in the band .
In fact , we had considered Major Lodge Victory as the title for both New Miserable Experience and Congratulations I ’m Sorry .
It was , ah … I ’ll tell you the story real quick .
We were getting on the Hollywood Freeway … after a long weekend .
The moment we got on the freeway , the hood of our van , like , blew [ open ] and covered the windshield , so we could n’t see .
I was driving the van .
And we could n’t see , and everyone started screaming and screaming .
And before this , Doug had been saying the whole time , all morning long , he ’s like : “ Let ’s not drive home .
Let ’s just check into a hotel , and go find a bar . ”
You know , Doug was always like that .
And then he saw a sign that read , Lodge .
So he kept going , “ Lodge — Lodge — let ’s go to the Lodge . ”
Then we got on the freeway , the hood flew up , and everyone was screaming .
It was like Dumb And Dumber or something .
I mean , it was really comical .
Everyone was shrieking and screaming , and I slowly pulled over to the side of the freeway , so we did n’t get killed .
I looked over at everyone and said , “ Let ’s go to a hotel . ”
And Doug goes : “ Major…Lodge…victory ! ”
We always just held on to that phrase as a really great moment for us .
MO : Is it urban legend , or is there really a secret entrance from your studio into Four Peaks [ the all - world brewpub adjacent to Robin ’s studio , Uranus Recording ] ?
RW : There was — up until about three weeks ago .
I just had it bricked up .
Originally , when we moved into that studio , the brewery was n’t there .
We used to go through this door that is now inside the brewery .
When they opened the brewery , they had to build me a new door … out in front .
And we basically just sealed the [ original ] door up — I had it filled with blankets and crap , you know , to keep the sound from the brewery down .
And then , eventually , I rebuilt the door , so it would be easier to get in and out of the brewery ( laughs ) .
For about six months , I kind of got away with it , where it was really fun to just go down to the studio , open up the door to the brewery , and I could just walk in there and get food or whatever .
It was a blast .
It was so much fun , especially late at night .
I remember I went to see some friends of mine in a band called Thriving Ivory , and I brought ’em back to the studio at , like , midnight .
We were partying in the studio and walking in and out of the brewery .
It was just so much fun .
[ Around the same time ] I was also trying to get radio stations to bring artists into the studio for private concerts .
One of things I wanted to offer as part of that “ package ” was seating at the brewery , and then you go right from the brewery into the studio .
But there are all these laws about where you can take booze .
The brewery has just got too much at stake .
They ’ve grown and grown so much that they just cannot risk having that door open at any time .
Every time I would open it , they would frown at me .
And I ’d be standing in the studio , hearing all this noise coming in from that doorway , and I was like , “ Well , if I ca n’t open the damn thing , I ’m just gonna brick it up . ”
So just finished that a couple weeks ago .
It was a really cool thing , but now it ’s just the brick wall .
MO : Discuss the irony of a Gin Blossom owning a recording studio that ’s next to a brewpub .
RW : Well , uh , you know , it is ironic .
You ’re right … but actually , it ’s incredibly fortunate as a studio owner to have such a cool place right next to the studio .
It really enhances the vibe ; it really makes it easy for the bands to have a place to go and have lunch and get a good beer .
There are all those pretty girls over there , plus the waitresses .
I ’ve worked at lots of studios around the country , and I ’ve never seen one that has a brewery that close ( laughs ) … especially one as cool as Four Peaks .
But , you know , more than it being [ next to ] a brewery , what I ’m really proud of is that we ’re in one of the oldest buildings in Arizona , and that I ’m now steward of one of the most historic buildings in my hometown .
It was the first building to have telephone service — I mean , my room specifically — was the first room to have telephone service on that side of Tempe .
And the remnants of all that old electrical and all the old wiring , it ’s still there .
You know , Arizona ’s such a young state — to have my studio in such a historic … building is really a privilege , especially being in my hometown .
I think the studio is my legacy to my hometown .
And when I designed it , I wanted it to feel timeless .
I did n’t want it to feel like one of those high - tech , modern studios .
I wanted it to feel like 1959 .
So it would feel like the studio has always been there .
So I went way out of my way to evoke an atomic - age style through the lamps and the fabric , all the decorations , the acoustics themselves — everything has been hand - built the way they used to make studios back in the ’50s and ’60s .
MO : You ’re not running analog at Uranus Recording , are you ?
RW : I used to — I got rid of it .
I ’m all Pro Tools now ; I ’ve got a Pro Tools / HD rig because , you know , you ’ve got to have a system that works for every single client .
And when I had an analog machine , I did n’t have a very good mixing board — so it was fine to record at my studio , but you ’d want to take it somewhere else to mix .
And I needed to keep the clients there , so I went with the HD system .
But it really does feel like an old studio .
I looked through old books of recording studios and went out of my way to emulate their look and their construction , so that it would be something timeless …
MO : I know you alluded to this earlier in the interview , but when can fans expect a new Gin Blossoms album ?
Is John Hampton producing ?
RW : We ’re not really sure .
It ’s likely we ’re going to be doing it mostly on our own — self - producing it in my studio .
Especially if we ’re financing it ourselves , we wo n’t be able to afford to go out to Memphis and spend $ 1,000 dollars a day on studio time and get five hotel rooms for weeks and weeks and weeks .
Why not just do it at my studio , and all the band will have to do is reimburse me for the power ?
John Hampton has been out there .
When I was in the Gas Giants , we brought John Hampton out to Tempe and recorded there .
But I think as of now — although we really have n’t discussed it much — the tentative plan is to self - produce it .
Oh , and final answer to your question : by the end of this year — god help me — we ’ll have a new record out .
MO : Are Gin Blossoms playing Tempe or Phoenix any time soon ?
RW : We ’re waiting for the Tempe Music Festival to call us back .
They made us a really great offer , and we were going to play with Fergie .
But for the last week , we have n’t been able to get ‘em on the phone or something like that .
So hopefully , we ’ll be at the Tempe Music Fest .
And then sometime before the end of the year — if I can help it — we ’re going to have some kind of a twentieth anniversary celebration in Phoenix , where we ’ll do a real club show .
Mostly in Phoenix for the last few years , all we ’ve done are festivals and charity gigs .
And I would like to play a club where people like to go and see music .
But , you know , there are economics involved .
We ’re involved with all of the promoters in Phoenix , so there ’s a lot of politics involved in where we play and who we play with .
It ’s not as simple as it sounds .
God help me , we ’ll be doing a twentieth anniversary club date in Phoenix before the end of the year .
Visit the Gin Blossoms on MySpace .

Is The Internet Dangerous ?
The Free Exchange of Ideas vs. Censorship
Do you feel angry or even afraid when you hear that the government or other organizations are trying to control the content of your entertainment and your information ?
There are laws and regulations that control the content of television , movies , video games , and to a lesser extent , the Internet .
The rules have gotten more lenient over time , but they ’re still there .
Why is the government trying to control the content of the Internet ?
Many people are concerned that some of the content on the Internet exerts a bad influence on our children , and even on society in general .
Still other people are frightened by the sheer power of the Internet , and the unknown ways in which it may influence our future .
I do n’t deny that the Internet has a powerful influence over us .
You might discount that influence , saying that everything and everyone we meet has an influence on us .
That ’s true .
Still , the Internet is unique for it ’s size , speed , and easy access to people everywhere .
This gives the Internet the power to connect us to every idea and influence that exists .
And the Internet provides virtual communities where people with common interests “ live ” together .
Hopefully you and I make choices about which influences we let into our heads and hearts and homes .
There are plenty of things that I do n’t want to see , or let my children see .
It ’s not ridiculous to try and limit our exposure to hatred , violence , child pornography , terrorism , etc .
But it ’s troubling to give the government the power to control what we see and hear .
Many people would like to live in a world without restrictions , not trusting government to always act in our best interests .
But what happens when violence or some other undesirable influence becomes so wide spread that we can no longer avoid it , and we can no longer keep it away from our children ?
Here we are .
You can drastically limit these influences , if you get rid of television and movies .
But outside of tightly knit religious communities , most people are n’t willing to go that far .
And even with movies and TV out of the picture , the Internet , and its many communities remain .
The Internet is the most extraordinary , powerful tool , and like virtually any tool it can be used for good or evil .
It brings us together , and it makes it easy to encounter any idea imaginable .
Virtual Worlds : The Final Frontier
But there is something new that has taken shape on the Internet , which may ultimately dwarf the importance of the Internet ’s communities : Virtual Worlds .
Many people will dismiss these as nothing more than multi-player video games .
We ’ve had complex games for years , have n’t we ?
The millions of people networking , sharing information , and living together through the Internet have irrevocably changed society , partly by making the Internet an integral part of our daily activities , and partly by changing our expectations of relationships , information , and commerce in a way that has carried over into brick and mortar parts of the economy .
So too the millions of people spending hours in virtual worlds will change the culture outside of the games , partly by making it commonplace for people to spend hours in virtual worlds , living other lives , and partly by changing the expectations that those players will have of their non-virtual worlds .
The numbers of people spending hours in these games is growing quickly .
Soon there will be hundreds of millions of people spending time in these worlds .
These worlds have culture , economies , and meaning .
The people who play these games find meaning in their identities and lives within the game , often more meaning than in their everyday lives .
Does it sound foolish or crazy to you ?
The players in these worlds think about their time in the games as just living there .
Virtual worlds on the Internet enable us to lead simulated lives that we care about .
This kind of experience has immeasurably more power to influence us than our relationships within the existing virtual communities , or the presentation of the same ideas in any other format .
BERLIN ( Reuters ) -
An elderly German who hid a stolen suit under his clothes was caught because he forgot to take it off the hanger , police said Wednesday .
A sales assistant at a men ’s outfitter in the western city of Aachen noticed the hanger bulging out when the man told her he had decided against buying anything .
“ Only a sign saying ‘ stop me , I ’m a thief ! ’ would have made the thief look more unprofessional , ” police said in a statement .

About 700,000 bpd oil production lost costing £ 40 million / day @ $ 110 per barrel • About 70 million cubic meters natural gas production lost per day costing £ 42 million / day @ 60 p / therm • BP , Shell , Exxon - Mobil , BG Group , Conoco - Philips , Chevron - Texaco , Total , Marathon , Tallisman , Nexen , Venture , Dana and many more companies affected • Global energy prices rise • Rural Scottish economy hit hardest by fuel shortages •
Risk level is raised throughout the system •
Worker 's grievance is unresolved • Population calm , politicians panic , fuel rationing looms ?

While the fate of energy flows into Britain were being sealed on Monday and Tuesday this week , Gordon Brown was pre-occupied with the past , let alone the present or the future , trying desperately to undo tax muddles that he himself created .
Gordon Brown will be remembered as one of the greatest Followers this country ever had .
BP have begun the process of closing the Forties Pipeline according to this Reuters report .
This is some 30 hours in advance of the planned 2 day strike by 1200 workers at Grangemouth Oil Refinery operated by private equity firm Ineos .
The closure of the Forties Pipeline will likely result in closure of around 60 offshore oil and gas fields that feed oil and condensate into the pipeline .
Around 700,000 bpd oil and 70 million cubic meters ( MCM ) per day gas production will be lost costing UK plc around £ 90 million per day at spot prices .
It is relatively straight forward to shut down the pipeline and all the fields that feed it , but the process of restarting production will likely be significantly more complex .
It seems possible that up to 6 days production may be lost .
BP once owned and operated the Grangemouth refinery and the Forties pipeline in addition to the off shore Forties Field .
In 2003 BP sold the refinery to private equity firm Ineos and the Forties field to Apache corporation .
This is a tightly coupled complex system best operated by a single responsible owner .
The pipeline terminal at Kinneil depends on power from the refinery to operate , hence with closure of the refinery the pipeline and all associated infrastructure must now close .
Questions should be asked about the wisdom of allowing the dependency of around one half of UK North Sea production to fall into the hands of a private equity investor .
A note on gas supply and demand .
Annual gas demand is cyclic reaching a maximum in the winter months Dec - Feb .
Since we are now past the peak demand period this will make it easier to source gas by cycling up the remaining UK production and by asking the Norwegians to raise their gas production .
However , persistent high spot prices this spring seem to betray un-seasonal tightness of gas supply in the The European Gas Market .
1 = falling demand and 2&3 = falling indigenous gas supplies .
Where might this end ?
See below .
A glimpse of the future :
This is an un-audited draft model showing how UK gas supplies may evolve .
In future we need not worry so much about UK strikes since we will no longer be producing significant quantities of gas .
We will need to worry about missile strikes in the countries from where we are destined to import LNG .
For a number of years Norway will be a vital supplier of natural gas to the UK .
But their gas production may start to decline from 2009 .
With price of Westexas Intermediate crossing $ 120 / barrel and UK day ahead gas prices pushing 69 p / therm the cost of this action will be felt by all gas and petrol consumers in the UK and further afield .
The UK government has either been wholly ignorant of or indifferent towards the consequences of this dispute .
At winters end gas storage is run down .
From current stock levels , short range storage may produce 18 MCM per day for 2.5 days , medium range storage may provide about 27 MCM / day for around 6 days and long range storage around 42 MCM / day for about 21 days .
Fortunately , mild spring weather will ease the demand for natural gas .
I would estimate the value of potential lost production to be approximately £ 40 million per day for oil and £ 50 million per day for gas ( at spot prices ) .
Platts report that the Forties Pipeline could be disrupted for 6 days as a result of the strike .
The potential losses to oil companies and to the government 's lost tax revenues seem wholly disproportionate to the grievance of the Grangemouth workers .
It is the Westminster government that has responsibility for UK energy matters and taxation .
The original TOD thread is here , and thanks to all posters for their contributions and links .
Grangemouth lies at the end of the Forties oil pipeline system that gathers oil ( and liquids ) from oil and gas fields throughout a large area of the Central North Sea .
Whilst Grangemouth processes around 200,000 bpd the pipeline system handles around 700,000 bpd and according to this CNN report , a BP spokesman has said they may have to shut down the whole pipeline system .
With the global oil market and European gas market already stretched , the impact of this dispute may reverberate around the world .
Why Grangemouth is important
Grangemouth is much more that an oil refinery .
Originally operated by BP , Grangemouth became an integral part of the Forties oil production , transportation , refining and export system .
BP has since sold the Forties oil field to Apache corporation and the refinery to Ineos but it still operates the pipeline and a number of the oil and gas fields that feed into it .
Grangemouth oil refinery lies close to the Kinneil terminal and is an integral part of this massive oil and gas production and transportation system .
Ineos have reported that if the refinery is closed it may take over a week to restart .
So a two day dispute over pensions may have a disproportionate impact .
If as reported by CNN , the whole Forties pipeline system were to close then this will shut down about half of the UK oil and a significant amount of gas production .
World oil supplies are already stretched and this will push prices even higher - but the UK will be able to buy oil on the international market .
I have heard that BP is trying to determine whether the Hound Point terminal has the storage capacity to handle the flow and offload from there without taking the system down .
The thinking is , if only the Grangemouth refinery shuts down , and Hound Point and its oil storage facility operate normally , oil and gas production losses could be minimised .
The situation with natural gas is much different .
Prices have been rising steadily this year betraying tightness in the European and Global gas markets .
At the end of the winter UK and European gas storage is run down and the UK may struggle to maintain gas supplies .
This is what one of TOD 's many friends had to say :
I do n't know about the refinery side , but having worked at St Fergus for a year or so , I can vouch for the fact that the ability to process gas is linked to the ability to export the liquid ends via Mossmorran and Grangemouth .
There are three St Fergus gas processing sites and each has different links to the downstream liquids market .
It gets complex depending on exactly what facilities are offline , and there are other things that can be done like shutdown fields producing wet gas and condensate and limit gas coming in to dry gas from FLAGS / Fulmar line and then ' optimise ' the gas processing to ' spike ' as much of the heavier ends as possible into the gas network .
That can limit the volume of liquids they need to push down the pipelines towards Grangemouth but can only go so far if there is a complete shutdown .
UK " spot gas prices " have been rising steadily for a year as UK domestic supplies continue to run down and a cold winter in N America and E Asia has caused increased competition for LNG deliveries .
Domestic users need not worry since they will always be the last to get cut off .
But in the event of a natural gas shortage , those industrial users who pay the reduced interruptible supply tariff may just find their supplies interrupted .
Consequences for fuel supplies in Scotland and North England
Grangemouth is the only oil refinery in Scotland producing gasoline , diesel , fuel oil and jet fuel for the whole of Scotland , Northern Ireland and Northern England .
UK has ample stocks of refined fuel and so the real issue for Scotland is the distribution of these stocks .
This has been the main focus of the main stream news thus far and panic buying has already led to local gasoline shortages and profiteering at the pump .
Cause of the strike
The strike is about Ineos proposals to adjust the terms of the final salary pension scheme for workers at the refinery .
Why then can Ineos not afford to fully fund the existing pension scheme ?
High feed stock costs for their refining operations , high energy costs , rising interest costs , high inflation throughout the engineering sector , adverse currency movements and zero stock market returns since the year 2000 may all help explain the dilemma that Ineos finds itself in .

In a world that has produced zero to negative stock market capital returns since the year 2000 , is it reasonable for any workers to cling to unrealistic pension promises struck decades ago that are founded upon the notion of limitless supply of cheap fossil fuel ?
The majority if not all of these factors are rooted in the inability of planet Earth to now provide the growth in low cost fossil fuel energy that powered economic growth and wealth creation throughout the 20th Century .
It is no longer a realistic expectation for any workers to be granted a generous pension at age 60 when OECD life expectancy is now over 80 .
The free fossil fuel energy slaves that created this aspiration in the 20th Century are now getting tired and will soon be exhausted .
It is the failure of government and leadership throughout the UK and the World to recognise and tackle the unfolding energy crisis that has led us to Grangemouth .
With reported debt of around € 9 billion , let us hope that Ineos has the financial strength and will to weather this storm .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Women can influence the gender of their child with what they eat before they conceive , according to new research that lends scientific support to age - old superstitions about pregnancy .
The study of 740 women showed that higher calorie intake led to a higher probability of a male birth .
The discovery shows higher calorie intake prior to conception can significantly increase the chances of having a son while women on restricted diets are more likely to produce daughters .
Scientists at Britain's Oxford and Exeter Universities , who studied eating habits of 740 women during their first - time pregnancies , say that their findings seem to back certain traditional links between diet and gender while disproving others .
" We were able to confirm the old wives ' tale that eating bananas and so having a high potassium intake was associated with having a boy , as was a high sodium intake , " research leader Fiona Mathews , a specialist in mammalian biology at Exeter University , told the Guardian newspaper .
" But the old take about drinking a lot of milk to have a girl does n't seem to hold up .
In fact , more calcium meant they were again more likely to have a boy . "
Mathews said the study pointed to a simple technique to influencing the chances of a male birth : Eating a bowl of cereal for breakfast .
" If you want a boy , eat a healthy diet with a high calorie intake , including breakfast , " she told New Scientist magazine .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Health Library
" Of women eating cereals daily , 59 percent had boys , compared with only 43 percent who bore boys in the group eating less than a bowlful per week . "
The researchers said that a higher calorie intake prior to conception can increase the chances of having a son from ten to 11 boys in every 20 births , according to the study published in the Proceeding of the Royal Society B .
They said it could explain why male births in richer countries are experiencing a slight reduction .

Low blood levels of vitamin D have long been associated with disease , and the assumption has been that vitamin D supplements may protect against disease .
However , this new research demonstrates that ingested vitamin D is immunosuppressive and that low blood levels of vitamin D may be actually a result of the disease process .
Supplementation may make the disease worse .
In a new report Trevor Marshall , Ph.D. , professor at Australia ’s Murdoch University School of Biological Medicine and Biotechnology , explains how increased vitamin D intake affects much more than just nutrition or bone health .
The paper explains how the Vitamin D Nuclear Receptor ( VDR ) acts in the repression or transcription of hundreds of genes , including genes associated with diseases ranging from cancers to multiple sclerosis .
" The VDR is at the heart of innate immunity , being responsible for expression of most of the antimicrobial peptides , which are the body ’s ultimate response to infection , " Marshall said .
" Molecular biology is now forcing us to re-think the idea that a low measured value of vitamin D means we simply must add more to our diet .
Supplemental vitamin D has been used for decades , and yet the epidemics of chronic disease , such as heart disease and obesity , are just getting worse . "
" Our disease model has shown us why low levels of vitamin D are observed in association with major and chronic illness , " Marshall added .
" Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone , and the body regulates the production of all it needs .
In fact , the use of supplements can be harmful , because they suppress the immune system so that the body cannot fight disease and infection effectively . "
Marshall 's research has demonstrated how ingested vitamin D can actually block VDR activation , the opposite effect to that of Sunshine .
Instead of a positive effect on gene expression , Marshall reported that his own work , as well as the work of others , shows that quite nominal doses of ingested vitamin D can suppress the proper operation of the immune system .
It is a different metabolite , a secosteroid hormone called 1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin D , which activates the VDR to regulate the expression of the genes .
Under conditions that exist in infection or inflammation , the body automatically regulates its production of all the vitamin D metabolites , including 25 - hydroxyvitamin D , the metabolite which is usually measured to indicate vitamin D status .
Vitamin D deficiency , long interpreted as a cause of disease , is more likely the result of the disease process , and increasing intake of vitamin D often makes the disease worse .
" Dysregulation of vitamin D has been observed in many chronic diseases , including many thought to be autoimmune , " said J.C. Waterhouse , Ph.D. , lead author of a book chapter on vitamin D and chronic disease .
" We have found that vitamin D supplementation , even at levels many consider desirable , interferes with recovery in these patients . "
" We need to discard the notion that vitamin D affects a disease state in a simple way , " Marshall said .
" Vitamin D affects the expression of over 1,000 genes , so we should not expect a simplistic cause and effect between vitamin D supplementation and disease .
The comprehensive studies are just not showing that supplementary vitamin D makes people healthier . "

I have an expression I present to my economics classes .
It has a certain impact : the US is a a third world nation , we just have n't realized it yet .
Our emerging status is n't obvious .
Products remain relatively cheap ( energy excluded ) despite the falling value of the dollar against most foreign currencies .
But there are real signs .
Most Americans who are paying attention have noticed a long term decline in manufacturing jobs in the US .
Quarter after quarter , year after year , the government reports job gains , but those gains are primarily in service industries : health care ( we 're not talking doctors , here ) , restaurants and bars , retail trade and , until recently , construction .
A close examination of the figures will usually reveal a decline in manufacturing jobs .
This is not an accident .
Over the past 30 years , American manufacturing has moved offshore at an accelerating rate .
Walk through any big box store ( or any other for that matter ) and look where things are made .
Overwhelmingly , it 's China or other developing nations .
The process is inexorable .
With “ Globalization ” we have opened the world 's borders to free trade in goods and services .
On the one hand , this has presented opportunities for US manufacturers to expand profits by shifting production to countries where wages are a tiny fraction of those in the United States .
Goods made abroad can be sold at an attractive price in the US while still allowing producers to increase the difference between price and total cost , otherwise known a profit .
Those companies with a sense of national pride and identity are , finally , forced to move some or all of their production offshore in order to survive .
Aside from the short term charm of finding bargains on the shopping rack , there are serious consequences here .
Let 's look them .
The first problem is the disappearance of the American “ living wage ” .
The only reason Americans have managed to avoid confronting their declining real income per capita it by increasing the number of family members working .
There was a time , in American mythology at least , when people accepted that one working family member could support 4 people at a reasonable standard of living .
This was the vision of America Nixon and Krushchev debated , famously , at an exhibit of the postulated US living standards presented in the Soviet Union .
This was the Ozzie and Harriet version of American life which was broadcast to the world and to the home audience as standard : the norm .
It was n't , of course , but it was close enough to what middle America saw around them to be at least plausible .
The incomes implicit in that early 1960 's view of American life may have improved until the early 1970's ( there was a war going on and war is always good for employment and incomes ) , but since that time statistics indicate that the real ( inflation adjusted ) incomes of American working people have actually declined .
This is a problem that is not going away .
It 's going to get worse .
Several convergent forces are leading to US economic destabilization .
One force driving this tragedy is free trade , also called globalization .
One of the more profound spokesmen on this subject is Paul Craig Roberts an economist in the Reagan Administration who has written extensively on the topic and lends support to the argument that globalization is on the verge of ruining the US economy .
The loss of American manufacturing jobs is largely the result of American firms moving their manufacturing off shore , to labor markets in which workers earn a tiny fraction of US wages .
Once the globalization process began in earnest , it became impossible for many American firms to maintain US production even if the wished to .
Keeping jobs here would render these firm uncompetitive as the rivals moved to take advantage of peasant wages in places like China , India and other developing nations .
Even signature American enterprises such as Boing are moving larger segments of their airliner manufacturing to other countries .
The finished sub-assemblies for the 777 Dreamliner , for example , are flown to Seattle for final assembly .
Highly skilled professionals , such as radiologists ( medical doctors specializing in interpreting X - rays ) are finding their work sent via high speed communications to much lower paid radiologists in places like India .
The effect of allowing the unimpeded flow of capital and goods and services between nations is precisely the same as allowing the free movement of people across borders .
In the end , we will experience a relative equalization of wages , world wide .
Obviously , those in the current Third World will find wages improving .
With billions of impoverished workers waiting in the “ wings ” , US workers will find their wage declines much more starting and profound than the increases granted to the struggling poor of the developing world .

The table , above , shows a relentlessly increasing balance of trade deficit with China .
By 2006 , the cumulative deficit with China was $ 950,500,000,000 .
It is larger today , and China is not alone as a nation with which we are running a deficit .
There are many others , Japan being a notable example .
Why are the Chinese , Japanese , Indonesians and others willing to hold claims against US dollars , claims they are n't going to use to buy US made goods or services ?
This was a question that plagued me as an economist trying to explain the workings of currency markets and free floating exchange rates to interested students .
Under normal market circumstances , the Chinese and others would simply convert dollars into currencies they were interested in using for purchases of imported goods ; the value of the dollar would fall and that would make US goods cheaper , US imports more expensive and would tend to equalize our balance of payments situation .
But that did n't happen .
The US has been in a consistent balance of payments deficit since the early 1970's , and somehow the dollar did n't fall , US exports continued to shrink and US imports exploded .
There are several factors at work , here .
The first is the fact that countries like China are seeing their development fueled in significant measure by sales to the US .
If the Chinese cashed their dollar claims in for , say , Euros , the dollar would collapse effectively ending the US 's ability to power Chinese economic growth .
This collapse of the dollar would also mean the Chinese and other dollar holders would only get a fraction of their nominal dollar wealth in the form of Euros — they 'd lose their “ dollar gains ” .
What the Chinese , and other dollar holders , have chosen to do is to buy US Government bonds , US corporate bonds and US properties .
In effect , we purchase more from China than they intend to buy from us , and they simply lend the money back to us .
In this way , the get interest earnings , and rents and profits from the US lands and businesses they purchase .
In a real sense , the Chinese have financed the war in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Finally , should dollar holder dump dollars indiscriminately , they would scrap their holdings of the very currency they need to purchase crude oil from the OPEC nations who , until recently , have agreed to sell oil only for US dollars .
Dollars used to purchase crude oil are called ' petro - dollars ' .
A very significant component of the world demand for dollars has to do with buying petroleum .
It 's interesting to note that , apparently , Saddam Hussein was proposing selling oil in currencies other than dollars before we deposed him .
Equally interesting is the fact that Iran has been selling oil to China in Yuan .
The ultimate point , here , is the absolute unsustainability of the US 's position .
We cannot expect our trading partners to hold dollars in unlimited quantities , and as we 've no hope of being able to achieve a positive balance of trade , that 's exactly what we are effectively
seeking .
That nations are cautiously moving out of dollar holdings is revealed by the rather steady overall decline in the value of the dollar over the past three years .
This will continue .

Clinton fails to congratulate Obama after second election night in a row
Via CNN Political Producer Peter Hamby : " For the second election night in a row , Hillary Clinton failed to acknowledge or congratulate Barack Obama after he won the day in dominating fashion . "
" On Tuesday in El Paso , hours after Virginia had been called for Obama , she stuck to her ' Texas campaign kickoff ' message and did not stray from an energetic , Lone Star - themed stump speech , " Hamby wrote .
" She did mention Obama by name , only to chide his health care plan .
" On Saturday night in Richmond , Virginia , Clinton spoke to a crowd of thousands at the states annual Jefferson - Jackson dinner , but she ignored Obamas quartet of blowout primary and caucus wins that day as well ( Obama also won the Maine caucuses the next day ) , " he added .
Extending a courtesy call to the victor is common practice for presidential primaries as well as the general election .
Hamby notes that Clinton congratulated Obama and John Edwards after their first and second place finishes respectively in Iowa .
Obama lauded Clinton for her victory in Obama .
But it appears , as of now , that tradition is done .
Or is it ?
" You go on , " Clinton said Wednesday , one day after suffering lopsided losses to rival Barack Obama in Maryland , Virginia and Maryland .
" Some weeks one of us is up and the other is down , and then we reverse it .
...
It 's a long and winding road . "
Speaking to reporters after a rally with hundreds of supporters in a convention center here , she acknowledged Obama 's victories , something she did not mention at a huge rally in El Paso Tuesday night .
" I want to congratulate Senator Obama on his recent victories and tell him to meet me in Texas , " she said .
" We 're ready . "
Following his Tuesday victories , Obama now has a 26 delegate lead over Clinton  1,224 to 1,198 , according to the latest tally by The Associated Press .
( with wire reports )
In a speech delivered at the Socialism 2007 Conference on Saturday , June 16 2007 in Chicago , John Pilger describes how propaganda has become such a potent force in our lives and , in the words of one of its founders , represents “ an invisible government . ”
The title of this talk is Freedom Next Time , which is the title of my book , and the book is meant as an antidote to the propaganda that is so often disguised as journalism .
So I thought I would talk today about journalism , about war by journalism , propaganda , and silence , and how that silence might be broken .
Edward Bernays , the so - called father of public relations , wrote about an invisible government , which is the true ruling power of our country .
He was referring to journalism , the media .
That was almost 80 years ago , not long after corporate journalism was invented .
It is a history few journalist talk about or know about , and it began with the arrival of corporate advertising .
As the new corporations began taking over the press , something called “ professional journalism ” was invented .
To attract big advertisers , the new corporate press had to appear respectable , pillars of the establishment — objective , impartial , balanced .
The first schools of journalism were set up , and a mythology of liberal neutrality was spun around the professional journalist .
The right to freedom of expression was associated with the new media and with the great corporations , and the whole thing was , as Robert McChesney put it so well , “ entirely bogus ” .
For what the public did not know was that in order to be professional , journalists had to ensure that news and opinion were dominated by official sources , and that has not changed .
Go through the New York Times on any day , and check the sources of the main political stories — domestic and foreign — you ’ll find they ’re dominated by government and other established interests .
That is the essence of professional journalism .
I am not suggesting that independent journalism was or is excluded , but it is more likely to be an honorable exception .
Think of the role Judith Miller played in the New York Times in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq .
Yes , her work became a scandal , but only after it played a powerful role in promoting an invasion based on lies .
Yet , Miller ’s parroting of official sources and vested interests was not all that different from the work of many famous Times reporters , such as the celebrated W.H. Lawrence , who helped cover up the true effects of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in August , 1945 .
“ No Radioactivity in Hiroshima Ruin , ” was the headline on his report , and it was false .
Consider how the power of this invisible government has grown .
In 1983 the principle global media was owned by 50 corporations , most of them American .
In 2002 this had fallen to just nine corporations .
Today it is probably about five .
Rupert Murdoch has predicted that there will be just three global media giants , and his company will be one of them .
This concentration of power is not exclusive of course to the United States .
The BBC has announced it is expanding its broadcasts to the United States , because it believes Americans want principled , objective , neutral journalism for which the BBC is famous .
They have launched BBC America .
You may have seen the advertising .
The BBC began in 1922 , just before the corporate press began in America .
Its founder was Lord John Reith , who believed that impartiality and objectivity were the essence of professionalism .
In the same year the British establishment was under siege .
The unions had called a general strike and the Tories were terrified that a revolution was on the way .
The new BBC came to their rescue .
In high secrecy , Lord Reith wrote anti-union speeches for the Tory Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin and broadcast them to the nation , while refusing to allow the labor leaders to put their side until the strike was over .
So , a pattern was set .
Impartiality was a principle certainly : a principle to be suspended whenever the establishment was under threat .
And that principle has been upheld ever since .
Take the invasion of Iraq .
There are two studies of the BBC ’s reporting .
One shows that the BBC gave just two percent of its coverage of Iraq to antiwar dissent — two percent .
That is less than the antiwar coverage of ABC , NBC , and CBS .
A second study by the University of Wales shows that in the buildup to the invasion , 90 percent of the BBC ’s references to weapons of mass destruction suggested that Saddam Hussein actually possessed them , and that by clear implication Bush and Blair were right .
We now know that the BBC and other British media were used by the British secret intelligence service MI - 6 .
In what they called Operation Mass Appeal , MI - 6 agents planted stories about Saddam ’s weapons of mass destruction , such as weapons hidden in his palaces and in secret underground bunkers .
All of these stories were fake .
But that ’s not the point .
The point is that the work of MI - 6 was unnecessary , because professional journalism on its own would have produced the same result .
Listen to the BBC ’s man in Washington , Matt Frei , shortly after the invasion .
“ There is not doubt , ” he told viewers in the UK and all over the world , “ That the desire to bring good , to bring American values to the rest of the world , and especially now in the Middle East , is especially tied up with American military power . ”
In 2005 the same reporter lauded the architect of the invasion , Paul Wolfowitz , as someone who “ believes passionately in the power of democracy and grassroots development . ”
That was before the little incident at the World Bank .
None of this is unusual .
BBC news routinely describes the invasion as a miscalculation .
Not Illegal , not unprovoked , not based on lies , but a miscalculation .
The words “ mistake ” and “ blunder ” are common BBC news currency , along with “ failure ” — which at least suggests that if the deliberate , calculated , unprovoked , illegal assault on defenseless Iraq had succeeded , that would have been just fine .
Whenever I hear these words I remember Edward Herman ’s marvelous essay about normalizing the unthinkable .
For that ’s what media clichéd language does and is designed to do — it normalizes the unthinkable ; of the degradation of war , of severed limbs , of maimed children , all of which I ’ve seen .
One of my favorite stories about the Cold War concerns a group of Russian journalists who were touring the United States .
On the final day of their visit , they were asked by the host for their impressions .
“ I have to tell you , ” said the spokesman , “ that we were astonished to find after reading all the newspapers and watching TV day after day that all the opinions on all the vital issues are the same .
To get that result in our country we send journalists to the gulag .
We even tear out their fingernails .
Here you do n’t have to do any of that .
What is the secret ? ”
What is the secret ?
It is a question seldom asked in newsrooms , in media colleges , in journalism journals , and yet the answer to that question is critical to the lives of millions of people .
On August 24 last year the New York Times declared this in an editorial : “ If we had known then what we know now the invasion if Iraq would have been stopped by a popular outcry . ”
This amazing admission was saying , in effect , that journalists had betrayed the public by not doing their job and by accepting and amplifying and echoing the lies of Bush and his gang , instead of challenging them and exposing them .
What the Times did n’t say was that had that paper and the rest of the media exposed the lies , up to a million people might be alive today .
That ’s the belief now of a number of senior establishment journalists .
Few of them — they ’ve spoken to me about it — few of them will say it in public .
Ironically , I began to understand how censorship worked in so - called free societies when I reported from totalitarian societies .
During the 1970s I filmed secretly in Czechoslovakia , then a Stalinist dictatorship .
I interviewed members of the dissident group Charter 77 , including the novelist Zdener Urbanek , and this is what he told me .
“ In dictatorships we are more fortunate that you in the West in one respect .
We believe nothing of what we read in the newspapers and nothing of what we watch on television , because we know its propaganda and lies .
I like you in the West .
We ’ve learned to look behind the propaganda and to read between the lines , and like you , we know that the real truth is always subversive . ”
Vandana Shiva has called this subjugated knowledge .
The great Irish muckraker Claud Cockburn got it right when he wrote , “ Never believe anything until it ’s officially denied . ”
One of the oldest clichés of war is that truth is the first casualty .
No it ’s not .
Journalism is the first casualty .
When the Vietnam War was over , the magazine Encounter published an article by Robert Elegant , a distinguished correspondent who had covered the war .
“ For the first time in modern history , ” he wrote , the outcome of a war was determined not on the battlefield , but on the printed page , and above all on the television screen . ”
He held journalists responsible for losing the war by opposing it in their reporting .
Robert Elegant ’s view became the received wisdom in Washington and it still is .
In Iraq the Pentagon invented the embedded journalist because it believed that critical reporting had lost Vietnam .
The very opposite was true .
On my first day as a young reporter in Saigon , I called at the bureaus of the main newspapers and TV companies .
I noticed that some of them had a pinboard on the wall on which were gruesome photographs , mostly of bodies of Vietnamese and of American soldiers holding up severed ears and testicles .
In one office was a photograph of a man being tortured ; above the torturers head was a stick - on comic balloon with the words , “ that ’ll teach you to talk to the press . ”
None of these pictures were ever published or even put on the wire .
I asked why .
I was told that the public would never accept them .
Anyway , to publish them would not be objective or impartial .
At first , I accepted the apparent logic of this .
I too had grown up on stories of the good war against Germany and Japan , that ethical bath that cleansed the Anglo - American world of all evil .
But the longer I stayed in Vietnam , the more I realized that our atrocities were not isolated , nor were they aberrations , but the war itself was an atrocity .
That was the big story , and it was seldom news .
Yes , the tactics and effectiveness of the military were questioned by some very fine reporters .
But the word “ invasion ” was never used .
The anodyne word used was “ involved . ” America was involved in Vietnam .
The fiction of a well - intentioned , blundering giant , stuck in an Asian quagmire , was repeated incessantly .
It was left to whistleblowers back home to tell the subversive truth , those like Daniel Ellsberg and Seymour Hersh , with his scoop of the My - Lai massacre .
There were 649 reporters in Vietnam on March 16 , 1968 — the day that the My - Lai massacre happened — and not one of them reported it .
In both Vietnam and Iraq , deliberate policies and strategies have bordered on genocide .
In Vietnam , the forced dispossession of millions of people and the creation of free fire zones ;
In Iraq , an American - enforced embargo that ran through the 1990s like a medieval siege , and killed , according to the United Nations Children ’s fund , half a million children under the age of five .
In both Vietnam and Iraq , banned weapons were used against civilians as deliberate experiments .
Agent Orange changed the genetic and environmental order in Vietnam .
The military called this Operation Hades .
When Congress found out , it was renamed the friendlier Operation Ranch Hand , and nothing change .
That ’s pretty much how Congress has reacted to the war in Iraq .
The Democrats have damned it , rebranded it , and extended it .
The Hollywood movies that followed the Vietnam War were an extension of the journalism , of normalizing the unthinkable .
Yes , some of the movies were critical of the military ’s tactics , but all of them were careful to concentrate on the angst of the invaders .
The first of these movies is now considered a classic .
It ’s The Deerhunter , whose message was that America had suffered , America was stricken , American boys had done their best against oriental barbarians .
The message was all the more pernicious , because the Deerhunter was brilliantly made and acted .
I have to admit it ’s the only movie that has made me shout out loud in a Cinema in protest .
Oliver Stone ’s acclaimed movie Platoon was said to be antiwar , and it did show glimpses of the Vietnamese as human beings , but it also promoted above all the American invader as victim .
I was n’t going to mention The Green Berets when I set down to write this , until I read the other day that John Wayne was the most influential movie who ever lived .
I saw The Green Berets starring John Wayne on a Saturday night in 1968 in Montgomery Alabama .
( I was down there to interview the then - infamous governor George Wallace ) .
I had just come back from Vietnam , and I could n’t believe how absurd this movie was .
So I laughed out loud , and I laughed and laughed .
And it was n’t long before the atmosphere around me grew very cold .
My companion , who had been a Freedom Rider in the South , said , “ Let ’s get the hell out of here and run like hell . ”
We were chased all the way back to our hotel , but I doubt if any of our pursuers were aware that John Wayne , their hero , had lied so he would n’t have to fight in World War II .
And yet the phony role model of Wayne sent thousands of Americans to their deaths in Vietnam , with the notable exceptions of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney .
Last year , in his acceptance of the Nobel Prize for Literature , the playwright Harold Pinter made an epoch speech .
He asked why , and I quote him , “ The systematic brutality , the widespread atrocities , the ruthless suppression of independent thought in Stalinist Russia were well know in the West , while American state crimes were merely superficially recorded , left alone , documented . ”
And yet across the world the extinction and suffering of countless human beings could be attributed to rampant American power .
“ But , ” said Pinter , “ You would n’t know it .
It never happened .
Nothing ever happened .
Even while it was happening it was n’t happening .
It did n’t matter .
It was of no interest . ”
Pinter ’s words were more than the surreal .
The BBC ignored the speech of Britain ’s most famous dramatist .
I ’ve made a number of documentaries about Cambodia .
The first was Year Zero : The Silent Death of Cambodia .
It describes the American bombing that provided the catalyst for the rise of Pol Pot .
What Nixon and Kissinger had started , Pol Pot completed — CIA files alone leave no doubt of that .
I offered Year Zero to PBS and took it to Washington .
The PBS executives who saw it were shocked .
They whispered among themselves .
They asked me to wait outside .
One of them finally emerged and said , “ John , we admire your film .
But we are disturbed that it says the United States prepared the way for Pol Pot . ”
I said , “ Do you dispute the evidence ? ” I had quoted a number of CIA documents .
“ Oh , no , ” he replied .
“ But we ’ve decided to call in a journalistic adjudicator . ”
Now the term “ journalist adjudicator ” might have been invented by George Orwell .
In fact they managed to find one of only three journalists who had been invited to Cambodia by Pol Pot .
And of course he turned his thumbs down on the film , and I never heard from PBS again .
Year Zero was broadcast in some 60 countries and became one of the most watched documentaries in the world .
It was never shown in the United States .
Of the five films I have made on Cambodia , one of them was shown by WNET , the PBS station in New York .
I believe it was shown at about one in the morning .
On the basis of this single showing , when most people are asleep , it was awarded an Emmy .
What marvelous irony .
It was worthy of a prize but not an audience .
Harold Pinter ’s subversive truth , I believe , was that he made the connection between imperialism and fascism , and described a battle for history that ’s almost never reported .
This is the great silence of the media age .
And this is the secret heart of propaganda today .
A propaganda so vast in scope that I ’m always astonished that so many Americans know and understand as much as they do .
We are talking about a system , of course , not personalities .
And yet , a great many people today think that the problem is George W. Bush and his gang .
And yes , the Bush gang is extreme .
But my experience is that they are no more than an extreme version of what has gone on before .
In my lifetime , more wars have been started by liberal Democrats than by Republicans .
Ignoring this truth is a guarantee that the propaganda system and the war - making system will continue .
We ’ve had a branch of the Democratic Party running Britain for the last 10 years .
Blair , apparently a liberal , has taken Britain to war more times than any prime minister in the modern era .
Yes , his current pal is George Bush , but his first love was Bill Clinton , the most violent president of the late 20th century .
Blair ’s successor , Gordon Brown is also a devotee of Clinton and Bush .
The other day , Brown said , “ The days of Britain having to apologize for the British Empire are over .
We should celebrate . ”
Like Blair , like Clinton , like Bush , Brown believes in the liberal truth that the battle for history has been won ; that the millions who died in British - imposed famines in British imperial India will be forgotten — like the millions who have died in the American Empire will be forgotten .
And like Blair , his successor is confident that professional journalism is on his side .
For most journalists , whether they realize it or not , are groomed to be tribunes of an ideology that regards itself as non-ideological , that presents itself as the natural center , the very fulcrum of modern life .
This may very well be the most powerful and dangerous ideology we have ever known because it is open - ended .
This is liberalism .
I ’m not denying the virtues of liberalism — far from it .
We are all beneficiaries of them .
But if we deny its dangers , its open - ended project , and the all - consuming power of its propaganda , then we deny our right to true democracy , because liberalism and true democracy are not the same .
Liberalism began as a preserve of the elite in the 19th century , and true democracy is never handed down by elites .
It is always fought for and struggled for .
A senior member of the antiwar coalition , United For Peace and Justice , said recently , and I quote her , “ The Democrats are using the politics of reality . ”
Her liberal historical reference point was Vietnam .
She said that President Johnson began withdrawing troops from Vietnam after a Democratic Congress began to vote against the war .
That ’s not what happened .
The troops were withdrawn from Vietnam after four long years .
And during that time the United States killed more people in Vietnam , Cambodia and Laos with bombs than were killed in all the preceding years .
And that ’s what ’s happening in Iraq .
The bombing has doubled since last year , and this is not being reported .
And who began this bombing ?
Bill Clinton began it .
During the 1990s Clinton rained bombs on Iraq in what were euphemistically called the “ no fly zones . ”
At the same time he imposed a medieval siege called economic sanctions , killing as I ’ve mentioned , perhaps a million people , including a documented 500,000 children .
Almost none of this carnage was reported in the so - called mainstream media .
Last year a study published by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health found that since the invasion of Iraq 655 , 000 Iraqis had died as a direct result of the invasion .
Official documents show that the Blair government knew this figure to be credible .
In February , Les Roberts , the author of the report , said the figure was equal to the figure for deaths in the Fordham University study of the Rwandan genocide .
The media response to Robert ’s shocking revelation was silence .
What may well be the greatest episode of organized killing for a generation , in Harold Pinter ’s words , “ Did not happen .
It did n’t matter . ”
Many people who regard themselves on the left supported Bush ’s attack on Afghanistan .
That the CIA had supported Osama Bin Laden was ignored , that the Clinton administration had secretly backed the Taliban , even giving them high - level briefings at the CIA , is virtually unknown in the United States .
The Taliban were secret partners with the oil giant Unocal in building an oil pipeline across Afghanistan .
And when a Clinton official was reminded that the Taliban persecuted women , he said , “ We can live with that . ”
There is compelling evidence that Bush decided to attack the Taliban not as a result of 9 - 11 , but two months earlier , in July of 2001 .
This is virtually unknown in the United States — publicly .
Like the scale of civilian casualties in Afghanistan .
To my knowledge only one mainstream reporter , Jonathan Steele of the Guardian in London , has investigated civilian casualties in Afghanistan , and his estimate is 20,000 dead civilians , and that was three years ago .
The enduring tragedy of Palestine is due in great part to the silence and compliance of the so - called liberal left .
Hamas is described repeatedly as sworn to the destruction of Israel .
The New York Times , the Associated Press , the Boston Globe — take your pick .
They all use this line as a standard disclaimer , and it is false .
That Hamas has called for a ten - year ceasefire is almost never reported .
Even more important , that Hamas has undergone an historic ideological shift in the last few years , which amounts to a recognition of what it calls the reality of Israel , is virtually unknown ; and that Israel is sworn to the destruction of Palestine is unspeakable .
There is a pioneering study by Glasgow University on the reporting of Palestine .
They interviewed young people who watch TV news in Britain .
More than 90 percent thought the illegal settlers were Palestinian .
The more they watched , the less they knew — Danny Schecter ’s famous phrase .
The current most dangerous silence is over nuclear weapons and the return of the Cold War .
The Russians understand clearly that the so - called American defense shield in Eastern Europe is designed to subjugate and humiliate them .
Yet the front pages here talk about Putin starting a new Cold War , and there is silence about the development of an entirely new American nuclear system called Reliable Weapons Replacement ( RRW ) , which is designed to blur the distinction between conventional war and nuclear war — a long - held ambition .
In the meantime , Iran is being softened up , with the liberal media playing almost the same role it played before the Iraq invasion .
And as for the Democrats , look at how Barak Obama has become the voice of the Council on Foreign Relations , one of the propaganda organs of the old liberal Washington establishment .
Obama writes that while he wants the troops home , “ We must not rule out military force against long - standing adversaries such as Iran and Syria . ”
Listen to this from the liberal Obama : “ At moment of great peril in the past century our leaders ensured that America , by deed and by example , led and lifted the world , that we stood and fought for the freedom sought by billions of people beyond their borders . ”
That is the nub of the propaganda , the brainwashing if you like , that seeps into the lives of every American , and many of us who are not Americans .
From right to left , secular to God-fearing , what so few people know is that in the last half century , United States administrations have overthrown 50 governments — many of them democracies .
In the process , thirty countries have been attacked and bombed , with the loss of countless lives .
Bush bashing is all very well — and is justified — but the moment we begin to accept the siren call of the Democrat ’s drivel about standing up and fighting for freedom sought by billions , the battle for history is lost , and we ourselves are silenced .
So what should we do ?
That question often asked in meetings I have addressed , even meetings as informed as those in this conference , is itself interesting .
It ’s my experience that people in the so - called third world rarely ask the question , because they know what to do .
And some have paid with their freedom and their lives , but they knew what to do .
It ’s a question that many on the democratic left — small “ d ” — have yet to answer .
Real information , subversive information , remains the most potent power of all — and I believe that we must not fall into the trap of believing that the media speaks for the public .
That was n’t true in Stalinist Czechoslovakia and it is n’t true of the United States .
In all the years I ’ve been a journalist , I ’ve never know public consciousness to have risen as fast as it ’s rising today .
Yes , its direction and shape is unclear , partly because people are now deeply suspicious of political alternatives , and because the Democratic Party has succeeded in seducing and dividing the electoral left .
And yet this growing critical public awareness is all the more remarkable when you consider the sheer scale of indoctrination , the mythology of a superior way of life , and the current manufactured state of fear .
Why did the New York Times come clean in that editorial last year ?
Not because it opposes Bush ’s wars — look at the coverage of Iran .
That editorial was a rare acknowledgement that the public was beginning to see the concealed role of the media , and that people were beginning to read between the lines .
If Iran is attacked , the reaction and the upheaval cannot be predicted .
The national security and homeland security presidential directive gives Bush power over all facets of government in an emergency .
It is not unlikely the constitution will be suspended — the laws to round of hundreds of thousands of so - called terrorists and enemy combatants are already on the books .
I believe that these dangers are understood by the public , who have come along way since 9 - 11 , and a long way since the propaganda that linked Saddam Hussein to al - Qaeda .
That ’s why they voted for the Democrats last November , only to be betrayed .
But they need truth , and journalists ought to be agents of truth , not the courtiers of power .
I believe a fifth estate is possible , the product of a people ’s movement , that monitors , deconstructs , and counters the corporate media .
In every university , in every media college , in every news room , teachers of journalism , journalists themselves need to ask themselves about the part they now play in the bloodshed in the name of a bogus objectivity .
Such a movement within the media could herald a perestroika of a kind that we have never known .
This is all possible .
Silences can be broken .
In Britain the National Union of Journalists has undergone a radical change , and has called for a boycott of Israel .
The web site Medialens.org has single - handedly called the BBC to account .
In the United States wonderfully free rebellious spirits populate the web — I ca n’t mention them all here — from Tom Feeley ’s International Clearing House , to Mike Albert ’s ZNet , to CounterPunch online , and the splendid work of FAIR .
The best reporting of Iraq appears on the web — Dahr Jamail ’s courageous journalism ; and citizen reporters like Joe Wilding , who reported the siege of Fallujah from inside the city .
In Venezuela , Greg Wilpert ’s investigations turned back much of the virulent propaganda now aimed at Hugo Chávez .
Make no mistake , it ’s the threat of freedom of speech for the majority in Venezuela that lies behind the campaign in the west on behalf of the corrupt RCTV .
The challenge for the rest of us is to lift this subjugated knowledge from out of the underground and take it to ordinary people .
We need to make haste .
Liberal Democracy is moving toward a form of corporate dictatorship .
This is an historic shift , and the media must not be allowed to be its façade , but itself made into a popular , burning issue , and subjected to direct action .
That great whistleblower Tom Paine warned that if the majority of the people were denied the truth and the ideas of truth , it was time to storm what he called the Bastille of words .
That time is now .
Celebrity Addictions : Painkillers and Hollywood Painkiller addictions are becoming more of a hollywood woe .
Feb. 22 , 2008  --
Hollywood stars usually set the trends that the rest of us follow — in the cities , to suburbia and beyond .
But not in the case of painkiller addictions .
What started as a problem among the rural poor in America has now spread across the nation and into the Hollywood spotlight .
The effective chemicals in prescription painkillers — called opioids — are derived from the same poppy plant used to make opium and heroin .
Painkillers give a feeling of euphoria and , just like heroin or opium , carry a high risk for abuse and recreational use .
" Addiction to opioids in America crosses all cultural and economic barriers , " said Dr. Andrew Kowal , director of the Pain Center at the Lahey Clinic in Burlington , Mass .
" You could be living in the hills of West Virginia , or an actor making $ 10 million on a movie . "
The popularity of opiates skyrocketed during the late 1990s , after pain management specialists went on a mission to treat chronic pain .
Kowal says that between 1997 and 2005 , methadone prescriptions shot up by 1,000 percent , oxycodone prescriptions ( slow acting OxyContin ) went up 600 percent and prescriptions for generic Vicodin increased 200 percent .
Anyone can become dependent on prescription painkillers , but addiction often begins with an emotional dependence .
" People start self - treating their anxiety , depression or loneliness , " Kowal said .
" That 's why you see a lot of the Hollywood stars with it , " he said .
" Even though they 're popular and famous and surrounded by lots of people they 're ultimately lonely . "
The following stars have dealt with an addiction to painkillers — or " hillbilly heroin , " as one celebrity called it .
Many of their stories reflect the pain and emotional turmoil that has resulted from the painkiller addiction boom .
Nicole Richie
Though the pint - size " Simple Life " star seems happy and healthy in her new role as a mother , she has a notorious track record for dangerous behavior and dramatic weight loss .
Richie , who has previously been addicted to heroin and alcohol , added a new substance to her record in December 2006 when she drove her sport utility vehicle the wrong way down a California freeway .
Police arrested her and found Richie to be under the influence of Vicodin , the heavy - duty pain medication on which many stars have become dependent .
Richie claimed that she took the pain medication for menstrual cramps , a statement that raised a few eyebrows in celebrity gossip magazines and on Internet forums .
After the arrest , Richie admitted to having a history of dodging responsibility .
" I really was n't learning anything from that , " the celebrity told ABC News .
" So I kept making bad decisions or mistake after mistake after mistake .
And I was n't growing .
I was n't going anywhere . "
Richie now appears to have kicked her substance abuse habits and seems to be focused on her relationship with rocker boyfriend Joel Madden and their baby , Harlow Winter Kate Madden .
" I owe the baby my life , " Richie said .
" I owe this baby everything and I have a responsibility now .
Besides being responsible for myself , I 'm now responsible for someone else .
And I have to set the right examples .
I have to really be someone that I would want my child to look up to . "
Winona Ryder
For years , Ryder was generally a well - respected actress in Hollywood with two Oscar nominations .
Then , in 2001 , Ryder was arrested at Saks Fifth Avenue for shoplifting $ 5,000 worth of clothing and accessories .
Though the shoplifting charges took the spotlight , authorities also found eight different painkillers in Ryder 's purse , according to The Los Angeles Times .
Police said at the time that she was carrying oxycodone without a prescription , which her lawyer later challenged .
" The attention was what was embarrassing , " Ryder said in an 2007 interview with Vogue .
" It was the December after Sept. 11 . …
So much attention was being paid to me , when we had just been attacked , and there was all this really important news going on . "
Ryder told Vogue of the events leading up to her arrest .
" Two months prior to that , I broke my arm in two places , and the doctor … was giving me a lot of stuff [ oxycodone , not to be confused with OxyContin ] and I was taking it at first to get through the pain , " Ryder said .
" And then there was this weird point when you do n't know if you are in pain but you 're taking it , " Ryder added .
" Have you ever taken painkillers ?
It is n't a reckless [ state ] , like you 're out of your head .
It 's just confusion . "
Matthew Perry
Perry , 39 , shot to stardom when he was cast as the sarcastic , yet lovable , Chandler Bing on the hit TV show " Friends . "
But at the height of the actor 's success , Perry 's partying led him to one addiction after another .
" I got into a serious problem with painkillers , a painkiller called Vicodin , " the actor said in an interview with Larry King in August 2002 .
" And that was mostly just to not drink as much as I was .
I was getting too hung over , so I tried other things that would try to balance me out . "
In 1997 , Perry recognized his addiction issues and checked himself into rehab to kick the habit .
" I guess it was around April that I realized the level , the severity of the problem that I was having , " Perry admitted in a 1998 interview with CNN .
" And I 'm really proud that I kind of stepped up to the bat and took care of it .
For me , it was a no - brainer .
It was just — this is obviously what I have to go do . "
But that was not the end of Perry 's painkiller abuse .
In May 2000 , he was hospitalized for pancreatitis , a rare inflammation that can be caused by alcohol and drug abuse .
By 2001 , he had checked in to the Malibu clinic Promises to keep his addictions at bay .
Now , he says he has kicked the painkillers .
He 's back to acting and currently working on a new film called " Seventeen Again " with Zac Efron .
Kelly and Jack Osbourne
This brother and sister celebrity pair — offspring of Ozzy " Prince of Darkness " Osbourne — inherited more than their father 's fame .
The younger Osbournes followed their father 's path of drug use and hard partying .
While still young adults both Kelly and her younger brother , Jack , fell victim to painkiller addiction .
In April 2004 , Sharon and Ozzy confronted their daughter and had her check into the Promises treatment center in Malibu , Calif .
" She did n't put up a fight , " Sharon said on an April 2 , 2004 episode of CNN's " Larry King Live . "
" It happened so quickly , she did n't have time .
It was so much of a shock she said , ' I 'll go . ' "
The family admits they 've had their share of problems with drug use .
" It 's a family illness , " Ozzy told King .
" It 's in the genes .
In this day and age , the availability of getting drugs is amazing . "
The news of Kelly 's rehab visit came on the heels of Jack 's stint in rehab a year before .
The hard - partying teenager admitted to being addicted to the painkiller OxyContin and voluntarily checked in to Las Encinas Hospital in Pasadena , Calif .
Jack 's time in rehab had a profound effect on him .
" I took myself out of the picture for a second and I looked around at every single person in the room , at who they were , how old they were and what they had going on in their lives , " Jack said in a July 2003 interview with MTV News .
" A lot of them were near 30 , unemployed , living off their parents , " he said .
" There were heroin addicts , there were the world 's biggest couch potatoes .
And it was like , ' I do n't want to be like that .
I do n't want my life to be controlled by a drug . ' "
Jamie Lee Curtis
Curtis debuted in independent horror films , like " Halloween " and " Prom Night " , as the sexy ingenue who always outwitted the bad guys .
But the " scream queen " was less successful at evading her off - screen demons .
Curtis , also a recovering alcoholic , began taking painkillers after a cosmetic procedure and became addicted to them .
" I would anesthetize myself on a daily basis , " Curtis said in an interview with Reader 's Digest .
" And I found painkillers were very helpful because they did the job without the messiness of alcohol .
When my mother was so ill , there was a lot of pain medicine around .
The bottle of liquid codeine that sat on her bathroom cabinet — do n't think I did n't see it . "
Curtis has since worked to overcome her addictions .
She sits on the board for the National Center for Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University and forgoes many film projects in favor of spending time with her husband , actor Christopher Guest , and their two children .
Eminem
The Grammy - and Oscar - winning recording artist makes no secret of his history of drug use .
Eminem , born Marshall Mathers , rapped about his drug use in songs such as " Drug Ballad , " " These Drugs " and " Under the Influence . "
His song " I'm Shady " on " The Slim Shady " LP , released in 1999 , includes the line : " Well , I do take pills , do n't do speed / do n't do crack , do n't do coke / I do smoke weed / do n't do smack / I do do ' shrooms , do drink beer / I just wanna make a few things clear . "
Eminem , one of the highest - selling rap artists of all time , known for his complex and controversial lyrics , admitted that the initial fame changed his behavior .
A friend told the Sunday Mirror that at one point Eminem was drinking a bottle of rum mixed with ecstasy and tablets of the painkiller Vicodin .
In fact , Eminem , 35 , displays his affinity for the prescription painkiller as candidly as he does his love for his daughter , Hailie Jade ; he has both images tattooed on his body .
" Hailie 's birth was a wake - up call , " Eminem told the Sunday Mirror .
" She made me get … in gear , to make something of my life and try 10 quadrillion times harder than I had before .
Everything I do is for her . "
Courtney Love
The 43 - year - old is almost as famous for her rock star antics fueled by alcohol and drug abuse , as for her rock music .
Though Love has not confirmed a painkiller addiction , painkillers have certainly made it on her list of recreational drugs .
Love , the former lead singer for the band Hole , was arrested in 2003 after she went to her ex-boyfriend 's home and broke a window .
Officers on the scene said that Love was intoxicated at the time and she was later charged with illegal possession of the painkillers OxyContin and hydrocodone .
Love admitted to using OxyContin , and thought she had a prescription for both medications .
Love 's husband , Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain , also had a history of drug use and committed suicide at age 27 .
" There are many people out there who are legitimately given these prescriptions by physicians , but they will divert them , " said Kowal , who explains that people in need of cash can get a high return for selling their drugs .
" People may come asking for them to sell it and say ' Hey Jim , I heard you have a prescription for Percocet , I 'll give you $ 10 a pill . "
A person with a month 's worth of OxyContin could face the temptation to make a good deal of money .
" You could get $ 2,400 for medicine on the street you just paid $ 10 for at the pharmacy . "
Charlie Sheen
With a reputation as one of Hollywood 's inveterate bad boys , Sheen has been known for his multiple , tumultuous love affairs , his penchant for prostitutes and his substance abuse .
Along with other drugs , painkiller medications are on Sheen 's list of addictions .
His abuse of these and other drugs , combined with heavy drinking , put the actor on extended probation .
This punishment came on top of a previous one - year prison sentence after Sheen was convicted of beating his then - girlfriend Brittany Ashland in December 1996 .
Sheen 's destructive behavior was so marked , his father , Martin Sheen , asked prosecutors to file probation violation charges against his son .
Drugs continued to haunt Sheen 's personal life .
Denise Richards ,
Sheen 's second wife , left him in 2005 while she was still pregnant with their second daughter .
According to CNN's " Showbiz Tonight 's " Brook Anderson , nasty allegations flew in the divorce papers , alleging that Sheen was once again addicted to painkillers .
Though experts say much research does not support addictive personality theories , they agree that addiction is partially inherited and partially due to personal history .
" Most studies point to approximately 50 percent of addiction being genetic , " said Christopher Welsh , an addiction specialist and assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Maryland School of Medicine .
" A lot of what then happens depends on personality , environmental influences and social and familial influences . "
Michael Jackson
The King of Pop , whose long history of scandal almost matches his illustrious music career , found his dependency on painkiller medication less than " thrilling . "
His struggle with the medications lead the megastar to abruptly cancel his worldwide " Dangerous " tour in 1993 .
Jackson claimed that the addiction stemmed from a burn injury he suffered in 1984 when filming a Pepsi commercial .
He also claimed that the mental stress of child - molestation allegations fueled his need for medicine .
" I was humiliated , embarrassed , hurt and suffering great pain in my heart , " the pop star said in a 1993 audiotape statement .
" I became increasingly more dependent to the painkillers to get me through the days of the tour .
My friends and doctors advised me to seek professional guidance immediately in order to eliminate what has become an addiction . "
Although Jackson apparently managed to kick the habit in rehab , he has not been able to kick the criticism and conjecture in the media .
The singer received more allegations of child molestation and continued to display increasingly bizarre behavior , like dangling his new baby over a balcony .
Jackson 's musical career may seem over , but the recent re-release of his album " Thriller , " featuring collaborations with Kanye West , Akon , Fergie , will .i.am and Chris Brown , may get the " Smooth Criminal " back on the charts .
Anna Nicole Smith
This deceased celebrity heiress was famous for her soap - opera - scandalous life and her untimely death .
While her death was ruled an overdose of anxiety and depression drugs , Smith had a history of painkiller addiction .
The former Playboy Playmate of the Year claimed that prescription drugs such as methadone nearly took her life .
" I actually went into a coma , you know .
I almost died .
And I had to learn how to walk again and all this and that , " Smith told CBS News .
" I had to rehabilitate myself .
And then they took the nurse away , so there I was crawling — crawling to the bathroom and stuff . "
The blond bombshell admitted that she became addicted to painkillers when her 89 - year - old millionaire husband , J. Howard Marshall II , fell ill and died .
The addiction was bad enough that Smith ended up in the Betty Ford rehabilitation center .
" It worked , " Smith told Larry King in a May 2002 interview .
" It got me off everything .
It was hard .
I hated it .
I 'll never go back . …
They treat you terribly . "
Cindy McCain
Cindy McCain , wife of presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , claimed that emotional and physical stress prompted her addiction to painkillers .
After two back surgeries , McCain became hooked on Percocet and Vicodin and continued to take the drugs during the Keating Five banking scandal surrounding the McCain couple in 1989 - 92 .
McCain 's habit worsened to the point where she began to steal pills from the American Voluntary Medical Team , an organization she founded to aid developing countries .
" I was an addict .
That 's why , " McCain told CNN when asked about the theft .
" I tell you , addiction is a very cunning enemy . "
Kowal says it 's important to understand the difference between what people call addiction , and what should be called a physical dependence .
People may form a physical dependence and have withdrawal symptoms , but as Cindy McCain said , addiction is a much more destructive beast .
" Addiction is an inability to stop using a drug , illegally or legally , even though it 's causing harm to yourself , your life or your career , " Kowal said .
While it took some fast political footwork to keep the senator 's reputation intact , his wife received treatment and is no longer addicted to pain medication .
Rush Limbaugh
Few celebrities have taken control of a painkiller addiction rumor like the conservative radio pundit , Rush Limbaugh .
Though the National Enquirer broke the story of Limbaugh 's painkiller addiction in October 2003 , Limbaugh promptly admitted on his radio show that he had a problem .
" You know I have always tried to be honest with you and open about my life , " he told the millions who listen daily .
" I need to tell you today that part of what you have heard and read is correct : I am addicted to prescription pain medication . "
" I refuse to let anyone think I am doing something great here , when there are people you never hear about , who face long odds and never resort to such escapes .
They are the role models , " he said .
Limbaugh 's announcement hardly ended the matter .
In 2006 , he turned himself in to Palm Beach County police for charges of " doctor shopping , " according to The Washington Post .
Court documents linked Limbaugh to several painkiller prescriptions filled at several pharmacies from doctors in New York , California and Florida , according to the Post .
Kowal says that " [ celebrities ] have access to these things , they have the money of course to pay for it , but they have physicians in every city they travel around the world . "
" There are physicians who are star struck and they want to do whatever they can .
They do n't know what the other doctor did in London in New York , " Kowal said .
Because Limbaugh turned himself in and agreed to undergo rehabilitation , the initial charges were dropped .
Chevy Chase
Chase 's story of painkiller addiction ( and recovery ) long preceded the boom in painkiller addictions in the 1990s .
In 1986 Chase checked himself into the Betty Ford Center — an ironic move considering he made his comic mark by imitating President Ford 's clumsy falls on " Saturday Night Live "
At the time , Chase 's agent Pat Kingsley said the treatment was for " dependency on prescription drugs relating to chronic and long - term back problems " resulting from years of stunts dating to his days on " Saturday Night Live , " according to the United Press International .
Shortly after Ford 's death in December 2006 , Chase wrote to The New York Times supporting the Betty Ford Clinic and its work .
" During my short stay there , " he wrote , " I often saw Mrs . Ford personally surveying the clinic and generously offering a helping hand . "
" If it had n't been for the courage of Mr. Ford 's wife , Betty , for admitting to an alcohol problem , I would never have received the help I needed , " he added .
After his time in rehab , Chase was invited to lunch with the Ford family and formed a friendly acquaintance , according to the Times .
Elvis Presley
Presley was a pioneer of rock ' n ' roll music , and the extreme lifestyle that goes with it .
He dated gorgeous women , bought a flashy mansion and took drugs .
When Presley died in 1977 , reportedly of heart complications , questions about his painkiller addiction began to snowball into accusations .
But Presley did n't quite doctor - shop ; he received many pain medicine prescriptions from a single man — Dr. George Nichopoulos .
In 1981 Nichopoulos testified in his own defense that he did not overprescribe drugs for Presley .
Instead , he claimed he tried to take control of his patients ' addictions , patients that included Presley , Jerry Lee Lewis and seven others .
Nichopoulos testified that all his patients named in the indictment had been getting drugs from other sources and that he had ordered placebo pills from the drug manufacturer , according to The New York Times .
" The goal with all these people was to control the medication , " he said in testimony .
At the time prosecutors showed evidence of narcotics , stimulants and sedative prescriptions written for Presley .
In the last 2 ½ years of the singer 's life , the pills added up to more than 19,000 doses , or roughly 20 pills a day .
Most think the Fed follows market expectations .
Count me in that group as well .
However , this creates what would appear at first glance to be a major paradox :
If the Fed is simply following market expectations , can the Fed be to blame for the consequences ?
More pointedly , why is n't the market to blame if the Fed is simply following market expectations ?
This is a very interesting theoretical question .
While it 's true the Fed typically only does what is expected , those expectations become distorted over time by observations of Fed actions .
For example :
If market participants are expecting the Fed to cut on weakness and the Fed does , market participants gets into a psychology of expecting more cuts on more weakness .
Here is another example :
If market participants expect the Fed to cut rates when economic stress occurs , they will takes positions based on those expectations .
These expectation cycles can be self reinforcing .
The Observer Affects The Observed
The Fed , in conjunction with all the players watching the Fed , distorts the economic picture .
I liken this to Heisenberg 's Uncertainty Principle where observation of a subatomic particle changes the ability to measure it accurately .
To measure the position and velocity of any particle , you would first shine a light on it , then detect the reflection .
On a macroscopic scale , the effect of photons on an object is insignificant .
Unfortunately , on subatomic scales , the photons that hit the subatomic particle will cause it to move significantly , so although the position has been measured accurately , the velocity of the particle will have been altered .
By learning the position , you have rendered any information you previously had on the velocity useless .
In other words , the observer affects the observed .
The Fed , by its very existence , alters the economic horizon .
Compounding the problem are all the eyes on the Fed attempting to game the system .
The Fed can not change the primary trend in interest rates .
However , the Fed can exaggerate the trend , temporarily slow it , or hold the trend for an unreasonably long period of time after the market ( without Fed distractions ) would have acted .
This leads to various distortions , primarily in the direction of the existing trend .
A good example of this is the 1 % Fed Funds Rate in 2003 - 2004 .
It is highly doubtful the market on its own accord would have reduced interest rates to 1 % or held them there for long if it did .
What happened in 2002 - 2004 was an observer / participant feedback loop that continued even after the recession had ended .
The Fed held rates rates too low too long .
This spawned the biggest housing bubble in history .
The Greenspan Fed compounded the problem by endorsing derivatives and ARMs at the worst possible moment .
In a free market it would be highly unlikely to get a yield curve that is as steep as the one in 2003 or as steep as it was just weeks ago when short term treasuries traded down to .21 % .
In other words we would not be in this mess without the Fed , or if we were , the mess would at least be smaller than the one we are in .
Would the market on its own accord be setting rates at the current Fed Funds Rate of 2.25 ?
It 's possible , but there is no way to tell .
It 's even possible the Fed is behind the curve by not acting fast enough .
This is of course all guesswork .
I do n't know , you do n't know , and the Fed does not know what to do .
This is part of the " Fed Uncertainty Principle " and a key reason why the Fed should be abolished .
After all , how can you give such power to a group of fools that have clearly proven they have no idea what they are doing ?
The Fed has so distorted the economic picture by its very existence that it is fatally flawed logic to suggest the Fed is simply following the market therefore the market is to blame .
There would not be a Fed in a free market , and by implication there would be no observer / participant feedback loop .
The Fed hints at " possibility " of recession .
We are already in one .
Today 's headline reads Bernanke Nods at Possibility of a Recession .
In his bleakest economic assessment to date , the Federal Reserve chairman , Ben S. Bernanke , said Wednesday that the American economy could contract in the first half of 2008 , meeting the technical definition of a recession , and he encouraged Congress to help homeowners caught up in the mortgage crisis .
My Comment
Mr. Bernanke , testifying before the Joint Economic Committee on Capitol Hill , said the economic situation had weakened since the Fed last reported at the end of January but that it could revive later in 2008 because of the $ 150 billion spending and tax cut package enacted this year .
“ It now appears likely that real gross domestic product , or G.D.P. , will not grow much , if at all , over the first half of 2008 and could even contract slightly , ” he said .
“ We expect economic activity to strengthen in the second half of the year , in part as the result of stimulative monetary and fiscal policies . ”
My Comment
Uncertainty Principle Corollary Number One
In separate comments , Mr. Bernanke went further than he had in the past , suggesting that the Fed would remain aggressive and vigilant to prevent a repetition of a collapse like that of Bear Stearns , though he said he saw no such problems on the horizon .
My Comment
By the end of his comments , it was also clear that he and the Fed were not entirely pleased with the “ blueprint ” for regulatory changes issued on Monday by the Treasury secretary , Henry M. Paulson Jr .
That proposal called for an overhaul and consolidation of the financial regulatory system .
The Fed chief , in an almost classic case of damning with faint praise , said Mr. Paulson ’s blueprint was “ a very interesting and useful first step ” for Congress to consider .
My Comment
Uncertainty Principle Corollary Number Two
Mr. Bernanke , making his first public comments about Bear Stearns , spent a considerable amount of time defending the Fed ’s actions in arranging for Bear Stearns to be acquired by JPMorgan Chase at a fire - sale price , and with the help of a $ 30 billion loan from the Fed .
Providing new details about the deal , which was arranged behind closed doors during the weekend of March 15 , Mr. Bernanke said he and his colleagues at the Fed did not know until March 13 that Bear Stearns faced bankruptcy and that they quickly realized a failure to act would create a global crisis .
My Comment
“ With financial conditions fragile , the sudden failure of Bear Stearns likely would have led to a chaotic unwinding of positions in those markets and could have severely shaken confidence , ” he said .
“ The company ’s failure could also have cast doubt on the financial positions of some of Bear Stearns ’s thousands of counterparties and perhaps companies with similar businesses . ”
My Comment
Uncertainty Principle Corollary Number Three
Caroline Baum Blasts Fed Decisions
Watching the evolution of Fed policy in the last six months from focused on inflation to fearful of systemic risk ; the series of aggressive , rapid - fire rate cuts ; the creation of an alphabet soup of new lending facilities [ TAF , TSLF , PDCF ] ; and the orchestration of a fire sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan , one has to wonder about the Fed's M.O.
It all has a make - it - up - as - you - go - along quality .
Faced with what it thought would be a series of cascading financial failures if Bear Stearns went down , the Fed probably knew what it wanted to do , knew it had to do it quickly , and then had to figure out " how to get it done within the confines of its legal structure , " DeRosa [ a partner at Mt. Lucas Management Co. ] said .
" The Fed used legal sleight of hand to reconcile what they wanted to do with what they 're permitted to do by law . "
Bernanke is sure to be grilled about his actions when he testifies before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress today and the Senate Banking Committee tomorrow .
A wee bit more transparency would be nice .
Then again , if the Fed is acting first and finding legal cover later , there 's a benefit to keeping the details murky .
Fed 's Actions Blatantly Illegal
The Federal Reserve decided last week to overstep its legal boundaries – going beyond providing liquidity to the banking system and attempting to ensure the solvency of a non -bank entity .
Specifically , the Fed agreed to provide a $ 30 billion “ non-recourse loan ” to J.P. Morgan , secured only by the worst tranche of Bear Stearns ' mortgage debt .
But the bank – J.P. Morgan – was in no financial trouble .
Instead , it was effectively offered a subsidy by the Fed at public expense .
Rick Santelli of CNBC is exactly right .
If this is how the U.S. government is going to operate in a democratic , free - market society , “ we might as well put a hammer and sickle on the flag . ”
The Fed did not act to save a bank , but to enrich one .
Congress has the power to appropriate resources for such a deal by the representative will of the people – the Fed does not , even under Depression era banking laws .
The “ loan ” falls outside of Section 13 - 3 of the Federal Reserve Act , because it is not in fact a loan to either Bear Stearns or J.P. Morgan .
Bear Stearns is no longer a business entity under this agreement .
And if the fiction that this is a “ loan ” to J.P. Morgan was true , J.P. Morgan would be obligated to pay it back , period .
The only point at which the value of the " collateral " would become an issue would be in the event that J.P. Morgan itself was to fail .
No , this is not a loan .
It is a put option granted by the Fed to J.P. Morgan on a basket of toxic securities .
And it is not legal .

4.5.1.6 mysql Client Tips
This section provides information about techniques for more effective use of mysql and about mysql operational behavior .
Input - Line Editing
mysql supports input - line editing , which enables you to modify the current input line in place or recall previous input lines .
For example , the left - arrow and right - arrow keys move horizontally within the current input line , and the up - arrow and down - arrow keys move up and down through the set of previously entered lines .
Backspace deletes the character before the cursor and typing new characters enters them at the cursor position .
To enter the line , press Enter .
On Windows , the editing key sequences are the same as supported for command editing in console windows .
On Unix , the key sequences depend on the input library used to build mysql ( for example , the libedit or readline library ) .
Documentation for the libedit and readline libraries is available online .
To change the set of key sequences permitted by a given input library , define key bindings in the library startup file .
This is a file in your home directory : .editrc for libedit and .inputrc for readline .
For example , in libedit , Control +
W deletes everything before the current cursor position and Control + U deletes the entire line .
In readline , Control + W deletes the word before the cursor and Control + U deletes everything before the current cursor position .
If mysql was built using libedit , a user who prefers the readline behavior for these two keys can put the following lines in the .editrc file ( creating the file if necessary ) :
bind " ^W " ed- delete - prev - word bind " ^U " vi-kill - line - prev
To see the current set of key bindings , temporarily put a line that says only bind at the end of .editrc .
mysql will show the bindings when it starts .
Disabling Interactive History
The up - arrow key enables you to recall input lines from current and previous sessions .
In cases where a console is shared , this behavior may be unsuitable .
mysql supports disabling the interactive history partially or fully , depending on the host platform .
On Windows , the history is stored in memory .
Alt +F7 deletes all input lines stored in memory for the current history buffer .
It also deletes the list of sequential numbers in front of the input lines displayed with F7 and recalled ( by number ) with F9 .
New input lines entered after you press Alt +F7 repopulate the current history buffer .
Clearing the buffer does not prevent logging to the Windows Event Viewer , if the -- syslog option was used to start mysql .
Closing the console window also clears the current history buffer .
To disable interactive history on Unix , first delete the .mysql_history file , if it exists ( previous entries are recalled otherwise ) .
Then start mysql with the - - histignore= " * " option to ignore all new input lines .
To re-enable the recall ( and logging ) behavior , restart mysql without the option .
If you prevent the .mysql_history file from being created ( see Controlling the History File ) and use -- histignore= " * " to start the mysql client , the interactive history recall facility is disabled fully .
Alternatively , if you omit the -- histignore option , you can recall the input lines entered during the current session .
Unicode Support on Windows
Windows provides APIs based on UTF - 16LE for reading from and writing to the console ; the mysql client for Windows is able to use these APIs .
The Windows installer creates an item in the MySQL menu named MySQL command line client - Unicode .
This item invokes the mysql client with properties set to communicate through the console to the MySQL server using Unicode .
To take advantage of this support manually , run mysql within a console that uses a compatible Unicode font and set the default character set to a Unicode character set that is supported for communication with the server :
Open a console window .
Go to the console window properties , select the font tab , and choose Lucida Console or some other compatible Unicode font .
This is necessary because console windows start by default using a DOS raster font that is inadequate for Unicode .
Execute mysql.exe with the -- default - character - set=utf8 ( or utf8mb4 ) option .
This option is necessary because utf16le is one of the character sets that cannot be used as the client character set .
See Impermissible Client Character Sets .
With those changes , mysql will use the Windows APIs to communicate with the console using UTF - 16LE , and communicate with the server using UTF - 8 .
( The menu item mentioned previously sets the font and character set as just described . )
To avoid those steps each time you run mysql , you can create a shortcut that invokes mysql.exe .
The shortcut should set the console font to Lucida Console or some other compatible Unicode font , and pass the -- default - character - set=utf8 ( or utf8mb4 ) option to mysql.exe .
Alternatively , create a shortcut that only sets the console font , and set the character set in the [ mysql ] group of your my .ini file :
[ mysql ] default - character - set=utf8
Displaying Query Results Vertically
Some query results are much more readable when displayed vertically , instead of in the usual horizontal table format .
Queries can be displayed vertically by terminating the query with \G instead of a semicolon .
For example , longer text values that include newlines often are much easier to read with vertical output :
mysql > SELECT * FROM mails WHERE LENGTH ( txt ) < 300 LIMIT 300,1 \G ***************************
1 . row *************************** msg_nro : 3068 date : 2000-03-01 23:29:50 time_zone : +0200 mail_from : Jones reply : jones@example.com mail_to : " John Smith " < smith@example.com > sbj : UTF - 8 txt : >>>>>
" John " == John Smith writes : John >

I think this is a good idea .
Is anyone familiar John > with UTF - 8 or Unicode ?
Otherwise , I 'll put this on my John > TODO list and see what happens .
Yes , please do that .

Using Safe - Updates Mode ( -- safe-updates )
For beginners , a useful startup option is -- safe - updates ( or - - i- am - a - dummy , which has the same effect ) .
Safe - updates mode is helpful for cases when you might have issued an UPDATE or DELETE statement but forgotten the WHERE clause indicating which rows to modify .
Normally , such statements update or delete all rows in the table .
With -- safe - updates , you can modify rows only by specifying the key values that identify them , or a LIMIT clause , or both .
This helps prevent accidents .
Safe - updates mode also restricts SELECT statements that produce ( or are estimated to produce ) very large result sets .
The -- safe - updates option causes mysql to execute the following statement when it connects to the MySQL server , to set the session values of the sql_safe_updates , sql_select_limit , and max_join_size system variables :
SET sql_safe_updates=1 , sql_select_limit=1000 , max_join_size=1000000 ;
The SET statement affects statement processing as follows :
Enabling sql_safe_updates causes UPDATE and DELETE statements to produce an error if they do not specify a key constraint in the WHERE clause , or provide a LIMIT clause , or both .
For example : UPDATE tbl_name SET not_key_column=val WHERE key_column=val ; UPDATE tbl_name SET not_key_column=val LIMIT 1 ;
Setting sql_select_limit to 1,000 causes the server to limit all SELECT result sets to 1,000 rows unless the statement includes a LIMIT clause .
Setting max_join_size to 1,000,000 causes multiple - table SELECT statements to produce an error if the server estimates it must examine more than 1,000,000 row combinations .
To specify result set limits different from 1,000 and 1,000,000 , you can override the defaults by using the -- select - limit and - - max - join - size options when you invoke mysql :
mysql -- safe-updates --select-limit=500 --max-join-size=10000
It is possible for UPDATE and DELETE statements to produce an error in safe - updates mode even with a key specified in the WHERE clause , if the optimizer decides not to use the index on the key column :
Range access on the index cannot be used if memory usage exceeds that permitted by the range_optimizer_max_mem_size system variable .
The optimizer then falls back to a table scan .
See Limiting Memory Use for Range Optimization .
If key comparisons require type conversion , the index may not be used ( see Section 8.3.1 , “ How MySQL Uses Indexes ” ) .
Suppose that an indexed string column c1 is compared to a numeric value using WHERE c1 = 2222 .
For such comparisons , the string value is converted to a number and the operands are compared numerically ( see Section 12.3 , “ Type Conversion in Expression Evaluation ” ) , preventing use of the index .
If safe - updates mode is enabled , an error occurs .
As of MySQL 8.0.13 , safe - updates mode also includes these behaviors :
EXPLAIN with UPDATE and DELETE statements does not produce safe - updates errors .
This enables use of EXPLAIN plus SHOW WARNINGS to see why an index is not used , which can be helpful in cases such as when a range_optimizer_max_mem_size violation or type conversion occurs and the optimizer does not use an index even though a key column was specified in the WHERE clause .
When a safe - updates error occurs , the error message includes the first diagnostic that was produced , to provide information about the reason for failure .
For example , the message may indicate that the range_optimizer_max_mem_size value was exceeded or type conversion occurred , either of which can preclude use of an index .
For multiple - table deletes and updates , an error is produced with safe updates enabled only if any target table uses a table scan .
Disabling mysql Auto - Reconnect
If the mysql client loses its connection to the server while sending a statement , it immediately and automatically tries to reconnect once to the server and send the statement again .
However , even if mysql succeeds in reconnecting , your first connection has ended and all your previous session objects and settings are lost : temporary tables , the autocommit mode , and user - defined and session variables .
Also , any current transaction rolls back .
This behavior may be dangerous for you , as in the following example where the server was shut down and restarted between the first and second statements without you knowing it :
mysql > SET @a=1 ; Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0.05 sec ) mysql > INSERT INTO t VALUES ( @a ) ; ERROR 2006 : MySQL server has gone away No connection .
Trying to reconnect ...
Connection id : 1 Current database : test Query OK , 1 row affected ( 1.30 sec ) mysql > SELECT * FROM t ; +------+ | a | +------+ | NULL | +------+ 1 row in set ( 0.05 sec )
The @a user variable has been lost with the connection , and after the reconnection it is undefined .
If it is important to have mysql terminate with an error if the connection has been lost , you can start the mysql client with the -- skip - reconnect option .
For more information about auto - reconnect and its effect on state information when a reconnection occurs , see C API Automatic Reconnection Control .
mysql Client Parser Versus Server Parser
The mysql client uses a parser on the client side that is not a duplicate of the complete parser used by the mysqld server on the server side .
This can lead to differences in treatment of certain constructs .
Examples :
Processing Deposit Accounts in a Bank Failure ;
Modernizing Large - bank Insurance Determinations
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) has issued the attached two - part Notice of Proposed Rulemaking relating to the potential failure of an insured depository institution :
Part 1 proposes a rule governing how and at what point deposit account balances would be determined in the event of an insured depository institution failure .
This part would apply to all insured depository institutions .
Part 2 proposes requirements to facilitate the process for determining the insurance status of depositors of large insured depository institutions in the event of failure .
As proposed , the Part 2 requirements currently would apply only to the 159 insured depository institutions with at least $ 2 billion in domestic deposits and either ( 1 ) more than 250,000 deposit accounts or ( 2 ) total assets over $ 20 billion , regardless of the number of deposit accounts .
These " Covered Institutions " amount to less than two percent of the more than 8,500 insured depository institutions .
Part 1 .
A deposit account balance on the day of failure would be defined as the end - of - day ledger balance of the deposit account on the day of failure .
This account balance would take into consideration any prearranged sweep transactions scheduled to occur that day , as long as funds are not removed from the depository institution after the time of failure .
When an FDIC - insured depository institution fails , the FDIC must determine the total insured amount for each depositor .
To make this determination , the FDIC must ascertain the balances of all deposit accounts owned by the same depositor in the same ownership capacity at a failed institution as of the day of failure .
The second part of this proposed rule would require certain large depository institutions to place holds on deposits accounts in the event of failure .
The amount held would vary depending on the account balance .
In order to calculate these hold amounts , the rules used by the FDIC to determine account balances as of the day of failure must be clearly established .
Under Part 1 , the FDIC also requests comment on whether repurchase - agreement sweep arrangements , as actually structured and executed , pass title to the customer in a transaction that is enforceable against the FDIC or create perfected security interests that are enforceable against the FDIC .
The FDIC is concerned that the structure of certain sweep arrangements labeled as repurchase agreements in fact do not result in perfected security interests , and thereby may result in a loss exposure to the customer in the event of failure .
Part 2 .
This part of the proposed rule applies to large FDIC - insured institutions with complex deposit systems .
Covered Institutions would be required to adopt mechanisms that would , in the event of the institution 's failure : Allow automatic posting of provisional holds on large deposit accounts in any percentage specified by the FDIC on the day of failure .
Provide the FDIC with deposit account data in a standard format .
Allow automatic removal of the provisional holds and posting of the results of insurance determinations as specified by the FDIC .
When handling a depository institution failure , the FDIC is required to structure the least costly of all possible resolution transactions , except in the event of systemic risk .
In addition , the FDIC is required to pay insured deposits " as soon as possible " after an institution fails .
The FDIC places a high priority on providing access to insured deposits promptly and , in the past , has usually been able to allow most depositors access to their deposits on the business day following closing .
Doing so enables the FDIC to ( 1 ) maintain public confidence in the banking industry and the FDIC ; ( 2 ) provide the best possible service to insured depositors by minimizing uncertainty about their status and avoiding costly disruptions that may limit their ability to meet financial obligations ; ( 3 ) mitigate the spillover effects of a failure , such as risks to the payments system , problems stemming from depositor illiquidity and a substantial reduction in credit availability ; and ( 4 ) retain , where feasible , the franchise value of the failed institution ( and , thus , minimize the FDIC 's resolution costs ) .
The largest insured institutions are growing increasingly complex .
The proposed rule would help facilitate an insurance determination and dramatically improve access to depositor funds if one of these institutions were to fail .
The proposed rule is intended to allow the deposit operations of a failed institution to be continued on the day following failure .
It is also intended to permit the FDIC to meet its legal mandates regarding the resolution of failed insured institutions , provide liquidity to depositors promptly , enhance market discipline , ensure equitable treatment of depositors at different institutions , and help preserve the franchise value of a failed institution ( thus , reducing the FDIC 's costs ) .
The FDIC last updated its deposit insurance determination process in 1999 .
The largest number of deposit accounts in a failed institution for which the FDIC has had to make an insurance determination was about 175,000 for NetBank , FSB , Alpharetta , Georgia , on September 28 , 2007 .
Today , some of the larger banks have more than 50 million deposit accounts .
Comments on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking are due by April 14 , 2008 .
Mitchell L. Glassman
Director
Division of Resolutions and Receiverships
If this view was correct , he claimed , rising fuel prices would have already begun to push American agriculture in the direction of smaller , less energy - intensive farms , and this would show in currently available statistics about profitability , labor costs , farm size and the like .
He then demonstrated that no such changes could be found in the statistics , and on this basis claimed that what he called the “ reversalist ” position had no merit .
Astyk , responding to Staniford , made two major points .
First , she noted that nobody claimed that the transition from today ’s agribusiness to tomorrow ’s rural landscape of small farms would simply run history in reverse , and Staniford was therefore kicking a straw man .
Second , she suggested that the emergence of a nonmechanized , small - farm economy in the postpetroleum future was not an inevitability , but a policy choice that Staniford ’s so - called “ reversalists ” considered the best option in the face of peak oil .
Like many readers of the debate , I found neither of these positions really satisfactory .
By the time I finished reading the comments , though , it was getting late , and I decided to round out the evening by pouring myself a glass of scotch and reading a few pages of a Gary Larson Far Side anthology .
Somewhere toward the bottom of the glass I dozed off ; I must have been reading one of Larson ’s dinosaur cartoons in my last waking moments , because I slipped into a dream in which a conference of dinosaurs pondered the approaching end of the Mesozoic era .
Quite a few dinosaurs had already given speeches about the threat of global cooling .
Several of them had mentioned that mammals , with their warm blood and furry coats , might be better off in a post -Mesozoic world .
At this point in the debate , however , another dinosaur lumbered up to the podium to speak .
“ This talk of mammals taking over the world is nonsense , ” it said .
“ It ’s true , of course , that the ancestors of mammals – the therapsids – ruled the earth back before dinosaurs came along , in the Permian period , before the earth ’s climate shifted to its long Mesozoic warm spell . ”
This sparked a good deal of discussion among the audience , and the Tyrannosaurus rex who presided over the meeting had to display its foot - long teeth and growl to quiet things down .
“ Nonetheless , ” the speaker went on , “ this claim that evolution will run in reverse can readily be refuted .
If that were true , the global cooling we ’ve seen already would have made dinosaurs become smaller and furrier , and that has n’t happened .
In fact ” – at this point it nodded toward the Tyrannosaurus rex – “ it ’s clear that we ’re getting larger and scalier all the time .
There ’s every reason to think that as the climate cools , and selection pressures become more extreme , big scaly dinosaurs will have even greater competitive advantages than they do now .
” At this point the buzz of conversation in the audience could not be restrained , even when the Tyrannosaurus rex killed and ate one of the loudest talkers .
A few moments later , though , a bright light flashed through the sky .
“ Did you see that ? ” said the Triceratops sitting next to me , pointing toward the sky with the horn on his nose .
“ I ’ve never seen a shooting star that big . ”
A moment later I was jolted awake by what felt like the shockwave from an asteroid impact , but was actually the Gary Larson anthology sliding from my lap and hitting the floor .
The parallels between Staniford ’s argument and that of his saurian equivalent , as it happens , go well beyond the obvious .
Both , strictly speaking , are quite correct in their core assertions .
As the Mesozoic era drew toward its close , dinosaurs did not retrace the process that led up to the monster reptiles of the Cretaceous .
In fact , important branches of the dinosaur clan – the carnosaurs that led to Tyrannosaurus rex , the ceratopsians that ended with Triceratops , and others – got progressively larger as the Cretaceous drew on .
These successful evolutionary lineages continued to follow their established trajectory as long as it remained viable .
When it stopped being viable , they did n’t shift into reverse and shrink back down to the size of their Permian ancestors ; they died out , and other organisms better suited to the new conditions took over .
In the same way , Staniford ’s assertion that today ’s industrial agriculture will not throw the gearshifts of its combines into reverse , and gradually retrace its tracks into the 19th century , is almost certainly correct .
Staniford is also correct to point out that in a world intent on pouring its food supply into its fuel tanks , rising energy prices mean that industrial farming is becoming more profitable , not less .
As a member of the Grange , I ’ve had the chance to watch this from an angle that may be rare in the peak oil scene .
Where the rest of the media bemoans rising grain prices , the Grange News is full of satisfied comments by family farmers who can finally make ends meet , now that their grain sells for more than it cost to grow .
Yet Staniford ’s overall argument fails , for the same reason that his imaginary Mesozoic equivalent missed seeing the future in plain sight -- both rely on linear models to predict a nonlinear situation .
In his essay , Staniford used the distinction between reversible and irreversible processes as a model for historical change in agriculture .
The difference between linear and nonlinear change , however , is at least as relevant .
Watch a frozen lake melt and you have a seasonally timely example of nonlinear change .
The transition from ice to liquid water does n’t happen gradually as temperature rises ; it happens at a specific point in the temperature spectrum , 32°F , and only then once the ice has absorbed enough energy to overcome its thermal inertia and provide the heat of fusion .
A five - degree warming can be irrelevant to the process , if it ’s from 15 °F to 20 °F , or for that matter from 40 °F to 45 °F .
The same rise between 30 °F and 35 °F , on the other hand , can cause drastic change .
Nonlinear change happens most often in systems that have negative feedback loops which balance out pressures for change .
In the case of the frozen lake , the main sources of negative feedback are the stability of water ’s solid state and its capacity as a heat sink .
Only when enough heat has entered the situation to overcome these factors does change happen , and when it does , the lake shifts from one relatively stable state to another .
The modern agricultural economy is a classic candidate for nonlinear change .
The feedback loops resisting agricultural change in the modern world are at least as potent as the ones that keep a lake from melting at 20 °F .
The food production and distribution system is oriented toward business as usual , and the psychology of previous investment and the very real costs of retooling to fit a different model both raise obstacles to change .
Monopolistic practices and the government subsidies and price supports that make most of today ’s “ capitalist ” agriculture a case study in corporate socialism also give the status quo impressive inertia .
At the same time , if something is unsustainable , it ’s a given that sooner or later it wo n’t be sustained .
Today ’s industrial agriculture , with its far - flung supply and distribution chains , its dependence on huge inputs of nonrenewable resources , and its severe impact on topsoil , water quality , and environmental health , is a case in point .
As transport costs rise , fossil fuel and mineral reserves deplete , and the burden of coping with ecological damage climbs , industrial agriculture will sooner or later reach the point of negative returns – and as Joseph Tainter pointed out in a different context , that ’s the point at which collapse becomes the most likely outcome .
Staniford has argued elsewhere that the energy crisis caused by the end of cheap oil will be temporary .
He proposes that nuclear power and other technologies will sooner or later make energy cheap and abundant again .
If he ’s right , it ’s possible that new energy sources will come on line soon enough to keep industrial agriculture from hitting the wall .
None of the theorists he critiques in his essay agree that the approaching crisis will be temporary , though , and this latter assessment gives their argument compelling force : as energy supplies dwindle and a social fabric predicated on cheap energy comes apart , the pressures on the agricultural status quo will eventually reach a level high enough to force nonlinear change .
This is where the second half of Sharon Astyk ’s argument comes in .
She points out that many of the writers critiqued in Staniford ’s essay see a nonmechanized small - farm agricultural economy not as the inevitable result of economic forces , but as a deliberate policy choice .
If our existing agriculture could fold out from under us , they suggest , getting plan B in place is a good idea .
Now this may well be true , but history teaches that when ideology collides with economics , it ’s inevitably ideology that comes off worst .
The same trap that has blocked most proposals for lifeboat communities so far – how do you make them economically viable in the world we inhabit today ?
– lies in wait for schemes to relocalize agriculture that do n’t take the actual economics of farming in today ’s world into account .
Fortunately , there ’s reason to think that economic factors will favor the rise of a nonmechanized small - farm economy in the industrial world in the decades to come .
The best evidence for this suggestion comes , ironically enough , from Stuart Staniford .
In posts about the agricultural side of peak oil – notably Fermenting the Food Supply – Staniford pointed out that the use of grain as a feedstock for ethanol is likely to drive up the price of basic foodstuffs so far that many people will no longer be able to afford to eat .
This is potentially a serious crisis , but it also represents an opportunity .
Sharp increases in the price of food mean that food production methods that may not be economical under current conditions could well pass the breakeven point and begin turning a profit .
To thrive in the economic climate of the near future , of course , such methods would have to meet certain requirements , but most of these can be anticipated easily enough .
These alternative farming projects would have to use minimal fossil fuel inputs , since fuel costs will likely be very high by past standards for much of the foreseeable future .
They would need to focus on local distribution , since those same fuel costs will put long - distance transport out of reach .
They would have to focus on intensive production from very small plots , since acreage large enough for industrial farming will likely increase in price .
They would also benefit greatly by relying on human labor with hand tools , since the economic consequences of peak oil will likely send unemployment rates soaring while making capital hard to come by .
All of these criteria are met , as it happens , by the small organic farms and truck gardens that many relocalization theorists hold up as models for future agriculture .
Already an economic success , especially around West Coast cities , these agricultural alternatives have evolved their own distribution system , relying on farmers markets , co-op groceries , local restauranteurs and community - supported agriculture schemes to carry out an end run around food distribution systems geared toward corporate monopolies .
As more grains and other fermentable bulk commodities get turned into ethanol , and food prices rise in response , such arrangements may well become a significant source of food for a sizeable fraction of Americans – and in the process , of course , the economics of small - scale alternative farms are likely to improve a great deal .
The result may well resemble nothing so much as the agricultural system of the former Soviet Union in its last years , featuring vast farms that had become almost irrelevant to the national food supply , while little market gardens in backyards produced most of the food people actually ate .
If Staniford is correct and the postpeak energy crisis turns out to be a passing phase , that bimodal system might endure for quite some time , as it did in the Soviet Union .
If more pessimistic assessments of our energy future are closer to the mark , as I suspect they are , the industrial half of the system can be counted on to collapse at some point down the road once energy and resource availability drop to levels insufficient to sustain a continental economy .
If this turns out to be the case , the small intensive farms around the urban fringes – mammals amid agribusiness dinosaurs – may well become the nucleus of the next agriculture .
DIGG THIS
No matter how many warnings have been issued , an economic crisis always takes a country by surprise .
The most urgent task is to somehow prevent policymakers from doing evil things to “ correct ” the crisis .
Every form of intervention can only make matters worse .
The best policy is to adopt a laissez - faire policy through regulatory cuts , sound money , and eliminating legal restrictions on trade .
The liquidation must be allowed to happen on its own to provide a suitable foundation for a future recovery .
How can we help this happen ?
One way is to make sure that the right books are front and center .
We might start by reviewing the great event that still inspires today ’s most fallacious countercyclical policies : the Great Depression .
It turns out that Ludwig von Mises was the great prophet of the event , with a series of essays on the nature of the business cycle and the urgency of sound money .
After the Depression hit , he urged a free - market policy for the world .
These wonderful essays are collected in The Causes of the Economic Crisis .
It was a tragedy that it took so long for them to appear in English .
What they show is that he , not Keynes , was the person who had it all figured out .
When I speak of a laissez - faire policy , many people ’s first reaction is : that ’s what Herbert Hoover did !
But the truth is quite the opposite .
Hoover was actually the first New Dealer .
He tried to reflate the economy and attempted ill - fated jobs and spending programs .
In fact , FDR ’s presidential campaign of 1932 argued that Hoover was a big spender who was driving up the debt and making matters worse through his intervention !
Never heard that before ?
Have a look at Murray Rothbard ’s America ’s Great Depression , which remains the best overall account of why the stock market crash happened and what Hoover did to make everything worse .
Murray shows that the depression was not a crisis of capitalism but the result of a disastrously loose monetary policy in the 1920s .
A special treat of this book is how Rothbard takes you through the theoretical underpinnings of the crisis , and shows precisely how the central bank distorts the structure of production and unbalances the relationship between consumption and investment .
Along the same lines , we need to understand that the Great Depression was hardly the first such crisis .
In 1920 there was another , but it was resolved rather quickly because the government stayed out of the way .
Moreover , banking panics occurred often in the 19th century , and always because of the same factor : fractional - reserve banking backed by a lender of last resort .
Counterfeiting comes to nothing but trouble .
Rothbard reviews the whole of this history , complete with an accounting of every crooked banker and every power - mad politician , in A History of Money and Banking in the United States .
How serious do you want to get with your theoretical understanding ?
Do you find yourself tripped up by inflationists throwing intellectual curveballs ?
Maybe you should sit down with the great treatise on money and banking in our time : Money , Bank Credit , and Economic Cycles by Jesus Huerta de Soto .
Yes , it is long .
Yes , it has apparatus .
But the scholarship is wholly necessary for proving his radical thesis that fractional - reserve banking constitutes an intervention in the market economy and is the foundational reason for the business cycle .
Through a close examination of microeconomic law and economy , he finds a link to macroeconomic effects .
What we do in the micro-sphere echoes in the macro-sphere .
De Soto goes back to Roman law to show that bank deposits are rightly treated like other forms of property subject to the usual standards of fraud .
He demonstrates how this standard was widely accepted until a change in outlook in the high Middle Ages , when special interests prevailed on legal regimes to have deposits treated as loans , with disastrous effects .
The debate on this subject has been around for many decades , but no one has shed more light on this subject than De Soto .
I fully expect that this book will continue to be mandatory reading for any banking scholar for decades ahead .
It is the thesis of L. Albert Hahn , another forgotten anti-Keynesian , that all excess money creates illusions of prosperity .
He was once an advocate of Keynesian - style economic management , but he saw the error then wrote this fabulous and passionate attack on the whole theoretical and political apparatus .
Mises was a big advocate of this book : The Economics of Illusion .
It does n’t say good things about our world where people in college read the Keynesians , are taught that they were right about free markets , but meanwhile truly great economists like Hahn are forgotten — forgotten so much , in fact , that this book has been out of print for many decades .
The Mises Institute has made it available again .
Is n’t it time we revise our sense of what ideas deserve study , and what ideas deserve to truly drop down the memory hole ?
Hahn was not alone among the great economic thinkers of this age .
The New York Times employed one as its top editorialist : Henry Hazlitt .
He warned constantly about the dangers of the dollar creation .
His first great book against the Marshall Plan foreign aid was Will Dollars Save the World ?
Then he turned his fire on the Bretton Woods agreement , and he was shot down for it — forced out .
But who was right ?
The agreement broke down because it did n’t allow dollar convertibility for American citizens .
Here you can read his analysis of not only Bretton Woods but the whole inflation issue : What You Should Know about Inflation .
Here he lays out the entire issue : what is money , what it does , what government does to money , how the economy responds , what it means for your life , and what to do about it .
Hazlitt of course advocated the gold standard .
Since Ron Paul has raised the issue of the gold standard , and is being treated like some kind of visitor from Mars for having mentioned the subject at all , we need to know more about the true American heritage of the gold standard .
This is why I ’m personally very fired up that the Mises Institute has brought back William Gouge ’s Short History of Money and Banking which I first read while working for Ron in his congressional office .
Gouge lived from 1796 through 1863 and was involved in all the great debates on banking in the 19th century .
His book is a major attack on all inflationary finance , and reading him underscores just how universal are the lessons on money and banking — universal in the sense that they apply in all times and all places .
Back in the 19th century , there were many people who wanted inflation : bankers , debtors , and the government .
What a surprise !
Who has an interest in sound money ?
Consumers , savers , and liberty - loving citizens .
This is the essential conflict .
Are we going to have a monetary regime rooted in robbery , or one rooted in honesty ?
Gouge was on the side of honesty , and he inspires us today .
Coming a few decades later , but along the same lines , is Charles Holt Carroll ’s Organization of Debt Into Currency .
This is one of those books that develops a hard - core cadre of fans .
When we started reprinting these great American economic classics , people began to ask us : what about Carroll ?
Well , here it is , and once you get into the book , you realize why Rothbard and George Reisman and so many others swear by it .
He patiently explains the difference between money and debt and how the government goes about sowing confusion about what is what .
Now , Ron Paul stands in this tradition of thinkers in every way .
Even on the campaign stump , he speaks about the evil of fiat money and Fed management of the nation ’s money stock .
In a true sense , he says , we ’ve put a cartelized gang of central planners in charge of the good that constitutes half of every economic exchange , and we are paying the price in terms of declining purchasing power , exchange - rate chaos , rampant debt , and growing crises in sector after sector .
Is there a way out ?
Most certainly !
It goes by the name of gold .
Make the dollar as good as gold and you eliminate the inflation problem and the business cycles that go along with it .
Here is the great secret of the gold standard .
The problem is not that it is unviable from the perspective of economics .
The problem is that there are many people allied against it : the big banks , the creditor class , and government .
You see , gold would provide a hard - core anchor for liberty .
Under the right form of the gold standard , government could no longer spend with impunity or run up debt without limit .
The resources it spent would have to be raised the old - fashioned way .
It behooves every American to read Ron ’s book , really his manifesto on the topic .
It is called The Case for Gold .
He covers 19th century monetary history and discusses several plans for instituting a gold standard .
Note that I did n’t say “ going back ” to a gold standard , because if you look at past gold standards , there was always a flaw in the form of government intervention .
There was the crazy system called bimetallism .
There was the lack of domestic convertibility after the New Deal .
There were the guarantees in the form of central bank backing .
There were special privileges in the law .
The gold standard that Ron favors is not complicated : it is the one that would emerge in a world of freedom , a free - market money .
If his large book seems like too much , have a look at this primer : Gold , Peace , and Prosperity .
You can read it in an hour .
It explains why you should care about these issues , and why the government does n’t want you to care about them .

* Abu Muqawama ** writes ... *
Here 's a question for the class : is the Iraq War still a counter - insurgency ?
Not too long ago , a very smart friend of Abu Muqawama with years of experience in Iraq since 2003 wrote that Iraq was not merely an insurgency but a competition for power and resources .
That 's the phrase Abu Muqawama had in his head watching Basra go up in flames last week , and that 's also the phrase he had in mind as he read this op - ed in Sunday 's New York Times by Anthony Cordesman :
* Even if American and Iraqi forces are able to eliminate Al Qaeda in Iraq , there are still three worrisome possibilities of new forms of fighting that could divide Iraq and deny the United States any form of “ victory . ” *
One is that the Sunni tribes and militias that have been cooperating with the Americans could turn against the central government .
The second is that the struggle among Arabs , Kurds , Turkmen and other ethnic groups to control territory in the north could lead to fighting in Kirkuk , Mosul or other areas .
The third risk — and one that is now all too real — is that the political struggle between the dominant Shiite parties could become an armed conflict ...
* There are good reasons for the central government to reassert control of Basra .
It is not peaceful .
It is the key to Iraq ’s oil exports .
Gang rule is no substitute for legitimate government .
* __But given the timing and tactics , it is far from clear that this offensive is meant to serve the nation ’s interest as opposed to those of the [ Shi'ite ruling parties ] Islamic Supreme Council and Dawa .
__( emphasis mine , and throughout )
A few thoughts :
One , the fighting in Basra and Baghdad is , on one level , about asserting the control of the central government .
That is a good thing .
But two , on another level , the fighting that took place last week was about ISCI [ the Islamic Supreme Council ] trying to set the stage for this fall 's provincial elections .
It was n't about the central government versus local authorities at all – it was about cold - blooded intra-Shia politics .
Do we have a dog in such a fight ?
Alas , we do .
That dog 's name is ISCI .
As the same friend mentioned above has noted , historians studying Iraq decades from now will wonder why the United States allied itself with the Iran - backed ISCI instead of the popularly - supported Sadr movement .
( Hint to those historians : it 's because they dress well and speak English .
This is what happens when you send smart but young Republican loyalists – who only speak English – to help run the new government in Baghdad . )
Once again , we have backed the loser :
American military and civilian officials were candid in telling me that the governors and other local officials installed by the central government in Basra and elsewhere in southern
Iraq had no popular base .
If open local and provincial elections were held , they said , Dawa and the Islamic Supreme Council were likely to be routed because they were seen as having failed to bring development and government services .
So where does this leave us ?
Well , on the ground , we should stick to the new counterinsurgency manual , FM 3 - 24 .
And Abu Muqawama is n't just saying that because if there was nothing " COIN "
[ counterinsurgency ] about this war he could n't write about it anymore .
No , the maxim employed by then - Major General James Mattis and his
Marines in 2004 and stolen from some Greek guy – first , do no harm
\– is a good one .
Keep doing the kind of population - centric COIN
outlined in FM 3 - 24 , boys , because if nothing else , it 's not going to make the situation worse .
But tactics only get you so far .
If the strategy is n't sorted , the tactics can be world - beating stuff and still fail .
( Charlie 's favorite historical example : Germany in WWII . )
So politicians in Washington better get their act together and sort out the big picture .
On the one hand , the president and his policy - makers need to decide at what point these intra-Iraqi political disputes become none of our business .
Why should U.S. soldiers and Marines die so some fat Iraqi politician can have a greater share of the oil revenues ?
And folks in the opposition
\– including all the presidential campaigns ( you too , McCain )
and Congress – need to start prodding the president along by asking the tough , critical questions about the decisions we 're making .
What is our responsibility to the central government ?
How can we avoid allowing our soldiers to be the shock troops for the ruling party who is nervous about an election defeat in the fall ?
And finally , echoing a question then - Major General David Petraeus asked a * Washington Post * journalist on the eve of the war , tell me how this ends ?

DARPA 's
Vulture is yet another of the agency 's blue sky programs , this one maybe more than others .
Vulture is intended to fly for periods of up to five years unattended at 65,000 feet .
Here 's what DARPA requested :
The VULTURE Air Vehicle Program is an exploratory development program with the overall goal to develop and demonstrate the ability to deliver and maintain an airborne payload on station for an uninterrupted period exceeding 5 years using a heavier - than - air platform system ...
The government is not interested in approaches that use either radioactive energy sources or employs any form of buoyant flight for this application .
The intent is that DARPA 's Vulture would orbit over a small , well - defined area ( like a battlefield ) and provide continuous coverage of that area .
Vulture is intended to operate in a manner similar to a satellite , except that it has the advantage of not being bound by orbital mechanics .
The only satellites that can remain stationary over one spot must orbit at 22,240 miles — and this trick works only along the equator .
Low - flying spy satellites scoot quickly over their coverage area .
If the Vulture can be accomplished , you would see dramatic increases in sensor resolution and communications capability .
I can't understand why none of the articles I read on this program include references to the amazing Helios program .
Helios is a single wing , solar - powered aircraft that has performed admirably above Hawaii in tests performed in 2001 .
Helios is essentially an ultralight flying wing with 14 electric motors built by AeroVironment Inc. Helios ' 247 - foot wingspan exceeds that of a Boeing 747 .
Operating entirely under solar power ( including the take - off ) , Helios reached an altitude just short of 100,000 feet , which broke records for non-rocket powered flight .
At that altitude , Helios approached conditions for winged flights in the atmosphere of Mars .
It 's not quite the same thing , but both the DARPA Vulture and Helios remind me of the Flying Wing from Triplanetary , the 1934 novel by ' Doc ' Smith .
The Flying Wing was also able to fly to near - space .
Writer E.B.
White got very close to the Vulture idea with his description of the Stratovideo , in his scarily prescient 1950 story The Morning of the Day They Did It .
" ... after much experimentation by the Westinghouse and the Glenn Martin people a satisfactory substitute was found in the high - flying planes .
A few of these planes , spotted around the country , handled the whole television load nicely .
Known as Stratovideo planes , they were equipped with studios ; many programs originated in the air and were transmitted directly , others beamed from the aircraft to ground stations and then relayed .
The planes flew continuously , twenty - four hours a day ... " ( Read more about White 's Stratovideo planes )
Via DARPA pushes limits of unmanned aircraft capability to extremes .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) -
If you are male and a Led Zeppelin fan , chances are you may be leaning toward voting Republican in the U.S. presidential election , according to a survey of rock radio fans released on Wednesday .
Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) delivers remarks at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis , Maryland , April 2 , 2008 .

The Jacobs Media ’s Media / Technology Web Poll IV of more than 27,000 respondents cited stronger than expected interest in the November 2008 election among fans of rock , classic rock , and alternative radio stations .
It also found that John McCain , the Republican candidate for U.S. president , was the top pick for the Oval Office for men and classic rock partisans -- those people who tune in to stations playing music from the “ original classic rock era ” of 1964 to 1975 , comprised of bands like Led Zeppelin , The Who and Pink Floyd .
Jacobs Media said the survey , conducted among 69 U.S. rock - formatted stations in markets as diverse as Los Angeles and Knoxville to Buffalo , found 84 percent of the respondents planned to vote in the November election .
“ People are clearly engaged by this election , even rockers .
A lot of stations tend to shy away from politics because it ’s so polarizing , but this data suggests they ’d better find a way to talk about politics this fall to keep listeners interested , ” said Fred Jacobs , president of Jacobs Media .
He said the company threw the political questions in as an afterthought and was surprised by the results .
The survey was conducted in late February and early March .
About 30 percent of the respondents called themselves Democrats , while nearly 22 percent described their politics as Republican and 21 percent declared they were independents .
About 26 percent of the respondents either named a different party , preferred not to answer , or refused to categorize themselves .
The survey found women and fans of alternative radio , featuring ‘ 80s and ‘ 90s rock , tend to be Democratic , while men and classic rockers lean Republican .
Asked about their overall presidential preference , Democrat Barack Obama led the pack with 26 percent support among those planning on voting in the November election .
McCain ranked second with 22 percent and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton drew 18 percent .
There were also a fair share of write - in votes .
Mickey Mouse ranked as the top presidential choice of 11 respondents , and singer Ted Nugent was written in by three members of the Rock sample .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A suspected high - level al Qaeda member who helped Osama bin Laden elude U.S. forces in Afghanistan has been captured and sent to the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay , the Pentagon said on Friday .

The detainee , Muhammad Rahim , helped prepare the Tora Bora caves used as a hide - out for bin Laden in Afghanistan in 2001 , and helped him escape during the U.S. - led invasion that followed the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , officials said .
He also tried to procure chemicals for a plan to attack U.S. - led coalition forces in Afghanistan and to recruit people with access to U.S. military facilities , Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said .
“ He is a close associate of Osama bin Laden and had close ties to al Qaeda organizations throughout the Middle East , ” Whitman said .
Rahim , an Afghan national , was detained in the summer of 2007 , according to a statement CIA Director Michael Hayden gave to CIA employees .
The CIA transferred him into Defense Department custody earlier this week , according to Whitman .
Whitman would not say where or how Rahim was initially detained .
He also would not say who captured him .
But Hayden said Rahim was transferred into U.S. custody after his detention , which could mean the detainee was first held by non-U.S. forces .
“ Rahim was eventually moved into U.S. custody and -- given his past and the continuing threat he presented to American interests -- placed in CIA ’s interrogation program , ” Hayden said .
A senior counterterrorism official would not describe the interrogation methods used on Rahim .
“ I ca n’t characterize the nature of his questioning ( but ) this detention was done in accord with U.S. law , ” the official said .
‘ TOUGH , SEASONED JIHADIST ’
Rahim served as a translator and courier for bin Laden , according to U.S. officials .
Hayden said Rahim was proficient in several languages and familiar with the border areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan , and that he had combat experience dating back to the 1980s -- when U.S. - backed Islamic fighters drove Soviet forces out of Afghanistan .
“ Rahim is a tough , seasoned jihadist , ” Hayden wrote .
According to the Pentagon , Rahim began working for al Qaeda in the mid-1990s , procuring supplies and later carrying messages among the group ’s leaders .
He carried messages for bin Laden in early 2002 , Whitman said .
Prior to 2002 , he worked with Abd al - Hadi al - Iraqi , an al Qaeda commander now detained at Guantanamo .
Whitman would not say whether information gathered from interrogations of al - Hadi led to Rahim ’s capture .
“ Intelligence is one of our most important tools in the global war on terror , ” Whitman said .
“ It ’s been essential in developing our knowledge of al Qaeda ’s structures , operations , finances , logistics and criminal activity to include safe routes , safe havens and intentions to conduct further attacks . ”
Al - Hadi was sent to Guantanamo in April 2007 .
With Rahim , the Pentagon is now holding 16 men it considers “ high - value detainees ” -- a classification that indicates U.S. officials believe the capture had a significant effect on al Qaeda operations and the prisoner is capable of providing high - quality intelligence .
The military prison at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , holds about 280 detainees .
The last transfer into Guantanamo was in August .
Al - Hadi was the last high - value detainee transferred from the CIA to the prison before Rahim .
The counterterrorism official declined to say whether there were others in the interrogation program .

Bush says House aiding ' trial lawyers ' by not granting telco immunity David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday March 13 , 2008

Print This Email This UPDATE : Feingold fires back at Bush 's ' transparent fear mongering '
Growing increasingly frustrated at House Democrats ' refusal to give him the authority he 's demanded on terrorist - surveillance legislation , President Bush has resorted to using increasingly partisan and misleading rhetoric , immunity opponents charge .
The House is expected to vote Thursday on a bill to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act that does not include retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies that facilitated the warrantless surveillance of Americans .
An immunity provision would spare these companies the burden of defending themselves in about 40 pending lawsuits alleging they violated customers ' privacy rights .
Bush has insisted that the companies ' actions were legal , but the administration has scuttled Congressional attempts to verify his " trust me " approach .
His latest rhetorical flourish unearths one of the conservatives ' favorite bogeymen -- " trial lawyers " -- to argue for immunity .
" The House bill may be good for class action trial lawyers , but it would be terrible for the United States , " Bush said .
The president is turning up his rhetorical heat in the latest address .
He made the same argument in a press conference two weeks ago .
He used the less - charged descriptor , " plaintiff 's attorneys , " although he did say they were looking for a " financial gravy train . "
Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) , one of the leading immunity opponents in Congress , fired back after Bush 's speech .
ï¿½The Presidentï¿½s fear - mongering and efforts to mislead the American people have become increasingly transparent , " Feingold said in a prepared statement .
" The House should continue to stand up to these tactics and decline to grant immunity to companies that allegedly cooperated in the presidentï¿½s illegal warrantless wiretapping program .
It is unacceptable that this administration seems to be more interested in avoiding all accountability for the program than it is in working with Congress to pass a bill that both allows us to aggressively go after suspected terrorists and protects the privacy of innocent Americans .ï¿½
The American Civil Liberties Union , which along with the Electronic Frontier Foundation is representing plaintiffs against the telecoms , has said the lawsuits are about protecting the constitution , not collecting a paycheck .
And immunity opponents point out that if the telecoms really did act within the law , as Bush insists , they already are immune from prosecution .
" It 's critical to emphasize ... that the telecoms already have immunity under existing statutes , even if they broke the law , as long as they obtained from the Attorney General certifications that the warrantless surveillance requests were legal , " writes Glenn Greenwald , who has closely followed the FISA debate ( emphasis in original ) .
" If the telecoms really did obtain those certifications -- and it's extremely unlikely that they did -- then all they ever had to do was just show them to the court and they would be immune . "
The House bill seeks a compromise over how telecoms will approach their court battles that stops short of a full grant of retroactive immunity .
But they offered the companies an olive branch : the chance to use classified government documents to defend themselves in court .
House Democratic leaders unveiled a bill that they hoped would bridge the gap between the electronic surveillance bill passed by the Senate last month and a rival version the House approved last fall .
The House bill also would create a bipartisan commission , modeled after the 9/11 Commission , to investigate the Bush administration 's secret wiretapping program .
Sticking to his all - or - nothing approach to updating the surveillance law , Bush panned all of those proposals , and he continued to claim that the US was more vulnerable because the FISA expansion remained in limbo .
( The president earlier pledged to veto a temporary measure aimed at closing those so - called vital gaps . )
He called on the House not to leave tomorrow for its Easter recess without passing a FISA bill identical to one already passed in the Senate , where a dozen Democrats joined Republicans in giving Bush everything he wanted .

At long last , the Duke DC Music Pack v2.0 has arrived !
What you get with this is nothing less than a completely new soundtrack for Duke It Out In D.C. with original music , composed by James " Jimmy " Paddock .
This creative guy has already shown his qualities as a composer in many Doom community projects ( including standalone efforts such as his " Harmony " MIDI Pack ) , and this debut contribution of his for a Duke3D - related game is a remarkable event that deserves acknowledgement .
Initially , I had already proposed this project to Jimmy back in 2013 ( free of charge back then ) , but it got delayed and did not really kick off before 2016 when it turned into a commission .
Until January 2017 , I have worked closely with Jimmy to give him ideas about the addon levels and which atmosphere I wished to be conveyed with the music .
For digitizing the MIDI files ( included in the music pack and usable ingame if two lines in duke3d. def inside of the zipfile are edited ) , we decided to use Maxime Abbey 's Arachno Soundfont for best overall quality .
In my opinion , the result is absolutely fantastic .
For the first time , the DukeDC levels get their own , individual tracks and feel better than ever when you play them !
Maybe some of you who were using previous versions of my music pack ( featuring selected music from various artists ) may have problems getting used to the different approach at first , but I am absolutely convinced you will quickly learn to love it just as much as I do !
You may download the new DukeDC Music Pack right away in the Download section or listen to the tracks on Youtube first if you are curious .
All that 's left to mention is that it was a great pleasure for me to work with Jimmy .
Thank you so much for this amazing effort , pal !
Somewhere in the Middle East , Jesus Christ is strapped to a bench , his head wrapped in clingfilm .
He furiously sucks against the plastic .
A hole is pierced , but only so that a filthy rag can be stuffed back into his mouth .
He is turned upside down and water slowly poured into the rag .
The torturer whispers religious abuse .
If you are God , save yourself you fucking idiot .
Fighting to pull in oxygen through the increasingly saturated rag , his lungs start to fill up with water .
Someone punches him in the stomach .
Perhaps this is how we ought to be re-telling the story of Christ 's passion .
For ever since the cross became a piece of jewellery , it has been drained of its power to sicken .
Even before this the Romans had taken their hated instrument of torture and turned it into the logo of a new religion .
Few makeovers can have been so historically significant .
The very secular cross was transformed into a sort of club badge for Christians , something to be proud of .
Two weeks ago , the most powerful Christian in the world vetoed a bill that would have made it illegal for the CIA to use waterboarding on detainees .
" We need to ensure our intelligence officials have all the tools they need to stop the terrorists , " said George Bush in a passable impersonation of Pontius Pilate .
" This is no time for Congress to abandon practices that have a proven track record of keeping America safe . "
Throughout his time in office , the president has frequently been photographed in front of the cross .
Yet as his support for torture demonstrates , he has understood little of its meaning .
For the story of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus is supremely a moral story about God 's identification with victims .
The French anthropologist René Girard is the modern voice that has done most to explain the nature of this moral change .
Human societies , he argues , are often held together by scapegoating .
From the playground to the boardroom , we pick on the weak , the weird or the different as a way of securing communal solidarity .
At times of tension or division , there is nothing quite as uniting as the " discovery " of someone to blame - often someone perfectly innocent .
For generations of Europeans , the Jews were cast in the role ; in the same way women have been accused of being witches , homosexuals derided as unnatural , and Muslims dismissed as terrorists .
The crucifixion turns this world on its head .
For it is the story of a God who deliberately takes the place of the despised and rejected so as to expose the moral degeneracy of a society that purchases its own togetherness at the cost of innocent suffering .
The new society he called forth - something he dubbed the kingdom of God - was to be a society without scapegoating , without the blood of the victim .
The task of all Christians is to further this kingdom , " on earth as it is in heaven " .
Yet , for all his years in office , it is hard to think that President Bush has done anything much to make this kingdom more of a reality .
Instead he has given us rendition , so - called specialised interrogation procedures , and the blood of many thousand innocent Iraqis .
Given all this , what can it possibly mean for George Bush to call himself a Christian ?
Easter is not all about going to heaven .
Still less some nasty evangelical death cult where a blood sacrifice must be paid to appease an angry God .
The crucifixion reveals human death - dealing at its worst .
In contrast , the resurrection offers a new start , the foundation of a very different sort of community that refuses the logic of scapegoating .
The kingdom is a place of shocking , almost amoral , inclusion .
All are welcome , especially the rejected .
At least , that 's the theory .
Unfortunately , very few of us Christians are any good at it .

Ben Dreidel sat through a Ben Stein interview on the Trinity Broadcasting Network so you do n’t have to .
( If you ’re curious , go here , click on the “ Behind the Scenes ” tab , and go to the video for April 21th . )
It ’s amazing how many shock - inducing things Stein says to host Paul Crouch , Jr. regarding the theory of evolution and science in general when he does n’t think non-Christians are watching .
A few excerpts ( courtesy of Ben D. ) are below .
Look at the last ones , especially :
Ben Stein : … I also started reading more about a subject that had long interested me , the connection of Darwinism with Nazism , and the fact that Nazism had rested in large part on the idea of Darwinism , that there are superior and inferior races , and that the superior ones deserve to live and they should stamp out the inferior ones … …
Crouch :
What can people of faith do ?
What do you hope comes from this film ?
Stein :
Well , we hope that people who have children in schools will tell their children that if the teacher says Darwinism created everything and that there is no explanation for anything in the scientific world except Darwinism , that the student will say , well , Ms. Smith — or whatever the teacher ’s name is — how did life begin ?
What keeps the planets in their orbits ?
Is there any proof of a separate species ever being seen to evolve ? …
Stein :
We ’re saying teach what is … what the evidence takes you to .
I mean , the evidence does not take you to Darwinism about , uh , about , uh , as to the foundations of life .
Darwin just had nothing to say about that .
The evidence does n’t take you to Darwinism about astronomy or about the laws of physics or of thermodynamics .
…
Stein :
When we just saw that man , I think it was Mr. [ PZ ]
Myers , talking about how great scientists were , I was thinking to myself the last time any of my relatives saw scientists telling them what to do they were telling them to go to the showers to get gassed .
…
Stein ( speaking about the Holocaust ) : … that was horrifying beyond words , and that ’s where science — in my opinion , this is just an opinion — that ’s where science leads you .
Crouch :
That ’s right .
Stein : … Love of God and compassion and empathy leads you to a very glorious place , and science leads you to killing people .
Crouch : Good word , good word .
You ’ve got to be *% &^ing kidding me .

India is leaving the Third World so fast that it is almost possible to watch it happeneing .
Many write off India as backward and poor .
The reality is that its billion people have a booming economy , excellent education and limitless ambition – and they are ready to take over the world .
America , Asia , Europe and the Middle East face a reversal of fortune that will astonish us and overpower us if we do not revise our rapidly dating assumptions and prejudices .
Yes India still has poverty with the power to turn the stomach .
Yes , there are still elephants striding nonchalantly through the boiling city traffic and cows on the loose in the heart of a megalopolis which crams the population half the size of Australia into fewer than 750 square kilometers .
But heartbreaking as these images are , they are not a true indication of the new civilisation which is growing here in the world ’s largest free country .
In India , the amazing thing is that all the intelligent people are optimistic .
The economists , the writers and the thinking classes in general , are full of an infectious patriotic delight at the way their mighty country is preparing for world power .
No douby some unpredictable disaster could unhorse this new hope .
A recent article in Forbes mentioned that India would have the maximum number of Billionaire ’s in 10 years time .
The world is paying too much attention to China and too little to India .
America and Europe , in particular , simply havnt been able to cope with the threat India ’s information technology industry poses to their own jobs .
“ They could not believe Indians could do this .
To them , this was still a country of snake charmers .
Read
In any Indian there ’s now a sense of tremendous belief in the future .
Even five years ago there was n’t .
We used to be apologetic about our identity , today we want to flash our identity – as Americans have always done .
The lower middle class used to lament that the rich would get richer while they stayed stuck or even sank lower into poverty .
They no longer believe that . ”
While most of the world has been looking at China , or has been distracted by America ’s clumsy and self destructive attemt to spread freedom with smart bombs and tanks , India has been incubating an economic and social revolution that is just as significant .
With a population of one billion , most of them young and huge number in their 20’s , it is not far behing China ’s 1.3 billion in sheer numbers .
But it has significant advantages which China does not possess and may never achieve .
China is a police state with muzzled media and is run by a rigid , secretive elite wothout the rule of law .
Crucially in India it is the poor who vote most of all and , as a result they have astonishing power .
It is one of the many examples of the way in which the old British India is now utterly dead , but now ideas which were truly British have been successfully adapted to Indian needs .
Now you know why the slums are not bulldozed and their inhabitants rounded up and expelled as they might be in China or other parts of the world , and why nothing is done to prevent migration to cities by poor country families hoping to better themselves .
India speaks English and in – in one of Britan ’s greatest and least noted achievements – is the greatest functioing democracy in the history of the world .
A genuinely free press is increasingly bold in exposing corruption and abuse of authority .
At the last elections 400 million people voted and the existing government was evicted from power without violence .
And now India has what must be surely the world ’s biggest and fastest growing middle class .
Thanks to the economic reforms in the early Nineties , and to long quiet growth before that , this confident growing class now has the purchasing power to sustain lasting economic growth and the political power to demand serious reform .
The reverence for education and self improvement here is comparable to America in its great days , when everyone assumed that tommorrow would be better than today , and was determined to make sure it would be .
A wise investor here would be setting up as many high quality , affordable private schools as he could build .
We should take nothing for granted about India except that it is changing with great speed and that it is , just now , one of the most hopeful places in a world badly in need of a new great power that believes in freedom and democracy .
How to Improve Your Social Skills : 8 Tips from the Last 2500 Years
Image by nogoodphotography .
One source for pretty reliable advice is what has been repeated .
Not whatâ€™s been repeated throughout your life but throughout history .
Time - tested advice , advice that has survived and been rediscovered over the centuries often has a good deal of practical value .
I think this applies to tips on improving your social skills .
Society may have changed but people are people .
So what worked a couple of hundred or thousand years ago can still be useful today .
Here are eight tips on social skills that have been told over and over .
Maybe youâ€™ll find them helpful .
1. Listen
â€ œNature gave us one tongue and two ears so we could hear twice as much as we speak.â€ 
Epictetus â€œThe less you speak , the more you will hear.â€ 
Alexander Solshenitsen â€ œI like to listen .
I have learned a great deal from listening carefully .
Most people never listen.â€ 
Ernest Hemingway
This is probably one of the most underappreciated social skills .
People are often centred on themselves .
Nothing surprising really , but it doesnâ€™t mean that they are selfish jerks either .
But because of this a lot of people are just used to talking about themselves or waiting for the other person to finish so they can start talking again .
I know I have done this many times and still do from time to time .
How do you get past it ?
One useful way that I have found is to just forget about yourself .
Focus your attention outward instead of inward in a conversation .
Place the mental focus on the person you are talking and listening to instead of yourself .
Placing the focus outside of yourself makes you less self - centred and your need to hog the spotlight decreases .
If you start to actually listen to what people are saying it also becomes easier to find potential paths in the conversation .
By asking open - ended questions â€ “ the ones that will give you more than a yes or no answer â€ “ you can explore these paths and have better and more fun conversations .
And this ties into the next tipâ€ ¦
2. Actually be interested in the other person .
â€ œYou can make more friends in two months by becoming really interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you .
Which is just another way of saying that the way to make a friend is to be one.â€ 
Dale Carnegie â€œThe greatest compliment that was ever paid me was when someone asked me what I thought , and attended to my answer.â€ 
Henry David Thoreau
If you become more interested in people then youâ€™ll naturally become a better listener since you are actually interested in whatâ€™s on their minds .
And it beomes easier find out what someone is really passionate about and to dispel negative assumptions that can mess up the communication .
If you listen to what someone has to say then you may find that s/he for instance isnâ€™t as boring or different from you as you may have guessed when you were first introduced .
And as Carnegie says , itâ€™s a lot easier to create and improve relationships if you focus on the other person than on yourself .
Why is that ?
Well , for one , as I wrote just a few paragraphs ago , people often donâ€™t listen that much .
So youâ€™ll be a pleasant exception among the others that are waiting for their turn to talk again .
But the big reason is simply that you make them feel good because of your attention , validation of them and their interest and the connection that is made .
3 . Donâ€™t listen too much to criticism .
â€ œIf evil be said of thee , and if it be true , correct thyself ; if it be a lie , laugh at it.â€ 
Epictetus “ When we judge or criticize another person , it says nothing about that person ; it merely says something about our own need to be critical . ”
Unknown
Well , Epictetus got this one down .
Listen to criticism .
If you feel that there is some relevance to it explore how you can change yourself .
But also recognize that lot of the time criticism is mostly about the other person .
Maybe s/he has had a bad day .
Maybe a pet or child is sick .
Maybe s/he is jealous of you or angry at someone else .
Since people often are centred on themselves itâ€™s easy to make a mistake here .
Someone may criticise you but is actually focused on something in their own life .
And you are probably also focused on yourself .
And therefore you draw the conclusion that the criticism must have something to do with you .
But the world doesnâ€™t revolve around you .
Which is bad if you want more attention and validation from others .
On the other hand , it can be liberating since people donâ€™t seem to care that much about what you do .
The big problem of not daring to do something because youâ€ ™re afraid of what people may say becomes a smaller obstacle .
4. Donâ€™t babble on and on .
â€ œThe less people speak of their greatness , the more we think of it.â€ 
Sir Francis Bacon â€œThe more you say , the less people remember.â€ 
FranÃ§ois FÃ©nelon
This one 's connected to listening .
If you talk and talk there will be little time , energy or focus for listening .
But if you start to focus outward then your mind will become more focused and youâ€™ll spend less time babbling for too long about something .
If you want more reasons to stop babbling and start simplifying check out 5 Reason to Simplify What You Say , and How to Do It .
5 . Treat others as you would like them to treat you .
â€ œThe people with whom you work reflect your own attitude .
If you are suspicious , unfriendly and condescending , you will find these unlovely traits echoed all about you .
But if you are on your best behaviour , you will bring out the best in the persons with whom you are going to spend most of your working hours.â€ 
Beatrice Vincent â€ œItâ€™s so easy to laugh , itâ€™s so easy to hate .
It takes guts to be gentle and kind.â€ 
Morrissey
The Law of Reciprocity is strong in humans .
As you treat someone else s/he will feel like treating you .
Maybe not today or tomorrow .
But over time these things have a way of evening out .
One of the most important things in relationships and conversations is your attitude .
It determines a lot about your interactions and how you treat other people .
The attitude you have , the lens you hold up and view the world through determines what you see .
And the thoughts you keep in your mind control how you feel .
Your thoughts and feelings direct how you say something and what your hands , eyes , posture etc. says through body language .
So even if you say nice words you may create an different feeling in the person you are talking to because your thoughts , feelings , voice tonality and body language arenâ€™t aligned with your words .
And words are only 7 percent of communication .
So the attitude behind your words is absolutely crucial .
6. Keep a positive attitude .
“ I am convinced that attitude is the key to success or failure in almost any of life 's endeavors .
Your attitude – your perspective , your outlook , how you feel about yourself , how you feel about other people – determines you priorities , your actions , your values .
Your attitude determines how you interact with other people and how you interact with yourself . ”
Carolyn Warner
“ Two men look out the same prison bars ; one sees mud and the other stars . ”
Frederick Langbridge â€ œConstant kindness can accomplish much .
As the sun makes ice melt , kindness causes misunderstanding , mistrust and hostility to evaporate.â€ 
Albert Schweitzer
If your attitude is so important then what can you do about it ?
One good tip , that has worked for very long , is simply to keep a positive attitude .
And by that I donâ€™t mean that you should just react in a positive way to events in your life that may be seen by society as positive .
For instance , getting a raise in salary , an A on an exam or winning a competition .
But before I continue with that train of thought Iâ€™d just like to say something about negativity .
I wouldnâ€™t say that it is all bad .
I wouldnâ€™t say that people want to get away from negative people all of the time .
Sometimes you can find camaraderie in complaining about your boss , job , salary and the government .
But overall and long - term I think that going positive is the more useful and fulfilling approach .
Now , what I mean with adopting a positive attitude is choosing to stay positive regardless of your external circumstances .
You may not be able to do this all the time , but being positive is habit just like eating well or doing your daily exercise .
It can be hard to get started and slow going at first .
But when your mind gets used to this new behaviour it becomes almost automatic .
Your mind just starts to interpret reality in a different way than it did before .
Instead of seeing problems everywhere it starts to zoom in on opportunities and whatâ€™s good about just about any situation .
Instead of sighing and feeling like youâ€ ™re working in an uphill rut youâ€™ll find reasons to be grateful and happy .
Yeah , I know , it might sound like wishful thinking .
But it really works .
The problem is just that it is difficult to see this – and to realise that you can actually change – from a current worldview and attitude that may be a bit more negative .
If youâ€™d like to read more about this , have a look at Take the Positivity Challenge for some more reasons to change your attitude â€ “ they include making better first impressions and becoming more attractive – and how to do it .
7 . Use silence .
â€ œA good word is an easy obligation ; but not to speak ill requires only our silence ; which costs us nothing .â€ 
John Tillotson â€œBe silent , or say something better than silence.â€ 
Pythagoras â€ œIt 's good to shut up sometimes.â€ 
Marcel Marceau
There are several good reasons to learn to be more silent .
It will help you to develop your listening skills .
And instead of saying something you wish you didnâ€™t you can learn to keep your piehole closed .
This can help you avoid unnecessary arguments and reduce the hurt you do unto others by , for example , criticising .
Sitting in silence day in and day out while your inner pressure builds up is of course not good .
Then you may need speak up , take charge and change whatever it is in your environment that causes the problem .
But often a great deal of negative things can be avoided just by calmly staying silent .
8. Communicate with more than your words .
â€ œThey may forget what you said , but they will never forget how you made them feel.â€ 
Carl W. Buechner â€ œI speak two languages , English and Body.â€ 
Mae West â€œWe often refuse to accept an idea merely because the tone of voice in which it has been expressed is unsympathetic to us.â€ 
Friedrich Nietzsche
The words you use are just a small part of communication .
How you use your tone of voice and your body language is over 90 percent of what you are communicating .
To become a better communicator these two areas are ridiculously important .
You can for instance improve how you say something by loading your words with more emotions .
If you use tip # 6 – Keep a positive attitude – this often improves kinda automatically .
Youâ€™ll naturally convey more enthusiasm and positive emotions through your voice .
Your attitude , as mentioned before , also has big impact on your body language .
If you feel relaxed , open and positive this comes through in how you use your body .
You may want check out these additional 17 body language tips though .
Just to be on the safe side .
And to not repeat and reinforce some old and ingrained body language habits .
Manually correcting your body language can be useful .
When you for instance are listening , you can lean in and keep eye contact to reinforce that you are actually listening .
If you keep your body language interested youâ€™ll also be able to keep your focus and interest longer since emotions can work backwards .
As your body is â€œinterestedâ€  your mind becomes interested and focused on what is said .

What type of house would you live in or build if you were a celebrity ?
Would you build a home that depicts your hobbies , or would you build a place that is so “ you ” or so overpriced that you could n’t sell it no matter how hot the market ?
With those questions in mind , we sought the ten top most ridiculous , obnoxious , and just plain ugly celebrity pads around .
Of course , beauty is in the eye of the beholder , so what we think is tacky might seem gorgeous and practical to another beholder …
The list below is in no particular order .
While the sites are numbered , the numbering does not indicate that we favor one site over another or that they are listed in order of value .
Britney Spears : According to public records , Spears purchased the Malibu , California house through her Love Shack Trust in October 2004 for $ 6,300,000 .
The 7,400 square foot home boasts a pool , a spa , tennis court and gym , a maid ’s quarters , seven bedrooms and six and a half bathrooms .
Spears put the home on the market in January 2007 for $ 13.5 million , but the price dropped in March to $ 11.8 million .
The house , which is located in the exclusive gated Serra Retreat area where such stars as Mel Gibson live , may have priced itself out of the market for the moment .
Additionally , rumor has it that the gated estate was too overly - customized to Mr. and Mrs. Spears ’ tastes .
According to the linked source , “ A bar in every room was too over - the - top for the average potential buyer in that price range – not to mention the lavish poolside bar built over which once was the tennis court . ”
This past March , papers were served to Britney and she was almost evicted because she had n’t paid the rent .
It appears that Britney ’s financial team screwed up , but that all payments now are current .
John Travolta :
No , this is n’t an airline terminal .
It ’s the home of John Travolta and family , built specifically to house his Gulfstream and Boeing 707B .
The home is located immediately off a main airstrip in Ocala , Florida , and it ’s designed so his jets can taxi right up to two outbuildings connected to the main structure that ’s shaped like a truncated air - control tower .
Although the property came equipped with a 7,500 - foot runway , Travolta extended the taxiway to reach the house .
Actress Kelly Preston , Travolta ’s wife , can tell when John ’s home , as the planes are visible from the living area inside the home .
If that ’s not enough airline for you , wait until you see the mural in the dining area that was culled from a 1937 Fortune magazine ad .
Diners can pretend they ’re eating in the lobby of a 1930s Paris airport .
Michael Jackson : Michael Jackson ’s Neverland Ranch served as the pop singer ’s private amusement park and home when the facility opened in 1988 , but it ’s no longer in operation .
This ridiculous property , which lies over 2,800 acres , contains a zoo , a theme park with Ferris wheel , merr - go - round , zipper , spider , sea dragon , wave swinger , super slide , dragon wagon kiddie roller coaster , and bumper cars .
Named for Neverland , the fantastical island in the story of Peter Pan where children never grow up , the ranch is located near Los Olivos , California .
As of March , 2008 , the property remains in foreclosure proceedings , with a possible auction slated unless Jackson clears his debt .
The auction may be forestalled by a loan extension offered by his loan holder Fortress Investments , according to Fox News .
Ira Rennert : Rennert , a publicity - shy billionaire founder of the Renco Group , is known more for his obnoxious New York Hamptons home than he is for anything else .
This mansion is considered one of the largest occupied residential compounds in America , and – if put on the market – may be the valued as the most expensive home on earth .
The home sits on 63 acres , and the buildings cover over 110,000 square feet including the 66,000 square foot main house .
The main building contains a 91 - foot long dining room , 29 bedrooms and 39 bathrooms .
Fair Field , named after the adjoining Fairfield Pond , also contains a bowling alley , tennis and squash courts , and a $ 150,000 hot tub .
Candy Spelling : Producer Aaron Spelling tore down Bing Crosby ’s old home to build this ridiculous 56,000 - square - foot , 123 - room Los Angeles , California estate .
Unarguably the largest estate in California , this hotel - sized mansion sports a bowling alley and a single room devoted entirely to gift wrapping .
While rumors ran rampant that Aaron ’s widow , Candy , would sell the home in 2006 following Aaron ’s death , Candy dispelled the rumors and continues to reside alone in the mansion .
Candy Spelling is the mother of Tori and Randy Spelling , both actors .
Candy and Tori have remained hot in celebrity mags , thanks to their feuds over Aaron ’s inheritance , Tori ’s portrayal of her mother in a VH1 sitcom , and other family feudal issues .
Will Smith : This is Will and Jada Smith ’s ridiculously obnoxious mansion , located in California .
Their estate is described as a Calabasas castle , as it has its own lake , basketball court , tennis court and a pair of private par threes in the backyard .
The estate took over seven years to build at $ 20 million .
Smith stated , “ The problem is that you build your dream home , but then you ’re seven years older so it ’s the house you used to want real bad ! ”
By 2004 , when they had seven months until they could move in , Smith added , “ We ’ve got about seven more months ( before we move in ) .
Everybody is excited because we went ( to the house ) and we let the kids come in and they picked out their rooms .
Some of them are not gonna live there because they ’re gonna have their own home by the time we actually move in ! ”
The Smith family was forced to leave this home in 2005 when a bush fire threatened to destroy it and several other houses in the same area .
Donald Trump : Donald Trump ’s Palm Beach , Florida mansion was primed for the real estate market in 2006 , and this 80,000 - square - foot estate was priced at $ 125 million well before the housing meltdown .
This obnoxious mansion , which resembles a civic center , totals 62,000 square feet , with nine bedrooms , a ballroom , media room , art gallery , beauty salon , and a 4,100 - square - foot conservatory .
Additionally , the 6.5 - acre property with 475 feet of ocean frontage includes two guest houses , a pool , and parking for 40 cars .
Trump purchased the estate for $ 41.35 million in a 2004 Florida bankruptcy - court auction .
Trump renovated Maison de l’Amitié during his tenure , and during the sale it was listed as the most expensive home on the market anywhere in the U.S. Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan bin Abdul Aziz : Shortly after His Royal Highness Prince Bandar bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz was appointed Secretary - General of the National Security Council by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah on October 16 , 2005 , he put his house in Aspen , Colorado up for sale .
His reason for purchasing this home , which sits on 95 acres , includes his position as Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the United States of America from October 24 , 1983 to September 8 , 2005 .
However , it appears that His Highness rarely stayed at this U.S. palace .
The main portion of the house , which is larger than the White House , includes 16 bathrooms , 15 bedrooms , stables , a tennis court , an indoor swimming pool , outdoor water features and a snowmelt driveway .
The price ?
At the time , the asking price was $ 135 million , ten million more than what Trump asked for his Palm Beach estate .
The Prince took the house off the market in November 2007 after a lack of offers .
Michael Vick :
The former quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is languishing in jail and no longer lives in this somewhat tacky Surrey County , Virginia home since he was convicted for dog fighting .
The house includes 5 bedrooms , 5 bathrooms , a white brick exterior , hardwood floors , and a full basketball court in the backyard .
Although the Surry County , Virginia Commissioner of the Revenue stated the dwelling itself is valued at $ 647,000 , and the 15 acres of land upon which the home sits was valued at $ 100,000 , it would be very spooky to live in a home where this celebrity buried dog carcasses .
The home sits across the street from a Baptist Church and is surrounded by a large , white fence and was sold at auction in November 2007 .
Martha Stewart : Would you pay $ 8.9 million for this house ?
That ’s what Martha Stewart wants for her Westport , Connecticut home called “ Turkey Hill . ”
The Georgian style house sports nine bedrooms , three baths , several outbuildings and “ the nicest garden in town . ”
However , we feel that – given Martha ’s gift for creativity – this house really is a turkey .
At least it has plenty of room to roam on 4.03 acres .
But , that wallpaper effect on the stairwell needs to go ( follow the link to view the images ) .

This is a PlanetJune original tutorial .
Please do not share or reproduce this tutorial ; instead post a link to www.planetjune.com/shrinkydinks
I ’ll answer some questions from the comments on my previous shrinky rings post before I get started , and add more hints and tips throughout the tutorial .
Shrink plastic , for the uninitiated , was originally marketed as a toy for kids .
It starts life thin and flexible .
You draw on it and then bake it in the oven , and it shrinks to become about 1/3 of the starting size , but 9 times as thick .
This thickness makes it strong and hard .
It will not bend after baking , so if you try to pull your ring open , or stand on it , it may snap , but it is strong enough to withstand regular use as a ring .
The last step ( bending the ring into shape ) is the most difficult , so I highly recommend that 1 ) you read through all the instructions before starting , and 2 ) practice on a blank piece of shrink plastic so you can get a feel for it and test your size and bending technique before putting too much effort into your design !
Full tutorial instructions are after the jump …
1 . Find your shrink plastic
I use Shrinky Dinks Frosted Ruff N’ Ready , which accepts rubber stamped images beautifully .
Any transparent shrink plastic will work .
If you use the coloured opaque shrink plastic , you would have to decorate the outside of your ring instead of the inside .
You could also use the inkjet printable type of shrink plastic .
An alternative source for shrinkable plastic is # 6 plastic , commonly used in food packaging .
Look for the ‘ 6 ’ recycling symbol to make sure you ’re using the right type !
You ’ll have to sand one side before use , as the plastic needs a rough ( not shiny ) surface so the ink wo n’t smudge and rub off .
Note :
If you are looking for sources , search for “ shrink plastic ” ( generic term ) not “ shrinkydinks ” ( brand name ) and you may have more luck .
For example , if you ’re in the UK , googling ‘ Shrink Plastic UK ’ ( without the quotes ) will give you lots of online stores that sell it .
You ’re looking for large sheets of it , not pre-cut shapes .
2. Measure and cut to size
Note : Different brand of shrink plastic may shrink by different amounts , so you might want to try baking a plain test piece to make sure you ’ve got the size right before spending time on decoration .
Measure :
The best method to find the right length for your strip of plastic is by trial and error .
A : Simple Method :
Use my measurements for your first attempt , then modify the length if they turn out too small or big !
My rings fit small ladies ’ fingers , and are 6 mm ( 1/4 ″ ) tall .
My starting dimensions were 14.2 x 1.6 cm ( 5 5/8 x 5/8 ″ ) .
Use my measurements for your first attempt , then modify the length if they turn out too small or big !
My rings fit small ladies ’ fingers , and are 6 mm ( 1/4 ″ ) tall .
My starting dimensions were 14.2 x 1.6 cm ( 5 5/8 x 5/8 ″ ) .
B : Attempt to Calculate Size :
If you know your ring size , you could calculate the desired circumference of your ring with a ring size converter .
( The circumference would be equal to the length of your strip of plastic after shrinking . )
However , I found that , although Shrinkydinks is supposed to shrink by ~3 times , my strips needed to be ~ 10 % longer than the length I calculated in this way .
This is n’t an exact science .
I recommend you just use your best guess to make a test ring ; you ’ll soon find out if your strip should have been longer or shorter !
Cut to Size :
To cut the plastic , I like to use a guillotine ( paper cutter ) to get straight lines , but it ’s probably not good for the cutter blade ( I use an old cutter blade ) .
You could also use an xacto knife and metal ruler , or just cut the plastic with scissors .
The corners can be very sharp , so I like to round them off slightly with scissors before baking ( do n’t worry if you forget this step ; you can file or sand them down after baking ) .
3. Decorate shrink plastic
Follow the decorating instructions that come with your shrink plastic .
Here are some ideas :
Rubber stamps + alcohol - based permanent inks ( be warned : other types of stamp ink will smudge )
Fine - point permanent marker ( e.g. Sharpie ) to draw or trace your designs
Coloured pencils ( use in combination with the above to add colour )
Print designs directly onto your plastic ( inkjet shrink plastic ONLY )
If you ’re using the frosted type , remember to decorate the rough ( frosted ) side .
For other types , consult your instructions .
I used peg stamps to decorate my first rings .
The designs are only 1 cm tall so fit my rings perfectly .
Below I have also tried some other rubber stamps :
Do n’t forget to let your ink dry before adding any coloured pencil embellishments , and remember that colours will become more saturated and vibrant after baking , so less is more in this case .
4 . Find a suitable form to bend plastic around
Here ’s a useful tip to find an object of the right size to create your ring : take an existing ring , and try to slip it over various thin cylindrical household objects , e.g. marker pen barrel , wooden spoon handle , lip balm tube .
You are looking for an object that is a tight fit inside your ring .
If you do n’t have anything suitable , you could buy a short length of wooden dowel of the right diameter .
Your object will come into contact with hot plastic , so do n’t use any treasured possessions for this step .
5 . Shrink your plastic
This is the fun part !
Preheat a toaster oven or conventional oven to the temperature specified on your packaging .
Make sure you are in a well - ventilated area so any fumes do n’t build up .
Note : Please read the instructions below all the way to the end before baking your ring – the shaping happens very quickly after baking so you need to be ready …
Place your strip ( decorated side up ) on a piece of brown paper on an oven tray , and put it in the oven .
Keep watching … this is where the magic happens .
Your strip will begin to curl up and wiggle about as some parts heat more quickly than others and so begin to shrink more quickly .
Do n’t worry if it looks like it ’s stuck together – in my experience it always flattens out as it continues to shrink .
When it has finished shrinking , leave it in the oven for another 30 seconds to heat through evenly .
Here ’s an animation of the shrinking process :
6 . Shape your ring
When your strip comes out of the oven , you ’ll have to work quickly – you only have about 10 seconds before it has cooled and becomes rigid .
Disclaimer : to protect your hands from the hot plastic , you should probably wear a thin glove ( for more control ) or an oven mitt ( for better protection against the heat ) but I do n’t bother – it is very hot , but the plastic does n’t stay hot for long enough to burn my skin .
Remove the brown paper from the oven .
Wait for about 2 seconds ( so it ’s not too hot to touch ) , then carefully wrap the strip around your forming tool , with your decorated side facing in towards the tool .
Hold it in place for a few seconds until it becomes cool and rigid .
I ’m not going to lie , this step is tricky .
You really do have to work quickly , and not make any mistakes , otherwise you wo n’t have time to wrap the entire strip around your object before it cools .
But do n’t lose hope !
There is a magic fix for a badly - formed ring like the one below …
Pop your misshapen ring back into the oven on the brown paper , balancing it upright on its curved surface so the join is at the top ( as in the picture above ) .
After a minute or so , the plastic will relax back out of its shape , and revert back into a flat strip …
I told you this stuff was magic !
Let it heat through for about 20 - 30 seconds , then try to form the ring around your tool again .
Left : unsanded edges ; Right : sanded edges
That ’s it !
You can sand down the edges to give a smoother finish , but this may partially obscure your design .
You could also paint the edges after forming for a different effect .
For more durability of your design , use a clear coat to carefully varnish the inside of the ring ( one coat should be enough ) .
You can make matching earrings , charm bracelets or necklace pendants – just punch holes for the jewellery findings before shrinking the plastic , and remember that the holes will also shrink , so do n’t worry that they ’ll be too large .
Enjoy your new jewellery !

Greg Mankiw reports
about how a group of UC Davis women faculty circulated a petition and pressured UC regents into rescinding an invitation to Larry Summers , the controversial former president of Harvard University , to speak at a recent board dinner in Sacramento .
Mankiw links
to this article
, which unfortunately grossly misquotes what Summers actually said .
Here is what appears in the newspaper article :
In January 2005 , Summers made controversial comments at the National Bureau of Economics Research Conference on Diversifying the Science and Engineering Workforce .
There , he attributed the under - representation of women in science , math and engineering to , among other things , the “ relatively clear evidence ” that men and women differ in “ overall IQ , mathematical ability ( and ) scientific ability . ”
Here is a link to the transcript of what
Summers actually said
:
It does appear that on many , many different human attributes - height , weight , propensity for criminality , overall IQ , mathematical ability , scientific ability - there is relatively clear evidence that whatever the difference in means - which can be debated - there is a difference in the standard deviation , and variability of a male and a female population .
As the graph above illustrates , the average ( mean ) intelligence of males and females could be exactly equal , but the variability ( standard deviation or variance ) of male intelligence could be greater than the variability of female intelligence .
Result :
There are more males 3 - 4 standard deviations above the mean , and more males 3 - 4 standard deviations below the mean , which would mean that there are more male super - geniuses than females , and more male super - idiots than females .
MIT math and science professors are typically 3 - 4 standard deviations above the mean , and males could be overrepresented in those groups because they are overrepresented in the top tail of the intelligence distribution ( and the bottom tail ) .
The Navy defense lawyer for a Canadian prisoner accused of killing a U.S. soldier in Afghanistan six years ago accused the Pentagon on Thursday of doctoring evidence to make his client appear guilty .
In pretrial motions in the case of Omar Khadr , who was 15 when he was wounded and arrested by U.S. forces , Lt. Cmdr. William C. Kuebler said the Army commander for the Khost region of eastern Afghanistan reported on July 28 , 2002 , that the person who threw a grenade that killed Sgt. 1st Class Christopher J. Speer also died in the firefight .
Two months after that report , the commander altered his account to say Speer ’s attacker was “ engaged ” by U.S. forces , Kuebler said .
The officer was identified only as Lt. Col .
W .
The government has listed the commander as a potential prosecution witness in Khadr ’s trial .
Kuebler had sought to interview the lieutenant colonel but was denied access by the prosecution .
At Thursday ’s hearing , he appealed to the Army judge handling Khadr ’s case , Col. Peter Brownback III , to make Lt. Col .
W available to explain the change .

Kuebler also sought access to Khadr ’s medical and interrogation records from the weeks he spent in U.S. military custody at Bagram Air Base north of Kabul before his transfer here .
He asked for videotapes of Khadr at Bagram undergoing “ enhanced interrogation ” while recovering from two gunshot wounds to the back .
Brownback promised to rule before departing Guantanamo today , but his decisions on motions argued here this week are unlikely to be made public immediately as censors in Washington vet them first for classified information .
Kuebler told journalists that the altered firefight report was “ consistent with the proposition that the government manufactured evidence that made Omar look guilty . ”
He also said Khadr had been mistreated by a U.S. military interrogator at Bagram , a soldier identified as Sgt.
C who was court - martialed and disciplined after the death of another prisoner there .
Advertisement
Asked if the government had revised documents to back the accusations against Khadr , the tribunal ’s deputy chief prosecutor , Army Col .
Bruce Pagel , replied : “ No . ” He declined to respond further .
Government reports have contended that Khadr was the only enemy combatant to survive the July 27 , 2002 , clash in which Speer was wounded .
Speer died eight days later .
Revising the combat report supports “ the myth that has grown up around this case that Omar was the only person alive at the compound ” when the Special Forces unit entered after a massive bombardment , Kuebler said .
Brig .
Gen . Thomas Hartmann , legal advisor to the convening authority who serves an attorney general - like role for the war - crimes tribunal , confirmed Thursday that the Pentagon was “ increasing the progression of cases ” and would continue to accelerate the process in coming months .

He disputed contentions by the chief defense counsel , Army Col .
Steve David , that only nine military lawyers are available to defend 14 charged suspects , versus 31 attorneys for the prosecution .
The defense has 10 uniformed lawyers now , four civilians who can act as co-counsel and eight more on the way , Hartmann said .
The prosecution has more staff , the general said , because its burden is greater than that of the defense in having to prove the guilt of each accused beyond a reasonable doubt .
The administration ’s hopes of speeding up the trials were probably dashed by the sessions this week , which raised more legal questions and issues .
A 33 - year - old Saudi , Ahmed Mohammed Ahmed Haza Al - Darbi , was arraigned after Khadr ’s hearing but declined to enter a plea or decide whether to accept his military defense lawyer .
He is charged with aiding Al Qaeda and plotting to attack ships in the Strait of Hormuz .

Al - Darbi , a brother - in - law to one of the alleged Sept. 11 hijackers , was arrested in Azerbaijan , sent to a third country for brutal interrogation and subjected to abuse by U.S. soldiers once transferred to Bagram months later , his attorney said .
While Al - Darbi was polite and responsive , by putting off his plea he remains at the same impasse as all four defendants who have been brought before the commission so far for arraignment .
It has been more than six years since the first of nearly 800 terrorism suspects arrived at Guantanamo .
All but 275 have been released or repatriated , and of those , 14 have been charged with war crimes .
Also Thursday , the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against the U.S. government demanding disclosure of Guantanamo prisoners ’ descriptions of waterboarding and other coercion at the hands of CIA interrogators .
Advertisement
Detailed accounts of alleged mistreatment of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and 13 other “ high - value ” prisoners now being held here were deleted from transcripts made public after each suspect was questioned during a Combatant Status Review Tribunal last year .
“ As the Guantanamo era enters its seventh shameful year , the government still refuses to level with the American people .
Its stonewalling is illegal and obstructs the public ’s right to know the truth about torture and abuse conducted in our name , ” said Ben Wizner , an ACLU staff attorney monitoring the proceedings .

NOW THAT most people agree the US is experiencing a recession ( or at the very least a slow down ) the following questions remain : how bad will it be and how long will it last ?
Ben Bernanke and many on the Street predict short and shallow .
Popular media and other economists , such as
Nouriel Roubini
, believe we teeter on the brink on the next great depression .
The data seems to lean to the Bernanke camp , but at this stage it ’s impossible to know .
Economists are trained to be Monday Morning Quarterbacks , not fortune tellers .
Talk to me several years into and I will be full of insights about the implications of the “ sub - prime crisis ” and the “ credit crunch ” that followed it .
Our fate will be determined by many unpredictable factors , primarily expectations .
The expectations of consumers deciding how much to spend and those of investors deciding how much to lend will be a crucial .
The more uncertainty that persists in the market , the more cautious people will be .
It seems we have an incentive to declare this recession short and shallow and get to spending and lending .
Perhaps , though I wonder if this strategy is feasible in the long run .
The US can not go on forever with a negative saving rate .
If its debt becomes too large eventually foreigners will become skittish about investing here .
They will have unfavourable expectations .
Calling this recession short and sweet could make sense for today ’s policy makers , but may not be a dynamically consistent strategy .
But saying we are on the verge of the next great depression seems to do more harm .
Why would so many smart people put their reputations on the line and potentially drag out a recession longer than it needs be ?
The current climate has many troubling aspects .
Policy makers and investors need to cognizant of what brought us here if we want to avoid past mistakes .
Not learning the lessons from the current , or any , recession does everyone a disservice and could lead to a serious contraction .
Also , I wonder if you are more accountable for your view when you predict good times rather than bad .
If you predict gloom and doom for the next ten years , but good times follow , people will be pleasantly surprised .
In business you often want to set expectations low and then deliver .
Paul Krugman has been predicting a recession for years ; he was bound to be right eventually .
Predicting a wealth boom that never happens , or occurs later than expected , will lead to disappointment .
As I mentioned earlier , I can not predict the future , but I am going to be bold and put my name ( or would if it were not for
the Economist
anonymity ) on a prediction : in the future we will see positive and vigorous economic growth .
Then , further into the future , the US will experience another recession .
I can not say when , how long , or predict the magnitude of either of these events , but they will happen .
A new record for Mitt backing away from something he said .
Seconds .
Just a couple seconds .
He said McCain was lying , which McCain was , then backed off .
Took Mitt a little longer to change positions on every other issue .
Huffington
Post has the video , too :
Appearing on the campaign trail in Florida , Romney was asked about the criticism , launched by McCain , that he has a timeline for withdrawing troops from Iraq .
“ I do n’t have one , never had , ” Romney said .
“ He says you do , ” chimed a reporter .
“ Well , he ’s lying , ” replied the former governor , with a slight laugh .
Within a second his tune changed .
“ He ’s dishonest [ inaudible ] .
He ’s being dishonest about that .
That ’s not accurate . ”
“ Are you calling him a liar ? ” the reporter asked .
“ No I ’m not .
I ’m saying he made a dishonest comment .
I misspoke . ”

Rand Abdel - Qader , 17 , was killed by her father after falling in love with a British soldier
An Iraqi teenage girl was brutally murdered by her father in an " honour killing " after she fell in love with a British soldier in Basra .
Seventeen - year - old Rand Abdel - Qader told her best friend how she had fallen for Paul , a 22 - year - old she met at a charity where she worked as a volunteer .
When her father learned she had been seen speaking to a foreigner he rushed home and butchered her , strangling and stabbing her while screaming that he was " cleansing his honour " .
He was arrested , but Iraqi police took no action .
His wife has since left him and is in hiding .
The Ministry of Defence was last night trying to trace the soldier .
Officials stressed he appeared to have done nothing wrong by befriending the girl .
While there is no suggestion the two had any physical relationship , the case raises questions about the training given to British forces in understanding cultural values in a city where 47 women died in " honour killings " last year .
According to reports from Basra , the soldier was an infantryman with blond hair who last saw Rand in January , a few weeks before her murder .
MoD officials said thousands of troops were in the city at the time .
Infantry units included the Irish Guards , the Royal Welsh and The Rifles , but Paul could have been from dozens of other units including engineers , logistics , medical specialists or the TA .

Her funeral was done without any of the traditional mourning because she was deemed ' impure ' .
Her uncles were said to have spat on her body
Army insiders said they needed to establish the full facts to help prevent such a tragedy happening again .
An MoD spokesman said troops received " cultural awareness training " , including the sensitivities of talking to Muslim women , but this focused on issues such as body searches rather than the potential dangers of striking up friendships .
He added : " They are not told , ' Do n't go and fall in love ' . "
Rand Abdel - Qader confided to her closest friend Zeinab that she fell in love the moment she saw the young soldier at the charity for displaced families , and she dreamed of a future with him .
Rand was studying English at Basra University and was able to chat to him without others knowing what they were saying .
Zeinab , 19 , said :
" She loved to speak about his blond hair , his honey eyes , his white skin and the sweet way he had of speaking .
He was very different from the local men who usually are tough and illiterate .

The teenager 's best friend had tried to hide the presents she was given by the soldier but a friend told her father after he saw the pair together
" I was in heaven when she was speaking about him .
Everything looked so beautiful .
" With just a simple , caring smile , he was able to give her the sense of love , making her forget all life in Iraq .
But , I always had to remind Rand that she was a Muslim and her family was never going to accept her marrying a Christian , British soldier .

A gift of love :
The cuddly toy
" Unfortunately she never wanted to hear me .
Her mind was very far from reality , closer to an impossible dream . "
Zeinab claimed the soldier gave Rand small gifts , including a cuddly toy .
Rand said she met Paul only four times , always in public .
According to Zeinab , Paul used to tell Rand about England and promised to show her the sights of London one day .
" But the thing she used to like talking about best was how he praised her beauty and her intelligence .
She told me he called her ' princess ' . "
Despite her feelings , there was no physical relationship .
" She never did anything more than talk to him , " said Zeinab .
" She was proud to be a virgin and had a dream to give herself to the man she loved only after her marriage . "
On March 16 - two months after Rand last saw Paul - her father Abdel - Qader Ali heard from a friend that his daughter had been seen speaking to the soldier at the charity project .
Recalling Rand 's murder , her weeping mother Leila Hussein said : " I screamed and called out for her two brothers so they could get their father away .
But when he told them the reason , instead of saving her they helped him end her life . "
Abdel - Qader
Ali stood on the girl 's throat until she suffocated and then stabbed her , all the time shouting that his honour was being cleansed .
He was arrested and released within two hours .
Sergeant Ali Jabbar of Basra police said : " The father has very good contacts in the Basra government . "
Because her family considered her impure , Rand was given only a simple burial .
Her uncles spat in her grave to show their disgust .
Two weeks later her mother demanded a divorce from Ali , and she now campaigns against honour killings .
She lives in fear of reprisals .
" I was beaten and had my arm broken by him , " she said .
" No man can accept being left by a woman in Iraq . "
Rand 's friend Zeinab said : " Rand was just a young girl with romantic dreams .
She always kept her religion close to her heart .
She would never even hurt a petal on a rose . "

At 8 or 9 years old , the typical American schoolgirl is perfecting her cursive handwriting style .
She ’s picking out nouns , verbs , adjectives and adverbs in sentences , memorizing multiplication tables and learning to read a thermometer .
She ’s a little girl with a lot to learn .
And yet , in increasing numbers , when girls this age run across the playground in T - shirts , there is undeniable evidence that their bodies are blossoming .
The first visible sign of puberty , breast budding , is arriving ever earlier in American girls .
Some parents and activists suspect environmental chemicals .
Most pediatricians and endocrinologists say that , though they have suspicions about the environment , the only scientific evidence points to the obesity epidemic .
What ’s clear , however , is that the elements of female maturity increasingly are spacing themselves out over months , even years -- and no one quite knows why .

“ We ’re not backing up all events in puberty , ” says Sandra Streingraber , biologist and visiting scholar at Ithaca College .
“ We ’re backing up the starting point . ”
She has examined the research on female puberty and compiled a summary in an August 2007 report called “ The Falling Age of Puberty in U.S. Girls . ”
The report was financed by the Breast Cancer Fund , an advocacy group interested in exploring environmental causes of that disease .
Earlier breast development is now so typical that the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society urged changing the definition of “ normal ” development .
Until 10 years ago , breast development at age 8 was considered an abnormal event that should be investigated by an endocrinologist .
Then a landmark study in the April 1997 journal Pediatrics written by Marcia Herman - Giddens , adjunct professor at the School of Public Health at the University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , found that among 17,000 girls in North Carolina , almost half of African Americans and 15 % of whites had begun breast development by age 8 .
Two years later , the society suggested changing what it considered medically normal .
The new “ 8 " -- the medically suggested definition for abnormally early breast development -- is , the society says , 7 for white girls and 6 for African American girls .

Through the ages
Puberty involves three stages : breast development , pubic hair growth and , finally , menstruation .
Because the final event is typically the most memorable for women , it has been the one most scientifically documented in studies based on self - reported memories .
The first 100 years that medical records were kept on the age of onset of menstruation saw continuous drops .
Between about 1850 and 1950 in Europe , the average age of a girl ’s first period dropped from about 17 to about 13 .
( The U.S. does n’t have good data earlier than the 20th century , though trends were probably similar , says Steingraber , who prepared the August 2007 report after examining hundreds of studies on potential dietary , lifestyle and environmental causes of early puberty . )
Much of that decline probably has to do with better nutrition and public health improvements that reduced the spread of infectious diseases .
“ Better diet , closed sewer systems , deep burial of the dead , ” Steingraber says .
“ By the beginning of the 20th century , those things were in place . ”
Adequate food and good health signal the brain that it ’s safe to reproduce , according to theories of evolutionary biology .
“ We ’re healthier and we weigh more , ” says Dr. Francine Kaufman , head of the center for diabetes and endocrinology at Childrens Hospital .
“ In some ways , puberty is a luxury . ”

With the brain picking up these signals , the hormonal parade can begin , first with the release from the hypothalamus of gonadotropin - releasing hormone , which sends other hormones from the pituitary gland through the bloodstream to the ovaries .
The ovaries gear up production of a form of estrogen called estradiol , which initiates breast development -- the first step in puberty .
A second signaling pathway stimulates the adrenal gland to begin androgen production , which results in pubic hair .
The final stage of puberty is the beginning of monthly periods .
But the first two events are happening significantly earlier in the lives of today ’s girls than they did in the lives of their mothers and grandmothers .
The age of first menstruation has dropped too , at a rate of about one month per decade for the last 30 years , according to a January 2003 study in Pediatrics .
Today , the U.S. average for first period is 12.5 for white girls , 12.06 for black girls and 12.09 for Latinas .
The gap between the first appearance of breast buds and menstruation grew wider by as much as a year and a half between the 1960s and the 1990s , according to research published in the October 2006 journal Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology .
The time from breast buds to bleeding , according to Herman - Giddens , is now close to three years .

In short , that finely tuned biological process may have reached a tipping point .
Since the 1960s , Herman - Giddens says , the decline in the age of maturity has crossed the line from positive reasons , such as better diet , to negative ones , such as eating too much , exercising too little and the vast unknowns of chemical pollution .
The lack of adequate explanation has some experts worried .
“ Over the course of a few decades , the childhoods of U.S. girls have been significantly shortened , ” Steingraber says .

Redefining ‘ average ’

The new average age of puberty , some fear , may be like the new average weight -- typical , but terrible .
“ My fear , ” Herman - Giddens says , “ is that medical groups could take the data and say ‘ This is normal .
We do n’t have to worry about it . ’
My feeling is that it is not normal .
It ’s a response to an abnormal environment . ”
Dr. Paul Kaplowitz , chief of endocrinology at Children ’s National Medical Center in Washington , D.C. , and lead author of a special article Oct. 4 , 1999 , in the journal Pediatrics suggesting a redefinition of early puberty , is n’t so sure .
Too many girls are being labeled abnormal , he contends .
“ Maybe we should n’t be worrying so much about those girls , ” he says .
“ The chance of finding a serious condition in a 7 - year - old with pubic hair is very , very small . ”

There have always been rare cases of extremely early puberty , called precocious puberty .
One report , going back to 1834 in Butler County , Ky. , was of a baby girl whose hips and breasts began to grow soon after she was born .
By the age of 1 , she was menstruating and at age 10 , she gave birth to a 7 - pound baby .
Such extreme cases today would be examined and treated .
But the beginnings of breasts , and the first pubic hair , at ages 8 , 7 or even 6 for African Americans falls at the low end of today ’s new normal range .
With statisticians proving that “ average ” is younger than recently thought , environmental activists are asking whether hormones in food , pesticides in produce or phthalates in plastics and cosmetics could be contributing to breast buds in third - graders .
Social scientists have lifestyle suspicions .
Does the stress of fatherless households , or the stimulating effects of sexually suggestive television shows , have anything to do with earlier signs of puberty ?
The suspicions remain difficult to prove .
Despite the reassurance of pediatric endocrinologists that younger development is normal , a lot of parents are still nervous , Kaplowitz says .

“ If somebody calls in and says , ‘ I ’ve got an 8 - year - old with breast buds , ’ there ’s nothing I need to do , ” he says .
“ I discourage referrals .
But they show up anyway . ”
Kaplowitz examined evidence for all suspected environmental and lifestyle factors in his book , “ Early Puberty in Girls : The Essential Guide to Coping With This Common Problem . ”
“ The explanation for which there ’s the most evidence is that it ’s related to the trend in increasing obesity , ” he says .
“ There are other factors , such as if your mother matured early .
Sometimes we simply do n’t know .
But overall , the biggest single factor is the trend toward obesity . ”
Fatty tissue is a source of estrogen , so chubbier girls are exposed to more estrogen .
“ With environmental influences , there has been a lot of speculation , but little hard data .
I ’m not suggesting there ’s no connection , but it ’s very hard to say there ’s a proven connection .
I think it ’s environmental mainly in the sense that overeating and lack of exercise is environmental , ” Kaplowitz says .
“ I ’ve tried to take the view that we should n’t be alarmed about this . ”

Herman - Giddens is not so convinced , but concedes that evidence for environmental causes is close to impossible to obtain .
“ I myself am shocked sometimes to see very thin girls , 8 and 9 years old , with breast development , ” she says .
“ But with all the estrogen - like elements in the environment , it ’s virtually impossible to study .
There ’s no place to find an unexposed population . ”
The biggest concern , she says , is that earlier puberty means longer lifetime exposure to estrogen , and early puberty , along with late menopause , is known to increase the risk of breast cancer .
But to design a study in which some girls are deliberately exposed to higher doses of such chemicals would be unethical , she says .
Some animal studies provide cause for concern about endocrine - disrupting chemicals , but little hard evidence for humans .
And a handful of industrial accidents have provided some data .
In 1973 , for example , estrogenic chemicals were inadvertently mixed in cattle feed in a Michigan community .
The daughters of pregnant and nursing women who ate meat and dairy products from the cows were studied and were found to have begun their periods up to a year earlier than girls not exposed to the chemical , according to a 2000 study in the journal Epidemiology .

Time for a talk
What ’s clear is that physical appearance is getting ahead of other aspects of girls ’ maturity .
They might be perceived as far older than they are , even when they ’re still rummaging through their mothers ’ closets to clomp around in oversized high heels .
“ My daughter started developing breasts maybe around age 8 , ” says Rhonda Sykes of Inglewood .
“ She was still into her doll phase and dressing up to play . ”
So Sykes began having frank mother - daughter conversations about curves and changing bodies a bit earlier than she expected .
“ Whatever they look like , they know nothing , ” says Diana Zuckerman , president of the National Research Center for Women and Families .
“ Eight - and 9 - year olds are learning to make change for a dollar .
These are children who are learning the most fundamental facts in school .
Imagine trying to teach that child the fundamentals of sex .
They ’re not even playing Monopoly yet .
They ’re still playing Candyland . ”

The medical community calls earlier puberty normal , the trend goes hand in hand with the obesity epidemic , and science has not yet pinpointed the reasons .
And yet , when girls who are still children in the minds of their parents start developing breasts , many of their mothers remember that it happened later in their own lives -- and wonder why .
Theorists and advocates continue to search for definitive evidence , and little girls continue to look like young women at earlier ages .
“ My biologist brain says , ‘ There ’s not a lot you can conclude from the [ environmental ] evidence , ’ ” Steingraber says .
“ But I ’ve got a 9 - year - old girl .
And as a mother , I say , ‘ They ’ve introduced all these chemicals into the environment , and they have no idea what it ’s doing .
What are they , nuts ? ’
I want data demonstrating safety , not data demonstrating ignorance . ”

Secretary Rice could lift the lid on the inner workings of the US government
The lobbyists are accused of passing classified information to government officials and journalists in Israel .
They say they were regularly asked by the US government to give information to the Israelis .
Ms Rice 's court appearance could shed light on American policy - making in the Middle East .
The two defendants in the case are former lobbyists for the influential American - Israel Public Affairs Committee , or Aipac .
They are accused of passing secrets obtained from a since - convicted Pentagon official to government officials and media outlets in Israel .
Go-betweens
The information they are alleged to have leaked included details of American policy in Iran and intelligence about the al - Qaeda network .
Their lawyers argue that they were regularly used as go - betweens by the American government and , as such , had an unofficial but approved role in the shaping of Middle East policy .
The lobbyists were therefore unaware , according to the lawyers , that their behaviour in this case was criminal .
Now , in a potentially embarrassing ruling for the Bush administration , a federal judge has issued subpoenas for top current and former government officials , including Ms Rice and National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley , ordering them to testify at next year 's trial .
District Judge T S Ellis III said the lobbyists had a right to argue that , as far as they were concerned , their meetings with the now - convicted Pentagon analyst were simply examples of the US government 's use of Aipac as a diplomatic back channel .
The administration will now be wondering whether to pursue this espionage case and risk the public exposure of certain sensitive aspects of its foreign policy - making process .
Each year , the Computing Research Association does an enrollment survey of US - based , PhD - granting academic computer science programs .
For the last five years , the number of undergraduate students involved in these programs has been plunging .
Fans of CS should take heart , however — the latest survey shows that the declining numbers may have finally leveled off .
Those figures were extracted from a survey performed by the Higher Education Research Institute .
The CRA 's take on the numbers is pessimistic , noting that the hangover from the recent lack of interest in CS has caused a continued drop in the total number of people that have chosen it as their major .
But that drop hides a difference in the 2007 data : for the first time since the dot - com bubble burst , more students chose computer science as their major than in the previous year ( although the increase is less than a percent ) .
New enrollments of CS majors had peaked in 2000 , with 16,000 freshmen nationwide picking a major that , at the time , seemed to promise challenges , excitement , and the possibility of retiring young .
As the bubble burst , that number dropped slowly for a couple of years , then dropped quite a bit faster as the decade wore on .
By 2005 , less than 8,000 new students were opting for CS degrees ; due to the lag between declaring a major and graduating , the total number of degrees granted peaked in 2004 , but dropped by over 40 percent in the past three years .
Since 2005 , however , the number of new students entering CS programs has been remarkably stable at around 8,000 per year , so total students and degrees granted should also stabilize over the next few years .
It 's possible that the field has been narrowed down to those that are actually interested in it as an intellectual pursuit .
Whether this represents a true turnaround , or just a temporary reprieve will take a few years to sort out .
Still , there is good reason to expect that any stability in the population of CS majors is temporary .
A separate bulletin from the CRA reveals that the field has seen two boom / bust cycles since the 1980s .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson both acknowledged problems in the U.S. economy Thursday , but both said they believe the nation will avoid falling into recession .
The two made their comments at a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee about the economy .
Their testimony comes in the wake of troubling economic readings that have raised recession fears on Wall Street .
But while Paulson and Bernanke repeatedly insisted they expect the economy to avoid shifting into reverse - thanks in part to a series of interest rate cuts by the Fed and a $ 170 billion economic stimulus package signed by President Bush Wednesday - they conceded the economy faces additional headwinds .
Bernanke and Paulson both said the outlook for the economy is noticeably worse than it was as recently as a few months ago , and both expect cuts in official growth forecasts from the administration and the Fed in upcoming months .
The Fed is currently predicting 1.8 % growth for this year , but Bernanke said a new forecast would be finalized next week .
The Council of Economic Advisors ' most recent estimate was for the economy to grow by 2.7 % in 2008 .
More losses , tight credit ahead
Bernanke said he believes major banks and Wall Street firms are likely to take additional earnings hits tied to bad investments in subprime mortgages .
That could lead to tighter lending standards and contribute to an overall slowdown .
" More expensive and less available credit seems likely to continue to be a source of restraint on economic growth , " Bernanke said .
But he added he's not worried about bank failures because he thinks banks entered the current downturn with sufficient capital and have been able to raise additional funds .
Some of the panel members praised the two for the steps taken so far to spur the economy .
The Fed last month made two significant interest rate cuts : three - quarters of a percentage point at an emergency meeting , followed by half a point eight days later .
Bernanke said Thursday that the Federal Open Market Committee , its rate - setting body , was ready to act again if further economic readings justify it .
But some senators criticized the pair , suggesting the administration and the central bank are at least partly to blame for the current economic problems , due to lax oversight and lack of early response to the downturn in housing .
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , suggested the problems in credit and financial markets pose a greater threat to the economy than a slowdown in consumer spending .
" Are n't you underestimating , not giving enough attention to , the severity of the problem in the credit markets ? " asked Schumer .
He said Wall Street executives he 's talked to " seem much more worried " about credit woes than Paulson and Bernanke .
Paulson , a former CEO of Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) , responded that he also spoke regularly with top Wall Street executives , adding " some are more worried than others . "
Paulson on defensive
Sen. Robert Menendez , D - N.J. , pointed out that Goldman Sachs is one of the growing number of investment banks forecasting a recession this year and suggested that Paulson and Bernanke " hit the snooze button " when alarm bells about the economy first went off last year .
Menendez said he was n't trying to talk down the economy , but that he was looking for " honest assessments " from Paulson .
Paulson bristled at the comments , telling Menendez , " If you 're trying to talk the economy up , I 'd hate to see you talk it down . "
Menendez shot back , " I 'm just trying not to hide my head in the sand . "
" I'm not either , " responded the Treasury Secretary .
The two also were asked to explain why investments in many major banks and Wall Street firms by sovereign wealth funds should not be a concern .
Sovereign wealth funds - large pools of money controlled by foreign countries - have taken stakes in recent months in Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) .
Paulson said these investments are an important endorsement of the U.S. financial system and that they do not pose a risk of foreign governments having undue influence on major banks here .
" I think we need to be vigilant .
I do n't think we need to be fearful , " said Paulson .
Paulson says economy ' fundamentally strong '
Throughout the hearing , Paulson and Bernanke repeated that they expect slower growth and not a recession .
Paulson said the economy " is fundamentally strong , diverse and resilient " and that the main problem is that it is " undergoing a significant and necessary housing correction . "
But Senate Banking Chairman Christopher Dodd , D - Conn. , said the slowdown is due to a crisis of confidence among both consumers and investors .
Dodd was critical of some of the Bush administration 's housing efforts , including the freeze on foreclosures announced this week by Paulson and some of the country 's leading mortgage lenders .
" It is a lifeline more to lenders than to borrowers in my view , " said Dodd .
Sen . Richard Shelby of Alabama , the ranking Republican on the committee , said he 's concerned that the mortgage meltdown is spreading to the rest of the economy .
" One thing that is now clear to all of us is the subprime mortgage problems are not contained , " said Shelby .
He added that he doubts whether the stimulus package would prove to be effective .
" Even if every consumer spends their $ 600 tax rebate , I 've equated it to pouring a glass of water in the ocean and expecting it to make a difference , " Shelby said .
" I hope I 'm wrong . "
Some prominent Democrats are converging on the prospect of mail - in elections to resolve a dispute over the fate of delegates from Florida and Michigan , who were disqualified by the party last year .
Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean , speaking on Sunday talk shows , called mail - in voting -- in which every registered Democrat , including those overseas , receives a ballot by mail -- " a very good process . "
But Mr. Dean said it is up to the states '
Democrats to formulate a plan that both campaigns would support .

SLAUGHTER BEACH , Del .  Sixteen nautical miles from the Indian River Inlet and about 80 feet underwater , a building boom is under way at the Red Bird Reef .
One by one , a machine operator has been shoving hundreds of retired New York City subway cars off a barge , continuing the transformation of a barren stretch of ocean floor into a bountiful oasis , carpeted in sea grasses , walled thick with blue mussels and sponges , and teeming with black sea bass and tautog .
“ They ’re basically luxury condominiums for fish , ” Jeff Tinsman , artificial reef program manager for the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control , said as one of 48 of the 19 - ton retirees from New York City sank toward the 666 already on the ocean floor .
But now , Delaware is struggling with the misfortune of its own success .
Having planted a thriving community in what was once an underwater desert , state marine officials are faced with the sort of overcrowding , crime and traffic problems more common to terrestrial cities .

Yahoo has begun discussions with News Corporation to explore alternatives to Microsoft ’s buyout offer , people familiar with the talks said on Wednesday .
The preliminary discussions stem from an approach Yahoo ’s bankers made to News Corporation last week as part of Yahoo ’s effort to find a “ white knight ” and avoid a hostile takeover by Microsoft .
The talks , which were described by both sides as a “ long shot , ” center on merging Fox ’s interactive assets  led by the social networking site MySpace  with Yahoo .
News Corporation is participating in the talks , in part , because , as one participant said , “ there ’s nothing to lose . ”
Either News Corporation clinches a deal , or more likely , its interest pushes up the price of Yahoo for its competitor , Microsoft .
The Microsoft bid , a mix of cash and stock , is now worth $ 42.1 billion .
News Corporation had sought a similar merger with Yahoo last year , people involved in the talks said , but Yahoo rebuffed its overture before News Corporation ever made a formal bid .
At the time , News Corporation had teamed up with Providence Equity Partners , a private equity firm that focuses on media companies .
The latest round of discussions are unlikely to include Providence , these people said , though it remains possible .
The United States government does such a bad job of caring for wounded war veterans , advocates told a federal judge in San Francisco Monday , that 18 veterans commit suicide every week .
" The suicide problem is out of control , " said Gordon Erspamer , an attorney representing the groups Veterans for Common Sense and Veterans United for Truth in a class action lawsuit against the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) .
" Our veterans deserve better . "
Erspamer ’s comments came in opening arguments for what is expected to be a week - long trial , the first class action brought on behalf of 1.7 million Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans .
Early arguments were punctuated by allegations top government officials deliberately deceived the U.S. public about the number of veterans attempting suicide .
In one e-mail made public during the trial , the head of the VA ’s Mental Health division , Dr. Ira Katz , advised a media spokesperson not to tell reporters 1,000 veterans receiving care at the VA try to kill themselves every month .
" Shh ! " the e-mail begins .
" Our suicide prevention coordinators are identifying about 1,000 suicide attempts per month among the veterans we see in our medical facilities .
Is this something we should ( carefully ) address ourselves in some sort of release before someone stumbles on it ? " the e-mail concludes .
According to CBS News , Katz ’s e-mail was written shortly after the VA provided the network with data showing there were only 790 attempted suicides in all of 2007  a fraction of Katz ’s estimate .
Earlier this month , the city of Dallas , Texas , closed its psychiatric unit after the hospital experienced its fourth suicide of the year .
" On April 4 , a man fastened a bed sheet to the bottom corner of a door frame , draped a noose over the top , and hanged himself , " the Dallas Morning News reported last week .
" Before that , a veteran hanged himself on a frame attached to his wheelchair .
And in January , two men who met in the psychiatric ward committed suicide in Collin County days after being released . "
" The system is in crisis , and unfortunately the VA is in denial , " Erspamer told the court , urging U.S. District Court Judge Samuel Conti to appoint a special master to oversee the troubled agency .
The veterans ’ groups are also seeking a judge ’s order forbidding the VA from turning away any veteran who shows up at a facility seeking mental health care .
In a number of high - profile cases , Iraq war veterans have killed themselves after being turned away from the VA .
Lawyers for the government argued strongly against the veterans , countering the VA runs a " world - class health care system . "
Multiple times during his opening statement , Justice Department lawyer Richard Lepley portrayed the veterans ’ groups as " special interests " and argued the changes the groups seek in their lawsuit  better and faster mental health care , and more rights for veterans appealing denials of benefits  are beyond the judge ’s authority .
" You have no standards to judge , " Lepley told Conti .
" This court should n’t be trying to be a substitute for what the medical professionals at the VA decide . "
No veterans are set to testify at the trial , which focuses on the nature of the Byzantine bureaucratic system veterans must navigate to receive health care and disability benefits .
According the Department of Veterans Affairs , the average time a veteran must wait to learn if his or her disability claim has been approved is 185 days , or about six months .
Veterans ’ groups countered the real wait is much longer , noting that if a veteran appeals the disability ruling , the appeals process can drag on for years .
According to internal VA documents provided by the plaintiffs , 526 veterans have died this year while their disability claims were being reviewed .
None of this surprises Kelly Conklin of Chunchula , Alabama .
Her husband Manuel was reduced to a wheelchair after experiencing a negative reaction to an anthrax vaccine administered as he was preparing to deploy to Iraq with the U.S. Navy in 2003 .
Military doctors pumped him with steroids and other medicine in hopes he would recover , Conklin said , but in 2005 she came to realize that was unlikely and filed a claim with the VA for disability compensation .
After three years , the family is still waiting .
" It ’s an every day battle , " Kelly Conklin told IPS .
" We ’re having grits and eggs for supper tonight and a lot of nights .
Sometimes we do n’t eat anything but lima beans for supper  it depends on what we have . "
In the absence of a regular paycheck or a disability check , Conklin says her family of four is now living almost completely off charity , with much of the food they eat coming from the local food bank .
She said she used to be proud of her husband for his service in the Navy , but has now forbidden her youngest son from joining the Armed Forces .
" If it sounds like I ’m down , yes I am down , " she told IPS .
" If I sound like I ’m bitter , you got that right .
They ’ve taken everything away from me .
The only thing left for them to take from me is my birthday . "
" When we give them our spouses , we give them whole , " she said .
" And if you ca n’t make him whole [ again ] , then you make sure he ’s taken care of . "

For months now , I have had this recurring nightmare : the Bush / Cheney junta figures out how to stay in power .
I used to think they ’d come up with some version of an our - national - security - is - at - too - high - a - risk - to - permit - elections scenario and refuse to leave , just hanging on to the reins themselves , hunkering down against all critics .
That , however , was apparently too big a leap for even these most calloused of neo-Cons to attempt ( though I ’m not confident the American people could n’t have been cowed into doing without elections ) .
Now their strategy is apparently to do what a year ago seemed beyond belief : they ’ve actually found a candidate to run under their banner who promises to keep the Ship of State on the precise course they ’ve steered for the past eight years .
That was certainly a very tough search .
Even more incredibly , they managed to find someone to do so that seems capable of doing it with a straight face !
There is in my estimation no more straight - faced person in American politics today than John McCain . , and after hearing some of his recent public pronouncements , there may be no more boring politician on the American scene than John McCain .
The guy seems capable of making even Fred Thompson at his most somnambulant sound comparatively exciting .
However , we ’ve had yawn - inducing candidates many times before .
That is part of the price we pay for Democracy .
What is scary about McCain is not that he is capable of putting us to sleep but that he is hell - bent on replicating every blunder of Dubya ’s administration … and tacking on a few doozies of his own for good measure .
Concerned about the economy ?
John McCain is n’t .
He thinks more tax cuts may be needed but mostly all we have to do is tough it out .
Just like Dubya .
Of course the economy mostly bores old John , so he puts most of his concentrated thought onto foreign affairs … like Iraq .
His prescription ?
More war .
Up to fifty or even a hundred years of war if that ’s what it takes to secure “ victory ” in that abused locale .
Iran ?
His prescription ?
Start a war .
Famously , he quipped in faux Beachboy rhythm : “ Bomb , bomb , bomb ; bomb , bomb Iran … ”
And he was n’t joking .
This guy does n’t joke about bombing .
He means it .
That ’s what he did for a living in Vietnam .
He believes if we had just done a little more bombing there we could have secured “ victory ” … whatever that means .
The Palestinian dilemma ?
Nothing going on there that a few good Israeli bombing runs would n’t solve .
In fact , waging war is pretty much the John McCain prescription for anything that ails this troubled world .
It is the cowboy solution to every dilemma .
And it is the farthest thing imaginable from what we need today .
Throw in another quirk of the Arizona Senator , his volcanic temper , and you start to get the full potential for disaster that electing him would entail .
As New Mexico's U.S. Senator Pete Domenici is reported to have said some years ago ( though he is too loyal a partisan trooper to admit it today ) “ that ’s the last guy I ’d want to have with his finger on the trigger . ”
Yet the national press has a crush on McCain that is really hard to understand .
His relationship with the reporters , print and television , who traipse around the country relaying the stories of the campaign back to the rest of us , is universally positive .
He has charmed them , practically to a person .
Apparently he likes them , spends time with them , fosters their easy access to him …and it pays off : they like him and cover him favorably .
We like to believe that our system for selecting a President is the best one ever devised , the model against which other democracies can measure themselves .
However watching the torturous route that this campaign has traveled , the two solid years of debates , television appearances , fund - raisers , caucuses , primaries and examinations under the investigative magnifying glass that have gone on in order to winnow the crowd of wannabes down to the three finalists staggering toward the conventions this summer , I have my doubts .
I am especially dismayed that the President whose clumsy conduct of his office and whose unmitigated series of disastrous international initiatives has left us less secure than ever before in our history , this most unpopular of all Presidents since that measure began being recorded , George W. Bush , would now have in McCain a worthy successor who promises to push forward in exactly the same vein if we have a national brain lapse and elect him , something that is actually possible .
Someone who visits Iraq ( as the GOP candidate did a couple of weeks ago ) and comes back talking about “ victory ” being within our grasp needs to be medicated , not lionized .
Yet lionizing him for his “ confidence ” is what the pundits and reporters are rushing to do .
We need to all take a deep breath and count slowly to one hundred whenever anyone starts foaming on about “ victory ” in Iraq .
This military fiasco has already cost a trillion dollars and we ’ll be paying the bills for decades , even if we were to bring all our troops home tomorrow .
It is already the most costly mistake in human history , politically and financially .
It has the potential to wreck even the super - economy of the United States if it is not ended quickly .
But John McCain has no interest in ending it .
The slowing of American fatalities since September , when Bush finally dumped Rumsfeld and instead sent over the 40,000 additional troops the Pentagon had been requesting for two years , may be a welcome development , but in no way constitutes a validation for the occupation nor a signal that we are succeeding .

IT IS a sign of the times that a cut of three - quarters of a percentage point in interest rates may be considered modest .
On Tuesday March 18th the Federal Reserve slashed its headline interest rate to 2.25 % , down by two percentage points in some two months .
And it looked poised to keep on cutting .
Equities markets soared on the news .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rocketed by 3.5 % , or 420 points , its largest gain in more than five years .
But the cut was smaller than markets had expected , and the Fed said it would “ monitor inflation developments carefully ” , signalling that it has not given up concerns over price stability .
This caused the dollar to surge against the yen and the price of gold to waver after hitting a record high on Monday .
The drop in the Fed funds rate caps an exceptional period of central - bank activity as credit markets seized up .
Over the weekend the Fed unexpectedly cut the discount rate it charges to commercial banks , and it opened this “ discount window ” to investment firms for the first time since the 1930s .
After another cut , the discount rate sits at 2.5 % .
The Fed also brokered a rescue of Bear Stearns , an investment bank struggling from its exposure to mortgage - related securities .
The central bank assumed the risk for $ 30 billion in mortgage - related securities in order to entice JPMorgan Chase to buy Bear Stearns for a bargain $ 2 a share and assume its liabilities .
All of this is on top of promising up to $ 400 billion in expanded liquidity facilities in the past month to keep money flowing through the system .
The Fed made clear it is most worried about economic weakness .
But the statement accompanying its decision acknowledged “ uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased ” .
There are risks to this approach .
The Fed 's aggressive rate cutting might stimulate inflation , which was 4 % for the year to February .
Core consumer prices , which exclude food and fuel , were flat in February but 2.3 % higher than a year earlier .
More worryingly , the spread between inflation - linked Treasury securities and ordinary ones is increasing .
Inflation hawks on the open market committee dissented from the latest rate cut and may have succeeded in keeping it to three - quarters of a percentage point rather than the whole percentage point the markets expected .
But for all the Fed 's effort , and despite the rally in the markets , the crisis in American finance remains severe .
There is still vast uncertainty about how much toxic debt remains , and who owns it .
This has led banks to hoard money and call in loans .
The fear hitting American finance will not subside dramatically until the value of mortgage - related securities is clearer and the size of investment houses ' liabilities is known .
That in part depends on stabilisation of the housing market .
The newly announced , and unexpectedly modest , decline in housing starts last month should provide encouragement .
Previous housing start data was revised upward , too .
But much of the positive news was in the volatile multi-family housing market .
Single - family starts were down by 6.7 % in February and by 60 % from their cyclical high , a larger tumble than in the early 1990s .
Housing permits , which project future building , fell by 7.8 % , the largest drop this decade .
All the signs point to continuing drops in home prices .
The big question now is whether fiscal policymakers will step in , perhaps with a rescue for the mortgage industry that George Bush has thus far resisted .
Congress will be increasingly receptive to calls from the left to take the pressure off homeowners , particularly now that Americans have seen massive Fed action to shore up Wall Street .
Mr Bush also seems to be coming around .
He now says that the government might do more beyond the fiscal stimulus set to take full effect in May , should conditions warrant .
getBoundingClientRect is a method , first introduced by Internet Explorer 5 ( and now included in Firefox 3 ) , which provides the top , right , bottom , and left offset coordinates of an element .
After PPK mentioned this method in a recent post of his , poo-poo-ing its applicability , I thought I ’d take some time to show how useful it can be .
What makes this method so especially handy is that the alternative means of computing an element ’s offset position is so horribly slow and buggy that it borders on the comical .
The general purpose of this method , or of similar implementations , is to allow the user to get the visual top / left position of an element ( such that if they absolutely position an element from the document it would be on top of the desired element – making things like tooltips possible , to name a single application ) .
This means that you have to take into account a huge number of quirks .
In no particular order here are some choice bugs which make this very difficult :
Handling table border offsets .
Fixed positioned elements .
Scroll offsets within another element .
Borders of overflowed parent elements .
Miscalculation of absolutely positioned elements .
For example , looking at jQuery ’s implementation of .offset ( ) ( which provides the top / left offset of an element ) we can see a number of these quirks worked around .
A phenomenal amount of work has gone into the method , by the excellent Brandon Aaron , in order to “ get it right ” in a cross - browser manner .
Check out the extensive suite of tests that are backing it up , as well .
This is where getBoundingClientRect comes into play .
For a visual comparison look at the green boxes ( representing the getBoundClientRect - based implementation ) versus the red boxes ( representing the normal cross- browser implementation ) .
The reason why the getBoundingClientRect implementation is more than 1 line is due to two facts :
It does n’t include the document scroll offset ( which is a simple addition ) .
Internet Explorer ’s handling of < html / > element border widths is completely whack .
In comparison to the default technique , however , this is a veritable walk - in - the - park .
Now , not only , is this method simpler to use it ’s also insanely faster .
Stupifyingly so .
Considering that you no longer have to perform all sorts of hacks , or walk the tree to rectify miscalculations , the result is quite impressive .
View the following jQuery UI drag - and - drop sorting demo page in Firefox 2 ( drag the items in the grid , at the bottom ) and then view it in Firefox 3 , doing this same :
http://dev.jquery.com/view/trunk/ui/tests/sortable.html
Night and day .
I ’ve also uploaded a simple movie demonstrating the difference .
I absolutely encourage everyone to check this method out .
It can serve as a near - drop - in replacement for your offset needs – and will gracefully work in new browsers that support the method .
How To ... Fly Through Airport Security
You might as well check your dignity curbside .
Soon you 'll be shoeless and flustered , spilling comics across the floor as you dig your MacBook from the depths of your duffel .
But take a deep breath , frequent fliers :
It is possible to pass security with your ego intact .
Here 's how .
* — Mathew Honan *
1 ) Do recon online .
Security delays vary widely by concourse and terminal .
Go to tsa.gov to find average wait times .
If you 're not checking bags , print your boarding pass at home and head to the fastest line .
( Be sure your gate is accessible from that security checkpoint . )
2 ) Carry a messenger bag .
The topside flap gives easy access to your laptop and Ziploc of liquids and gels while the pockets provide plenty of storage for alarm - trippers .
As soon as you get in line , tuck your belt , wallet , keys , watch , and phone into the sack .
3 ) Wear laceless shoes .
And holeless socks .
Just think of all the foot fungi of travelers past .
Or do n't .
4 ) Go !
After you pass ID screening , make a beeline to the shortest x-ray queue .
Do n't wait to be directed , and do n't hesitate to bypass dawdlers .
Not only will you get there faster , you 'll keep the whole line moving .
5 ) Use only two bins .
Place shoes , coat , and toiletries in the first bin ; laptop in the second ; followed by the messenger bag .
Keep the roller on the floor , where it 's easy to manage , until the last minute .
6 ) Dress strategically .
Don your coat and shoes while waiting for your bags .
Put on your belt and watch at the gate .
... Survive an Avalanche
Your odds of outrunning the snow ?
Not so good .
An avalanche can accelerate to 80 mph in seconds .
But if you follow these tips , you might just walk away from it .
1 ) Grab a tree
The more snow that slides past you , the less likely you 'll be buried alive .
Hang on for dear life until the force knocks you off .
2 ) Paddle hard
You are three times denser than dry snow , so if you 're not swimming , you 'll sink .
3 ) Create space
Once the snow stops , it 'll set like concrete .
As it slows , inhale to reserve room for the expansion of your chest , and cup a hand around your mouth to leave an air pocket .
4 ) Raise a hand Before the flow ceases , get a limb to the surface to help rescuers find you .
Between 15 minutes and 45 minutes under the snow , your odds of survival fall from 90 percent to 30 .
5 ) Breathe slowly
To delay carbon dioxide poisoning , stay calm and do n't bother yelling until rescuers are on top of you .
Your fate is now in their hands .

... Break Up on Facebook
It 's not you , it 's Mark Zuckerberg .
Facebook 's confounding founder has made breaking up that much harder to do .
Every time you decouple , little press releases blast the gossip to all your friends ( and " friends " ) , prompting those pitiful " What happened ? " emails .
Next time you split , in the " News Feed and Mini - Feed " section of your privacy options deselect " Remove my Relationship Status " ; then , in your profile settings , change " In a Relationship " to the default " Select Status . "
But there 's a hitch : Your ex's Mini - Feed will display an update in their relationship status , tipping off the gossip hounds .
( You did n't think Zuckerberg would let you off that easy , did you ? )
You have no choice but to nicely ask your former boo to delete it , ASAP .

Early in the day on February 28 , 2008 , the Wilkins Ice Shelf remained intact .
By March 17 , 2008 , the ice shelf had retreated significantly from its original extent .
As the Antarctic summer drew to a close , sea ice began to freeze around the ice fragments .
( NASA images by Jesse Allen and Robert Simmon , based on MODIS data . )
In the March 17 image , amid the pieces of shattered shelf , large blocks of ice cluster along the northern and ( especially ) southern edges of the shelf .
Upstream from the broken shelf , crevasses appear on what remains of the shelf , suggesting that this portion of the shelf remains vulnerable to disintegration .
According to Scambos , however , the ice shelf will not likely undergo further breakup until the next Antarctic summer .
“ The ice has begun to re-freeze , and it ’s already been snowed on , ” he stated .
Terra acquired these images on February 28 ( top ) and March 17 ( bottom ) .
The top image , acquired just before the breakup , shows the intact ice shelf .
The bottom image , taken 18 days later , shows the remnants of the ice shelf becoming frozen in place by surrounding seawater .
Whereas the intact ice shelf appears white , the disintegrated shelf appears in varying shades of pale blue indicating small pieces of water - saturated ice mixed with a newly forming veneer of sea ice .
In late February 2008 , the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula disintegrated , an indication of warming temperatures in the region .
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) sensors on NASA ’s Terra and Aqua satellites provided some of the earliest evidence of the Wilkins Ice Shelf disintegration .
Ted Scambos , lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) , noticed changes in the shelf in MODIS imagery in March 2008 .
Between 1981 and 2007 , most of Antarctica warmed .
Portions of West Antarctica experienced an especially rapid rise in temperature .
( NASA image by Robert Simmon , based on data from Joey Comiso , GSFC . )
This map of the temperature trend is based on thermal infrared ( heat ) observations from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) satellite sensors .
This image shows trends in skin temperatures — roughly the top millimeter of the land , sea ice , or sea surface , rather than air temperatures — and it shows the long - term change in yearly surface temperature between 1981 and 2007 .
Warming areas appear in shades of red , and cooling areas appear in shades of blue .
One of the most dramatically warmed areas appears at the former location of the Larsen B Ice Shelf , which shattered in 2002 .
Although some 300 kilometers ( 185 miles ) farther south than the Larsen , the Wilkins Ice Shelf seems to have succumbed in the same fashion in early 2008 .
At roughly 70.5 degrees south and 72.5 degrees west , the Wilkins Ice Shelf occupies some 13,680 square kilometers ( 5,282 square miles ) , and has a maximum thickness of 200 to 250 meters ( 656 to 820 feet ) .
Like other ice shelves , the Wilkins floats on the surface of the water , but is also glued to the shore .
The shelf ’s disintegration appeared to result directly from warming temperatures .
In the five decades prior to the collapse , the Antarctic Peninsula experienced a temperature increase of 0.5 degrees Celsius ( 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit ) per decade , making it one of the fastest warming places on Earth , according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center .
Large blocks of ice , recently broken off the Wilkins Ice Shelf , float on the ocean in this aerial photograph .
In between the large blocks of ice float much smaller pieces of ice with a rough surface .

The Wilkins Ice Shelf , like its predecessor the Larsen B , showed evidence of melt pond formation on the surface of the ice shelf prior to breakup .
A series of sufficiently warm summers can change permeable snow into impermeable ice , similar to how snow collected in a sidewalk gutter can turn icy after a few warm days .
This change in the ice shelf surface allows melt ponds to form during subsequent warm summers , and these ponds may find and fill preexisting surface cracks .
Because water is denser than ice , the water may deepen the cracks and eventually slice completely through the shelf .
As the ice shelf crumbled , the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) conducted a flight over the shelf , capturing video footage and photographs , including this picture of the shelf .
In its release , BAS stated , “ A large part of the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula is now supported only by a thin strip of ice hanging between two islands .
It is another identifiable impact of climate change on the Antarctic environment . ”
Consistent with MODIS imagery , this photograph shows large blocks of relatively intact ice intermingled with ice detritus floating on the ocean surface .
Upon observing the Wilkins Ice Shelf disintegration in MODIS imagery , NSIDC ’s Scambos contacted Cheng - Chien Liu at Taiwan ’s National Cheng Kung University ( NCKU ) .
Liu subsequently requested imagery from Taiwan ’s Formosat - 2 satellite .
Formosat - 2 collected high - resolution imagery of the disintegrated ice shelf , showing the aftermath of the collapse in remarkable detail .
When melt ponds cut through ice shelves , some of the pieces they carve may be broad slabs , but other pieces may be tall and thin .
( Photographs of tall and narrow slices that formed during the collapse of the Larsen B Ice Shelf accompany the feature story Fragment of Its Former Shelf . )
The broad slabs are stable in the water , whereas the thin slices may topple over like dominoes .
This Formosat - 2 image captures a partial domino effect in action .
An intact portion of ice shelf has a smooth surface , and some of the ice blocks in this image display such a surface , indicating that those ice blocks did not topple .
Other ice blocks have rough surfaces , often with one smooth edge ( the former surface ) .
These ice blocks have tipped onto their sides .
An ice shelf collapsing does not by itself raise sea level because the ice shelf was already floating on the ocean surface and displacing its own weight .
However , the loss of an ice shelf can “ release the brake ” on the flow of glaciers that feed the shelf .
Increased glacier flow can raise sea level by introducing the weight of the glacier onto the ocean surface , just like adding enough ice cubes can raise the level of your drink .
In the wake of the Larsen B Ice Shelf Collapse in 2002 , a research team led by Scambos found that the glaciers feeding the shelf accelerated up to six times their original flow speed .
The Larsen Ice Shelf is “ typical ” in that it is primarily fed by a land - based glacier .
The Wilkins Ice Shelf is somewhat unusual in that only the southern end of the shelf appears to be fed by land - based ice ; the rest of the shelf may have formed from accumulation of sea ice that held fast to the coastline through many seasons , as well as snow cover .
Glaciologists estimate that the part of the Wilkins Ice Shelf that formed from sea ice may be 300 to 400 years old , and the part that is fed by glacier flow is older , perhaps up to 1,500 years old .
Because the Wilkins Ice Shelf is only marginally fed by glacier flow , however , its collapse was not expected to have the same impact on sea level rise as the collapse of the Larsen B potentially could .
The collapse of the Wilkins Ice Shelf was announced in a joint press release from the National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) , the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) , and the Earth Dynamic System Research Center at National Cheng Kung University ( NCKU ) in Taiwan .

VIENNA ( Reuters ) - Iran has begun installing advanced centrifuges in its key uranium enrichment complex , accelerating activity that could give it the means to make atom bombs in future if it chooses , diplomats said on Thursday .

Iran says it wants to produce nuclear fuel only for electricity so it can export more oil .
But has been hit with three sets of United Nations sanctions for hiding the work until 2003 , failing to prove to inspectors since then that it is wholly peaceful , and refusing to suspend the disputed program .
Iran launched 3,000 centrifuges , a basis for industrial scale enrichment , in the underground Natanz production hall last year .
But they are a 1970s - vintage design prone to breakdown so Iran began testing an advanced version in Natanz ’s pilot wing .
After a pause of several months , Iran has now assembled more than 300 centrifuges divided into two cascades ( interlinked networks ) to expand beyond 3,000 , diplomats with access to intelligence told Reuters .
“ One of the two cascades is using the advanced model , the other the older one .
There are more machines in the advanced cascade than the set of 164 typically used for the ( older model ) , ” said one of the diplomats , who asked for anonymity because the details remained confidential .
“ Iran may not have had enough of the advanced one ready yet to put into two cascades .
But they wanted to show the world they could go beyond the threshold of 3,000 now enriching at Natanz ( despite international pressure ) to stop . ”
Analysts believe Iran aims to gradually replace its start - up “ P - 1 ” centrifuge with “ a new generation ” it adapted from a “ P - 2 ” design , obtained via black markets from the West and able to enrich uranium 2 - 3 times faster than its older counterpart .
Iran ’s ambassador to the IAEA told Reuters he was unaware of new progress at the Natanz enrichment complex , which is ringed by anti-aircraft guns against a feared U.S. bombing .
The Vienna - based International Atomic Energy Agency , which has inspectors at Natanz , declined comment .
A senior diplomat familiar with the IAEA ’s Iran mission did not dispute the disclosures but said it remained unclear if Iran could get the upgraded brand of centrifuge to work productively .
Centrifuges are technically temperamental tubes that spin at supersonic speed to refine uranium to levels suitable for power plants or bombs , depending on their configuration .
NEW CENTRIFUGES PASS QUALITY TESTS
The first diplomatic source said Iran had completed quality control checks on the newly installed advanced centrifuges and was ready to start feeding uranium gas into them for enrichment , but it was unclear when this process would begin .
“ Iran has already done most of the necessary vacuum tests , including leakage checks , to make sure the ( latest ) centrifuges are in working order and to activate them , ” he said .
“ The two new cascades were installed to comply with a directive from President ( Mahmoud ) Ahmadinejad that on April 8 , a date Iran has marked as National Nuclear Technology Day , a significant achievement would be displayed . ”
Ahmadinejad used the same occasion a year ago to proclaim industrial enrichment capacity .
But nuclear analysts said then , and still say , Tehran has yet to show it can run centrifuges in large numbers at optimal speed nonstop for long periods -- the key to yielding usable quantities of enriched uranium .
Still , a U.S. intelligence report in December said Iran would gain a latent ability to build atomic warheads between 2010 and 2015 merely by gradually expanding the program and mastering the technology .
The diplomats who reported Iran ’s advanced centrifuge assemblies said they were meant to “ state a fait accompli ” that Tehran has no intention of suspending enrichment , as demanded by the U.N. Security Council , but rather of accelerating progress towards industrial production of fissile nuclear material .
The IAEA is also pressing Iran to explain Western intelligence alleging that it conducted secret studies into how to “ weaponize ” nuclear materials despite its membership of the Non-Proliferation Treaty .
Iran says the information is forged .
Diplomats close to the IAEA said it was aiming to set up a meeting with a top Iranian nuclear official in Vienna in mid-April to have him address the intelligence fully .

We ’ve written often recently off the challenges soon to be faced by the continuing melt of the Arctic .
Without a doubt , there are resources up there that someone will attempt to get their grubby little hands on .
And , with the price of oil continuing to skyrocket with each passing month , if oil is found in the north – not an unexpected possibility considering the nearby reservoirs – all hell is going to break loose .
Scott Borgerson of the Council on Foreign Relations , a former U.S. Coast Guard lieutenant commander , has just gone on record as saying that we could be facing a new cold war .
The analogy is both apt and humorously fitting , but is it in any way true ?
Instead of the historic face - off between the world ’s two superpowers , we could be looking at something far different .
Instead of just America and Russia , Arctic powers include Canada , Denmark and Norway , in addition to the original two .
Already tensions are rising , in a way that is eerily familiar .
Russia is sending submarines and science ships north to investigate how far their continental shelf extends .
They ’ve planted a flag on the seabed underneath the North Pole , and for the first time since the Cold War , they ’ve sent strategic bomber flights over the Arctic .
And yet a US official , who went on record under anonymity , believes that “ There ’s no ice cold war . ”
Borgerson said in a telephone interview recently that “ … planting a flag on the sea bottom and renewing strategic bomber flights is provocative , ” and added that “ I do n’t think we ’re [ the United States ] scrambling .
We ’re sleepwalking … I think the Russians are scrambling and I think the Norwegians and Canadians and Danes are keenly aware . ”
Everyone ’s scrambling for the best view .
Russia is n’t the only one conducting scientific research .
All of the Arctic powers are looking at just how far their continental shelves reach .
Russia seems to have stepped on toes , and while they are n’t necessarily in direct conflict with the US as of yet , Norway and Denmark definitely have some issues with what Russia is claiming as hers .
Coastal nations , like the 5 involved , are generally happy with the 200 nautical miles that extend from their coastline as sovereign territory .
But recent research coming out of the University of New Hampshire and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration suggests that the US shelf might extend an extra 100 nautical miles further than previously thought .
The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea is what gives the sovereign rights to coastal nations .
And many believe that the US should sign the treaty soon .
In addition , if a country can meet a set of conditions – scientific , etc – then their coastal boundaries can extend .
“ Of course we need to be at the table as ocean law develops , ” the U.S. official said .
“ It ’s not like ocean law is going to stop developing if we ’re not in there .
It ’s just going to develop without us . ”
What saddens me the most is that you can get your bottom dollar that this does not bode well for the environment .
Ask yourself what ’s causing the melting of the Arctic , and then look at what they hope to extract .
The answer to both questions , is fossil fuel .

The mystery over the Israeli bombing of Syrian territory last year took a new twist yesterday when US intelligence agencies showed a video claiming to prove that the target was a covert nuclear plant being built with North Korean help .
The White House described the alleged reactor as " a dangerous and potentially destabilising development for the region and the world " .
After seven months of silence and evasion from the Bush administration , the CIA director , Michael Hayden , briefed members of the Senate and House armed services , intelligence and foreign affairs committees , saying his weapons specialists found the evidence compelling .
After the Israeli attack last September , there had been speculation that the target was a nuclear reactor but this the first time there has been an official statement , complete with details , and the first time that North Korea has been implicated .
The Bush administration also disclosed that Israel had consulted Washington before launching the strike .
The White House spokeswoman , Dana Perino , speaking after the Senate and House of Representatives had been briefed , said Syria had built the plant " carefully hidden from view " in a remote desert area in the east of the country , in breach of its international obligations .
" We are convinced , based on a variety of information , that North Korea assisted Syria 's covert nuclear activities .
We have good reason to believe that the reactor , which was damaged beyond repair on September 6 of last year , was not intended for peaceful purposes , " she said .
The White House added that the regime moved quickly to bury evidence of its existence , covering over the wreckage and constructing a new building on the site .
US officials said yesterday the Bush administration was putting the information out in order to clear the decks before doing a deal with North Korea to dismantle its nuclear programme .
The video , made public last night after Congress had been briefed , is a collection of material from various sources , in addition to Israeli intelligence .
There is no tape from inside the alleged reactor , only two still photographs , apparently taken by a human hand on the ground rather than a drone or satellite .
This was supported by satellite pictures and graphs .
The pictures taken on the ground show an apparently empty brown - grey , solid building , but nothing that seems to indicate it is being used for nuclear purposes .
In the video , which shows the site before and after the bombing , the CIA claims that the alleged reactor is similar to one in Yongbyon , 55 miles north of the North Korean capital , Pyongyang .
One official said the Syrian plant was within weeks or months of being operational .
" This thing was good to go , " he said .
Congress was told that the reactor was designed to produce a small amount of plutonium , which can be used to build a nuclear bomb .
In releasing the video , the Bush administration is taking the risk that the North Korea regime may use it as an excuse to walk out of US - North Korean negotiations about dismantling its nuclear programme , but is banking on any such walkout as being only temporary .
Under a deal agreed last year between North Korea , the US , China , Japan , South Korea and Russia , Pyongyang is required to detail whether it has provided nuclear help to Syria and other countries round the world .
So far it has failed to deliver .
A US official who had seen the video said : " We cannot move forward [ on a deal with North Korea ] unless you acknowledge we are doing this with our eyes wide open .
And we are going ahead with our eyes wide open . "
The Syrian government yesterday denied it had been building a nuclear reactor with North Korean help .
Syria 's ambassador to Britain , Sami al - Khiyami , described the video as ridiculous : " Unfortunately the scenario of taking and retaking pictures looks like what happened before the Iraq war , when the US administration was trying to convince the world that Iraq had nuclear weapons . "
In the run-up to the invasion of Iraq , the Bush administration showed photographs and other material to the UN security council that it claimed amounted to evidence of Saddam Hussein 's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction , but which were subsequently proven to be false .
Joseph Cirincione , an expert on nuclear proliferation and head of the Washington - based Ploughshares Fund , said : " We should learn first from the past and be very cautious about any intelligence from the US about other country 's weapons . "
He insisted there had been no justification for Israeli launching the strike on another country , given there was no imminent danger .
He added that Syria was a sideshow that should not deflect attention from the bigger prize of North Korea dismantling its nuclear programme .
" The administration is trying to clear up old business , so it does not get in the way of an agreement with North Korea . "
The Israeli strike destroyed a large building in the desert near the village of At Tibnah in the Dayr az Zawr region , 90 miles from the Iraqi border .
The strike was reminiscent of one on the Iraqi reactor at Osirk in 1981 .
But , unlike the Iraqi strike , the attack on Syria initially remained shrouded in mystery , with Bush and other leaders repeatedly deflecting reporters ' questions .
At the time , the British intelligence service , MI6 , privately briefed the British government that Syria had been building a nuclear reactor .
The British government accepted this as credible .
If Syria had been secretly building a nuclear plant , it would have been in breach of the non-proliferation treaty , which requires Damascus to notify the UN watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , of any such plans .
The US media and some analysts speculated that neo-conservatives in the Bush administration , led by the vice - president , Dick Cheney , wanted the North Korea - Syria link publicised to try to wreck the prospect of a deal and to undermine the state department official leading the negotiations , Christopher Hill , the assistant secretary of state for Asia
But US officials , as well as analysts , discounted this , saying the neo-conservatives had been discredited and that pragmatists such as the secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , who favours a deal with North Korea , remained in the ascendancy .
Backstory
Israel is the sole nuclear power in the Middle East , though it publicly refuses to acknowledge this , and is intent on remaining so .
It carried out a pre-emptive air strike against Saddam Hussein 's nuclear plant at Osirk in 1981 , from which the dictator 's nuclear ambitions never recovered , and hinted at similar strikes against Iran , saying it will not allow Tehran to acquire a nuclear weapon .
It was against this background that Israel bombed the alleged Syrian nuclear plant in September .
It came as a surprise , given that there had been no speculation that Damascus had been engaged in any such programme .
The Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , imposed a news blackout and George Bush also refused at White House press conferences to confirm whether the target was a suspect nuclear plant , until yesterday .
At the time , there were questions over why Israel should strike against Syria at such an early stage .
One theory was that it was meant as a signal to Iran that if it continued to pursue uranium enrichment , a process that could lead to a nuclear bomb , Israel would bomb its nuclear sites .
One of the biggest questions facing both defendants and the RIAA in the record labels ' legal campaign against P2P users is whether making a file available for download over a P2P network equates to distribution as defined under the Copyright Act .
In a long - awaited ruling , a federal judge essentially validated the RIAA 's position that having songs available in a KaZaA shared folder violates the distribution right under the Copyright Act .
The ruling came in response to Denise Barker 's motion to dismiss a copyright infringement lawsuit brought against her in 2005 .
In denying the motion to dismiss , Judge Kenneth M. Karas sided with the RIAA 's contention that merely offering a song for distribution is sufficient to infringe on the record labels ' distribution right .
" Having a file in a shared folder is enough to violate the law , " EFF staff attorney Fred von Lohmann told Ars .
( The EFF had filed an amicus curiae brief in the case . )
What 's significant about the decision in Elektra v. Barker is that it is one of only two or three cases where the judge has heard arguments , been fully briefed , and asked to rule on this particular issue .
There have been a handful of other rulings on the issue , but Judge Karas ' ruling " represents the most extensive and serious treatment " of the issue , according to von Lohmann .
In his decision , Judge Karas focused on the " publication " right enumerated in the Copyright Act .
" However , while the statute does not define ' distribute ' or ' distribution , ' it does define the term ' publication , ' " wrote the judge in his decision .
" The question before the Court , therefore , is whether the Court should look to the definition of the word ' publication ' to construe the meaning of the term ' distribute ' in Section 106 ( 3 ) of the Copyright Act . "
His conclusion is that Congress considered the two terms to be synonymous when it enacted the Copyright Act .
" Although Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged that Defendant ' offer[ed ] to distribute [ Plaintiffs ' copyrighted works ] ... for the purposes of further distribution , ' Defendant 's Motion still fails because Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that , in addition to making Plaintiffs ' works available , Defendant distributed Plaintiffs ' copyrighted works . "
So even if the RIAA can't argue that making music in a shared P2P folder available is distribution , it does mean that the labels can allege that dropping songs into a KaZaA share is making an offer to distribute .
Von Lohmann called the decision well - reasoned , but unfortunate .
" I understand how the court went wrong and the unfortunate result , " he told Ars .
" And he admits that his decision is not without disagreement ; he understands the contours of the issue .
But clearly , he really engaged the subject and read all of the law . "
Ray Beckerman , who is representing Barker , called the ruling a mixed bag .
" We 're gratified to see the court reject the making available theory and disappointed to see that he did n't throw out the case altogether , " he told Ars .
" I think the ruling had some positive aspects to it and was also flawed . "
( Beckerman broke the story and the decision is available from his site . )
The RIAA is pleased with the ruling .
" As we expected , the court rejected the defendant ’s motion to dismiss and is allowing this case to proceed , " RIAA spokesperson Cara Duckworth told Ars .
" The court also agreed with the record companies that merely offering to distribute copies for the purposes of further distribution — even without an actual dissemination — can violate the distribution right . "
There 's at least one other case where a judge is expected to rule on the making available issue .
The RIAA has a motion for summary judgment pending in Atlantic v. Howell , which was filed in 2006 and the EFF filed a brief opposing the RIAA 's position in that case in January , with von Lohmann arguing the EFF 's position in early March .
In the short term , today 's ruling nudges Elektra v. Barker closer to a trial , unless she decides to settle or the RIAA drops its case for some unforeseen reason .
Longer - term , von Lohmann sees some real problems arising from Judge Karas ' decision .
" I think the problem here is that it greases the wheels of the RIAA 's litigation machine , " von Lohmann said .
" The RIAA 's goal is to get from complaint to judgment as quickly as possible .
So far the evidence that they have been able to cheaply amass is the shared folder , and if that 's all you need to prove copyright infringement , then it 's very , very easy for the RIAA to generate victories against large numbers of people . "

themselves
It is beyond dispute that our rulers are forcing government scientists to reach conclusions based on politics rather than science .
For example , the editor of the prestigiousmagazine wrote in early 2003 that there is growing evidence that the Bush Administration “ invades areas once immune to this kind of manipulation ” ( see here for further information ) .
What does this have to do with 9/11 ?
Well , the White House ordered the EPA to lie about air quality after the collapse of the Twin Towers and Building 7 Okay , that 's bad .
But , you say , that does n't prove that politics trumped science in investigating who carried out the 9/11 attacks and why they succeeded .
Well , let 's take a look . •
The chairmen of the Joint Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 had conflicts of interest that may have put them in the middle of the 9/11 attacks ( see also this video ) •
The co-chairs of the 9/11 Commissionnow admit that the Commission largely operated based upon political considerations • Indeed , the 9/11 Commissioners were " a bunch of people who are connected to the very people who are at the center of the question of who's at fault " , and the person in charge of determining what topics and evidence the Commission examined or ignored is an expert on creating public myths and one of the architects of the imperial agenda
• 9/11 Commission co-chair Lee Hamilton says " I do n't believe for a minute we got everything right " , that the Commission was set up to fail , that people should keep asking questions about 9/11 , that the 9/11 debate should continue , and that the 9/11 Commission report was only " the first draft " of history
• 9/11 Commissioner Bob Kerrey said that " There are ample reasons to suspect that there may be some alternative to what we outlined in our version . . .
We did n't have access . . . . "
• 9/11 Commissioner Timothy Roemer said " We were extremely frustrated with the false statements we were getting "
• Former 9/11 Commissioner Max Cleland resigned from the Commission , stating : " It is a national scandal " ; " This investigation is now compromised " ; and " One of these days we will have to get the full story because the 9 - 11 issue is so important to America .
But this White House wants to cover it up "
• The Senior Counsel to the 9/11 Commission , who led the 9/11 staff 's inquiry , said " I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described ....
The tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years ....
This is not spin .
This is not true . "
• Commissioner Richard Ben-Veniste told that father of one of the victims : " This is not an investigation , but merely an exposition . " •
Even the former director of the FBI says there was a cover up by the 9/11 Commission .
And the 9/11 Commissioners knew that military officials lied to the Commission , and considered recommending criminal charges for such false statements , yet did n't bother to tell the American people •
Look at the following quotes : • " We were supposed to be independent , not necessarily confrontational .
We were investigating a national catastrophe , not a White House transgression ; this was 9/11 , not Watergate . "
Without Precedent , p. 65 .

• “ The purpose of a government investigatory commission is to place blame where it does the least harm politically . ”

The question was one she had heard before , but this time it was asked in downright hostile terms .
“ Has your mother shown any remorse for the fact that her vote cost Iraqis a million of their lives ? ” a student asked Chelsea Clinton on Monday at the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
Ms. Clinton replied : “ She cast a vote based on the best available evidence .
Perhaps you had clairvoyance then , and that ’s extraordinary . ”
As Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s presidential campaign tries to win some younger voters , her daughter is parachuting into the heart of enemy - occupied territory : college campuses in the grip of Obama fever , both in must - win and lost - cause states for her mother ’s candidacy .
On Saturday and Sunday , Ms. Clinton will campaign in Hawaii , the childhood home of Senator Barack Obama .
For nearly the first year of her mother ’s presidential bid , Ms. Clinton , 27 , was practically invisible to voters .
Just before the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 3 , she began appearing in the tableau of flags and signs behind her mother at speeches .
But when it became clear that Mr. Obama was making off with many people her age , Ms. Clinton decided to speak out .
Unlike most other family members who hit the campaign trail , she does not offer an intimate portrait of the candidate , and she recounts old family stories only when her audiences clamor for one .
( Memory lane can be a dangerous place : waxing about White House Christmases might remind voters of just how many her family has already had . )
( CNN ) -- English marine experts have laid their hands on an octopus that 's missing two of its own : a six - limbed creature that they have dubbed ' hexapus . '
Henry the ' hexapus ' photographed by staff at Blackpool 's Sea Life Centre , in northwest England .
Ordinarily , octopodes have eight arms and legs .
And should they lose one or more in an accident , they can grow the limbs back .
Which is what makes ' Henry ' -- as staffers at Blackpool Sea Life Centre in northwest England have dubbed their find -- so unique .
His missing limbs stem from a birth defect .
" If you look closer between the legs , there 's webbing that attaches each of the arms together , " John Filmer of the Sea Life Centre told CNN Tuesday .
" You 'd assume if he'd lost one of his legs in an accident , there would be space for an arm to grow back .
" But there 's no space for two extra legs to grow back .
That 's just how he is . "
Staffers called others zoos and aquariums and scoured the Internet to see if there were records of similar creatures .
" No one has ever heard of another case of a six - legged octopus , " said display superviser Carey Duckhouse .
' Henry ' was picked up from a local zoo along with seven other octopodes for a new exhibit at the center .
No one noticed his missing legs until he attached himself to the inside of his glass tank .
They named him ' Henry ' because it alliterated well with ' hexapus . '
" It has also been mentioned in the grapevine that he was named after King Henry the VIII who had six wives when he should have had eight , " Filmer , the centre 's marketing director , said .
Until Henry , the most famous six - legged octopus was one that appeared in a 1955 B - movie , ' It Came From Beneath The Sea . '
As was common of many science fiction movies of the era , the film was made on a shoestring budget -- and designers left off two legs from the creature because of budget contraints .
Octopuses are renowned for having three hearts , blue blood and the ability to alter their skin complexion in the blink of an eye .
But , said the center , " ( e ) ven these astonishing characteristics however are commonplace compared to Henry 's unique tally in the leg department . "

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Archer Daniels Midland Corp. on Tuesday countered criticism that biofuel production is driving up food prices and defended the industry as the answer to meeting the world 's rising energy demand .
The Decatur , Ill . - based agriculture company is the country 's largest ethanol producer , spending millions of dollars on production facilities .
At the same time , the industry benefited from about $ 3.2 billion in federal tax breaks last year , the biggest energy - related tax break ever , according to an April report from the Energy Information Administration .
Biofuel is made from the same grains that people eat and feed to their livestock .
With the price of grain sharply higher this year , many are now questioning whether subsidizing the ethanol industry is really in the country 's best interest .
“ ' Retreat from biofuels is just an empty gesture .
That wo n't fill anybody 's stomach and wo n't fill anybody 's gas tanks . ' ” — Patricia Woertz , Archer Daniels
But food costs are being driven primarily by higher energy costs , said Archer Daniels ADM , - 1.11 % Chairman and Chief Executive Patricia Woertz , which is the result of a tight energy supply -- not increased biofuel production .
" And I actually find it sad , and maybe even a little ironic , that these misguided attacks on biofuels is directed at the one alternative we actually have today for ... increasing the fuel supply , " she said , speaking on a post - earnings conference call .
Further , a pullback of U.S. government subsidies to the industry would be " wrong , it 's foolish , I think it 's dangerous , I think it 's a mistake , " Woertz said .
" Retreat from biofuels is just an empty gesture , " she said .
" That wo n't fill anybody 's stomach and wo n't fill anybody 's gas tanks . "
The nascent biofuel industry has spent millions lobbying for greater U.S. support , culminating in President George W. Bush 's declaration in his 2006 State of the Union Address that biofuel will be an important step towards achieving national energy independence .
Archer Daniels Midland contributed more than $ 700,000 toward lobbying the federal government in 2007 , according to filings provided through the Lobbying Disclosure Act .
A Brazilian developer threatened with legal action by Creative for making its soundcards work better with Vista has had his work reinstated on the company 's website .
Daniel Kawakami , better known by the moniker Daniel_K , modified a range of Creative 's drivers to make the company 's soundcards work smoothly with Windows Vista .
Without his modifications , users argue , Vista machines with Creative soundcards crash and features fail to work .
Posting a forum message on its website last weekend , Creative threatened Daniel_K with legal action , accusing him of infringing its intellectual property .
The company removed forum posts from the developer containing links to his work .
The move backfired big time , generating a media firestorm and howls of protests from outraged users on technology forums across the web .
Guess what , Creative has reinstated Daniel_K 's posts .
Creative declined to speak to The Register on the matter , but sent us this statement instead .
We have read the strong feedback about Creative 's forum post regarding driver development by daniel_k and other outside parties .
Creative 's message tried to address our concern about the improper distribution of certain software , which is the property of other companies .
However , we did not make it as clear as we would have liked that we do support driver development by independent third parties .
The huge task of developing driver updates to accommodate the many changes in the Vista operating system and the extensive testing required , including the lengthy Vista certification requirements for audio , makes it very difficult for Creative to develop updates for all past products .
Outside developers have been very helpful to Creative and our customers by developing updates for many of our Sound Blaster products , and we do support and appreciate these efforts .
This however does not extend to the unauthorized distribution of other companies ' property .
We hope to work out a mutually agreeable method for working with daniel_k in supporting his efforts in driver development .
Going forward , we are committed to doing a better job of working more closely with third parties to support their development for our products and our customers .
Daniel_K is incensed by Creative .
" They publicly threatened me , just to show their arrogance , " he told El Reg by email .
He told us that Creative contacted him on a chat session .
" They were sarcastic , ironic and asked me if I wanted something from them , as if I were expecting something , " he wrote .
" It was my protest against them and would like to see how far it would go . "
Enough reward
He acknowledges that Creative has a case regarding intellectual property , but is furious about the company 's strategy .
" I 'd say they are stealing [ from ] their own customers by disabling features based on technologies they own ( so they did it on purpose ) and by charging for a software that requires an improved driver that they refuse to provide . "
" At least they are getting flamed all over the web and they are certainly mad about it .
That is enough reward for my hard work , " he wrote .
Daniel_K 's modified drivers have proved immensely popular , with 100,000 downloads in total , according to the developer .
Users had complained that , without them , Vista machines based on Creative 's soundcards crashed and features failed .
Some forum posters have already suggested that , given Daniel_K 's success in modifying its drivers , the company should offer him a job .
So The Register asked him if he would accept a job if offered by Creative .
" No . " ®

Nearly half a million people in China are making money by playing a game , earning gold and selling it to other players with too much time on their hands and a credit card burning in their pocket !
The phenomenon that is World of Warcraft , a massively multi-player online role - playing game , has spawned some of the most creative ideas for making money .
The game ’s currency is gold , but a lot of players do n’t want to take the time to earn it themselves .
So , these people in China , and all over the world , spend their days playing the game , making gold and selling it in the game for actual cash .
Washington - based energy solutions company Innovatek has invented a revolutionary microreactor that has the capability of converting most any liquid fuel into hydrogen .
The microreactor is a first of its kind device that could change the entire automotive landscape and finally free America from it 's dependance on foreign sources of fuel .
Each microreactor weighs less than one pound and can be linked to other units to give the group a higher output of hydrogen fuel .
Innovatek says it has developed connected systems that can produce one to 160 gallons of hydrogen per minute -- an accomplishment that perfectly enables it to be used in small spaces for automobile transportation .
Innovatek ’s device is called the InnovaGen fuel processor .
It uses microscopic channels and proprietary catalysts to continuously produce hydrogen from a variety of hydrocarbon sources .
“ Rather than natural gas , which is something we can also use , we have been focusing on liquid fuels , ” Irving says .
“ That includes things like gasoline , biodiesel , vegetable oil and other renewables . ”
The fuel processor works by combining two feeds , one of a hydrocarbon and the other of water , in a catalytic reactor .
“ We use microtechnology to scale down the system into something that can be held in your hand , and produce hydrogen that can be fed directly into the fuel cell , ” Irving says .
“ Rather than using a huge plant that produces hydrogen that is compressed into cylinders , our device can be integrated directly into the fuel cell as a component of an overall system . ”
InnovaTek 's microreactor overcomes numerous stumbling blocks for hydrogen - powered car adoption including the elimination of the highly pressurized hydrogen storage tanks , the lack of a nationwide hydrogen pipeline system and the immense cost of adding hydrogen fuel stations across the country .
Because of its use of biodiesel as a feed stock the microreactor will complete a carbon neutral chain of energy that would outperform any other kind of automotive propulsion including plug - in electric vehicles .

A Shoplifter convicted for the 175th time was spared a prison sentence after magistrates decided to give her
another last chance .
Joanne Jones , 31 , has faced more than 200 court hearings and served 34 jail terms over the past 16 years , at a cost to the taxpayer of more than £ 700,000 .
But she walked free from the court after Canterbury magistrates decided there was a " chink of light " to suggest
she could change – despite the fact that she was on bail when she committed her last offence and is still hooked on heroin .
Scroll down for more ...
Jones has plagued the city since she first appeared in its youth court at 16 .
She has since averaged 12 court appearances a year , but has never been jailed for longer than 12 months .
After admitting her 175th offence – stealing underwear worth £ 117 from TK Maxx – on Wednesday , magistrate
Neil Hubbard told her : " We 'll give you another chance .
" You are no stranger to this court .
However , on this occasion there 's a chink of light in your favour , which
gives us some chance of hope for you .
" We are going to give you another opportunity if you can manage it . "
Jones , who is unemployed and receiving £ 50 a week in benefits , went on to confess stealing £ 40 worth of make - up from Asda – an offence not on the charge sheet – in the hope of a lenient sentence .
She was given a 90 - day suspended sentence and ordered her to pay TK Maxx £ 40 compensation for damaging
the underwear as she tore off the security tags .
Defence solicitor Ian Bond told the court Jones had made " progress " .
He added : " I know she is still in her early thirties and and the court has dealt with her again and again and again .
" She has been sent to prison on 34 separate occasions .
I think there is some scintilla of hope for the future that good progress can be made .
" There is some suggestion that she is complying with the probation service . "
The court accepted Mr Bond 's recommendation that Jones only undergo a " medium intensity " drug rehabilitation
programme because she might " fail " the harder course .
Mr Bond added : " When dealing with someone like Joanne Jones we would be better off not setting her up to fail . "
A court insider said after the hearing : " Nobody can believe Joanne has been given another chance .
" She has been in and out of this court since she was a teenager and still she keeps coming back .
She has had 16 years of chances .
When is it going to be her last chance ?
" There is no point sending her out into the community again – it's not as if we do n't know what is going to happen .
" She 'll be back here by the end of next month .
In 2003 everyone thought she had turned over a new leaf as
she was only jailed four times that year .
" But it started up again soon after that and has been getting worse ever since . "
As Matt points out , they undoubtedly already know which way they 're going to go , so why are they subjecting us all to this painful ordeal ?
Working theories :
1 ) They are afraid of retaliation by a vengeful Senator Clinton
2 ) They are afraid that she will somehow get the nomination , and retaliate from the Oval Office
3 ) They need the Clintons to fundraise for the general
4 ) No one wants to be the guy who put the last nail in the Clinton campaign 's coffin .
Collective action problems : not just for economists any more .
My question is if the media really is an all - powerful force shaping the debate , why can't we band together and tell everyone that the race is over , thus making it true ?
Where 's the vast media conspiracy when you need it ?
We want to hear what you think about this article .

My friend Mina lets her four - year - old boys wear fairy dresses .
It probably would n't be an issue if they did n't wear them out of the house , but they do .
And that 's where the trouble with gender begins .
People assume these boys are girls , but those who engage Mina and her boys in conversation realise they have boys ' names , and then start to redden and get nervous , mutter things under their breath and walk away .
Mina 's grandmother has asked why the boys can't dress up in cowboy outfits instead .
Other little boys ask why they like pink .
Another parent has suggested that Mina has transsexual children .
The boys ' paediatrician has asked Mina if the boys like football , because they should start playing now and develop the common language for men .
It 's a precious thing , this masculinity .
It seems to be in danger at any moment of disappearing , so concerned adults seem to insist in little boys performing a certain kind of masculinity , restricting them from the ethereal world of the fairy , which , incidentally , was originally an imaginary world where these creatures were gender - neutral .
We know deep at the heart of Mina 's grandmother 's and paediatrician 's concerns about the twins is that they may grow up to be , God forbid , gay .
Like gay and lesbian culture , femininity has long been associated with artificiality , with things that are n't " real " , like dresses , lipstick , carefully curled hair and high heels .
It 's something these little boys " put on " when they wear their fairy dresses , and maybe if they keep them on for too long their relationships with other boys and men will go beyond the relationship of the mate and the cobber .
As feminists have pointed out , the American version of " mate " - " buddy " - is lexically related to the word " brother " and is a term of affection , warmth and connection .
" Sissy " , on the other hand , is a term of derision , and of course comes from the word " sister " .
Misogyny , which I believe is at the core of the fear of little boys wearing fairy dresses , lies deep in the heart of our language , as Dale Spender suggested many years ago .
Parents feel the need to crush any traces of the feminine that may lurk in the hearts , minds and hands of little boys .
It 's emotional circumcision .
Although Western society is increasingly less homophobic than it used to be , when it comes to Disney cartoons , you can be sure that the male villain is coded queer .
He seems a little too concerned with his appearance , does n't live with a woman , wears buckles on his shoes and has stockinged calves and speaks like Sir John Gielgud .
Think of Scar in The Lion King , Govenor Ratcliff in Pocahontas , and any of the bad guys in the Barbie movies .
And if the villain is female , you can be sure that she 's not straight : Ursula in The Little Mermaid is an overbearing , screaming drag queen .
Interestingly , the heroines in these cartoons are usually pretty feisty .
They usually have to have physical and emotional courage to survive and subsequently marry their prince ( or , in the case of Barbie 's Princess and the Pauper , get engaged , then go travelling before settling down - a true third wave feminist film ) .
And it 's also okay for little girls to play cowboys , build a train track and wear cargo pants .
They do n't seem to be in danger of losing their femininity .
Why is there such a difference here ?
Why are little girls encouraged to explore so many aspects of the imaginary and what it is to be human , while boys are sliced up so early on in life ?
But although little girls are able to be tomboys , it can't last for too long .
There comes a time when girls need to behave in rigidly feminine ways .
Ladette to Lady , a reality TV show recently screened on ABC TV illustrates this beautifully .
About ten young , working class English women around the ages of 16 to 18 were selected to go to a finishing school where older , upper class women aimed to transform the girls into nicely spoken , demure ladies that men would be happy to take out to dinner and eventually marry .
As one girl put it : " You ca n't be expected to be taken to nice restaurants when you act like a lad . "
So the girls are taught to speak with tic tacs in their mouths ( so they articulate their words clearly ) , they learn to bake soufflés , de - bone quails and arrange flowers .
It 's all pretty darn boring , and it's no wonder the girls at various points " act up " and voice their opinions , which are n't at all ladylike .
These girls are caught in so many binding agents here ( and I do n't just mean eggwhites ) : they are told not to argue , not to be outspoken , not to be so physical - just a few of the human rights feminists have fought for over the past 100 years - and they actually want to learn these " skills " because they do n't want to be judged wherever they go , and want to move forward in life without being categorised as failures .
But one girl wo n't accept it .
" If that 's what being a lady 's all about , I want nuffin ' to do with it , " she says as she leaves the show .
The upper class teachers watch her walk out of the house , midriff out and proud , with , I think , a little longing .
These women are restrained by their strict adherence to extreme gender conformity , but it works for them .
It has enabled them to marry well , be financially secure and turn out a beautiful vertical arrangement with roses and hydrangeas on a firm oasis .
Like most reality TV shows such as Extreme Makeover , Ladette to Lady works with joining the system , not beating or questioning it .
What 's the point in raising human beings that operate outside of the gender norm if they can't get a date ?
In no way do I want to trivialise these young working class girls ' plight .
Indeed , they are judged by their voices , their gestures , their volume , but is cross-class dressing , repressing behaviours that are classified as masculine , really the answer ?
Mina 's boys have just started kindergarten and are desperate to wear the gingham school dresses rather than their rather drab shorts and t- shirts .
But Mina has put her foot down on this one , knowing that parents and other students just would n't be able to cope with that , even though the girls are able to wear the same shorts and t- shirts any day of the week .
The interesting thing here with these fairy - dressing boys , queer Disney villains and ladettes is just how narrow our definition of acceptable gendered behaviour is , and that femininity in young boys and men just is n't okay from early childhood onwards , even in the 21st century .
The result is that little boys are stuck in a straight world of the most aggressive parts of reality - guns , pirates and cowboys - and girls are encouraged to explore both this and the more ethereal elements of imagination .
Simply put , strict gendered behaviour whittles away so many aspects of what it is to be human .
Like anything , perhaps these confusions are best put by quoting Madonna , who quotes Ian McEwan :
Girls can wear jeans
And cut their hair short
Wear shirts and boots
' Cause it 's OK to be a boy
But for a boy to look like
a girl is degrading
' Cause you think that being
a girl is degrading .
The event will convene an array of scientists , economists , statisticians and libertarian commentators holding a dizzying range of views on the changing climate  from those who see a human influence but think it is not dangerous , to others who say global warming is a hoax , the sun ’s fault or beneficial .
Many attendees say it is the dawn of a new paradigm .
But many climate scientists and environmental campaigners say it is the skeptics ’ last stand .
Michael E. Schlesinger , an atmospheric scientist at the University of Illinois , Urbana - Champaign , said that any focus on the last few months or years as evidence undermining the established theory that accumulating greenhouse gases are making the world warmer was , at best , a waste of time and , at worst , a harmful distraction .
Discerning a human influence on climate , he said , “ involves finding a signal in a noisy background . ”
He added , “ The only way to do this within our noisy climate system is to average over a sufficient number of years that the noise is greatly diminished , thereby revealing the signal .
This means that one cannot look at any single year and know whether what one is seeing is the signal or the noise or both the signal and the noise . ”
The shifts in the extent and thickness of sea ice in the Arctic ( where ice has retreated significantly in recent summers ) and Antarctic ( where the area of floating sea ice has grown lately ) are similarly hard to attribute to particular influences .
Interviews and e-mail exchanges with half a dozen polar climate and ice experts last week produced a rough consensus :
Even with the extensive refreezing of Arctic waters in the deep chill of the sunless boreal winter , the fresh - formed ice remains far thinner than the yards - thick , years - old ice that dominated the region until the 1990s .
That means the odds of having vast stretches of open water next summer remain high , many Arctic experts said .
“ Climate skeptics typically take a few small pieces of the puzzle to debunk global warming , and ignore the whole picture that the larger science community sees by looking at all the pieces , ” said Ignatius G. Rigor , a climate scientist at the Polar Science Center of the University of Washington in Seattle .
WHEN President Bush started making noises about World War III , he only confirmed what has been a Democratic article of faith all year : Between now and Election Day he and Dick Cheney , cheered on by the mob of neocon dead - enders , are going to bomb Iran .
But what happens if President Bush does not bomb Iran ?
That is good news for the world , but potentially terrible news for the Democrats .
If we do go to war in Iran , the election will indeed be a referendum on the results , which the Republican Party will own no matter whom it nominates for president .
But if we do n’t , the Democratic standard - bearer will have to take a clear stand on the defining issue of the race .
As we saw once again at Tuesday night ’s debate , the front - runner , Hillary Clinton , does not have one .
The reason so many Democrats believe war with Iran is inevitable , of course , is that the administration is so flagrantly rerunning the sales campaign that gave us Iraq .
The same old scare tactic — a Middle East Hitler plotting a nuclear holocaust — has been recycled with a fresh arsenal of hyped , loosey - goosey intelligence and outright falsehoods that are sometimes regurgitated without corroboration by the press .
Mr. Bush has gone so far as to accuse Iran of shipping arms to its Sunni antagonists in the Taliban , a stretch Newsweek finally slapped down last week .
Back in the reality - based community , it is Mr. Bush who has most conspicuously enabled the Taliban ’s resurgence by dropping the ball as it regrouped in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Administration policy also opened the door to Iran ’s lethal involvement in Iraq .
The Iraqi “ unity government ” that our troops are dying to prop up has more allies in its Shiite counterpart in Tehran than it does in Washington .

There is concern about how Bridgend is being portrayed
Residents have their opinions but nobody has the answers .
They have spoken of their shock and are at a loss to understand why 17 young people in the area would apparently want to kill themselves since January 2007 .
There is also a sensitivity about how their county , with a population of 130,000 , is being portrayed .
A place they have always regarded as unremarkable .
There is deprivation but unemployment is comparable with other south Wales industrial areas that appear to have lower suicide rates among their young people .
Bridgend is both a town and a county .
Around 40,000 people live in the town itself , where the Ford engine factory is the best known employer .
There are also valley communities and not far away is the seaside town of Porthcawl , popular with surfers .
The sudden deaths have not been confined to one area .
From 1996 to 2006 , Bridgend county had the highest rates of suicide in Wales among males aged 15 to 24 , although it was only sixth in Wales for all males aged over 15 .
You need people in schools looking out for the early signs
Robert Batchelor
Darren Matthews , branch director for the Samaritans in Bridgend , said : " It 's got its problems like any town but there 's nothing special about Bridgend .
" In my mind , Bridgend has always had a high suicide rate but it 's been older people .
" The community is in in shock .
They can't believe this is happening and so many people have died . "
He believes deprivation often plays a part in suicides but other factors must also contribute for it to affect so many young people .
He said : " We believe it may be a suicide cluster and there 's a contagion effect .
The door has been opened .
" It 's saying to the rest of the community that suicide is an option . "
He added that this would particularly affect a young , vulnerable person who was feeling suicidal anyway .
Bridgend Samaritans said the community is in " shock "
Speaking to shoppers in Bridgend town centre on Wednesday , everybody I spoke to was aware of what had been happening , but it came as a surprise to meet somebody who had actually tried to take his own life .
Robert Batchelor , 38 , a painter and decorator , spoke openly about how he attempted suicide 13 years ago and said he could identify with the emotions that some young people felt .
" I tried to kill myself and mates had also tried to take their own lives before me .
" I had no prospects really . "
Mr Batchelor , who is now planning to live in Spain , said he thought that early intervention in schools would be the best way of preventing suicides .
" You need to catch it at an early age at school .
" You need people in schools looking out for the early signs . "
This echoes comments by mental health charity Mind , which has said that schools should train teachers in suicide awareness .
Another issue that has raised concern locally is some of the media coverage which has seen Bridgend labelled as a " suicide town " .
On Tuesday , South Wales Police and the parents of 15 - year - old Nathaniel Pritchard , who apparently killed himself , were critical of some of the media coverage of the deaths .
It 's a lovely town , that 's why it 's so shocking
Stacy Browning
Shoppers in Bridgend also expressed concern about the coverage and how the town was being portrayed .
Police have said there was no link between a number of suicides in the area and no suggestion of a pact , saying they " were all young people with big issues " .
Carol Phillips , 56 , said : " It 's not fair on the families enduring it day after day on the television and in the newspapers .
" It could influence the youngsters , I think .
We think it 's a coincidence that has been highlighted by the media . "
And Stacy Browning , 22 , said : " It 's a lovely town , that 's why it 's so shocking .
" A lot of the media have portrayed us as an awful town but it 's not a horrible place . "
Steps are being taken to ensure that the suicide rate in Bridgend and , indeed , the whole of Wales , is reduced .
The Welsh Assembly Government wants a 10 % drop in suicides by 2012 .
That 's no surprise when suicide rates among men in Wales are the highest in the four UK nations .
A separate suicide prevention strategy has also been set up to tackle the deaths in Bridgend county .
Alison Mawby , project manager with KPC Youth which helps provide activities for young people in the communities of Kenfig Hill , Pyle and Cornelly , said everybody was now working together .
" With everybody working together across the borough , we can work out some sort of strategy on this .
" I wish there was a magic answer but it 's very complex . "
Argentina has been having a huge UFO boom , with 64 reported sightings in 2008 alone .
And some of the UFO photos have become remarkably detailed , showing things like insignia and little fins .
Thanks to digital cameras ( and maybe Photoshop ) people are able to create much , much more believable evidence of extraterrestrial vehicles zooming over Buenos Aires .
But is the truth out there ?
Click through for more photos , and some details of the sightings .

What 's great about the Argentinian UFO boom is that some of the sightings have included multiple vehicles .
( Why should alien visitors have to travel alone ? )
For example , on Jan. 1 , a Buenos Aires man witnessed " a perfect triangular formation of three vehicles , " heading toward Rio de la Plata .
Other sightings include " a group of lights " and " two luminous objects . "

Some of the UFOs are the traditional saucer shape , while others are V - shaped , rocket shaped , rotating black objects , or just a big orange sphere .
Which could mean that multiple different alien races are visiting Argentina , or it could mean that our visitors have a variety of different craft .
Also notable , however , is the fact that the word " phantom " comes up a lot .
So the alien visitors could actually be ghosts .

Solving a 60 - year - old mystery , researchers have concluded that new flu strains emerge in eastern and southeastern Asia , move to Europe and North America six to nine months later , then travel to South America where they disappear forever .
The new findings should help researchers pick the correct flu strains for each year ’s vaccine , a process that must be carried out a year ahead of time and that is now analogous to making a long - term weather forecast supported by only limited data .
The group charged with making the decisions about vaccines has been right about 80 % of the time , said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , and the new findings should lead to an even higher success rate .
“ If we have competing candidates , this will help to pick which virus should go in a vaccine , ” added Dr. Arnold S. Monto , an epidemiologist and flu specialist at the University of Michigan .

Influenza strikes up to 15 % of the world ’s population each year , killing , on average , about 250,000 to 500,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .
About 300 million people annually are protected by an influenza vaccine , but producing the vaccine is something of a crapshoot because its ingredients are typically chosen nearly a year before the flu season to allow time for production .
The problem is that the flu virus mutates rapidly , particularly the gene for a surface protein called hemagglutinin that plays a key role in interacting with the human immune system .
Those mutations reduce the efficacy of the immune response to the virus , limiting vaccine protection .
For more than a half a century , researchers have debated where these mutations occur .
One idea , discredited only about a year ago , suggested that a background infection of the virus remained in each country outside the flu season , allowing mutations to occur .
Other hypotheses were that the virus migrated back and forth between the northern and southern hemispheres following the seasons , that the viruses circulated continuously in the tropics , or that new mutations occurred in China and spread to the rest of the world from there .
Advertisement
The new results , appearing today in the journal Nature and Friday in Science , suggest that there is a little bit of truth in each of those scenarios .
In the Science paper , an international team led by geneticists Colin A. Russell and Derek J. Smith of the University of Cambridge studied more than 13,000 samples of influenza A virus collected on six continents between 2002 and 2007 .
They studied physical differences in the hemagglutinin molecules on the surfaces of the viruses by measuring how strongly each one bound to an antibody .
They also determined the DNA sequence of the hemagglutinin gene for about 10 % of the viruses .
The team found that once the viruses leave Asia , they do n’t change much and rarely return .
The areas outside Asia are “ evolutionary graveyards , ” Russell said .

In the Nature report , biologist Edward Holmes of Pennsylvania State University and his colleagues sequenced the entire genome of 1,302 influenza A viruses collected over a 12 - year period .
Holmes ’ results were very similar to Russell ’s findings .
Holmes ’ team was able to conclude that the viral mutations originated in only one area in the tropics but could not pinpoint the area .
Several factors contribute to Asia ’s role in the mutations .
While flu season in the Western world typically occurs in winter , flu season in Asia generally is the rainy season .
Because of the wide geographic variations in the region , there is generally a rainy season somewhere , allowing the viruses to propagate continuously .
Add to that the high population density , and the conditions are ripe for a high transmission rate and accompanying mutations .

The large rate of air travel from Asia to Europe and North America then carries the mutated viruses to a new environment where there is little resistance to them .
Much less direct traffic occurs between Southeast Asia and South America , so the virus must travel via North America , delaying its passage .
Some of the virus is undoubtedly carried back to Asia via air travel , Smith said , but by that time widespread immunity to it has built up in the population and it cannot gain a foothold .
Although the new information will be useful in producing vaccines , Monto said , even more important is the proliferation of new influenza monitoring stations throughout Asia in response to fears of a bird flu pandemic .
Too often , he said , researchers have known which strain should be included in a vaccine but have not been able to obtain a good isolate of the virus .
The new monitoring stations should be able to provide those strains , he said .

The UN says Mr Ban is too busy to attend the Olympics opening UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will not attend the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics , an aide has said .
The decision was due to " schedule issues " and had been made months ago , said UN spokeswoman , Marie Mukabe .
Meanwhile , Buenos Aires is braced for Friday 's Olympic torch relay after anti-China protests in other cities .
Kenyan Nobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai has withdrawn from the torch relay 's Tanzanian leg , due to concerns over human rights in China .
The BBC's Laura Trevelyan said the UN was anxious not to give the impression that Mr Ban 's absence was a boycott of the Games .
Ms Mukabe said Mr Ban " had conveyed to the [ Chinese ] government some months ago that he may not be in a position to accept the invitation to attend this important event due to schedule issues " .
This means the decision was made before violent anti-Beijing protests in and around Tibet last month that were suppressed by a heavy security presence .
Security cocoon
The Olympic flame is being relayed around the world through 20 countries before it arrives in Beijing in August for the Games ' opening ceremony .
The torch 's progress has been beset by protests - especially on the London , Paris and San Francisco legs of its tour .
Several thousand police and other guards are to line the planned 13 km ( eight mile ) route of the torch through Buenos Aires .
Map of planned world torch relay route Argentine activists say their protests will be peaceful but have promised " surprises " .
Groups upset over China 's human rights record have been trying to put pressure on Beijing as it readies to host the Olympics for the first time .
The protests along the international torch route have meant that torch - bearers have been immersed in a cocoon of security , surrounded by dozens of police officers and Chinese guards in blue track - suits .
In Paris , the torch had to be extinguished three times because of safety concerns , while in London there were 37 arrests .
The US stage of the torch relay in San Francisco on Wednesday passed off amid confusion and tight security .
' Houdini torch ' relay disappoints
In pictures : San Francisco relay Media coverage : China vs West The Dalai Lama - who many Tibetans regard as their spiritual leader - said on Thursday that China deserved to host the Games , but that protesters had the right to express themselves in non-violent ways .
The president of the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , Jacques Rogge , said on Thursday that anti-China protests had created a " crisis " but that the Games in Beijing would " rebound " .
He also urged China to respect its " moral engagement " to improve human rights ahead of the Games .
China said it hoped the IOC would steer clear of what it called " irrelevant political factors " .
Beijing says
Tibet is an integral part of China and what happens there is an internal matter .
After its run through Buenos Aires , the torch will be flown to Tanzania for the next stage of its journey .
2004 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai told Kenyan TV that she was pulling out of that leg of the relay over concern about " the events that have been unfolding in Tibet for a very long time " .
She said she still supported China hosting the Games , but wanted " to see a country that is challenged , [ that ] is addressing those challenges to the betterment of the environment and the world in general . "

During yesterday ’s keynote Apple presented new iPods that got all Apple fans excited , including us .
New versions of Shuffle , Nano and Classic and the totally new iPod Touch which is basically the iPhone without the phone part .
As always when Apple introduces new products they take down their online Apple Store while they do the updates .
All that we who want to see or order the new hardware can do is wait and eagerly push reload .
But hold on .
Why keep pushing reload ?
With Mr Uptime we could just add a watch on the temporary “ We ’ll be back soon ” page and as soon as Apple Store was back up , we were told of it and the website loaded automatically in a Firefox tab .
To do this we simply added a watch to check if the contact text on the web page above had been removed .
It ’s as simple as selecting the text that should not be present on the page and then choose “ Text string should not exist on page ” in the Mr Uptime menu when you right click the page .
Pretty smooth . 🙂
God love him , John Edwards smacks the media who insist on making the Democratic presidential race a two person one and treating him as if he does n't exist :
You go , John !
In related news , Edwards had taken jabs at Obama and Clinton ( maybe then the press will mention him , you think ? ) but set his most pointed comments to Bill " There are no homeless vets " O'Reilly :
Tonight , 200,000 brave veterans will be homeless , and they will sleep in shelters , on the streets , under bridges , and on grates - and Bill O'Reilly does n't think there is a problem .
For someone who spends a lot of time shouting about patriotism , you would think he would be outraged by the treatment of our homeless veterans .
How many more will it take before we wake up and solve this crisis ?
While George Bush and Bill O'Reilly continue to ignore our homeless veterans , the American people , whether we are Democrats , Republicans , or Independents , must speak out and stand up for those who have stood up for us .
We must do everything we can to solve this terrible problem - and we must begin by reaching out to these men and women who are suffering - not pretending they do not exist .
After our veterans have served our country honorably , is n't one homeless veteran one too many ?
While there is a certain grand mystery to some aspects of human behavior , others can be easily explained .

The neocons may yet get their war on Iran .
Ever since President Nouri al - Maliki ordered the attacks in Basra on the Mahdi Army , Gen. David Petraeus has been laying the predicate for U.S. air strikes on Iran and a wider war in the Middle East .
Iran , Petraeus told the Senate Armed Services Committee , has “ fueled the recent violence in a particularly damaging way through its lethal support of the special groups . ”
These “ special groups ” are “ funded , trained , armed and directed by Iran ’s Quds Force with help from Lebanese Hezbollah .
It was these groups that launched Iranian rockets and mortar rounds at Iraq ’s seat of government ( the Green Zone ) … causing loss of innocent life and fear in the capital . ”
Is the Iranian government aware of this — and behind it ?
“ President Ahmadinejad and other Iranian leaders ” promised to end their “ support for the special groups , ” said the general , but the “ nefarious activities of the Quds force have continued . ”
Are Iranians then murdering Americans , asked Joe Lieberman :
“ Is it fair to say that the Iranian - backed special groups in Iraq are responsible for the murder of hundreds of American soldiers and thousands of Iraqi soldiers and civilians ? ”
“ It certainly is . …
That is correct , ” said Petraeus .
The following day , Petraeus told the House Armed Services Committee , “ Unchecked , the ‘ special groups ’ pose the greatest long - term threat to the viability of a democratic Iraq . ”
Translation : The United States is now fighting the proxies of Iran for the future of Iraq .
The general ’s testimony is forcing Bush ’s hand , for consider the question it logically raises :
If the Quds Force and Hezbollah , both designated as terrorist organizations , are arming , training and directing “ special groups ” to “ murder ” Americans , and rocket and mortar the Green Zone to kill our diplomats , and they now represent the No. 1 threat to a free Iraq , why has Bush failed to neutralize these base camps of terror and aggression ?
Hence , be not surprised if President Bush appears before the TV cameras , one day soon , to declare :
“ My commanding general in Iraq , David Petraeus , has told me that Iran , with the knowledge of President Ahmadinejad , has become a privileged sanctuary for two terrorist organizations — Hezbollah and the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard — to train , arm and direct terrorist attacks on U.S. and coalition forces , despite repeated promises to halt this murderous practice .
“ I have therefore directed U.S. air and naval forces to begin air strikes on these base camps of terror .
Our attacks will continue until the Iranian attacks cease . ”
Because of the failures of a Democratic Congress elected to end the war , Bush can now make a compelling case that he would be acting fully within his authority as commander in chief .
In early 2007 , Nancy Pelosi pulled down a resolution that would have denied Bush the authority to attack Iran without congressional approval .
In September , both Houses passed the Kyl - Lieberman resolution designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization .
Courtesy of Congress , Bush thus has a blank check for war on Iran .
And the signs are growing that he intends to fill it in and cash it .
Israel has been hurling invective at Iran and conducting security drills to prepare its population for rocket barrages worse than those Hezbollah delivered in the Lebanon War .
Adm. William “ Fox ” Fallon , the Central Command head who opposed war with Iran , has been removed .
Hamas and Hezbollah have been stocking up on Qassam and Katyusha rockets .
Vice President Cheney has lately toured Arab capitals .
And President Ahmadinejad just made international headlines by declaring that Tehran will begin installing 6,000 advanced centrifuges to accelerate Iran ’s enrichment of uranium .
This is Bush ’s last chance to strike and , when Iran responds , to effect its nuclear castration .
Are Bush and Cheney likely to pass up this last chance to destroy Iran ’s nuclear facilities and effect the election of John McCain ?
For any attack on Iran ’s “ terrorist bases ” would rally the GOP and drive a wedge between Obama and Hillary .
Indeed , Sen. Clinton , who voted to declare Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization , could hardly denounce Bush for ordering air strikes on the Revolutionary Guards ’ Quds Force , when Petraeus testified , in her presence , that it is behind the serial murder of U.S. soldiers .
The Iranians may sense what is afoot .
For Tehran helped broker the truce in the Maliki - Sadr clash in Basra , and has called for a halt to the mortar and rocket attacks on the Green Zone .
With a friendly regime in Baghdad that rolled out the red carpet for Ahmadinejad , Iran has nothing to gain by war .
Already , it is the big winner from the U.S. wars that took down Tehran ’s Taliban enemies , decimated its al - Qaida enemies and destroyed its Sunni enemies , Saddam and his Baath Party .
No , it is not Iran that wants a war with the United States .
It is the United States that has reasons to want a short , sharp war with Iran .
British soldiers breached the human rights of an Iraqi who died while in UK custody in Basra more than four years ago , the defence secretary , Des Browne , said today .
Baha Mousa , a hotel receptionist , suffered 93 injuries and died screaming in custody , witness statements read to the high court said .
Browne said the Ministry of Defence would also admit to violating the rights of eight other Iraqi men in September 2003 at a high court hearing due to take place on Friday .
Over the last few months , the court has heard harrowing accounts of the treatment of Iraqis by British troops in Basra .
Mousa was one of several men seized from a hotel when it was raided , and weapons were recovered , in 2003 .
The men - all of whom were tortured - were detained under suspicion of being insurgents .
At times , some were hooded - a practice banned by the British government in 1972 .
In a written statement , Browne said the government would admit " substantive breaches " of the parts of the European convention on human rights that protect the right to life and prohibit torture .
The armed forces minister , Bob Ainsworth , said " acts of abuse " had been carried out by a " very small minority " of British troops .
" I deeply regret the actions ... and I offer my sincere apologies and sympathy to the family of Baha Mousa and the other eight Iraqi detainees , " Ainsworth added .
He said " all but a handful " of the more than 120,000 British troops who have served in Iraq had conducted themselves " to the highest standards " .
" But this does not excuse that , during 2003 and 2004 , a very small minority committed acts of abuse , and we condemn their actions , " he added .
Seven members of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment , including the commander of the 1st battalion , had faced the most expensive court martial in British history .
All were eventually acquitted of negligence and abuse after an investigation that cost more than £ 20 m and took over three years .
A six - month military trial at the Bulford court martial centre , in Wiltshire , involved 100 witnesses , including eight Iraqis .
Corporal Donald Payne , 35 , became the first British serviceman to admit a war crime after pleading guilty to the inhumane treatment of Iraqi prisoners .
He was jailed for a year .
Much of the hearing rested on whether headquarters staff at 19 Mechanised Brigade had sanctioned the use of what British troops call " conditioning " .
The process involves the hooding , handcuffing and placing of terrorist suspects into stress positions , as well as depriving them of sleep , in order to make them more likely to answer questions .
Shami Chakrabarti , the director of the human rights group Liberty , said Mousa was " the Stephen Lawrence of Iraq " .
" A direct legal and moral consequence of today 's admission that Mousa and others were unlawfully tortured and killed in British custody is that there must be a wholesale independent inquiry into what went wrong , " she said .
" British soldiers should never be sent into post - conflict situations without adequate training and advice . "
Lawyers for the detainees said the soldiers ' actions were in breach of both the Geneva convention and the Human Rights Act .
Their demands for damages run into six figures , and today 's MoD announcement opens the door to unlimited compensation pay - outs to Mousa 's family and the eight other men .

Praise or cash ?
Your brain does n't care
Paying people a compliment appears to activate the same reward centre in the brain as paying them cash , Japanese researchers say .
They say their study , published in the journal Neuron , offers scientific support for the long - held assumption that people get a psychological boost from having a good reputation .
" We found that these seemingly different kinds of rewards , a good reputation versus money , are biologically coded by the same neural structure , the striatum , " says Dr Norihiro Sadato of Japan 's National Institute for Physiological Sciences in Okazaki .
" This provides the biological basis of our everyday experience that personal reputation is felt as rewards , " Sadato says .
Sadato's team studied 19 healthy people using a brain imaging technique known as functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI .
In one set of experiments , people played a gambling game in which they were told one of three cards would yield a payout .
The researchers then monitored the brain activity triggered when the subjects received a cash reward .
In a second set of experiments , people were told they were being evaluated by strangers based on information from a personality questionnaire and a video they had made .
The researchers then monitored reactions to these staged evaluations , including when the subjects thought strangers had paid them a compliment .
Both kinds of rewards triggered activity in a reward - related area of the brain .
Sadato says the finding represents an important first step toward explaining complex human social behaviours such as altruism .
The fact that the social reward is biologically coded suggests that " the need to belong ... is essential for humans " , says Sadato .
Social standing
A similar study in the same journal by Dr Caroline Zink of the US National Institute of Mental Health and colleagues found the same brain region was active when people were processing information about social status .
They say the finding might have implications on how social standing affects behaviour and health .
The researchers created an artificial social hierarchy in which 72 participants played an interactive computer game for money .
Participants were assigned a social status they were told was based on their playing skill .
Researchers monitored their brain activity as the participants were shown pictures of inferior and superior players who were supposedly playing the game in different rooms .
Zink and colleagues saw increased activity in the brain 's reward centre when people won money or saw their social standing rise .
" The processing of hierarchical information seems to be hard - wired ... underscoring how important it is for us , " Zink says .

MenAreBetterThanWomen.com reached 200,000 visitors early this morning , so I thought I would mark the occasion by posting a very special top ten list of the top ten ways in which men are better than women .
Naturally as a man the moment I thought of an idea I set to work implementing it — in this case by writing it .
It would have been exactly the same if my idea had been the wheel or the Hoover Dam .
That ’s because I ’m a man and instead of taking shit from the world around me , I can shove shit right back into it as well .
Dick ’s Top Ten Reasons MenAreBetterThanWomen.com
10 . Men do not have Tourette Syndrome
I believe all women suffer from a mild and extremely localized form of Tourette Syndrome .
The afflicted organ ?
Their tongues .
That ’s why women cannot shut their fucking mouths for ten seconds while adults are speaking around them .
Their tongues are battling around in their mouths like drunken Vipers .
9 . Men are not sponges
Women are social chameleons — or better yet : social vampires .
Women walk into a situation and before you know it they ’ve completely changed their wardrobe and mannerisms as if they ’ve joined a fucking cult .
Men are not sheep .
Everyone knows the word for a female sheep is ewe , but what about the male word ?
There is n’t one because sheep is something men are not .
8. Women are racists
Women ’s entire lives and social circles are based around hatred .
Do they hate their boyfriends ?
Do they hate their wardrobe ?
Do they hate each other ?
Yes , yes and fuck definitely .
Men do n’t go in for that silly sort of nonsense .
If we ’re dissatisfied , we pick up and move out .
Or we take our mighty man muscles and lift fucking mountains so the world looks exactly the way we want it to .
Men do more world changing before 9:00 AM than any woman ever has done in her whole life .
7 . Men live less than women
The last thing a society needs is a bunch of non-contributing members laying around and sucking all the juice from the young .
Men know this so they blast off from birth like shooting man stars — burning out ten years faster , but setting the whole night ablaze with manness .
Women just kind of lie around like big fat pigs in big fat puddles of shit .
Congratulations women .
You really earned those rights !
6 . Men write illegibly
Writing is stupid and an ineffective way to communicate .
Men know this so they do n’t give a shit about handwriting things with big hoops and loops and squiggles and shit so aliens can read notes about remembering to pick up your birth control pills after 6th period from space .
5. Jesus was a man
Whether or not you believe in Jesus , there is one fact you ca n’t argue with : he was a man .
No religion anywhere has ever put a woman in charge of shit .
That ’s called dogma — man-dogma — and it means men are better than women .
4 . Men wear watches
Do you know why men wear watches ?
It ’s because there ’s a limited amount of time in the day and men need to know how much of it there is so they can efficiently allocate their man ass kicking for the day .
Women do n’t wear watches ; they wear bracelets .
Women wearing bracelets is like dropping a bus of retarded kids off in front of a taffy pulling machine .
They can just stare for hours and never get bored .
A watch says , ‘ Get up and go !
Move your man ass and take care of your fucking man business !’
That ’s why 60 minutes uses a ticking watch for its theme song .
‘ Important shit is going down and we ’re about to talk about it in a fucking fastidious manner , so get the fuck ready , ’ says a ticking watch .
A bracelet says , ‘ You ’re most likely ugly , but look at how much money you ’re worth ! ’
What a joke .
3 . Boys destroy things
The only thing that has ever lifted our species out of the trees where we came from is our ability to destroy .
Take paper : the cornerstone of the modern world .
That was invented because man wanted to destroy trees and beat them into pulp .
How about nuclear power ?
Men invented that too .
Men are natural destructors .

2. Marriage is stupid
Marriage is 100 % the fault of women .
It was invented by men though !
Did you know that ?
Marriage was invented because women were too busy whoring it out to fuck the only the guy who was paying their rent and feeding their fat asses French bon-bons every day .
Men invented marriage as a way of telling women who they could and could n’t fuck .
Like everything else men have ever invented , it completely worked and worked way better than any man thought it would .
Women became so indoctrinated by the man-invention of marriage that they ’re fucking obsessed with it .
Marriage is still stupid .
It ’s a stupid game invented to entertain stupid minds and to teach basic lessons of fidelity that even invertebrates are born with .
1 . Men have penises
When it comes to being a man , being quick at identifying problems is tantamount to fixing them .
In fact it ’s tantamount - ier .
Having a penis — in other words looking like a man and having man parts — is a man ’s way of telling other men , ‘ Hey .
Look at me .
I ’m a man .
I wo n’t fuck up whatever it is that you ’re trying to do .
If you need some help , maybe ask me and I ’ll see if I can lend a man-hand .
It ’s the least I could do to be fucking courteous . ’
Men Are Better Than Women .

Young , lonely and struggling to make a mark .
The U.S. military Sunday presented a profile of foreign fighters , who are blamed for about 90 % of the suicide bombings that have claimed thousands of lives in Iraq .
It was based on interrogations of 48 men captured by U.S. - led forces here in the last four months , Navy Rear Adm.
Gregory Smith told reporters at a briefing inside Baghdad ’s fortified Green Zone .
Smith said most militants were single men in their late teens and early 20s recruited by Al Qaeda in Iraq , a largely homegrown Sunni Arab militant group that the U.S. military says is led by foreigners .
They typically come from large , lower - income families in which they struggled to be noticed .
“ Most of these young men wanted to make an impression , but paradoxically they did not tell their families they were going off to Iraq to fight for Al Qaeda out of fear of disapproval , ” said Smith , a U.S. military spokesman .
Smith ’s presentation comes at a time when the number of high - profile suicide attacks in Iraq has inched up , many of them carried out by bombers with explosives strapped to their waists .
U.S. officers stress that the number of attacks overall remains down since the military finished sending an additional 28,500 troops to Iraq in June .
But Smith acknowledged that a modest rise in attacks using explosives vests , including 18 in February , was troubling .
“ It is a difficult target to stop , and the only effective way is to take down the networks that feed this type of terrorism , ” he said .
In the latest such attack , a man blew himself up Sunday in front of a Kurdish political party office in the northern city of Mosul , injuring a guard and six civilians , police said .
Two policemen were injured by a roadside bomb on their way to the scene , police said .
Fighters also have started to wear explosives vests and blow themselves up when captured , Smith said , a tactic previously used only by senior leadership .
The interviews conducted with detainees are helping U.S. forces to understand the backgrounds , motivations and recruitment of foreign fighters .
Smith said most were from the Middle East and North Africa , including about 40 % from Saudi Arabia .
More than half of the approximately 240 foreign fighters in U.S. custody come from Saudi Arabia , Egypt and Syria , according to figures provided separately by the military .
Smaller numbers were recruited in Jordan , Sudan , Libya , Yemen , Kuwait , Tunisia , Morocco and Algeria .
In addition , several hundred foreign fighters are in Iraqi custody .
Most described their upbringing as religious but not extremist , Smith said .
Many said their fathers were harsh and often abusive .
Most reported little or no previous military experience .
Before they were recruited , many worked as taxi drivers , construction workers and in other low - paying jobs .
Others were students .
Their recruiters preyed on their desire for recognition , acceptance and friendship , Smith said .
Many detainees told their interrogators that they were first approached at their mosques .
Others were approached at work and invited to attend discussions at the mosque .
These conversations would begin as a harmless discussion about Islam that over several weeks would shift to the war against U.S. - led forces in Iraq , he said .
The recruits were often shown videos of Americans purportedly abusing Iraqis and were urged to help avenge the mistreatment by killing Americans , Smith said .
Insurgent strikes against U.S. forces also were shown .
Once they agreed to join the fight , most of the young men were flown to Syria and then smuggled into Iraq by road , he said .
The facilitators who met them in Syria often entertained them at nightclubs and bars during the months it sometimes took to get them to Iraq , Smith said .
But when they reached Iraq , those destined for suicide missions were sequestered in safe houses with copies of the Koran and few other amenities .
They complained that their Iraqi handlers looked down on foreigners , did not give them enough food and treated them harshly , Smith said .
Some spoke of their disillusionment on discovering that most of the attacks carried out by insurgents were directed against the Iraqi people rather than U.S. forces .
“ Again and again , we heard this reality bothered the recruits , ” Smith said .
“ They had not come here to kill Iraqi civilians .
. . .
They felt misled . ”
Eventually , most just wanted to go home , he said .
But their handlers had their passports and their money , so they felt trapped .
All 48 fighters interviewed by U.S. - led forces were men , but a growing number of suicide attacks have been conducted by Iraqi women .
U.S. officers have suggested that the insurgents are using women because they attract less attention .
The insurgents may also be having difficulties recruiting foreign volunteers .
About 120 foreign fighters were entering Iraq each month at the peak of the influx in mid-2007 , but that figure has dropped to about 40 to 50 , Smith said .

WINSTON - SALEM , N.C.  Senator Barack Obama broke forcefully on Tuesday with his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. , in an effort to curtail a drama of race , values , patriotism and betrayal that has enveloped his presidential candidacy at a critical juncture .
At a news conference here , Mr. Obama denounced remarks Mr. Wright made in a series of televised appearances over the last several days .
In the appearances , Mr. Wright has suggested that the United States was attacked because it engaged in terrorism on other people and that the government was capable of having used the AIDS virus to commit genocide against minorities .
His remarks also cast Louis Farrakhan , the leader of the Nation of Islam , in a positive light .
In tones sharply different from those Mr. Obama used on Monday , when he blamed the news media and his rivals for focusing on Mr. Wright , and far harsher than those he used in his speech on race in Philadelphia last month , Mr. Obama tried to cut all his ties to  and to discredit  Mr. Wright , the man who presided at Mr. Obama ’s wedding and baptized his two daughters .
“ His comments were not only divisive and destructive , but I believe that they end up giving comfort to those who prey on hate , and I believe that they do not portray accurately the perspective of the black church , ” Mr. Obama said , his voice welling with anger .
“ They certainly do n’t portray accurately my values and beliefs . ”

Scott , a man who loves both fruit flavored sugar cubes and Star Wars , cast a Boba Fett PEZ dispenser in bronze .
I made this using the lost wax casting process with an organic burnout .
The material is silicon bronze .
The original sleeve for the Pez broke , so I cannibalize dparts from another dispenser : Simba from the Lion King .
The hole in the body resulted from an incomplete casting of the thin part ; probably could have had better sprue placement .
I like the results , though .
The replacement sleeve was modified for the " battle scar " effect , revealing the Pez .
Finishing was minimal , with a pretty standard bronze patina .
Great job , Scott .
And you were right about the battle scar , that turned out pretty awesome .
Now you 'll always know when you 're running low on on your sugar fix .

What depressed the cavemen ?
It may strike us as a particularly modern malaise for a time - poor , fast - paced society but a new reappraisal of depression suggests it has always been around .
A leading psychiatrist says that depression is not a human defect at all , but a defence mechanism that in its mild and moderate forms can force a healthy reassessment of personal circumstances .
Dr Paul Keedwell , an expert on mood disorders at the Institute of Psychiatry , King 's College London , argues all people are vulnerable to depression in the face of stress to varying degrees , and always have been .
The fact it has survived so long - and not been eradicated by evolution - indicates it has helped the human race become stronger .
FAMOUS DEPRESSIVES
Robbie Williams , Sir Elton John , Winston Churchill and Stephen Fry ( pictured ) Writers Tennessee Williams , Sylvia Plath , Evelyn Waugh and Ernest Hemingway Artists Paul Gauguin , Vincent Van Gogh , Edgar Degas , William Blake Performers Caroline Ahern , Ewan McGregor , Morrissey
" I have received e-mails from ex-sufferers saying in retrospect it probably did help them because they changed direction , a new career for example , and as a result they 're more content day - to - day than before the depression . "
One woman left an abusive relationship and moved on , he says , and might not have done if depression had not provided the necessary introspection .
Similarly , unrealistic expectations are revised when depression sparks a more humble reassessment of strengths and weaknesses .
In Britain one in four men and one in five women are estimated to suffer depression during their lifetime , and one in 20 suffers it at any one time .
Creativity
Dame Kelly Holmes has spoken in the past about how the depression she suffered in 2003 made her a stronger person , a year before her double - gold performance at the Olympics .
Alastair Campbell has said it was the making of him .
But there are other qualities depression generates , not just resilience , says Dr Keedwell , author of How Sadness Survived .
" Psychological unease can generate creative work and the rebirth after depression brings a new love affair with life . "
Aristotle believed depression to be of great value because of the insights it could bring .
There is also an increased empathy in people who have or have had depression , he says , because they become more attuned to other people 's suffering .
Do n't beat yourself up about being depressed , in most cases it will run its course
Dr Paul Keedwell
What is depression ?
Some remote communities are more aware of it .
The Banda tribe in Uganda calls it " illness of thought " and those affected are allowed time out from the group , a concession not extended to many with the condition in the UK .
The high and rising incidence in the UK and US - compared to countries like Brazil and Mexico - could be due to the breakdown of family bonds and the fragmentation of society .
And compared to past decades , there are increased expectations of success .
SEVERE DEPRESSION
Dr Keedwell says his theory does not cover severe depression , which is an illness accompanied by a catatonic lack of energy , cannot be worked through and requires the intervention of a GP
" Do n't beat yourself up about being depressed , in most cases it will run its course provided you take yourself out of the situation that caused it .
" I know that 's an easy and glib thing to say , because I 'm not a single mum living 12 floors up in a high - rise block .
Sometimes it 's not easy to escape but that 's the fault of society , not the fault of depression . "
GWB , not GDP
Politicians have recognised this and happiness is a word that has recently entered the political debate on both sides , with David Cameron saying that improving society 's sense of well - being is one of the central political challenges of the times - GWB ( general well - being ) and not GDP ( gross domestic product ) .
A happiness agenda is a laudable aim but one that is meaningless , says Phillip Hodson , a fellow of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy , because happiness is not something you can buy in Tesco .
" Everybody 's life is full of occasional misery and we are going to suffer .
All life ends in grief , unless you are lucky and you and your loved ones all die simultaneously in some plane crash .
" So I applaud the government for trying but I think the happiness agenda can be simplistic .
You ca n't legislate for happiness . "
Happier days ?
" You would never ask for it or want it this way .
But people who work through it , with a professional or with friends and family , for those people who have an awful journey , they are better travellers . "
But identifying the cause and addressing it is easier said than done , says Stuart Summerfield , 68 , from Chesterfield , who has suffered from depression throughout his adult life .
Although he believes he has a genetic predisposition to it , he blames its severity on his possessive mother .
She never acknowledged his illness and made it difficult for him to seek help , but her death in 1999 relieved him of caring duties and sparked a recovery .
He is now involved in running a self - help group .
Superman
" I do n't think that knowing the cause is always the route out .
Changing circumstances is a major part of it but it's not always something you can change .
Sometimes the big problem is admitting what the situation is . "
He concedes it has helped him in some ways because he has a new appreciation of life .
" They say adversity makes you stronger , so I should be Superman by now . "
But it is an " awful journey " and not a price worth paying for longer - term gain .
Depression is bad , really bad .
I suffered relationship and career breakdown 12 months ago with no one around me to help .
I lost 20 kgs in 2007 , it was a completely wasted year for me .
But once everything went away , I realised I 'm much healthier and stronger now .
Maybe the main point of the article is valid , some of us do come stronger in the other side .
The whole thing made me reassess my life , and career opportunities .
I can see things in a different light now .
I 'm much happier and 10 times more determined to make the most of my life without stressing myself .
Maybe I have the Kelly Holmes effect ( resilience ) .

I have suffered with severe depression for around 10 years ( I am in my early 20s now ) and can honestly say that despite having some horrible dark moments that almost killed me , it has had a positive affect on my life .
I had therapy , counselling and medication , which in combination helped me .
I am now an occupational therapist , working in mental health .
I have the chance to help people out of their own darkness and empower people to be as independent as possible .
For me this is an amazing , positive outcome after years , and sometimes even now , of suffering from depression .
I found this article refreshing , and it relates to my own beliefs ; things happen for a reason .
Anon , Sussex
I have lived with depression on and off for many years and now see it as a positive experience .
I 'm more attuned to my stress levels and have learned effective coping methods to deal with difficult situations .
I 'm more appreciative of the kindness of others and more empathetic to their needs and moods .
My experiences with depression have made me less judgemental and I now lead a more balanced life .
From working a forty hour week and owning my own home , I now choose to live in a small rented apartment , not drive a car and have a far less " affluent " lifestyle , which allows me to work part time and use my " free " time for volunteering and family & friends .
Depression is n't something I 'd recommend but it can certainly be a path to better living habits and a higher quality of life appreciation , as long as the correct therapy is used .
A combination of medication and talking therapy worked for me .
Val , Birmingham
I suffered with depression for years without even realising , until I met my fiance who made me realise I have a problem and seek help .
I agree that the big problem is admitting what the situation is ; once I admitted to myself I had a problem I was able to confront it and I am now a new person with so much more confidence ... thanks to my fiance !
Hannah , South London
I suffered a breakdown after the death of my father two years ago .
I had thought that this was my first experience of depression but looking back with the knowledge I have now I believe that I 've had episodes throughout my life .
I 'm now really well and put my recovery down to rest , medication , diet and a wonderful support network .
My GP once said that people often emerge from ' the dark place ' that is depression with a great deal of emotional knowledge and empathy .
She was right !
Having a breakdown has changed my life for the better .
I now look at the world with new eyes , I 've become a much more compassionate and patient person and feel so much the better for it .
Depression truly can help you clarify what is important .
If you have n't already read it I suggest Richard Carlson 's ' Do n't sweat the small stuff ' .
True wisdom in a world where affluenza is making many ill and overshadowing what is truly important for a happy and contented life .

As someone who has suffered from depression for many years and have only just recently tried to seek any form of help for it I find it really difficult to see " the other side " at the moment , I can not see how there will be a positive to come from going through this .
Assuming I make it through this , I cant imagine being able to look back on these years and think " oh , I 'm glad I went through that because now I can / am .... " etc..
Rob , Bristol , UK
To Rob from Bristol , you may not see the other side at the present , but believe me , it will get better .
It 's never easy when you 're going through the " dark times " , please hang in there as things will improve .
I fell into a deep depression two years ago when the love of my life died .
I thought my life was meaningless and I was convinced I would die too .
More importantly , I wanted to die .
I thought at my age ( 44 ) how could I start again ?
I lost my home and now can't afford a place of my own but I 've learnt life is much more than our material possessions and with help I 'm now learning to take each day at a time .
Chin up Rob , it will get better .
Flora , London
I suffered depression during a very difficult period of my life .
My friends and family supported me and I have been able to recover .
I really agree that you need to take yourself out of the situation that caused it before you can move on .
I have done exactly that and my life has improved ennormously .
Depression is a human reaction to help us get our lives back on track .
It is hard to believe that things will get better when you depressed but they do - time is the most important healer .
Clare Prior , Southsea
When you stop hitting your hand with a hammer it feels good .
This does n't mean that hitting your hand with a hammer it good for you .

My depression was hormonal when I was a teenager and I would n't wish it on my worst enemy .
I just had to wait until my hormones settled down .

Friends : Sharon Bush ( left ) with Jack Worthington 's sister , Nancy
The Texas tycoon who claims to be John F Kennedy 's secret love child had an affair with President Bush 's sister - in - law , The Mail on Sunday can reveal .
New York socialite Sharon Bush says she conducted a romance with financier Jack Worthington , 47 , after the break - up of her marriage to Neil Bush , the US President 's multi-millionaire brother .
Sceptics have derided Mr Worthington as a " wacko " or an opportunist for his extraordinary claim about his parentage .
But Mrs Bush – who is the mother of supermodel Lauren Bush – strongly defended him .
She says he was brought up to believe his father was the respected Houston school administrator to whom his mother was married for 47 years .
But then his mother allegedly told him his real father was America 's assassinated 35th President , to whom Mrs Bush says he bears a " stunning " physical resemblance .
" When his mother gave him the information , just a few years ago , he was shell - shocked , " Mrs Bush said .
" He is a fine man , highly ethical , a man of high integrity .
" He only wants to know the truth . "
Mrs Bush , 55 , said she dated Mr Worthington following her acrimonious divorce in April 2003 from Neil Bush , 53 .
The couple had been married for 23 years .

Family resemblance ? : Jack Worthington ( left ) and John F Kennedy
President Kennedy , who was gunned down in Dallas in November 1963 , regularly cheated on his wife , Jackie .
His conquests are known to have included Marilyn Monroe .
There is no public record of him ever meeting Mr Worthington 's mother , who is identified in Texas birth archives as Mary Evelyn Bibb .
Critics have suggested her son is either a " fantasist " or a fortune - seeker who hopes to make a financial killing from his story .
Supermodel : Sharon Bush 's daughter , Lauren
However , Mrs Bush said he had been determined to keep his quest for a Kennedy DNA sample , which he hopes will substantiate his claims , in " complete confidence " .
A reporter for Vanity Fair magazine , which has been preparing an article about his claims , allegedly leaked his name to the media .
Mr Worthington contends that he is infuriated by his new notoriety .
As a successful mergers and acquisitions expert , who worked for major American companies before founding an internet banking firm , he insists he has no motive to lie .
" It 's outrageous , " he said .
" Vanity Fair approached me .
" They had to woo me for over six months to work with them on their story , and I co-operated only on their assurances that my anonymity would be protected . "
His mother , who was widowed last year , still lives in his family 's impressive house in an affluent district of Houston .
She did not respond to repeated requests for comment .
The Mail on Sunday also attempted to interview Mr Worthington 's sister , Nancy – who has been photographed with Sharon Bush on the US social circuit – but police outside her home refused to allow us to approach her .
Neighbours and friends of the twice - divorced businessman were sharply divided in their opinions .
Ken Lindsay , who lives across the street from Mr Worthington 's mother , said : " The claims come as a shock because his mother is not that type of woman at all .
" She and her husband were always very good , friendly and caring neighbours right up until the time he died last year , and I have the utmost respect for her .
" She was so loyal and good to her husband throughout his decline in health .
Everything was very normal . "
However , Mr Worthington 's former business partner , Doug Vandermotter , took his side .
He said : " I met his mother .
She seemed like a normal , older woman .
" She never mentioned JFK and nor did Jack , so this has all come from out of the blue .
" It sounds kind of wild , but Jack is not a fantasy artist .
" I do n't think he'd say he believes he is Kennedy 's child unless he believed it . "
There have been many articles written on the subject of why businesses fail , and most of them point to the same reasons , such as :
Inadequate funding
Bad location
Lack of a well thought - out business plan
Poor execution
Bad management
Expanding too quickly
Insufficient marketing or promotion
Inability to adapt to a changing marketplace
Failure to keep overhead costs low
Underestimating competitors
These reasons are widespread and no doubt cause many businesses to fail .
However , the reason for a company ’s failure is not always something so obvious .
Below are 6 lesser - known reasons why a business might fail .
Why do these reasons remain untold ?
Simple .
Most of the time , the business owner does n’t realize that these reasons are what caused their failure , and consultants generally do n’t ask the kinds of questions that would identify them .
1 ) Focusing on Short - Term Profits Rather than Building Long - Term Value
It ’s important to be profitable , but NOT when short - term profits come at the expense of the long - term value of the business and the lifetime value of the customer .
Here ’s a real - life example :
In the late 1990s , there was a franchise of a national smoothie shop located in West Los Angeles , CA .
At this store , smoothies sold for about $ 4 .
They cost only around $ 1 to make , resulting in a solid profit .
However , certain ingredients , like mangoes and berries , cost more than the other ingredients , such as juice and frozen yogurt .
Since juice and frozen yogurt were cheap , the franchisee put more of these ingredients in their smoothies and less of the expensive ingredients .
By doing this , their profit margin per smoothie grew by approximately 20 cents , which seemed great … on paper .
Unfortunately for the store , customers were n’t satisfied with the taste of the lower cost smoothies , people stopped going there , and the store eventually went out of business .
As you can see here , it ’s important to consider the lifetime value of a customer .
Repeat business is way more valuable than short - term profits .
Saving 20 cents on a smoothie today will cost you big in the long run .
( Another great example of this concept is Google giving preference to relevant ads in order to improve the user experience , even though there are less relevant advertisers willing to pay a higher price per click . )
2 ) Ego Business vs. Business Opportunity
The foundation of a good business is a good business opportunity .
As an entrepreneur , you want to fill a need in the marketplace .
Unfortunately , many businesses are started solely to fulfill an entrepreneur ’s ego ( or , to put it less harshly , to satisfy one of the entrepreneur ’s interests ) .
This can often be seen in the restaurant & bar industry , where too many entrepreneurs open shop because it ’s a “ cool ” thing to do .
Such businesses rarely succeed .
3 ) Life distractions
The best ideas do n’t always come between 9 and 5 .
A person might have a great idea while driving , or in the shower , or while working out .
It ’s moments like these when an entrepreneur leaves behind the day - to - day tasks of running a business and gains a better perspective of the big picture .
Sadly , there are a lot of things that can disrupt a person ’s home life .
Illness , death of a family member , divorce , relationship trouble , and problems with a child are just a few of the many issues that can affect a person ’s mindset .
When things like this occur , moments of clarity are replaced by stress and anxiety .
Many entrepreneurial ventures depend heavily on new ideas and creative thinking , and when an entrepreneur ’s head is n’t clear , business can suffer .
4 ) Bad feedback & white lies
People like spending time with friends and family .
Unfortunately , when it comes to business , friends and family members do n’t always give the best advice .
This is especially true at the birth of a business .
Nobody wants to be a buzz - kill .
No one wants to tell an entrepreneur their idea is bad , or their location stinks , or anything else negative .
Most people are conditioned to be supportive of their friends and family regardless of the situation .
Plus , nobody wants to be wrong .
Imagine your friend has an idea that you think is terrible .
You share your objections , but the friend goes ahead with the idea anyways , and it succeeds .
Now you ’ll always be the naysayer that never believed in them .
Nobody wants to be that person .
That ’s why you ’ll rarely get honest , objective business advice from friends or family members .
And yet , oftentimes friends and family are the first people entrepreneurs turn to for advice .
5 ) Maybe the owner is just a jerk
There are a lot of great people in the business world , but there are also some jerks .
And these jerks sometimes start their own companies .
A jerk , in this case , is someone who a lot of people ca n’t get along with .
Maybe it ’s because they ’re a super - perfectionist , or they yell a lot , or they demand that everything be done in a certain way , or they constantly complain .
Or maybe they ’re annoying in some other way .
The key is that nobody — not employees , customers , partners , suppliers , clients , etc. — wants to give 100 % for a jerk .
Clients and customers will be turned off , and employees will start cutting corners .
Most people believe that life is too short , and do n’t want to spend their time working with someone they ca n’t get along with .
6 ) The entrepreneur never took the full leap
In most new business attempts , the entrepreneur never leaves their day job , or they create a back - up plan , fail to complete all the components of their business plan , or they have a job lined up in case the new business fails .
In these cases , failure IS an option , as the entrepreneur has a safety net to fall back on .
In cases where failure is NOT an option , and the entrepreneur depends on the new business to provide food , shelter and clothing , the business has a greater chance of succeeding .
There ’s a great example of this concept in this NY Times article .
Xiang
Yu was a third century ( B.C. ) General in the Chinese army .
He led his troops into enemy territory by crossing the Yangtze River .
Then , in order to inspire his troops , Xiang Yu took some unorthodox measures .
He burned all of his troop ’s ships and destroyed all of their cooking materials .
This left the troops with only two options :
Move forward and conquer the enemy , or perish .
The maneuver did not make Xiang
Yu very popular with his soldiers ; nevertheless , the troops advanced and ultimately emerged victorious .

Yu’s methods might be a little drastic in this day and age , but the moral of the story is what ’s important .
Author Anita Roddick has said that entrepreneurship is a matter of survival , and the truth is , if you ’re not totally committed to your business , your chances for success will be greatly diminished .
In a stunning example of a stopped clock being right , Iran ’s President Ahmadinejad assails the dollar , suggesting OPEC should break the petrodollar link :
“ They get our oil and give us a worthless piece of paper , ” Ahmadinejad told reporters after the close of the summit in the Saudi capital of Riyadh .
He blamed President Bush ’s policies for the decline of the dollar and its negative effect on other countries .
Oil is priced in U.S. dollars on the world market , and the currency ’s depreciation has concerned oil producers because it has contributed to rising crude prices and eroded the value of their dollar reserves .
“ All participating leaders showed an interest in changing their hard currency reserves to a credible hard currency , ” Ahmadinejad said .
“ Some said producing countries should designate a single hard currency aside from the U.S. dollar . . . to form the basis of our oil trade . ”
He was unsurprisingly echoed by statements from Mini-Mahmoud , Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez .
This expands an already wide rift within OPEC , as several states ( most notably Saudi Arabia ) are allies with the United States .
They fear that dropping the dollar will also destroy any semblance of friendly relations between their governments and Washington .
Many of their regimes could face internal resistance if American backing disappeared , and given some of their internal policies , it ’s not likely that they ’ll be peacefully overthrown .
Quite honestly , this has been on the horizon for a long time .
Our own Federal Reserve and politicians , in an effort to keep the American economy moving ( and themselves from political harm ) , have engaged upon a credit glut that has covered the world with American paper .
And the world is slowly starting to realize that this paper is becoming worthless .
To a large extent , they were still stuck with the dollar , as there was n’t an alternative large and stable enough to be an alternative .
With the growth of the Euro , though , the dollar no longer has a monopoly position in the world market .
A global dollar crisis is a nightmare for the entire world .
But it ’s becoming increasingly likely , and while Ahmadenijad might be crazy , he ’s not stupid .
He knows that his best option for getting rich on the back of the falling dollar is to get on the leading edge and ditch it before the crisis materializes .
And if divesting of the dollar manages to cause that world panic after he ’s complete , all the better to damage “ the Great Satan ” and turn him into a hero to the extremists at home .
To the vast majority of Americans , the “ high price of oil ” is OPEC ’s fault .
But in reality , how much of the high price is a reflection of the weakness of the dollar instead of a short supply ?
The vast majority of Americans see “ crazy Mahmoud ” spouting off , but I guarantee the prospect of oil being sold in euros rather than dollars is a prospect keeping many folks in Washington awake at night .

All internet is shared at some point along the line .
Cable is just shared out farther in the field than DSL .
DSL is shared at each DSLAM .
Thats the thing that DSL lovers / ravers forget - it may be dedicated from the CO to your house / business but it doesnt mean its dedicated all the way to the Internet or passed the equipment .

Normal large - scale networks are n't built to handle 100 % end - point load routing capacity in everywhich direction .
The only difference between cable and ADSL is the point at which the sharing and over - subscribing begins .
With cable , it starts right on the coax and this makes the shared nature plain obvious .
With ADSL , sharing begins at the DSLAM 's ATM backplane .
Beyond this point , both technologies become very similar .
The whole internet is an oversubscribed shared network that would not be able to handle every internet user simultaneously going at full speed .
Simply look at TSI : their traffic peaks are currently around 2.5 Gbps .
With an overall average of about 50 GB / subscriber / month which is less than 1 / 4 of what is possible at 1 M bps , TSI would need over 20 Gbps of total transit capacity to provide non-blocking full - speed for everybody assuming an average sync speed of 2.5 Mbps .
But for the time being , everybody east - side is happy with TSI 's current 3xGbE links to Bell - land ... modulo
Bell 's new wholesale throttling .

Re : teksavvy
Because it 's not reselling .
Under the CRTC 's model , Bell is used for the coppper , the DSLAM ( what your DSL modem talks to ) , and the ATM network to get you to your ISP .
From there , you 're on your own ISP 's network , using their upstream providers and peers .
Some ISPs colocate their own DSLAMs in COs , in which case they 're only using the dumb copper .
This is why they 're called wholesellers and not resellers ; they 're relying on Bell for the last mile , but using their own networks for actual internet connectivity .
The result is TekSavvy can sell 200 GB / mth for $ 30 / mth while Bell charges something like $ 42 ( last I checked ) for 30 GB / mth .
Now , TekSavvy themselves have many resellers , and I do n't understand why somebody would want to go with one of them ; they really are just resellers .
Might as well go with TekSavvy directly .

Re : teksavvy Telus has a packet - switched network , but it does n't matter ; DSL works directly over the raw copper wire .
From there , it 's just a question of how it 's backhauled to the ISP's PoP .
I believe Bell uses L2TP over ATM .

Well you will be horribly disappointed with Bell , they are more expensive then whole / resellers , and have outsourced email services to Hotmail .
Yes , they still do have a web space , a whopping 5 megs worth , but you must wade through technical support ( which has also been outsourced ) to get it running !

What is this good support you speak of ?
I know of very few ISP 's who actually assist their customers well .
In fact , I worked technical support for 2 different ISP's and nine times out of ten we 're told to send them to a third - party such as Microsoft or Eudora etc .
It 's very rare that an ISP will admit to having difficulties with their mail servers , and even MORE rare for them to actually fix any issues with their mail servers .

You 're right , it is very rare .
That 's why TekSavvy has such a loyal following .
Their support is excellent , you talk to people that know what they 're doing and are n't reading from a script .
They also admit when they 're having problems and say what the problem is and how long till its resolved .

@allstream.net Em Adespoton Anon Re : teksavvy
If you 're tech savvy yourself , just run a traceroute to figure out where your connection stops , then run a traceroute from the outside ( via a friendly wireless access point or something ) to see where the problem is from the outside .
Then call tech support with these two IP addresses and any telltale information their reverse DNS lookup gives you , and tell the person on the other end that you 've noticed network issues between the two points and would like to talk to someone knowledgeable regarding their current network issues .
Using this trick always gets me escalated within minutes to someone who actually knows what they 're talking about -- they often think I 'm a wholesaler who somehow called in on the wrong line .
Generally the answers are something along the line of " Bob currently has router X offline in building Y -- the failover to carrier X's network does n't seem to be kicking in .
When Bill gets there with the new hardware ( should be an hour or so ) , we 'll have more information ) . "
Sure beats " Try restarting your computer again while closing one eye and kissing your modem " that you get at the lower levels .

You need to also consider that under the U.S. Patriot Act , the government can intercept or view any email or electronic content stored in or transiting by the U.S.A. even if it belongs to a foreign citizen .
Since Hotmail and Yahoo are in the U.S. , the Patriot Act will apply even if you connect from Canada .
If I was Canadian , I 'd stick with a Canadian ISP which stored my emails in Canada .

never use ISP 's email you dont want isp specific email addresses anyway .
rogers made EVERYONE change their address from at HOME , to some other stupid shit -- cant remember what , i never use isp email .
they had NO choice , because i think it was yahoo that forced them to change after gettin the @HOME domain .
think they tried to strong arm rogers for cash , and then possibly the users , so they could keep their addresses they had for yesrs , some more than 10 years , of paying rogers almost 50 $ per month , or 600 per year .
after 10 years you have just given rogers 6 THOUSAND dollars , and they cant even guarantee you email address as promised in teh sales pitch .
if that happened to me , would have sued them for every penny i paid them fromt eh moment i made that email address .
who knows how many long lost friends , business contacts etc those poor trusting idiots lost out on .
no , my friend , NEVER use isp email .
always go with a email only setup .
GOOGLE mail is pretty good now , but even shitty hotmail , or some paid email ( yes they do exist ) would have been better .
avoid the paid email services tho , their fly by mnight , and needing to charge for email hosting is a POOR business model -- they wo n't be around for long .
google and hotmail wil be around for a very long time , only MS might get ugly some day and mess with their users , GOOG us far more ethical and less likely to screw over its users .
even a company like Techsavvy , which seems like they are VERY nice and well LIKED may not be able to protect users form bell pulling the plug on them , just to be assholes .

This has to be the pinnacle of incompetence and mismanagement !
So that it 's clear , Bell resells a service , most likely under contract , then when they realize that they would have to spend money to keep their paying customer happy ( in this case Teksavvy ) they instead decided to traffic shape an ISP !!!
Also , its been stated in these forums before that Bell actually makes more money on the resellers !
So , they take a profit center for the company and turn it into a big question mark .

Bush Makes Power Grab
President Bush , without so much as issuing a press statement , on May 9 , 2006 signed a directive that granted near dictatorial powers to the office of the president in the event of a national emergency declared by the president .
The " National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive , " with the dual designation of NSPD - 51 , as a National Security Presidential Directive , and HSPD - 20 , as a Homeland Security Presidential Directive , establishes under the office of president a new National Continuity Coordinator .
That job , as the document describes , is to make plans for " National Essential Functions " of all federal , state , local , territorial , and tribal governments , as well as private sector organizations to continue functioning under the president 's directives in the event of a national emergency .
The directive loosely defines " catastrophic emergency " as " any incident , regardless of location , that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties , damage , or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population , infrastructure , environment , economy , or government functions . "
»www.ww4report.com/node/3940
Translated into layman 's terms , when the President determines a national emergency has occurred , the President can declare to the office of the presidency powers usually assumed by dictators to direct any and all government and business activities until the emergency is declared over .
Ironically , the directive sees no contradiction in the assumption of dictatorial powers by the President with the goal of maintaining constitutional continuity through an emergency .
The directive issued May 9 makes no attempt to reconcile the powers created there for the National Continuity Coordinator with the National Emergency Act .
As specified by U.S. Code Title 50 , Chapter 34 , Subchapter II , Section 1621 , the National Emergency
Act allows that the president may declare a national emergency but requires that such proclamation " shall immediately be transmitted to the Congress and published in the Federal Register . "
A Congressional Research Service study notes that under the National Emergency Act , the President " may seize property , organize and control the means of production , seize commodities , assign military forces abroad , institute martial law , seize and control all transportation and communication , regulate the operation of private enterprise , restrict travel , and , in a variety of ways , control the lives of United States citizens . "
The CRS study notes that the National Emergency Act sets up congress as a balance empowered to " modify , rescind , or render dormant such delegated emergency authority , " if Congress believes the president has acted inappropriately .
NSPD - 51 / HSPD - 20 appears to supersede the National Emergency Act by creating the new position of National Continuity Coordinator without any specific act of Congress authorizing the position .
NSPD - 51 / HSPD - 20 also makes no reference whatsoever to Congress .
The language of the May 9 directive appears to negate any a requirement that the President submit to Congress a determination that a national emergency exists , suggesting instead that the powers of the executive order can be implemented without any congressional approval or oversight .

BUSH MOVES TOWARD MARTIAL LAW
2007 Defense Authorization Act Guts Posse Comitatus
by Frank Morales , WW4 REPORT
In a stealth maneuver , President Bush has signed into law a provision which , according to Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - Vermont ) , " will actually encourage the President to declare federal martial law . "
It does so by revising the Insurrection Act of 1807 , a set of laws that limits the president 's ability to deploy troops within the United States .
The Insurrection Act ( 10 U.S.C.331- 335 ) has historically , along with the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 ( 18 U.S.C.1385 ) , helped to enforce strict prohibitions on military involvement in domestic law enforcement .
With one cloaked swipe of his pen , Bush has done much to undo those prohibitions .
Public Law 109 - 364 , or the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 ( H.R.5122 ) , which was signed on October 17 in a private Oval Office ceremony , allows the president to declare a " public emergency , " station troops anywhere in the United States , and take control of state - based National Guard units without the consent of the governor or local authorities , in order to " suppress public disorder . "
President Bush seized this unprecedented power on the very same day that he signed the equally odious Military Commissions Act of 2006 .
In a sense , the two laws complement one another .
One allows for torture and detention abroad , while the other seeks to enforce acquiescence at home , allowing the commander - in - chief to order the military onto the streets .
Although not invoked in the legislation , the term for putting an area under military rule is " martial law . "
Section 1076 of the massive Authorization Act , which grants the Pentagon another $ 500 - plus billion for its global adventures , is entitled " Use of the Armed Forces in Major Public Emergencies . "
Section 333 , " Major public emergencies ; interference with State and Federal law " states that " the President may employ the armed forces , including the National Guard in Federal service , to restore public order and enforce the laws of the United States when , as a result of a natural disaster , epidemic , or other serious public health emergency , terrorist attack or incident , or other condition in any State or possession of the United States , the President determines that domestic violence has occurred to such an extent that the constituted authorities of the State or possession are incapable of maintaining public order " in order to " suppress , in any State , any insurrection , domestic violence , unlawful combination , or conspiracy . "
In short , this allows the president to commandeer guardsmen from any state , over the objections of the local government , ship them off to another state , conscript them in a law enforcement and set them loose against " disorderly " citizenry protesters , possibly , or those who object to forced vaccinations and quarantines in the event of a bio - terror event .
It is particularly ominous that the law follows new contracts for construction of emergency detention facilities .
An article on " recent contract awards " in the summer issue of the slick , insider Journal of Counter terrorism & Homeland Security International reported that " global engineering and technical services powerhouse KBR [ Kellog , Brown & Root ] announced in January 2006 that its Government and Infrastructure division was awarded an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity ( IDIQ ) contract to support US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) facilities in the event of an emergency ....
With a maximum total value of $ 385 million over a five year term , the contract is to be executed by the US Army Corps of Engineers ... for establishing temporary detention and processing capabilities to augment existing ICE Detention and Removal Operations ( DRO ) in the event of an emergency influx of immigrants into the US , or to support the rapid development of new programs . "
The report points out that " KBR is the engineering and construction subsidiary of Halliburton . "
So in addition to authorizing another $ 532.8 billion for the Pentagon including a $ 70 billion " supplemental provision " which covers the cost of the ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan the new law further collapses the historic divide between the police and the military .
The Posse Comitatus Act reads : " Whoever , except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress , willfully uses any part of the Army or Air Force as a posse comitatus [ deputized law enforcement ] or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years , or both . "
It is the only US criminal statute that outlaws military operations directed against the American people under the cover of " law enforcement . "
It has been held as the citizenry 's the best protection against the power - hungry intentions of an unscrupulous and reckless executive intent on using force to impose its will .
It has now been dealt a near - fatal blow .
Despite the unprecedented nature of this act , there has been no outcry in the American media , and little reaction from our elected officials in Congress .
On September 19 , a lone Senator Leahy noted that 2007s Defense Authorization Act contained a " widely opposed provision to allow the President more control over the National Guard [ adopting ] changes to the Insurrection Act , which will make it easier for this or any future President to use the military to restore domestic order WITHOUT the consent of the nation 's governors .
In other words , the law facilitates the " transfer " of the newest in so - called " crowd control " technology and other weaponry from the Pentagon to local militarized police units .
The new law builds on and further codifies earlier " technology transfer " agreements , specifically the 1995 DOD - Justice Department memorandum of agreement achieved back during the Clinton - Reno administration .
Halliburton wins concentration camp contract

Submitted by Bill Weinberg on Mon , 05/08/2006 - 16:50 .
We wish we were joking .
What a shame nobody noticed this the little note in the second section about the Halliburton contract ( emphasis added ) should have been front - page news in every paper in the country .
Back on Feb. 23 , Nat Perry of Consortium News wrote for AlterNet :
Bush 's Mysterious ' New Programs '
Is the Pentagon building U.S. - based prison camps for Muslim immigrants ?
Evidence points to the possibility .
Not that George W. Bush needs much encouragement , but Sen. Lindsey Graham suggested to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales a new target for the administration 's domestic operations Fifth Columnists , supposedly disloyal Americans who sympathize and collaborate with the enemy .
" The administration has not only the right , but the duty , in my opinion , to pursue Fifth Column movements , " Graham , R - S.C. , told Gonzales during Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Feb .
6 .
" I stand by this president 's ability , inherent to being commander in chief , to find out about Fifth Column movements , and I do n't think you need a warrant to do that , " Graham added , volunteering to work with the administration to draft guidelines for how best to neutralize this alleged threat .
Labor camps
There also was another little - noticed item posted at the U.S. Army website , about the Pentagon 's Civilian Inmate Labor Program .
This program " provides Army policy and guidance for establishing civilian inmate labor programs and civilian prison camps on Army installations . "
The Army document , first drafted in 1997 , underwent a " rapid action revision " on Jan. 14 , 2005 .
The revision provides a " template for developing agreements " between the Army and corrections facilities for the use of civilian inmate labor on Army installations .
Pentagon surveillance
Despite the Posse Comitatus
Act 's prohibitions against U.S. military personnel engaging in domestic law enforcement , the Pentagon has expanded its operations beyond previous boundaries , such as its role in domestic surveillance activities .
Homeland defense
As the administration scoops up more and more names , members of Congress also have questioned the elasticity of Bush 's definitions for words like terrorist " affiliates , " used to justify wiretapping Americans allegedly in contact with such people or entities .
The Pentagon strategy paper calls for increased military reconnaissance and surveillance to " defeat potential challengers before they threaten the United States . "
The plan " maximizes threat awareness and seizes the initiative from those who would harm us . "
But there are concerns over how the Pentagon judges " threats " and who falls under the category " those who would harm us . "
A Pentagon official said the Counterintelligence Field Activity 's TALON program has amassed files on antiwar protesters .
In December [ 15 ] 2005 , NBC News revealed the existence of a secret 400 - page Pentagon document listing 1,500 " suspicious incidents " over a 10 - month period , including dozens of small antiwar demonstrations that were classified as a " threat . "
The Defense Department also might be moving toward legitimizing the use of propaganda domestically , as part of its overall war strategy .
A secret Pentagon " Information Operations Roadmap , " approved by Rumsfeld in October 2003 , calls for " full spectrum " information operations and notes that " information intended for foreign audiences , including public diplomacy and PSYOP , increasingly is consumed by our domestic audience and vice versa . "
The Department of Homeland Security also has demonstrated a tendency to deploy military operatives to deal with domestic crises .
In the wake of Hurricane Katrina , the department dispatched " heavily armed paramilitary from the Blackwater private security firm , ( and had them ) openly patrolling the streets of New Orleans , " reported journalists Jeremy Scahill and Daniela Crespo on Sept. 10 , 2005 .
Noting the reputation of the Blackwater as " some of the most feared professional killers in the world , " Scahill and Crespo said Blackwater 's presence in New Orleans " raises alarming questions about why the government would allow men trained to kill with impunity in places like Iraq and Afghanistan to operate here . "
For any American citizen suspected of collaborating with terrorists , Bush also revealed what 's in store .
In May 2002 , the FBI arrested U.S. citizen Jose Padilla in Chicago on suspicion that he might be an al - Qaida operative planning an attack .
Rather than bring criminal charges , Bush designated Padilla an " enemy combatant " and had him imprisoned indefinitely without benefit of due process .
After three years , the administration finally brought charges against Padilla , in order to avoid a Supreme Court showdown the White House might have lost .
But since the court was not able to rule on the Padilla case , the administration 's arguments have not been formally repudiated .
Indeed , despite filing charges against Padilla , the White House still asserts the right to detain U.S. citizens without charges as enemy combatants .
HALLIBURTON GETS DETENTION CONTRACT
KBR , the engineering and construction subsidiary of Halliburton Co. , announced on Jan. 24 that the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) has awarded KBR a five - year $ 385 million " Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity " ( IDIQ ) contingency contract to support ICE facilities in the event of an emergency .
The contract , effective immediately , provides for establishing temporary detention and processing capabilities to expand existing ICE Detention and Removal Operations ( DRO ) facilities in the event of an emergency influx of immigrants into the US , or to support the rapid development of new programs , KBR said .
The contract may also provide immigrant detention support to other government organizations in the event of an immigration emergency , the company said .
The competitively awarded contract will be executed by the US Army Corps of Engineers , Fort Worth District .
KBR held the previous ICE contract from 2000 through 2005 .

While General Hayden has extensive administrative experience , he would face daunting challenges at the C.I.A. , an agency that has been demoralized and has endured turbulence since the mid-1990's .
As N.S.A. director until last year , General Hayden oversaw the program to intercept international phone calls and e-mail messages of Americans and others in the United States believed to have links to Al Qaeda .
General Hayden , 61 , has been the program 's most public defender , repeatedly asserting that it is legal and constitutional even though the eavesdropping is done without warrants from a special court set up in 1978 to authorize such surveillance .
" I 've taken an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States , " General Hayden said at the National Press Club in January as he defended what the Bush administration calls the Terrorist Surveillance Program .
" I would never violate that Constitution , nor would I abuse the rights of the American people . "
Supports warrant - less wiretaps and says he upholds the Constitution .
Lucky for him , most of the citizenry does n't have a clue what the document actually says .

Is how they are going to merge Canada , U.S with Mexico to create the NAU .
The border with Mexico has vanished already .
I 'm sure Canadians want to keep Canada , Canadian owned and separated from the U.S. , so as to not lose your National Identity .

Take for example McCain raised $ 11 million for his campaign .

Obama raised $ 55 million .
More than the other two put together .
Want to guess where that $ 55 million came from ?
Sure as hell was not from people with homes in foreclosure .
It came from big business and special interest groups .
I do n't know where this off - topic BS is coming from but is patently false .
The vast majority of the 55 million raised so far in Q1 2008 has been from small donations .
I do n't have the time right now to add up Jan and Feb , but here is a sample from January :
" Baracks $ 28 million in online contributions came from more than 250,000 contributors .
90 % were under $ 100 . 40 % were $ 25 or less , and 10,000 people gave $ 5 or $ 10 to the campaign "

If you count my $ 25 donation as a " special interest " donation then you might have a point but we all know that is n't what you were saying .
Do you care to retract this statement or to back it up with fact ?
Show me that even half of this money came from big business and special interest groups as you claim and I will donate $ 25 to the candidate of your choice .

Conspiracy theories
You need to separate your dislike for traffic shaping ( which I share ) from your conspiracy - theory dislike for governments in general .
Let 's get our facts straight , shall we ?
For years now you can download tons of anti-government and pro-jihad videos online and no one will try to stop you .
On the other hand , try posting a video that is said to be anti-Islam and you 'll find yourself the target of death threats , legal threats and internet censorship faster than you can blink .
Here is a recent example : »
If there is any sort of censorship going on in North America , it is n't in the direction you claim it is .
If anything , I 've seen the left censor the right but not the other way around .
Try to even * hint * that Global Warming is a debatable topic and you 'll see what I mean .
I 'm not saying I personally believe one way or another .
I am simply pointing out that in my experience people on the left have been censoring people on the right far more often in recent history than the other way around .
Extremists on either end of the stick are a bad thing , period .

How is this possible ?
This is as legal as traffic shaping a Point to Point T1 line .
As far as I understand / know ( Im a american ) the pair goes into the Teksavvy or its wholesaler 's DSLAM , then onto Teksavvy 's ATM or SONET or MPLS lines which are rented from BC .
How can BC touch the ATM / SONET / MPLS lines ?
Do n't the five nines just get invalidated since the line is n't spiting out what when into it anymore ?

It 's not actually Teksavvy 's ATM lines .
DSL user -> incumbent / wholesaler 's DSLAM ( e.g. Bell ) ->
Bell 's ATM / ethernet/mpls/ whatever network -> demarc point -> Teksavvy 's 3x GbE ->
Teksavvy 's network
The throttling is being done within Bell 's network , the question that 's unknown is whether they 're intentionally throttling Teksavvy clients , somehow based on protocol , or if their network is simply overloaded and throttling everyone .
AFAIK , Teksavvy has an SLO for network performance , so it 's quite possible Bell is breaking that completely .
As Rocky mentioned , " wait for Tuesday " when they actually have a meeting with Bell and figure out what 's happening .
Personally , I 'm speculating that they 're throttling based on a user 's usage pattern ( e.g. constant max rate ) because their trunk lines are overloaded , and possibly prioritizing their business clients ' traffic above others .

On thing that upsets me about this throttling , as I saw when I used my Sympatico account , my other TCP / UDP connections suffer .
The latency variant between each hop jumps between ~+20 ms to 200 ms .
It is not just BT suffering , other things like SFTP seems to be throttled back too .
Luckily , I have access to a NEXXIA account at work to do some downloading during slow periods of the day .
Tbug
@kc.uwo.ca Tbug Anon Re : Throtting = high latency
Bell is throttling ALL encrypted connections which includes SFTP , VPN , RDP , IMAP .
They utilize the same vendor as Rogers to do their shaping / throttling ( I got this info from a VP of Product Management for Bell )
Once they started this crap , I noticed major fluctuations in RDP .
Using RDP at 30 kbps is ridiculous .
The further problem is there is not set time when they throttle - it's just whenever " Network Congestion " is detected aka high use periods .

I am trying to download the CBC show , and I am on Montreal - DSL aka Teksavvy , and I am only getting 30 kB /s , like everyone else .
I 'm in the Ottawa area .
But I also ftped the latest kernel ( yes , I am one of those sickos who likes to compile their own Linux kernels ) from kernel.org , I got throughput of over 450 kB / s .
So it 's not the network that is slow , it 's the link somewhere betweeen me and those 100 + seeders that is throttling the connection .
With that many seeds , 90 % of them are in Canada , I should be maxing out my connection with 500 + kB /s or more .

I do n't expect Teksavvy to lower the rates for us if Bell continues to charge them the same amount but for what is substantially less service .

It boils to my blood and makes me hate this monopoly of Bell in Canada .
It 's the customers who should matter most before the effing profit and yet Bell and Rogers ( in mobile section ) , two of biggest companies are screwing with customers since they know how crippled we are without them .

The initial hope is for a treatment for the liver disease Hepatitis C Scientists say they have taken a major step towards a new generation of drugs for many conditions , including cancer .
Writing in Nature , a Danish team said they had " silenced " key genetic material in cells called RNA , thought to play an important role in disease .
Working on monkeys , they cut the animals ' cholesterol levels by silencing strands of micro-RNA in liver cells controlling its metabolism .
Previous tests had only been carried out in a test - tube , or on rodents .
The study holds out hope for the treatment of liver diseases .
The team from the Copenhagen - based drug firm Santaris Pharma are aiming to use their findings to develop a treatment for Hepatitis C rather than high cholesterol , for which there are already a number of effective treatments .
But they say the technique could ultimately be employed to treat a range of conditions , including certain types of cancer , cardiac diseases and metabolic problems like diabetes .
Taking charge
The treatment is based on the idea of silencing certain types of RNA , which scientists have increasingly come to understand as the main regulator of what goes on in a cell .
We are going to have to take it slowly , but it is nonetheless a possibility that we could have something on the market within five years
Dr Keith McCullagh
Santaris Pharma
Types of RNA have been identified which have been associated with disease .
There is evidence to suggest , for example , that levels of one form of RNA are extremely elevated in lymphomas , and that they are not just a symptom but a driver of the disease .
Silencing them could therefore prove an effective treatment , if not a cure .
The experiment featured in Nature shows for the first time that it is possible to employ this silencing technique in non-human primates .
African green monkeys were injected with a drug aimed at silencing microRNA - 122 , which is known to have a role in the production of cholesterol .
After three doses over five days , their cholesterol levels were lowered by 30 % - an effect which lasted for three weeks .
" What 's more , there appeared to be no associated signs of toxicity to the liver or kidneys , " said Joacim Elmen , part of the Santaris Pharma team .
Side - effects unknown
However , the side - effects of silencing RNA remain unknown .
There are great prospects for future drug development both for liver diseases and other disease types
Dr Mike Gait
MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology
While the team hope to use their findings to develop a treatment for Hepatitis C , which is also regulated by microRNA - 122 , it is unclear what the implications of permanently lowering both " good " and " bad " cholesterol at the same time would be .
This would in any event be one of the known side - effects .
There may be others which are not yet apparent , including the risk of developing liver cancer , admits Dr Keith McCullagh , the head of Santaris Pharma .
" We are going to have to take it slowly , but it is nonetheless a possibility that we could have something on the market within five years , " he said .
Dr Mike Gait , of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge said : " This exciting paper is the first to show activity in monkeys of an important new class of designed molecule that can interfere with an essential RNA that controls specific genes in the liver .
" There are great prospects for future drug development both for liver diseases and other disease types , and Europe has the potential to match the USA in this area . "

What are these ?
Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann , who discovered the hallucinogenic drug LSD , died yesterday .
But the LSD trip is far from over as scientists bring lucidity to how hallucinogens work .
Also called psychedelics , hallucinogens alter a person 's perception , mood and a slew of other mental processes .
Hallucinogen history goes back centuries as people worldwide have taken the drugs to induce altered states for religious and spiritual purposes .
While LSD ( lysergic acid diethylamide ) , mescaline and other psychedelics were studied in the past , research largely came to a halt after recreational abuse of the drugs in the 1960s , with some work resuming in the 1990s .
Many studies now rely on animal models such as mice .
One human study published in the journal Psychopharmacology revealed the active ingredient in hippie mushrooms , called psilocybin , elicited " mystical experiences " for participants that reportedly led to behavior changes lasting for weeks .
However , nearly one - third of the participants had a bad trip , reporting that they found the drug experience frightening .
Research has suggested hallucinogens primarily do their magic in the brain 's cortex , where the drugs activate specific receptors called 5 - HT2A receptors ( 2ARs ) that are normally triggered by serotonin .
" In order to function , [ the cortex is ] integrating different signals , for example glutamate signals and serotonin signals , " said neuroscientist Stuart Sealfon of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York , " and what hallucinogens must be doing is they are disrupting this process so that sensory perception is altered by them . "
However , not all compounds that activate these receptors lead to mind - bending trips .
" What was it that made hallucinogens have their unique properties ? "
Sealfon said .
Scientists once thought of receptors in terms of " locks and keys , " in which certain drugs fit into a specific receptor as a key fits into a lock .
That receptor would then turn on and signal to other molecules in the cell .
But that 's not the case for hallucinogens .
Research by Sealfon and his colleagues published last year in the journal Neuron revealed the serotonin - 2A receptor has more than one " on " position .
" When a non-hallucinogen activates the receptor , it causes one pattern of signaling of the cells in the brain that is not hallucinogenic , " Sealfon told LiveScience .
" When a hallucinogen turns on this receptor , the receptor we infer must go into a different position and that leads to a different pattern in responses in the cell and is what makes the hallucinogen have its unique effect . "
Brains are mysterious , whether on drugs or not .
Sealfon 's and others ' research has continued to reveal how brain receptors are involved in hallucinogenic effects ; study results are also providing insights into the nature of a mystical or hallucinogenic experience .
And so while studies are shedding light on " the brain on hallucinogens , " many questions remain .
For instance , what causes a " bad trip ? "

One hundred and sixty people , many of them Americans , are feared dead or injured after a series of large explosions at an army base on the outskirts of Tirana , the capital of Albania , officials have said .
People suffering with burns , concussions and broken limbs were rushed to local hospitals following the blasts , believed to have begun while teams were dismantling munitions at a store base .
Many of the injuries were a result of flying glass or shrapnel .
" We do not know the exact number , but we fear the worst for the three teams , each of 21 people , working there at the time , " said Juela Mecani , spokeswoman for the country 's prime minister , Sali Berisha .
" Several were US citizens . "
A spokesman for the Albanian interior ministry , Avni Neza , said army and police forces were trying to reach the area in armoured cars .
" Helicopters have not yet managed to land because the explosions continue , " he said .
A Reuters cameraman who quickly arrived at the scene described people trying to escape : " Terrified people are leaving the area on foot along the highway , women and children .
Cars with broken windows have been abandoned on the highway . "
The force of the explosion was so strong that it was felt at the seaside resort of Durres , 20 km away .
People living in the nearby village of Gerdec took shelter in concrete bunkers while others fled to the hills .
At Tirana airport , several kilometres from the base , glass doors and windows shattered .
" We evacuated passengers from the affected area and suspended flights for around 30 minutes , " said Arlinda Causholli , a spokeswoman for the airport .
Local media reports suggested that five people were in a coma while Tirana residents were rushing to hospitals to donate blood .
One witness said there had been 100 people at the base .
The US embassy in Tirana could not confirm whether US military personnel were present at the site or not .
Albania is required to dismantle its obsolete Stalinist - era arsenal and modernise its armed forces in order to qualify it for an invitation to join Nato next month .
" For more than seven months , the nation 's top public health agency has blocked the publication of an exhaustive federal study of environmental hazards in the eight Great Lakes states , reportedly because it contains such potentially ' alarming information ' as evidence of elevated infant mortality and cancer rates , " reports Sheila Kaplan .
The 400 - page study , undertaken by a division of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in cooperation with the government of Canada , " warns that more than nine million people who live in the more than two dozen ' areas of concern ' -- including such major metropolitan areas as Chicago , Cleveland , Detroit , and Milwaukee -- may face elevated health risks from being exposed to dioxin , PCBs , pesticides , lead , mercury , or six other hazardous pollutants . "
Canadian biologist Michael Gilbertson , who was involved in reviewing the study , said it has been suppressed because it suggests that vulnerable populations have been harmed by industrial pollutants .
" It 's not good because it 's inconvenient , " Gilbertson said .
" The whole problem with all this kind of work is wrapped up in that word ' injury . '
If you have injury , that implies liability .
Liability , of course , implies damages , legal processes , and costs of remedial action .
The governments , frankly , in both countries are so heavily aligned with , particularly , the chemical industry , that the word amongst the bureaucracies is that they really do not want any evidence of effect or injury to be allowed out there . "

A scanned image of a Singaporean identity card has been making the rounds online , recently turning up on the widely read techie blog Gizmodo .
The card belongs to a young fellow , born May 13 , 1990 in Singapore to Javanese parents , with the regrettable name of Batman bin Suparman .
Two superheroes in one name ?
Well , one superhero and one Javanese name that 's coincidentally similar to another superhero .
Let 's take a look .
First , Suparman .
This is , in fact , a very common name among the Javanese who inhabit central and eastern thirds of the island of Java , as well as nearby ethnolinguistic groups , particularly the Sundanese in the western third of Java .
The Su- prefix , derived from a Sanskritic root ( सु in Devanagari ) meaning ' good , fortunate ' , shows up frequently in Javanese names , such as the first two presidents of Indonesia , Sukarno and Suharto , as well as the current president Susilo ( Bambang Yudhoyono ) .
A top Indonesian military commander is named Djadja Suparman .
A Sundanese traditional musician who has toured the United States is named Ade Suparman .
And showing the Sundanese penchant for reduplication , the regional secretary for the city of Bandung , West Java is named Maman Suparman .
So there 's no connection to Superman , though the similarity is obvious enough in Indonesia to generate occasional puns on the name .
A recently published comic book is entitled Suparman Pulang Kampung ( " Suparman Goes Home to the Village " ) , a self - deprecating localization of the Superman mythos complete with the familiar " S " logo .
Batman , on the other hand , has no false friends in local languages ( as far as I 'm aware ) .
And the character of Batman is almost as well known in the region as Superman , so it 's hard to imagine any source other than the DC Comics superhero .
One indication of Batman 's fame is yet another Indonesian fusion of the global and the local : the Bandung - based rapper Iwa K released a song in the mid-90's called " Batman Kasarung " , melding the Batman story with the Sundanese folk character Lutung Kasarung , a prince disguised as a monkey .
So it appears that the Javanese parents of young Batman really were inspired by the comic book creation .
The full name , Batman bin Suparman , features an Arabic patronymic construction occasionally used by Muslims in the region .
Bin means ' son ' , so the name is literally " Batman , son of Suparman " .
Could Suparman and his wife have named their son Batman as a wry joke , playing on the similarity of Suparman to Superman ?
Perhaps , but it would be unfortunate for the young man to be saddled for life with his parents ' one - time attempt at humor .
One final possibility to consider : could the image of the identity card be a fake ?
Does n't seem that way .
First , the line of Jawi script ( Arabic script used for writing Malay ) is a perfect transliteration of the Romanized name .
Furthermore , one Singaporean blogger recalled in 2005 that he was childhood friends with Batman bin Suparman .
And a commenter on another Singapore - based blog remembered the name from working at a call center .
The commenter was responding to a post about another comical Singaporean name … Ninja Turtle .
Cruel , cruel parents .

10 steps to becoming fluent in a language in 6 months or less
Even if you do n’t feel linguistically - inclined , it ’s possible –with patience , diligence , and a sense of humor — to become fluent in a language in six months or less .
ALTHOUGH ENGLISH IS MY first language , I learned Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese Chinese as a child , picked up French in high school , and have recently became conversant in Spanish as I travel through South America .
Over the years , I ’ve picked up the following tips for expediting language acquisition .
1. Immerse yourself
It ’s almost impossible to learn a new language , or at least to learn it rapidly , unless you begin thinking in that language .
But how do you think in a new language you ca n’t yet speak ?
Ingratiate yourself with the community and you ’re halfway there !
The answer is to simply immerse yourself in it .
Traveling in a foreign country allows you to continuously hear the sounds , rhythms , and inflections of a new language –spoken on the streets , in buses , on television , etc .
Your brain will already start to process and interpret a new language .
Even better than simply traveling is being forced to “ operate ” in a new language by participating in a volunteer program , or working abroad .
Best of all is being completely immersed with locals ( such as living with a host family ) and completely isolated from other native speakers of your language .
Immerse yourself with the locals , their music , culture , media , politics , sports , family , etc .
Ingratiate yourself with the community and you ’re halfway there !
2. Forget translating : think like a baby !
photo by Felicia Wong
How do babies learn language ?
Through imitation , repetition of sounds , and above all , by not being shy or self - conscious .
So what if your pronunciation is a little off , or you ca n’t remember the proper conjugation ?
Just start talking , even if it seems like babbling .
Resisting the urge to translate everything into your native language can be the single fastest shortcut to fluency .
Rather than walking up to the restaurant or giving your host family a pre-memorized phrase for what you ’re going to order , simply listen to how the locals order their food , and then imitate them as best you can .
The same goes for greetings , small talk , etc .
Watch their facial expressions as they say the words ; study how they move their mouths .
Copy these expressions and sounds just like a baby would .
Whether you understand what they mean exactly or not , eventually you will begin simply calling upon these sounds / phrases / words in appropriate situations .
They ’ll appear , as if by magic .
This is the gateway to thinking in a new language .
3 . How do you say ?
Besides common greetings , the one phrase you should memorize and always have at the ready is the phrase is “ How do you say that / what is that called ? ”
By being an inquisitive traveler , one who is always asking questions , you befriend the local people .
You ’ll find that over time they ’ll open up to you , making it easier to initiate conversations .
These daily interactions with the locals are your best teachers : set a daily goal for yourself of having X number of conversations each day–asking people about things you ’re interested in , but do n’t know the words for .
Even if you ca n’t finish the conversation , you ’re on the way .
4. Write it
After having conversations , jot down the things you remembered hearing but did n’t quite understand .
After having conversations , jot down the things you remembered hearing but did n’t quite understand .
( This can serve double duty if you ’re also taking notes for your travel blog ) .
Then go back and use your dictionary .
Look up the words , piece the conversation back together in your mind .
Then , next time you have a conversation , use what you learned .
When studying French and Spanish , I also used “ grammar sheets ” where I wrote down the various verbs to learn their conjugations .
Besides helping me focus , they also became handy reference guides .
5 . Use cognates and draw links
Ever noticed how some words appear exactly the same across various languages ?
These are called “ cognates . ”
Unlocking the usage of cognates instantly gives you several hundred more words to your vocabulary .
For example , most words ending in “ ion ” in the Latin languages are the same in English .
For example : information / información , donation / donación
Similarly , words across different languages often share the same root word , so drawing on what you already know will make it easier ( e.g. : cheese is fromage in French and fromaggio in Italian ) .
Studies have also shown that when you have mastered a second language , your brain becomes becomes better wired to learn subsequent new languages .
Fret not , it gets better !
6. Local TV , movies , music
photo by Robert Paetz
Watch movies , listen to music , sing songs , and browse newspapers and magazines .
It ’s fun and helps improve your pronunciation and comprehension .
I often stumble when trying to read Chinese script because I do n’t use it enough and there are no phonetic cues in Chinese characters .
But by watching Chinese music videos and following the lyrics , I learned many new characters and also began pronouncing words more accurately .
In the same way , I attuned myself to rapid French prattling by watching French movies on DVD without subtitles and improved my Spanish by paying attention during the dubbed action movies on long bus rides in South America .
Salsa classes have also ensured I know my izquierda ( left ) from my derecha ( right ) !
7. Non-verbal cues
Beyond words , observe locals when they talk .
Be it the Gaelic shrug or a slight tilt of the head , combining body language with a new tongue helps you communicate better .
This is especially important in cultures where language is closely linked to gestures .
For instance , appropriate bowing and greeting in Japanese are inseparable , as with the hand gestures and intonation in Thailand .
Picking up on non-verbal cues added a new dimension to my interactions with Thais , as I learned the appropriate bowing of the head and a deep enough wai ( palms together ) to accompany my greetings .
8 . Get emotional !
Emotive experiences often etch impressions onto our memory .
Make full use of embarrassing / funny / angry experiences by linking them to the new language .
I learned , quite unfortunately , the importance of the special “ ñ ” character in Spanish because saying “ Tengo 24 anos ” instead of “ años ” meant I told everyone I had 24 anuses rather than being 24 years old .
Needless to say , the embarrassment helped correct my pronunciation for good !
Similarly , negotiating with shady cab drivers or nasty vendors also helps you learn numbers rather quickly so you do n’t get ripped off .
9 . A world of friends / then going solo .
While individual classes can be highly beneficial for unsurpassed attention , group classes with friends can greatly aid learning .
Having a friend to practice with helps you get better , and you can also learn from the different mistakes different people make .
On the other hand , venturing out solo in a foreign country forces you to speak with local people–say the person riding next to you on the bus , or standing in line at the market .
It also prevents you relying on a friend with stronger language skills to do the talking for you in key exchanges such as asking for directions or buying food .
10 . Practice at every opportunity before and after you travel .
Ever felt really “ rusty ” and lacking confidence in a language despite having taken classes or used it ( or even mastered it ) at some other time in your life ?
Languages are alive and require exercise .
Find avenues to practice wherever and whenever you can .
For instance , I do n’t get to use French very often in my daily life , so I found a French penpal to exchange emails .
I also keep in touch with people I met in France and French travelers I met in the course of my travels .
Writing in French on FaceBook ( www.facebook.com) walls does wonders and even helps you learn some local slang !
Different Investment Styles For Investing In The Stock Market
There are a lot of investment styles you can use when you participate in the stock market .
We review how they work .
There are many schools of thought when it comes to investing , but the main rules still stand out :
(1) Invest early .
( 2 ) Invest regularly .
( 3 ) Stay invested .
After following these three rules for sometime , you should find yourself happily sitting on a nice pile of dough .
But having waded through so many finance and investing books through the years , I continue to be fascinated by the various investment styles that have been used by so many successful investors and fund managers to generate that pile of dough .
Care to know a little about some of them ?
When you plunk down your money into a stock or fund , you release that money into a market heavily studied by investment strategists and money gurus .
Do n’t worry since many of them are already working for you , when you ’re invested in mutual funds .
But in case you ’ve been doing your own investing without a professional involved , it may be good to know a few of the investing styles used out there by market players who constantly want to gain an edge .
Here are some descriptions of contrasting strategies that exist in the market place and my own confessions about which styles I subscribe to .
Investment Styles For Any Portfolio
# 1 Technical Versus Fundamental Analysis
I ’ve described technical analysis versus fundamental analysis in the past and even included pretty pictures in the mix .
Technical analysis involves using timing indicators and triggers .
I ’ve encountered a few folks who have decided that trading was the way to go to make some bucks .
They play the market in their spare time by trading on volatility .
Traders love it when market prices shift dramatically because that ’s when they make money on their positions .
A quiet and boring market is a money loser for them .
On the other hand , fundamental analysts are most of us who are long - term investors .
We keep the money in the market and minimize trades because we ’re banking on the solid earnings of corporations and a nicely running economy to keep our money growing .
On this note , I ’m definitely on the camp of long term investing .
# 2 Growth Versus Value
Value investors are those who buy lower valued stocks based on fundamentals and corporate balance sheets .
They are looking to buy stocks of businesses that are currently unpopular , underestimated in terms of earnings or undiscovered by the market herd .
They hope to buy stock at low price points in order to reap the largest gains when the tide turns in favor of these stocks .
Meanwhile , growth investors favor stocks that have expected high future growth rates .
It does n’t matter whether a growth stock is expensive in terms of its price / earnings multiple , just as long as its future is bright and earnings remain strong .
Small stocks are often in this realm as they go through growth spurts in a huge way .
I personally put my money in blended funds — those that have equal representation in growth and value equities since I ’d like to have some level of participation in whatever style is fashionable at any one time .
# 3 Contrarian Versus Momentum
Contrarian investors like to go against the herd .
Either buying stocks that everyone hates or going against what the investing crowd does .
When the market dies , they buy .
Most of the time , they just sit quietly in the wings , waiting for the opportunity to buy on dips .
An example of contrarian investing is the Dogs of The Dow approach .
Whereas momentum investors are just the opposite : they are what I call the “ rah - rah ” investors .
They love to pump up the market .
When things are going well , they buy on strength hoping to catch the momentum of the bull .
The “ momo ” investors ’ motto : Buy High , Sell Even Higher .
I do n’t know about you but I find it a challenge to buy when the market has been surging for some time .
I ’m really a pseudo - contrarian at heart .
# 4 Active Versus Passive ( Indexing )
Do you like to fuss over your portfolio ?
If you are , or if you ’ve invested in what they call “ actively managed mutual funds ” , then you ’re pursuing the active investment style .
You ’re an active investor if you tinker with your portfolio a lot to try to beat market returns , quite often racking up a good amount of transactional activity .
If you ’ve sent your money off to funds that have fund managers doing investment research and trades in your behalf , then by association , you ’re an active investor .
If in the meantime your investments are simply tracking an index determined by a third party , then you ’re investing “ passively ” .
So which approach is superior ?
Reports such as those provided by Lipper Analytical Services have trumpeted the fact that most actively managed equity mutual funds underperform the S & P 500 Index .
I ’d love to see some hard statistics on this , for sure , but this is a point that many “ indexers ” and passive investors like to boast about when justifying their love for index funds or index ETFs .
Indexing is a great way to go if you are ready to accept slight under - performance by funds that are tracking their actual indexes .
Funds that follow indexes have slightly lower returns due to minimal management fees and transaction costs incurred by these funds .
After all these years of investing , I ’ve accepted indexing as my core investment style of choice , for the simplicity and convenience it offers me .
# 5 Asset Allocation
It ’s a no-brainer : practicing asset allocation and diversification by utilizing any or all of the aforementioned investment styles to achieve your financial goals are very wise moves .
I ’ve tried quite a number of strategies in the past that involved trading , shorting , leverage , concentrated positions , and so forth and nothing made me more money and gave me less headaches than long term investing using the passive or indexing approach .
For average investors , I think this is the most reasonable and sensible way to invest .
Unfortunately , many decide to go this route only after getting burned by the market at some point in their investing careers .
-ooOoo -
There are other investment styles such as those that involve choosing which market caps you ’d like representation in ( e.g. small to large company investing ) or top down vs bottom up strategies .
Sometimes it ’s a pattern of behavior , at other times , it ’s about following what ’s in fashion .
For further diversification , I ’ve tried to find representation of these styles in my own portfolio as they can co-exist in various capacities .
At first , these various styles can make your head spin but if you ’re going for simplicity , nothing beats passive investing .
It ’s a good place to start … and end !

Sadly , after Pat Tillman , this does n't seem so hard to believe anymore ... and if her death was the result of a Blackwater employee , the administration and Department of Defense will likely do everything in their power ( and given the news yesterday , a few things technically not in their power ) to force this story down the memory hole .
Patriot Ledger ( h/t Heather ) :
Ciara Durkin was home on leave last month and expressed a concern to her family in Quincy :
If something happens to me in Afghanistan , do n't let it go without an investigation .
Durkin , 30 , a specialist with a Massachusetts National Guard finance battalion , was found dead last week near a church at the Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan .
She had been shot once in the head , the Army says .
Fiona Canavan , Durkin 's older sister , said today that when her sister was home three weeks ago , she told family members that she had come across some things that concerned her and had raised objections to others at the base .
‘‘ She was in the finance unit and she said , ‘ I discovered some things I do n't like and I made some enemies because of it . '
Then she said , in her light - hearted way , ‘ If anything happens to me , you guys make sure it gets investigated , ''' Canavan said .
‘‘ But at the time we thought it was said more as a joke . ''[..]
Canavan said that her sister was openly gay , but that the family had no specific reasons to think that had anything to do with her death .
Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during a government meeting in the Kremlin in Moscow March 17 , 2008 .
REUTERS / RIA Novosti/ Kremlin
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday he had received a “ serious document ” from U.S. leader George W. Bush , which offered the prospect of successful progress in relations between the two countries .
“ I recently had an opportunity to speak to the U.S. president and I received his letter , ” Putin said at the start of a meeting with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
“ ... it is a serious document which we have carefully analyzed .
If we manage to agree on its main provisions , we will be able to say that our dialogue is progressing successfully . ”
Putin did not give further details about the letter .
A Pentagon official traveling with Gates said the letter was sent in advance of Rice and Gates ’s trip in order to lay out the issues between the two sides .
“ It dealt with the agenda , what we wish to discuss while we were here and , frankly , unless they were willing to focus on those issues it was probably not worth us doing the trip , ” the official said .
Gates said that he and Rice had come to Moscow “ outside of the usual rotation ” of the bilateral talks in the hope of making progress .
The last meeting between the Russian and U.S. foreign and defense ministers was held in Moscow and the next one had been due to happen in Washington .
This is from last night ’s Congress Daily PM dispatch by Chris Strohm and Christian Bourge :
To break an impasse over legislation overhauling the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , House Democratic leaders are considering the option of taking up a Senate - passed FISA bill in stages , congressional sources said today .
Under the plan , the House would vote separately on the first title of the bill , which authorizes surveillance activities , and then on the bill ’s second title , which grants retroactive legal immunity to telecommunications companies that aided the Bush administration ’s warrantless electronic surveillance activities .
The two would be recombined , assuming passage of both titles .
In this way , Democratic leaders believe they can give an out to lawmakers opposed to the retroactive immunity provision .
Republican leadership sources said their caucus would back such a plan because not only would it give Democratic leaders the out they need , it would provide a political win for the GOP .
It remains to be seen if such a move will placate liberal Democrats who adamantly oppose giving in to the Bush administration on the immunity issue .
House Speaker Pelosi said that Democrats hope to have a solution worked out by March 8 .
But she also indicated that Democrats want language included in the bill that would clarify that FISA is the exclusive means under which the government can conduct electronic surveillance .
The White House and some congressional Republicans have argued that the 2001 authorization of military force to launch the war on terrorism gave Bush the authority to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance .
They also say the president has inherent constitutional authority to do what is necessary to protect the country .
Senators have battled over whether to include so - called exclusivity language in their FISA bill .
In the end , an amendment from Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , that states FISA is the exclusive means for conducting electronic surveillance failed to win a needed 60 votes in a roll call that split mainly along party lines .
This is not a good sign .
If Title I and Title II of the Senate - passed Intelligence Committee bill are voted on separately in the House , the Blue Dogs have the ability to vote with the Republicans and pass the Senate bill in two parts .
Title II , of course , is where retroactive immunity for big telecoms resides .
And I ’ll repeat – this style of voting on the Senate bill would make it more likely the retroactive immunity would pass through Blue Dog Democrats voting with the Republican caucus in the House .
I do n’t know why the House leadership , who has been steadfast against the bad Senate bill , would suddenly let the Senate bill the one that is voted on to move forward .
It makes no sense .
The overwhelming majority of House Democrats do n’t want a bill that includes retroactive immunity and bad wiretapping oversight .
But the Senate bill that would be receiving votes under this deal would be just that .
Clearly in the closed - door negotiations with pro-Constitution Democrats , Jay Rockefeller has refused to budge .
It ’s also interesting that , in the end , the main sticking point in Title I is the Senate bill ’s failure to include exclusivity .
This fight remains one area where the Bush administration is most clearly seeking congressional approval for their radical theories of executive power .
It would be an epic failure if the House passed legislation that did just that .
FISA says it is the exclusive means for conducting electronic surveillance on Americans .
That law did not change when George W. Bush took office and it did not change on September 11 , 2001 .
Exclusivity is one of the key reasons that Bush ’s warrantless wiretapping program was and is illegal .
We cannot let the law be changed to legitimize Bush ’s theories of a unitary executive .
While it ’s still possible , we need to let the House hear from us to say we do n’t want retroactive immunity .
Not in the Senate passed bill .
Not in any other .
Use the contact tool from CREDO Action to tell your rep to oppose retroactive immunity , no matter how it ’s presented to them .
WASHINGTON  President Bush on Saturday further cemented his legacy of fighting for strong executive powers , using his veto to shut down a congressional effort to limit the Central Intelligence Agency ’s latitude to subject terrorism suspects to harsh interrogation techniques that are prohibited by the military and law enforcement agencies .
Mr. Bush vetoed a bill that would have explicitly prohibited the agency from using such interrogation methods , which include waterboarding , a technique in which restrained prisoners are threatened with drowning and that has been the subject of intense criticism at home and abroad .
Mr. Bush ’s veto deepens his battle with increasingly assertive Democrats in Congress over issues at the heart of his legacy .
As his presidency winds down , he has made it clear he does not intend to bend in this or other confrontations with Congress on issues from the war in Iraq to contempt charges against his chief of staff , Joshua B. Bolten , and former counsel , Harriet E. Miers .
Mr. Bush announced the veto in the usual format of his weekly radio address , which is distributed to stations across the country each Saturday .
In his remarks , he unflinchingly defended an interrogation program that has prompted critics to accuse him not only of authorizing torture previously but also of refusing to ban it in the future .
Excavations of an underwater Stone Age archaeological settlement dating back 8000 years took place at the National Oceanography Centre , Southampton between 30 July – 3 August 2007 .
Maritime archaeologists from the Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology ( HWTMA ) have been working at the site just off the Isle of Wight coast .
Divers working at depths of 11 metres have raised sections of the seabed , which have been brought to the NOCS laboratories for excavation .
Garry Momber , Director of HWTMA said : ‘ This is a site of international importance as it reveals a time before the English Channel existed when Europe and Britain were linked .
Earlier excavations have produced flint tools , pristine 8,000 - year - old organic material such as acorns , charcoal and worked pieces of wood showing evidence of extensive human activity .
This is the only site of its kind in Britain and is extremely important to our understanding of our Stone Age ancestors from the lesser - known Mesolithic period .
‘ At first we had no idea of the size of this site , but now we are finding evidence of hearths and ovens so it appears to be an extensive settlement .
We are hoping that this excavation will reveal more artefacts and clues to life in the Stone Age . ’
The team of archaeologists will take the sections to the NOCS laboratories where they will painstakingly excavate through the layers of sediment revealing materials that have lain unseen beneath the seabed for over 8000 years .
Garry Momber has recruited University of Southampton students to help with the work .
Before New York State politics was turned upside down and shaken all around today , we had noted that Hillary Clinton had hinted at the possibility of trying to woo Barack Obama ’s pledged delegates over to her side .
She also trotted out the neologism or seldom phrased “ caucus delegates ” in order to contrast to “ pledged delegates . ”
But an old pal of mine gave me a call today that gave me an idea of something else that may be afoot here .
“ Caucus delegates ” are different from primary delegates .
But not quite in the sense that people are saying .
Not in the sense that they ’re any less legit or meaningful than those produced by primaries .
But they are less fixed .
Here ’s what I mean .
Caucuses rarely if at all vote directly for national convention delegates ( I ’m going to hedge here a bit because I do n’t know the ins and outs of every states rules . )
Generally speaking , they choose delegates to a state convention , which in turn chooses delegates to the national convention .
In some states I think there are even intervening county conventions .
But the key point is that unlike in primaries where the delegates really get picked on primary night , that ’s not what happens with caucuses .
When you have a caucus in state such - and - such and they say Obama got X number of delegates , that ’s just an estimate .
He does n’t really have them yet .
What it really means is that he got X number of delegates and if they all go to the state convention and vote for Obama then he ’ll get the estimated number of delegates , or something very close to that number .
The point is that there ’s a lot of potential haggling and funny - business possible between what ’s actually set in stone now and what people are expecting come convention time .
TPM Reader AO sent in this AP article from February which notes that back in 1984 Gary Hart actually lost delegates through the course of this sifting process .
In Nevada , Obama won 13 delegates and Clinton won 12 .
But if one side is unable to rally its supporters at any step along the way , it risks losing national delegates , much like Gary Hart did in 1984 .
Hart fared well in initial party caucuses when he ran for the Democratic nomination in 1984 , only to see some of those delegates go to Walter Mondale at the state conventions , said Tad Devine , a Democratic strategist who counted delegates for Mondale .
People often ask me if national convention pledged delegates can switch candidates .
And the answer is yes , they can .
But in practice , it ’s highly , highly unrealistic because the people who the candidate chooses to be their delegates are the staunchest of supporters , the absolute campaign true believers .
So as long as that candidate is still in the race , the idea that they ’re going to get wooed away is highly unrealistic .
But way down at the county convention level we ’re talking really big numbers of delegates .
You do n’t know these people quite as well .
Some of them may be new to politics .
You ’ve got to be certain they all show up at the different conventions .
As the same AP article notes , if at any point one campaign or another can’t manage or control their delegates , they can lose some national delegates .
Do n’t get me wrong .
Hillary is n’t going to come out of Kansas with more delegates than Obama .
Any changes would be small .
But every little bit helps at this point .
I heard twenty or thirty possible new delegates tossed around as a possibility today — a number that strikes me as a tall order .
But I ’ll defer to people who know more about the mechanics to decide whether that ’s credible or not .
The key point to remember is that on balance , the party regulars tend to be Hillary supporters , at least disproportionately so .
And they ’re the ones most familiar with the process , possibly most likely to show ( though that ’s very debateable ) .
On the other hand , it would be surprising if the Obama campaign which has proved so skillful at working caucuses would drop the ball in the subsequent stages of the process .
It ’s not the biggest part of the equation .
But it ’s another moving part you should have your eye on .
Late Update :
This post at Daily Kos has some anecdotal evidence ( of course unconfirmed ) that some of this shaking out is already happening .
Hot on the heals of a recent study that found that neuroscience jargon made unlikely scientific claims more believable , comes a new study , covered by the BPS Research Digest , that found that simply showing a picture of a brain scan made bogus science more convincing .
David McCabe and Alan Castel presented university students with 300 - word news stories about fictional cognitive research findings that were based on flawed scientific reasoning .
For example , one story claimed that watching TV was linked to maths ability , based on the fact that both TV viewing and maths activate the temporal lobe .
Crucially , students rated these stories to be more scientifically sound when they were accompanied by a brain image , compared with when the equivalent data were presented in a bar chart , or when there was no graphical illustration at all .
McCabe and Castel repeated the experiment with a control condition featuring a topographical activation map – it ’s just as visually complex as a brain image but it does n’t look like a brain .
These stories were rated as more credible when accompanied by a brain image compared with a topographical map , showing that the allure of brain images is not merely down to their complexity .
Most of these sorts of reasoning errors are due to the fact that the public at large still thinks about the mind and brain as separate , loosely connected systems .
The influence of ‘ placebo science - a- likes ’ is n’t a problem restricted to neuroscience , of course .
I suspect adding the language of genetics will have a similar confidence - boosting effect , regardless of the actual claim being made .
If you want to know the nitty gritty about how fMRI brain scans can mislead , I highly recommend the sardonic guide , How to Lie with fMRI Statistics .

If you have one of the new MacBook Pros ( early 2008 ) and noticed some vertical display striping and graphic glitches , evidence is mounting that you may not be crazy after all .
No , this is n't a hidden new " abstract art " feature in Safari
After picking up one of these machines with the 512MB NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT card , I began noticing these glitches myself .
They typically appear after waking the machine from sleep , and only a restart seems to fix them .
The glitches manifest as quick , colorful flashes when moving and scrolling windows , as well as garbled text and images like the screenshot above .
Image courtesy of Apple discussion user " docfilm "
If an Apple discussion thread ( that is 220 replies strong and growing ) is anything to go by , garbled images and text may be the least of the new MacBook Pro 's problems .
Users in that thread are reporting striping issues with MacBook Pro displays where the display itself exhibits bands of dark vertical stripes across the entire display .
This looks like it could be a pinching issue with the display 's construction , and if so , it would n't be the first time Apple 's portables have exhibited the problem .
Some replies suggest that the issue could actually be software , stating that turning off the " automatically adjust brightness as ambient light changes " issue can stop the vertical striping , or even make it disappear .
Other users report that the problem appears and disappears every few days , while another group reports that Apple replaced their machines and have not seen the problem resurface .
Apple has yet to officially acknowledge either of these problems , so contacting Apple support and commenting in large threads like this may be a good way to finally get a response if you 're experiencing this problem .
Past investigations have had mixed results .
Some experiments suggested that color terms influenced people in the moment of perception .
Others suggested that the language effect kicked in only after some basic perception occurred .
The consensus was that different ways to label color probably did not affect the perception of color in any systematic way .
Last year , Lera Boroditsky and colleagues published a study in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showing that language could significantly affect how quickly perceptions of color are categorized .
Russian and English speakers were asked look at three blocks of color and say which two were the same .
Russian speakers must distinguish between lighter blues , or goluboy , and darker blues , siniy , while English speakers do not have to , using only “ blue ” for any shade .
If the Russians were shown three blue squares with two goluboy and one siniy , or the other way around , they picked the two matching colors faster than if all three squares were shades from one blue group .
English makes no fundamental distinction between shades of blue , and English speakers fared the same no matter the mix of shades .
In two different tests , subjects were asked to perform a nonverbal task at the same time as the color - matching task .
When the Russians simultaneously carried out a nonverbal task , they kept their color - matching advantage .
But when they had to perform a verbal task at the same time as color - matching , their advantage began to disappear .
The slowdown suggested that the speed of their reactions did not result just from a learned difference but that language was actively involved in identifying colors as the test was happening .
Two other recent studies also demonstrated an effect of language on color perception and provided a clue as to why previous experimental results have been inconclusive .
In The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Dr. Paul Kay of the International Computer Science Institute at Berkeley and colleagues hypothesized that if language is dominant on the left side of the brain , it should affect color perception in the right visual field .
( The right visual field is connected to the left side of the brain , and vice versa . )
English - speaking subjects were shown a ring of 12 small squares that were all the same color except an odd one on the left or the right .
If the odd square was shown to the right visual field and it was from a completely different color category in English , like a green square compared to the ring of blue squares , then subjects were quick to identify it as different .
If the odd square shown to the right visual field was the same basic color as the ring of squares , perhaps just being a different shade of blue , subjects were not as fast to recognize the difference .
If the odd square was shown to the left visual field , it did n’t matter if it was a different color or only a different shade .
The extent to which language affected color perception depended on the side of the brain being used .
Scuffle at the Wilshire
My colleague Jeffrey Ressner was at Hillary 's fundraiser last night at the Wilshire Theater in Los Angeles , and captured the audio ( .wma ) of a really jarring scene : a woman dragged out in handcuffs , screaming that she was the only black supporter of Hillary there .
( She was n't . )
Secret Service , Ressner e-mails , declined to comment .
Clinton herself had some fairly strong stuff to say , particularly on Florida and Michigan : " If we do n't figure out Michigan and Florida , our candidate will lack the legitimacy that we want , " she told the crowd .
Also , a burqa joke :
" I was among the very first to speak out against the Taliban .
... I was invited by the Taliban to visit [ but I declined ] , " she said .
" Some days I may think I want to wear a burqa , but I do n't want to do that . "
At the end of the event , the music played to usher people out , but Hillary stopped the music and implored the crowd to donate .
" I need your help .
I 'm being outspent , " she said .
UPDATE : A Clinton volunteer at the Wilshire writes that he witnessed what happened before the woman was arrested :
" Not only did she attack another person at the event ( she literally bit a woman , which drew blood and required bandages ) , she was screaming profanities and tried to urinate in the doorway to the theater !
She was both verbally and physically confrontational to volunteers ( I was one of them ) and to the Secret Service , as well ! "

After being called off Friday , the on- again , off - again cyber attack against CNN's
Web site again picked up steam early this week , according to network security analysts .
At its peak , the attack has sucked up 100MB / S in bandwidth , enough to slow the news Web site for some visitors .
" That 's a decent - sized attack , " said Jose Nazario , a senior security engineer with Arbor Networks .
" Globally speaking , it 's probably garden - variety . "
Organizers had originally called for the attack to be launched on April 19 .
But they soon called off their efforts with one organizer , CN - Magistrate , saying that " too many people are aware of it , and the situation is chaotic . "
CN - Magistrate soon disbanded his Web site devoted to these attacks and dropped out of public view .
Hackers had launched some low - intensity attacks against CNN ahead of the April 19 deadline , but on Sunday , another group calling itself HackCNN picked up the attack .
CNN visitors experienced a noticeable slowdown during the early hours of Sunday and Monday , researchers said .
This group also managed to deface a Sports Network Web site ( sports.si.cnn.com ) , replacing sports scores with slogans such as " Tibet was , is , and always will be a part of China ! "
Although a CNN spokeswoman said that the Web site was not taken down by the attacks , Web monitoring company Netcraft said that some of its sensors were unable to get a response from CNN servers in Phoenix , San Jose , California , London and Pennsylvania for about three hours on Sunday .
On Monday , response times to CNN were as slow as two - tenths of a second , Netcraft said .
CNN did slow down the rate at which network traffic from the Asia - Pacific region was able to reach its
Web site , the spokeswoman said .
Nazario said that a botnet network of hacked computers has now been involved in the attacks , but the hackers have mostly relied on voluntary downloads to spur their efforts .
Angered by Western coverage of unrest in Tibet by CNN , organizers had hoped to knock the Web site offline using tactics similar to those seen in recent attacks on Internet servers run by the Church of Scientology and the Baltic nation of Estonia .
Hackers made easy - to - use Web attacking tools available for download on hackcnn.com and then encouraged as many computers as possible to join in on the attack .
" People would purposely infect themselves with malware released on behalf of Chinese hacktivists to automatically utilize their Internet bandwidth for the purpose of a coordinated attack against a particular site , " said Dancho Danchev , a Bulgarian security researcher , via instant message .
" These guys are young .
they 're usually 20 - 25 years old , college students , they spend their life online , " said Scott Henderson , a retired U.S. intelligence analyst who has been following the CNN attacks on his blog .
" It is really a way of expressing themselves . "
Security experts said that the Estonian and CNN attacks more closely resembled a cyber riot than anything else , with no central figure in command and many different groups , loosely coordinating their activities and attacking computers in many ways .
The attacks can be hard to stop at first , and they tend to garner attention to the attacker 's political cause , Nazario said .
" We 're going to see this again because it 's effective to some degree . "
The addition of RESTful routing and the #to_param method in Rails has undoubtedly improved both the ease and usefulness of URL generation in Rails apps .
However , there has come to be a rather insidious tendency to have an auto - generated id as the true reference for a given item .
This may make sense for some or even many apps , but by and large records should be referred to by their content , not their ids , in URLs if at all possible .
With this goal in mind , I have released from_param , a simple addition to ActiveRecord that makes it dead simple to use better URL finders .
Example
First of all , from_param is meant to simply be the complement of to_param , that is , you should be able to pass Model.from_param ( some_parameter ) the same way you would pass Model.from_xml( some_xml ) .
Let ’s examine how this works in practice :
class User < ActiveRecord :: Base def to_param " #{id}-#{login.downcase} " end end class UsersController < ApplicationController # GET /users /1- mbleigh def show @user = User.from_param( params [ :id ] ) # => < User id=1 login= " mbleigh " > end end 1 class User & lt ; ActiveRecord :: Base def to _ param " #{id}-#{login.downcase} " end end class UsersController & lt ; ApplicationController # GET /users /1- mbleigh def show @user = User.from_param( params [ :id ] ) # => < User id=1 login= " mbleigh " > end end
Simple enough , and it should look very familiar except that instead of a User.find or User.find_by_id , we have User.from_param .
In fact , that ’s exactly what this code does : from_param by default will call find_by_id since that is how the default to_param is configured .
Now let ’s take something a little more complicated : a blog post title .
I definitely do n’t want an id in the URL if it ’s a permalink , so how can I make an arbitrary parameter found as easily as the id ?
Simple , just add a param column to your table !
Take a look :
class Post < ActiveRecord :: Base def to_param " #{created_at.strftime ( " %Y - %m-%d " )}-#{title.gsub ( " " , " - " ).downcase.gsub ( /[ ^a -z0-9 - ] / , " " ) } " end end class PostsController < ApplicationController # GET / posts/2008-04-26-from-param-plugin-released @post = Post.from_param( params [ :id ] ) # => < Post title= " From Param : Plugin Released " created_at = " 2008-04 - 26 " > end 1 class Post & lt ; ActiveRecord :: Base def to _ param " #{created_at.strftime ( " % Y - % m - % d " )}-#{title.gsub ( " " , " - " ).downcase.gsub (/[ ^a -z0-9 -] / , " " ) } " end end class PostsController & lt ; ApplicationController # GET / posts/2008-04-26-from-param-plugin-released @post = Post.from_param( params [ :id ] ) # => < Post title= " From Param : Plugin Released " created_at = " 2008-04 -26 " > end
From Param will auto-magically save the to_param of your model to the specified parameter column ( defaults to “ param ” but you can set it by calling set_param_column ) and then automatically know to find by that column if it exists when from_param is called .
This way , all you have to do is define a to_param that will be unique to your record and everything else is handled for you !
This plugin is really quite simple , but it establishes a convention that I feel has been missing from Rails for some time : a standard method to call to retrieve a record based on its URL parameter .
Installation
To install the plugin on Edge Rails or Rails 2.1 and greater :
script / plugin install git://github.com/mbleigh/from_param.git 1 script / plugin install git : //github.com/mbleigh/from_param.git
On earlier versions of Rails :
git clone git://github.com/mbleigh/from_param.git vendor/plugins/from_param 1 git clone git : //github.com/mbleigh/from_param.git vendor/plugins/from_param

If you have any suggestions for expanding the usefulness of the plugin or run into any problems , please report them on the From Param Lighthouse Project .

For those of us who grew up playing videogames in arcades , hearing that computerized voice in WarGames was the moment when gaming became more than a frantic quest for quarters .
That voice — tempting Matthew Broderick into nearly setting off a global thermonuclear war — signaled a new epoch : Reaching the next level in Donkey Kong was n't enough anymore .
Games could be serious .
Two decades on , that revelation is now conventional wisdom .
From the military 's use of America 's Army for recruiting to quarterbacks researching tactics via Madden NFL , we 've gone from games representing life to becoming life .
Ask yourself :
Do you believe that your club moves have improved from playing Dance Dance Revolution ?
Have your driving skills matured because of Gran Turismo ?
Does cleaning out your RSS reader remind you of playing Pac - Man ?
Does the action of the iPhone 's bouncing icons recall Mario Bros .?
Have you tried to convince your friends that the invasion of Sudoku and Tetris into your dreams is proof of high - level brain activity ?
Welcome to the arcade called you .
Of course , the basics of gameplay — competing against opponents , setting records , winning prizes — are as old as human civilization .
But the gaming mindset has now become pervasive .
We use game models to motivate ourselves , to answer questions , to find creative solutions .
For many , life itself has turned into a game .
Our online lives are just twists on the videogame leaderboards , where we jockey to get our blog a higher rank on Technorati and compete to acquire more friend - adds on MySpace than the next guy .
Even on more serious social networks like Facebook and Linked In , you rack up friends , accrue hipster points , try to score high on identity tests .
At iminlikewithyou.com — a dating site with bidding , competition , winners , and losers — you pose questions ( or " games , " in the parlance of the service ) for potential mates to bid on , and the resulting interactions are less stilted and artificial than conventional online dating services .
That 's right , a gamelike environment feels more real than trying to mimic the experience of real - world dating .
And the gaming mentality continues right into the real world , where we are finding ways to compete for bragging rights in even the most mundane activities .
Chorewars.com lets you turn the grind of household tasks into a quest for experience points .
And who are those Prius hypermilers , obsessed with optimizing their driving techniques to wring every possible mile out of a gallon of gas , but Forza Motorsport players honing their skillz for a perfect lap ?
Pop culture , too , abounds with game scenarios .
Turn on the TV : Reality hits like Survivor , The Apprentice , and * American Idol *use psychological game theory to create competition , intrigue , and adventure .
Even shows like Lost and 24 , with their respective number theory and time obsessions , seem influenced by gameplay .
( Lost is to The Legend of Zelda as 24 is to Pitfall ! — it makes sense ! )
And the burgeoning phenomenon of ARGs ( alternative reality games ) — which pull the narrative thread of videogames into real - world environments — demonstrates that there 's no escaping the game onslaught .
With ARGs seeping into TV shows and commercials , you may be participating in a game without even realizing it .
And as we play through our lives , we do n't reach for a Coke — the pause that refreshes .
Instead we grab a high - octane energy drink , a liquid power - up to refill our health bar .
As games and the gaming mindset take over our lives , they 've also gone professional .
In baseball , the cult of stats - guru Bill James has let a legion of fantasy baseball players enter the ranks of real - life scouts .
There are competitive eaters , air guitar champions , pro gamers , poker players , WoW gold farmers — all now legitimate occupations .
Of course , some gamers deal in the semi-legitimate .
With billions of dollars at stake , the line has blurred between principled players and unscrupulous schemers .
Spammers and Digg manipulators represent the dark side , but their tactics differ only slightly from those of earnest search engine optimizers and prank - driven Google bombers .
" Gaming the system " has become the prevailing narrative of our time .
How did we end up with a world we play like a game ?
It 's no historical coincidence that gaming ascended right along with the rise of the information age .
As the ever - rising flood of new data threatened to inundate our lives , we developed tools to organize all that information — sort it , filter it , cut it , mix it .
Desktop editing apps let us manage our data , but they also let us manipulate it .
As we got better at controlling pixels and bits , games became a handy metaphor .
And more than a metaphor .
Like a Sim city come to life , we 've moved from a society that creates goods to one that solves puzzles .
As Broderick 's character in WarGames asks the computer at one point , " Is it a game , or is it real ? "
The computer , which has now taken on a human identity , replies , " What 's the difference ? "

No , not idiotic fiction from the simian world , but a new kind of celebrity stalking ; stalking by a celebrity ( Ricky ) of that shaved Mancunian idiot Karl Pilkington .

Karl saw the blog and was a bit worried how the past week 's events came across .
He wants me to point out that he does n't do things solely for the money but , because he " is n't in the same boat as me " , he does need to get paid for his time .
The good news is , he is talking to me again and even said he has not ruled out a reunion podcast in the the future .
Thanks for winding down the campaign and for being so supportive .
Cheers , Ricky .
P.S. He really does have a head like a fucking orange .

The End
I am sorry to say I have failed .
Karl has decided he does n't want to do another show .
Well he does n't want to do it for free .
He says he has bills to pay .
I offered to pay him myself but he would n't accept that either .
I think that made him feel a bit stupid .
I should n't really have offered but I so wanted to do another one .
I then tried to get him to do it as a favour but then he said no altogether .
The whole thing annoyed him so much that he said he would n't enjoy doing it now .
Maybe he 's tired of playing the fool .
I was surprised he would n't do this for me but it 's up to him .
This will be the last blog entry .
I will leave this up for a few days then remove it all together .
I suggest for Karl 's sake you end the campaign too .
I think you all did marvelously and I know you did so with nothing but affection and hope .
You 'll always have him the way he was on the old podcasts and I 'm sure it's not the last you 'll see of Karl ( I do n't know whether he 'll talk to me again though )
Thank you all so much for listening over the past few years .
It has been my absolute pleasure .

I spoke to Karl .
He is staying with Auntie Nora at the moment .
Unbe - fucking - lievable .
He 's doing no work at all - just swanning around .
The blog and the poster campaign is irritating him more and more .
1 . He can't believe I kept it up this long and
2 . He can't believe how it 's taken off .
So today he tried to appeal to my forgiving side .
He just casually said " Let 's knock it on the head now .
It 's getting a bit silly . "
I said , " I 'll stop when I can give people a definite date for a new one - off show .
Just to say goodbye . "
He mentioned getting his agent involved to talk about the money and I said that there probably would n't be any money .
He said , " Why are we doing it then ? "
I said to give something back to all the people would bought the millions of podcasts .
He shouted , " Give something back ?
It 's not like I'm Bono for fuck 's sake . "
I laughed and said I would call him tomorrow .
I am trying my best and when I get him into that studio I will squeezed the little Manc twat 's head like never before .
This could be a long war .

Bong ..... Poster campaign - amazing .
Even the one that says I 'm the most annoying man in the world - an award 's an award .
Bong ..... Karl definitely moving to Manchester in a year or so .
Podcast ..... one final show possibly in June .
I was listening to the last ever radio show today .
What a fucking shambles .
I loved it though .

I love the new comic strip .
The insects are pulling together to rally for Pilkers .
I can't wait for the episode when he saves them all from drowning in the pool on holiday .
That 's like their D - day .
Also they could just be witness to all the other stuff he 's done in his life .
The choking on an ice pop , the hanging by his satchel , and of course the split tennis ball .
( Maybe not )
What were the three flies , trying to have group sex , thinking when Karl was watching them ?
I hope these questions and more will be answered .
Stay tuned .
I will .

Hi Chimplings
Good work with the posters .
Nice to see Karl In Canal
St after all his comments about that particular community over the past few years .
I went into a chinese restaurant with Karl a few weeks ago and he looked round and said , " I 'm asking for it in here . "
Maybe we could get together a list of all the people he 's insulted .
It might take a while .
I love this

I 've heard no reports of phone - ins being hijacked by monkey fans shouting citrus based insults .
Come on guys .
I 've seen no mentions of spherical craniums on any Amazon reviews .
Add a review to the top ten albums , singles and books .
Something like " I loved this CD because it is almost as round as Karl Pilkington 's head " .
Go Go Go .
Also I have been criticised by true fans for making my Karl quiz too easy .
OK try these for size .
1 . What would Karl do if he was a slug ?
2 . What would Karl do if he was a beetle ?
3 . What would Karl do if he was a maggot in a spider ?

I have very nearly convinced Karl to do some new material .
It may only be a one - off but it 's something .
He still has reservations but I 'm quietly confident .
He is still moaning about stuff and said today that " no one cares about the podcasts .
We 're not even number one any more . "
" That 's because we have n't done any new material for fucking years , " I said .
So , people here 's the plan .
Keep downloading the free podcasts .
Even if you 've already heard them .
They 're free so it does n't matter .
Download them 10 times each .
When we 're number one I will get him to agree on a new podcast .
If that does n't work I will make some fresh orange juice out of his stupid little Manc head .
Here 's a quiz for Karl experts .
1 . Why would n't Karl donate his eyes ?
2 . Why does Karl 's dad like telephone boxes ?
3 . Why does n't Karl self examine his testicles ?

Karl went to the Natural History Museum today .
He enjoyed it but said it was too busy .
" There was loads of kids standing in front of the exhibits thinking ' when can we go to MacDonalds ? '
Get 'em out . "
He then said there was a stuffed sloth in a glass cabinet .
" It was as active as the one in the zoo . "
I 'm not sure Karl and culture mix .

I cannot believe the effort you guys have put in .
( Particularly the new video appeal by Ross and the big poster .
More of those please . )
Well it 's working .
Not only did Karl politely request I call the campaign off today , but he 's thinking about doing a special one off show as part of a special event .
I can't tell you about that yet but I just wanted to say " We shall never surrender . "

Karl is laying low .
And by that I mean doing fuck all .
I emailed him earlier saying " what 's going on ? "
He replied with " Nowt mate .
Going to bed ' cos me back 's hurting . "
Next he 'll lose the use of his legs , if he does n't get off his arse .
The poster campaign is picking up speed though .
We 're spanning the globe .
Another great song too .
We 'll have enough for an album soon .
Let me know when a DJ is brave enough to play a song called ' Karl Pilkington has a head like a fucking orange ' on their radio show .
It sounds like job for my cool NY friends Opie and Anthony .
Here 's a clip from a few years ago in which I promise never to wind Karl up again .

To everyone around the world who has put up a poster ; I 'm proud of you .

Well done everyone with the posters .
I 'm really impressed .
I 've had a few ideas to up the ante a bit .
Are there any Entertainments officers or events managers out there ?
Come on !
Cover your student unions and campuses .
Bands and DJs , dedicate a song to the monkey brained twat .
Office workers send e-mails .
Everyone , call every phone - in show on every radio station and point out that a certain part of Karl 's anatomy resembles a citrus fruit live on air .
Be a hero .
Go on to amazon.co.uk and .com and leave a thousand comments on every book , dvd and album .

People , countrymen , friends of the earth .
It is now time to fight for all we believe in .
To fight for what we know is right .
It will not be an easy time .
It may not be a peaceful time .
It will be a time of joyful struggle .
It will take resolve and a guided will .
And I know you will stand as one .
Brothers apart , bound by a common goal .
To adorn this world with plumboid gimpocity .
A testicular faced uber - twat .
A pilkumbular pandemic of mancunian proportions will reign globally .
But let us never forget our three main targets .
Central London , Kent and Manchester .
Call Xfm , Capitol , Invicta , Key , all stations in these areas .
And posters .
Posters .
Posters .
Everywhere .
A warm , thick div-cloud over our lives .
He may not be himself at the moment .
He may be lost .
But you can find him and restore him to his former glory .
Let us now remember him how he once was .
And how he can be again .
Forever Karl .

Karl is going to Manchester again today to visit Auntie Nora .
It 's not even the weekend and he 's doing no work at all .
He 's basically given up .
" I 'm just gonna do me book .
I 'm sick of pointless meetings with people in telly , " he told me .
This blog was seen by 174,000 unique users last week .
More than the film blog .
He is such an idiot .
I think he 's afraid that if he gets on TV people will shout " coconut head " at him in the street ; and " you monkey brained twonk " or " you stupid little bald mank twat you 've got a head like a fucking orange . "
Well why do n't you do that anyway .
Come on .
Get those posters up .
And I think I know why he is disillusioned with the entertainment industry .
Because he thinks that TV shows like this could happen .
Anyway he's in Manchester visiting Auntie Nora .
" Hello Karl .
Come in , sit down , hold your nose and start the stop watch I 'm going for a new world record ...

Karl called me today .
I had just got to The Ivy .
So I stood outside the restaurant by the cloakroom to take the call .
" Hello , " I said .
" Alright , " he mumbled quietly .
" What have you been doing all day , " I said .
" I took me coat to the dry cleaners , " he said .
" That 's it ? " I said .
" I 've been reading about fish .
When Jesus fed the 5000 with 2 fish and them loaves , was that each ? "
" Of course it was n't each .
Why would that be a miracle ?
He had 2 fish and five loaves and he fed them all . "
We discussed the fact that with 2 fish and five loaves of bread the fish sandwiches would be very bready , but a miracle none the less .
Then Karl said , " were n't the disciples fishermen ?
Why only two fish ?
And where did all the bread come from .
Who was the baker ? "
I said " I 'd better go .
I call you tomorrow . "
All the time I was on the phone to Karl , a young chap had been standing by .
It turns out he was waiting to speak to me .
He introduced himself and said he was a fan of my work and in particular the podcasts .
I told him that I 'd just been speaking to Karl on the phone .
And he said , " I thought you were ; when I heard you trying to explain feeding the 5000 .
I was going to interrupt you and say , 'has he really got a head like a fucking orange ? " "
Well he has got a head like a fucking orange , and someone has gone to the trouble of proving it here .

We need to employ more drastic measures .
Karl is digging his heals in and going deep under cover .
We need to flush him out .
I 've had an idea .
We need to get a poster of the little egg - headed twat in every window in central London , Kent and Manchester .
It should just say " Congratulations to local boy Karl Pilkington .
World 's roundest head . "
Like this .
Beg shop keepers to put it in the window for a week , Put it in your own window .
Come on .
I 'll let you know the very first time he sees one and where it is .
It could be yours .
Thank you .

Karl is living the good life now .
When he is not buying property around the country he is sitting at home with his finger up his arse moaning .
But today he really put the work in .
He did an interview and photo shoot for GQ magazine .
He thinks he 's David Beckham .
It 's not all glamour apparently .
When he arrived at the studio it was pointed out that he had dried bird shit down the back of his coat .
" I wonder how long that 's been there ? " he said .
" Probably days .
I 've been in and out of museums and art galleries all week .
I must 've looked like a walking Jackson Pollock . "
Maybe his life has n't changed that much after all .
" And me boiler 's still fucked but no one will believe me . "
He mentions his boiler and swears in the same sentence .
Here 's what his fans think of that .

This blog has backfired .
The more I do it the more Karl annoys me .
Lazy , grumpy Manc gimp .
He does n't want to do anything .
I think it 's annoying him too , but the profit margin of irritation is n't enough for me .
To punish me for this diary he said today that he definitely wo n't do another podcast now .
" Why ? " I said .
He replied , " how can I talk about me dodgy boiler now !
Everyone will go ' fuck off whingeing , you 've got three houses y' cunt ! ' "

Greetings chimp cadets .
Karl is back in London and is as miserable as ever .
" Why do n't we do a new podcast ? " I asked for the 50th time .
" No point , " he said .
" Why ? " I said
" We 've done it all .
Steve gets annoyed if I mention insects , he 's talked about girls and holidays , and you 've told them you like cheese .
Nothing left to talk about . "
Incredible .
Talking of Karl 's obsession with insects .
When he was at the zoo last week apparently he spent 40 minutes looking at a stick - insect .
" 40 minutes ? " I said .
" Yeah , it was amazing .
A kid had a stick - insect at school and it was shit .
The one at the zoo looked exactly like a stick . "
You 're probably having the same thought I did when he said this to me ...
" Did Karl spend 40 minutes looking at a stick ? "
By the way we 've disappeared from the top of the audiobook chart on iTunes .
They were a bit concerned that for the last two years , we had been filling the top 3 positions of any chart they put us in .
So they decided to move things around to give some other people a chance .
However you can still find us and they 've reassured us we will pop up again soon somewhere .
Serves us right for being the most popular download .
Here 's a classic insect clip with an amazing new photo illustration .
A really brilliant piece of work .

Hello Monkey Fans .
Chimp boy is still in Manchester .
I do n't know if they 've decided on a house yet but I will keep you informed .
I noticed that Karl is looking more simian by the day .
His long arms are very hairy and as he approaches 40 he should start to stoop a bit hopefully .
Maybe he should buy a cage instead of a third house .
That reminds me ; he went to the zoo the other day and told me he was annoyed that the sloth had such a big enclosure .
" Why should n't it have ? " I said .
He replied , " It does n't need it .
It does n't move .
They could just stick it in a wardrobe . "
Amazing .

Karl is still in Manchester and now he is n't even returning my calls .
I 've just left a message saying I 'm going to the put the picture up of him with hair unless he calls me .
He was out of contact the entire time he was driving up there as he has n't got a hands - free phone so does n't answer any calls .
That will be the same driving back too .
Why does n't he take the train ?
That way he could work and answer his phone .
Maybe it 's because he's had odd experiences when travelling by rail .
Karl just called .
Not only is he away again , but the reason he had n't called was that he'd forgotten his phone charger .
He was calling from a house phone .
I said , " you just do n't care any more do you ? "
He said , " I 've been doing stuff all day . "
" What stuff ? " I said .
" Lookin ' at houses , " he replied .
He 's buying another house !
Fuck me .
He 's buying a house in Manchester but " not nowhere I 've lived before . "
Maybe there wo n't be another podcast after all .
I can't imagine him being in one place long enough to actually record anything .

Karl drove to Manchester again today for the long weekend .
Another holiday .
It annoys me a bit because he 's not doing any work .
The podcasts are still selling and he 's just sitting back and receiving a fat cheque every month .
I am too but I 'm doing something towards it ; I 'm trying to create new content and motivate him to give a little back .
" Why are you doin ' anything for them ? " he said .
( He is referring to the people who say that the podcast is scripted and that his real name is Graham . )
I said , " I 'm not doing anything for them , I 'm doing stuff for the other 99 % of the people who like what we do and still listen to the podcasts . "
I think I 'm getting through to him a bit as he eventually said he might do another show after I 've finished the movie .
So maybe in the autumn you can hear fresh talk of ghosts , Auntie Nora , and maybe even monkey news - the original Monkey news , not this blog .
I found an amazing photo of Karl on my iPhone that I took last night at dinner .
Suzanne stands behind him and hangs her hair over his egg - like bonce to create the illusion of a chimp with a fringe .
Unfortunately I had promised not to put it on the blog before he let me take it .
I can't go back on my word but I will persuade him to change his mind somehow .
Here 's a clip of Karl on the subject of hair where there should n't be hair

Karl and Suzanne came round for dinner tonight .
Karl arrived first as Suzanne said she did n't know about the meal .
Karl swore on his mother 's life that he told her last night .
She said , " I do n't remember " .
Karl said , " Of course I told you .
Why did n't I text you today asking what was for dinner ?
Because we were eating out . "
I said , " Do you text her every day to ask her what 's for dinner ? "
" Yes , " they said .
According to Suzanne the first she heard about it was at 6.45 pm tonight .
" Well you should 've known something was up cos we usually eat by then , " explained Karl
" We usually eat at about 8.30 , " said Suzanne .
Karl insisted , " No . Last night when Location Location Location started , we 'd already finished eating , cos you were patting my back cos I had wind . "
She was patting his back cos he had wind !
Patting his back like a big bald six - foot baby .
Unbelievable .
Karl had a brain - scan this week because he kept getting headaches .
Luckily everything was normal .
" Well ... , " said Suzanne , " it looked very round . "
I could not believe my luck .
Even his fucking brain is round .

Karl has realised that I 'm not getting bored with this blog .
He has n't realised that the more it annoys him the more focused I am .
He is now trying hard not to tell me anything .
He is failing miserably .
He called me today and said , " What do you know about the brain ? "
He is writing his new book at the moment .
It is about " Knowledge and learning and that . "
I said , " Well I told you all about the fact that it 's divided into two lobes joined by the corpus callosum . "
Silence .
He 'd forgotten everything already .
( I 'd spent ages the other week telling him about 1950 's experiments where people had their corpus callosums cut and how the two sides of their brain could no longer communicate with each other . )
He said , " We start with a woman 's brain . "
I said , " Well we all start out as women , ; the foetus ... "
" No , " he said , " even after we 're born we 've got a woman 's brain . "
I was intrigued .
" What do you mean ? " I said .
" I do n't question your knowledge , " he said .
" I 'm not questioning it .
What do you mean though ? "
" Just got it off the internet , " he said .
Of course he did .
Talking of the internet , thanks to all the websites that have been plugging this blog .
Someone on one of the forums wondered if I was doing this to annoy Karl or entertain fans of the podcasts ...
Well both actually .
And the beauty of it is , the more it entertains people , the more it annoys Karl .
It 's the perfect crime .
If you run a website or a fanzine or work on a radio station , please plug this blog and talk about the orange headed chimp - gimp that is forever Karl Pilkington .
Make posters if you own a shop and stick them in the window .
Especially , if you live in Kent .
Call Invicta radio and dedicate a song to him .
People !
Friends !
Monkey fans !
Come together and annoy Karl .
He is your leader .
He is your messiah !
He is your God !
And he fucking hates it .
Bear witness to Karl 's heavenly judgement here .
Entry No. 3
Karl is annoyed with me .
" Why did you mention I lived in Kent ? " was the whinge .
" Kent 's a big place , " I said .
" No one will find you from that . "
" They might , " he said , " you 've given 'em a challenge . "
" Do n't talk shit , " I said .
" How will they find you just from knowing you 're in Kent ?
You gave away more when you said on The Culture Show that I chased you through the streets of central London to your flat . "
" Yeah but the interesting bit in that story was the fact that a forty two year old world famous actor was chasing me through the streets .
Not the fact that I lived in central London . "
Good point .
I laughed and said , " imagine if you start getting notes put through the door saying ' Karl Pilkington do you live here ' ? "
Karl said , " I would n't worry .
Not even the postman can get that right .
Most of my letters are to Karl fucking Dilkington . "
Entry No. 2
Karl is still in Kent .
He says there is no point going into London anymore as " everyone tries to rip you off there " ( he got two parking tickets in one day ) .
He is also " sick of doing pointless meetings with people who do n't know what they want . "
So he stayed down in Kent " playin ' scrabble ' n ' that . "
I pointed out that if he did some work he would have money coming in as well as out .
He said , " I 'm doin ' another book and I can do that anywhere . "
I said , " But you 're not doing the book ; you 're playing scrabble . "
He replied , " I 've learnt two new words that can go in the book . "
" What are they ? " I said .
" Tittle , " he said .
( So look forward to reading that word in the new publication ) " What was the other word ? " I said .
( long pause ) " Ca n't remember . " Idiot .
There are still a few teething problems with his new coastal home .
He had to have someone come round and sort out the windows .
" That 's 300 quid a window , " he moaned .
" How many windows do you have , " I asked .
" Loads , " he said .
" It 's like a fuckin ' greenhouse . "
Well we all know about people who live in glasshouses ...

Since charging for the podcasts
The Ricky Gervais show sold about 2 million episodes ( plus a further 48 million free downloads ) .
We 're not saying how much Karl made from this but he now has a house in Kent as well as his Marylebone flat , which he keeps on as his office .
We 're not sure why he has an office as he rarely does any work now .
When he's not in his Kent retreat he is visiting either his girlfriend 's parents in Manchester or his own parents in Wales ( he did both the last two weekends for example ) .
He is in Kent this weekend .
Whenever Ricky phones him and asks what he is up to work - wise , Karl usually replies " nothin ' - no point " .
Karl refuses to do any further podcasts because he is " sick of people moaning " .
He still reads forums .
Comments like " It 's definitely scripted " and " Karl is a character whose real name is Graham " have annoyed Karl so much that last week he told Ricky that he wishes he could turn the internet off to see their " stupid fuckin ' faces " .
Apparently they do n't like it when Karl swears either .
So with no more Pilkington available Ricky has decided to write a blog to report Karl 's every move .
Ricky is doing this to annoy Karl .
Karl recons
Ricky will be bored in a week .
He is probably right .

Harnessing the Saharan Sun Is Desert Solar Power the Solution to Europe 's Energy Crisis ?
A tiny fraction of the sun 's energy that shines upon the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East could meet all of Europe 's electricity demands .
The technology to harness the energy already exists .
So why is hardly anyone investing in it ?
I HAVEN ’T GONE shopping for a piece of non-underwear clothing in nearly two years .
If it were n’t for gifts from my parents , I ’d still be wearing clothes from the 1980s .
This is why when men get old , they wear Members Only jackets .
Men have no use for shopping .
A guy ’s instinctive reaction to any piece of clothing is n’t to wonder if it will make him look good , but whether he can get his last name stitched in big letters on the back
So when I heard that Elton John was having a five - day garage sale last week in a store at New York ’s Rockefeller Center to raise money for his AIDS foundation , I said , “ Hey , I ’m having breakfast in Rockefeller Center with my friend Lauren anyway . ”
This is about as excited about shopping as a guy can get .
The first thing I noticed is that John has more clothes than the rest of the Earth ’s men put together .
He was clearing 10,000 items out of his closet , and he had already had four sales in the last 10 years : three in London and one in Atlanta .
Advertisement
Though half of the shoppers were women , men were stripping down to their underwear right in the middle of the store , sometimes to try on pants and sometimes just to get in the spirit of an Elton John event .
Elton , I discovered from the first rack I saw , shops differently than most men do .
Whereas a typical guy would see a floral print suit and say , “ No ! ” Sir John sees such a suit and says , “ Can you make that in nine different colors ? ”
He is also the Noah of clothing .
One rack had coats made from calf , mink , rabbit , coyote , squirrel , pony , lamb , goat and Finnish beaver .
The $ 2,500 floor - length coat made exclusively of squirrel seemed like a particularly good idea to Lauren , who said , “ Everything should be made of squirrel . ”
As if all this were n’t exciting enough , a saleswoman suddenly announced the addition of a $ 1,500 sequined , green - and - red jacket with racing flags on the back .
I realized that John dresses just like my grandmother at a show in her Fort Lauderdale condo clubhouse .

Along with endless numbers of Versace suits for just $ 200 , there was a rack of underwear on sale for $ 50 , some of it orange , some of it mesh and some of it both .
There were also two huge circular racks of sweatpants and sweat jackets , or what I like to call “ the clothes Elton John actually wore . ”
Sadly , there were no glasses , hats or feather boas .
Another charity , I was told , got to auction those .
This meant that if I were to go home with a little piece of Elton , I would have to do some real clothes shopping .
Unfortunately for me as a shopper , and more unfortunately for the singer as a person , he has a pretty big waist .
However , John ’s partner , David Furnish , has a 32 - inch waist and wears a size 40 jacket .
If you ’ve ever put your hands against John Wayne ’s prints at Grauman ’s Chinese
Theatre , you can begin to imagine the excitement of knowing you are the exact size of the man Elton John has sex with .
Having no idea what to buy , I approached the dandiest guy in the store .
Patrick McDonald was not only happy to help but happy to inform me that his nickname in the fashion press is “ the Dandy . ”
McDonald also told me that he ’d heard about the sale through performance artists Brandywine and Brenda A. Go - Go at a party for transsexual Amanda Lepore ’s doll launch .
I was starting to remember why I moved out of New York .
Advertisement
That ’s when I knew it was time to leave .
Plus , I had already heard “ Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters ” twice .
Upon the Dandy ’s recommendation , I bought a Piombo jacket , two Richard James shirts and a pair of Marc Jacobs pants , all for $ 225 .
If not for carry - on suitcase limitations , I would have gotten my entire lifetime of shopping out of the way .
The reason this sale was so huge -- it raised more than $ 700,000 -- was that straight men need an excuse to feel OK about shopping .
Men have done the objectifying for so long that women have learned to completely focus on themselves , leaving no one to sexualize us straight guys .
The only escape clause is to become a rock guitarist , and that seems like a huge economic risk just to wear leather pants .
But with Elton as our intermediary , we can take an interest in how we look without preening .
Open a few Elton ’s Closets at stadiums and arenas , and we ’ll have an AIDS vaccine in no time .
Just one day after nasty security flaws were disclosed in Yahoo's Music Jukebox , miscreants have begun to actively exploit them .
The buggy Yahoo media player is one of at least three pieces of web software reported in the last week to be smitten by ActiveX flaws that leaves users wide open to attack .
Elazar Broad , the researcher who disclosed the vulnerability on Sunday , also recently revealed critical flaws in the programs used to upload photos onto MySpace and Facebook .
Sites that use the Anon Proxy Server are at risk of being remotely controlled by attackers exploiting a third recently disclosed ActiveX vulnerability .
According to Symantec 's DeepSight Threat Management System , exploit code targeting the Yahoo media player installs a backdoor on vulnerable machines .
Yahoo currently has no patch for the multiple vulnerabilities .
Two ActiveX controls in the player are susceptible to buffer overflow attacks because they fail to scrutinize code for malicious input .
Broad posted proof - of - concept code on the Milw0rm site , and within about 24 hours exploits targeting one of the two vulnerabilities were found by Symantec honeypots .
Symantec researchers say it 's likely exploits the other flaw will also make it into the wild soon .
Vulnerability tracking service Secunia rates the vulnerabilities " extremely critical , " its highest classification .
Yahoo Music Jukebox is the default software for playing music sold by Yahoo .
The insecurity comes as Yahoo has announced plans to abandon an unlimited service and transfer users to RealNetworks '
Rhapsody service .
It 's been a busy week for Broad .
Last Thursday , he disclosed a buffer overflow vulnerability in Aurigma 's Image Uploader Control Library that put MySpace users at risk .
He was back on Sunday to update additional ActiveX uploader tools distributed by Aurigma that were also vulnerable .
Of course , the easiest way to insulate yourself from one of these bugs is to simply uninstall the software .
There are plenty of other ways to upload pics or listen to digital tunes , so that is n't really asking for much , now is it ?
Those who are really stubborn , and have a sufficient technical foundation , can set the kill bit for the vulnerable CLSIDs .

5 Jay Leno meets Spider - Man ( 2002 )
Superheroes and late night TV hosts have a curious history of teaming up to fight evil .
The Avengers guest - starred on Letterman , and the cast of Saturday Night Live joined Spider - Man in defeating the Silver Samurai .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
These unlikely team - ups combined two great tastes that do n't seem to go together , but , like Nutella and Jagermeister , somehow make perfect sense when you 're absolutely shitfaced .
In July 2002 , Marvel Comics debuted Jay Leno & Spider - Man : One Night Only .
Marvel presumably created this three - part crossover to capitalize on the release of the Spider - Man feature film , but why they chose Leno to be the star is anyone 's guess .
You would n't think Leno 's audience of senior citizens would overlap much with audience for Spider - Man on the Venn diagram .
Where it goes wrong ...
We have to start with One Night Only 's criminally ridiculous plot , wherein Spider - Man and Leno team up to film a General Motors commercial , then get attacked by ninjas .
What the hell help is Jay Leno going to be in a ninja fight ?
Could n't they , say , have them attacked by a race of aliens whose only vulnerability is really stale monologues and awkward , polite laughter ?

The torch has been taken on a surprise route through San Francisco
Torch relay
Barack Obama has urged US President George W Bush to consider a boycott of the opening of the Beijing Olympics unless China 's rights record improves .
The Democratic presidential hopeful made his call a day after a similar appeal by his rival , Hillary Clinton .
The US stage of the Olympic torch relay passed off amid confusion and tight security in San Francisco on Wednesday .
The route was changed at the last minute and the closing ceremony took place on a motorway fly - over .
Throughout the route , the torch - bearers were immersed in a cocoon of security , surrounded by dozens of police officers and track - suited Chinese guards .
The Olympic flame was lit in Greece on 24 March and is being relayed through 20 countries before being carried into the opening ceremony in Beijing on 8 August .
Demonstrators sought to disrupt the torch relay in Athens , Istanbul , Paris and London , while it passed successfully through Almaty , in Kazakhstan , and St Petersburg , in Russia .
It is due to arrive in the Argentine capital , Buenos Aires , later this week .
However , the International Olympic Committee is meeting in Beijing to consider calling off the rest of the torch 's 136,788 - km ( 85,000 - mile ) journey .
Dalai Lama to speak
Mr Obama said President Bush should boycott the opening ceremony if China failed to take steps to improve human rights in Tibet or help to end the alleged genocide in Darfur , in Sudan .
" A boycott of the opening ceremonies should be firmly on the table but this decision should be made closer to the Games [ in August ] , " he said in a statement .
Speaking on Tuesday , Mrs Clinton said Mr Bush should not attend the ceremony without " major changes by the Chinese government " over Tibet and Darfur .
The US House of Representatives has overwhelmingly passed a motion condemning China 's " extreme " response to protests in Tibet .
Mr Bush himself called on the Chinese government to begin a dialogue with the Tibetan spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama .
The Dalai Lama , who is due in Tokyo en route to the US , is expected to give his reaction to the torch protests at a news conference shortly .
A spokeswoman for UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he would not be attending the opening ceremonies , and had never intended to do so .
However , he will be at the closing ceremony .
Whisked away
Thousands of spectators had been waiting hours to see the torch pass through San Francisco and demonstrators were out in force along the waterfront relay route .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The Olympics have always been politically motivated so protests should be accepted Thomas , Guilford , UK
But immediately after the torch was lit , the torch - bearers turned into a warehouse building , disappearing for an hour .
They reappeared at a new starting - point across the city where it was handed to two runners , away from the protesters .
The planned waterfront closing ceremony in Justin Herman Plaza was moved to a motorway fly - over .
" We assessed the situation and felt that we could not secure the torch and protect the protesters and supporters to the degree that we wished , " San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom told Reuters news agency .
In Paris , the torch had to be extinguished three times , while in London there were 37 arrests .
OLYMPIC TORCH ROUTE
Torch lit in Olympia on 24 March and taken on five - day relay around Greece to Athens After handover ceremony , it is taken to Beijing on 31 March to begin a journey of 136,800 km ( 85,000 miles ) around the world
Torch arrives in Macau on 3 May .
After three - month relay all around China , it arrives in Beijing for opening ceremony on 8 August

Sinister Keepers of the Flame Controversy over ' Thuggish ' Chinese Olympic Torch Guards
Amid all the protests surrounding the Olympic torch relay , many people are asking who the sinister troop of Chinese torch guards in their blue track suits really are -- and why they were allowed on the streets of London and Paris .

Disgraced former Gov. Eliot Spitzer has been identified as a long - standing client of a second high - priced call - girl ring , The Post has learned .
The ex-governor regularly patronized Wicked Models , the Manhattan - based operation taken down Tuesday , according to financial documents and other evidence unearthed in a yearlong prostitution in vestigation , law - enforcement sources said .
PHOTOS : Alleged Madam Kristin Davis
PHOTOS : Hookers Made Famous by Eliot Spitzer
VOTE : Did Eliot Spitzer abuse his power ?
How a Co - Ed Began Reign at Emperor ’s Club
Porn Star Sues Papa to Pay Up
The revelation comes three weeks after Spitzer was outed as “ Client - 9 ” in a separate federal hooker probe involving the New Jersey - based Emperors Club VIP .
At the center of the new ring is Kristin “ Billie ” Davis , a busty bottle blonde who hails from a ough - and - tumble California trailer park .
She has a reputation for hard - partying , shameless self - promotion and a rumored 10,000 - name - long client list .
Davis ’ alleged multimillion - dollar empire was smashed by city vice cops as she made plans to skip town .
Prosecutors say she netted some $ 2 million last year by pimping out ladies of the night for as much as $ 1,000 an hour through four Web sites .
They noted she has openly boasted of total earnings of $ 6 million , and has been in operation since at least 2004 .
Davis , 32 , pleaded not guilty to money laundering and promoting prostitution in Manhattan Supreme Court yesterday and was held on $ 2 - million bail .
She faces 15 years in prison if convicted of running the ring , which also allegedly operated the Madison La A’mour and New York Body Miracle agencies .
A source said Davis personally serviced Spitzer .
“ She personally interfaced with Spitzer a number of times ” since 2003 before she became a madam , a source close to Davis said .
When asked about the allegation , Davis told The Post , “ I ca n’t talk about it . ”
Spitzer ’s spokeswoman , Anna Cordasco , countered that “ Mr. Spitzer was not ever a client of Ms. Davis . ”
When vice cops raided Davis ’ apartment at 315 E. 56th St. after learning she was about to skip town , they seized some $ 500,000 in various bank accounts , $ 15,000 from a safe - deposit box , and $ 4,800 from the residence .
The wary madam had been tipped off to the investigation and was in the midst of destroying evidence , moving her money and planning her escape , Assistant District Attorney John McConnell said during arraignment .
It ’s unclear what happened to any records that could identify her well - heeled clients .
Sources close to the case estimated she did business with 10,000 different johns over the years .
Since 2004 , Davis ran a lucrative , high - end operation employing several dozen prostitutes – not just in New York , but in Pennsylvania and California , McConnell said .
There ’s been no link between Davis ’ alleged operation and the Emperors Club VIP , the ring from which Spitzer was caught on a federal wiretap ordering a hooker in Washington , DC .
Nor was there word on whether Spitzer wore his socks during his alleged escort encounters .
Last week , it was revealed Republican dirty - tricks operative Roger Stone told the FBI that Spitzer kept his socks on during sex with a Florida prostitute .
A year ’s worth of investigation , including undercover work and the execution of multiple search warrants , turned up a pile of incriminating bank records and other documents related to the hard - partying Davis and her business , McConnell said .
These records show that in the last year alone , Davis moved $ 2 million in hooker proceeds through her elaborate web of money - laundering accounts , he said .
Davis ’ lawyer , Mark Jay Heller , continued for a second day yesterday to blame her arrest on “ rumors ” circulated by unnamed sex- industry insiders looking for money or preferential treatment in their own cases .
“ She believes she ’s being persecuted here as a result of the Gov. Spitzer scandal , ” he said .
But the source close to Davis said more high - profile names are involved .
“ There are some big people involved in the entertainment industry , ” the source said , adding that there are “ sports superstars ” including “ a very prominent Yankee , ” along with Spitzer campaign contributors .
In court yesterday , the slightly rumpled Davis wore gray tights , black Ugg boots and a black hoodie decorated by silver - sequin images of flaming skulls and crossbones .
“ Why could n’t they have picked me up in regular clothes and not in gym clothes ? ” she asked The Post .
“ It ’s more comfortable , I guess . ”
Davis may be loving the attention .
Even before her bust , she was trying to shop her story to the media , and in her pitches described herself as the madam behind “ the world ’s largest escort agency , ” according to the Manhattan prosecutor .
Sex - industry insiders described the tattooed platinum blonde as “ a flamboyant biker chick ” who boasted of her business success and reveled in telling pals about a hard - luck upbringing .
“ She is the female version of Jason , ” said one industry source , referring to Jason Itzler , the limelight - loving , tall - tale - telling pimp who ran now - busted NYConfidential .
She ’s known in the industry for a drug - fueled , wild annual party she throws for her “ girls ” in Las Vegas .
Her MySpace page features several photos of well - endowed women surrounded by ogling men .
“ I have created a business empire where I rule , ” Davis wrote on her MySpace page .
“ It ’s also one I could fall , and fall hard , very much like Lucifer getting kicked out of heaven . ”
Photographer Jason Howard , whom Davis hired last year to take nude photos of her , said she was a regular on the club scene , but he had no inkling of her real business .
“ Had I known , I would have charged her more , ” he quipped .

If you are a Twitter addict and liked MobileTwitter , the native iPhone application which I had reviewed few days back then you should also checkout Twinkle , another native Twitter client for the iPhone that has been recently released .
Twinkle has couple of additional features that got me interested .
The two interesting features about Twinkle is the Locate Me feature and ability to add images to your tweets .
The Locate Me feature works as follows :
Twinkle lets you use the iPhone ’s location feature to add location data to your tweets .
You can use the ‘ Near Me ’ tab to see tweets from twitter users who are within X miles of you .
The default is 50 - miles , and you can choose to change this to 1 , 2 , 10 , 25 , 100 , 1,000 , or 252,000 ( it appears that there is a bug as the settings are lost when you exit the application ) .
The location information is only visible from Twinkle and not on the Twitter website , so this will only work when more iPhone users start using Twinkle .
If you do not fancy this feature then you always have the option to turn it off in the application " Settings " tab .
The other cool feature is the ability to add images to your tweets right at the posting screen , one tap on a camera icon at the bottom launches the camera and once you select the image , it takes you right back to the posting screen with your image file as an attachment .
The images are then visible in your tweets as thumbnails which can be enlarged with a tap on the thumbnail .
Unfortunately , just like the location information , the images will be visible only from the Twinkle client and not on the Twitter website .
Other than these two additional features , you can see from the screenshots below ( courtesy Gear Live ) that the user interface is quite neat and intuitive .
In order to install Twinkle on your iPhone , you will need a Jailbroken iPhone with the cool Installer App installed .
If you want to jailbreak your iPhone you can check out these posts : ZiPhone 3.0 : New version of Popular tool to JailBreak and Unlock iPhone Released or iLiberty : Easy to use Application to JailBreak , Activate and Unlock iPhone .
Once you have the Installer app on your iPhone , you ’ll need to add the Polar Bear Farm source in Installer to see Twinkle .
You need to follow some simple steps on your jailbroken iPhone for this :
Click on the Installer Icon on your iPhone ’s home screen .
Click on the " Sources " icon at the bottom .
Click " Edit " .
Click " Add " .
Enter : " http://www.polarbearfarm.com/repo/ " .
Click " OK " .
As always do let me know the things you liked or did not like about this native iPhone application .

Taser International and Mossberg have unveiled a shotgun that can only fire less - lethal projectiles .
At the 2008 SHOT Show in Las Vegas , Playboy models were on hand to show off the latest people - zappers .
But perhaps the most interesting advertisement is the stun - gun maker ’s creepy new promotional video .
For one brief moment , it appears to be the trailer for a Harry Potter movie , but everything goes straight downhill from there .
Ominous clouds and lighting give way to the Taser logo , which looks oddly familiar …
Taser , Flash Gordon wants his insignia back !
Cue the creepy new age music and slow panning shots of pasty - white police officers that appear to be suffering from severe constipation .
A caption on the screen touts a ‘ ghost ring ’ sight .
Foreshadowing perhaps ?
I thought this thing was built to be less - lethal !
Then , just when it should n’t be able to get any worse , you ’re staring straight down the barrel .

A leatherback turtle was tracked by satellite traveling 12,774 miles ( 20,558 kilometers ) from Indonesia to Oregon , one of the longest recorded migrations of any vertebrate animal , scientists announced in a new report on sea turtle conservation .
Leatherback sea turtles ( Dermochelys coriacea ) are the largest of all living turtles and are widely distributed throughout the world 's oceans .
They have been seen in the waters off Argentina , Tasmania , Alaska and Nova Scotia .
Adult leatherbacks periodically migrate from their temperate foraging grounds to breeding grounds in the tropics .
Scientists at the National Marine Fisheries Service ( NMFS ) tracked one female nester , who was tagged on Jamursba - Medi beach in Papua , Indonesia , on her journey back to her foraging grounds off the coast of Oregon .
She was tracked for 647 days covering a distance about equal to two round trips between New York and Los Angeles .
The turtle 's trip set a new record for sea turtles , and is among the longest documented migrations for any marine vertebrate .
The longest measured annual migration for any animal is the 40,000 - mile ( 64,000 - kilometer ) journey between New Zealand and the North Pacific of the sooty shearwater ( Puffinus griseus ) , a medium - sized seabird .
The leatherback tracked by the NMFS belongs to one of two distinct breeding populations in the Pacific , the western group .
Other research has shown that nesters from this population migrate through areas in the Philippines , South China Sea , Japan , and the waters around many other countries , spurring conservationists to call for an international effort to protect the species , which is listed as Critically Endangered on the World Conservation Union 's Red List .
The turtle 's journey is featured in an article in the third annual volume of the State of the Worlds ' Turtles Report , written by NMFS scientists Peter Dutton and Scott Benson and Creusa Hitipeuw of WWF - Indonesia .
Some customers who have tried to get their brokers to cash them out say the firms have responded by offering to let them borrow against the value of these securities .
At a cost , of course : the typical margin rate for borrowers is at least 7 percent at most shops .
Other holders are selling the notes at a deep discount to speculators willing to buy distressed securities .
Wall Street made generous fees issuing these securities and running the auctions  as long as there were bidders .
After the bidders vanished , some firms stepped in and bid for the securities for a while , giving investors a way out .
No more .
What ’s the sense stretching your already - thin balance sheet just to keep a market open for your customers ?
In interviews , investors who own these securities say they were n’t warned that they might not be able to sell them if an auction failed .
They say they were told that the instruments were as safe and liquid as  yes , you guessed it  cash .
Stephen N. Joffe , a client of UBS Financial Services , is suing the firm because it put all $ 1.35 million of his charitable foundation ’s cash into auction - rate securities issued by Eaton Vance Limited Duration funds .
This , even though he said he explicitly told the broker to take no risk and that he would need constant access to the funds .
Dr. Joffe , 65 , is a former professor of surgery who founded LCA - Vision Inc. , a company that operates laser vision - correction centers .
“ I never asked my broker to get me a better rate , ” he said .
“ I felt the responsibility to maintain this account as a risk - free account .
I believed this was in the equivalent of an overnight money market account . ”
Now , the Joffe Foundation can no longer fund programs that help prevent AIDS in Africa , provide indigent people with laser vision correction and correct the cleft palates of African children .
One should never take the actions of others too seriously .
Lately American Airlines had to cancel a flight from Chicago to London .
It appears that American had not booked enough passengers to ‘ justify ’ a flight according to an Eco — Activist organization called “ Friends of the Earth . ”
Okay …how about the fully booked flight that is waiting patiently on the other side of the pond in London for their return trip home to Chicago and all of the connecting flights to get them home safely ?
My point is quite simple : where is the greatest amount of benefit for all parties concerned ?
A major airline is under fire from environmentalists for flying an aircraft across the Atlantic with only five passengers on board .
Furthermore , what business is it of “ Friends of the Earth ” how much fuel is expended or saved ?
Are we to believe that every major airline in the world is supposed to change their flight schedules because of a premise ?
Show me the data , that ’s all I ask .
Please do n’t speak to me in “ eco— jargon ” about carbon footprints , global warming , doomsday , so that every religion under the sun is debating or arguing with every atheist or agnostic organization around about eschatology !
Simply show your data .
One major issue behind all of these cock and bull weather predictions is that is precisely what they are — predictions .
Perhaps we should gauge all of our weather forecasts on the Farmer ’s Almanac insofar as it has more credibility than any sort coming from these eco-activist organizations .
Richard Dyer , Friends of the Earth ’s transport campaigner said : “ Flying virtually empty planes is an obscene waste of fuel . ”
Unbeknownst to many airlines do not make their money on passenger revenues .
Sure it helps to defer some costs ; however , airlines make the bulk of their revenues in bulk transport .
Basically it ’s what is under the seats , in the belly of the airplane is where the airline makes more money .
There ’s more , continue reading :
And a bit more here from the Huffington Post : Please read the comments ( For a great laugh ! )
PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama has quickly made up the deficit he faced with Hillary Clinton earlier this week , with the latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking update on Democratic presidential nomination preferences showing 48 % of Democratic voters favoring Obama and 45 % Clinton .
Obama 's campaign clearly suffered in recent days from negative press , mostly centering around his association with the controversial Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
Perhaps as a result , Clinton moved into the lead in Gallup 's Wednesday release , covering March 16 - 18 polling .
But Obama has now edged back ahead of Clinton due to a strong showing for him in Friday night 's polling , perhaps in response to the endorsement he received from well - respected New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , a former rival for the nomination .

Both Democrats have inched closer to John McCain in the latest update on registered voters ' general election preferences .
McCain holds just a two percentage point edge over both -- 46 % to 44 % over Obama and 47 % to 45 % over Clinton .

Computing Thoughts
Should Microsoft Buy Yahoo ?
by Bruce Eckel
February 4 , 2008
Summary
I read somewhere that over half of acquisitions fail .
I think the percentage might be much higher than half .
Advertisement
I have certainly seen acquisitions that looked like obvious bad moves , and later turned out to be just that .
But the corporate leaders had managed to talk themselves into thinking it was a good idea .
Part of the problem is that a publicly - held corporation must put its cash to work , or , I suppose , pay it out as dividends .
Buying small , innovative companies that have developed something that the corporation has n't been able to -- that makes sense .
Google , in fact , has turned this into a business model for small companies who develop an idea precisely so that Google might buy them .
Buying big , established companies -- those who are themselves capable of buying other companies -- seems to be where most of the bad ideas come from .
Here are three that I personally paid attention to .
Borland buys Ashton - Tate Ashton - Tate invented the DBase database system and was very popular for awhile , then began sliding .
Borland developed a much - improved clone of DBase and was doing very well with it , gaining customers left and right from Ashton - Tate .
Ashton - Tate continued sliding , and everyone could see it was only a matter of time before they went on life support .
All Borland had to do was continue on their current path and they 'd win .
Instead , they bought Ashton - Tate for a billion dollars .
They threw away a billion dollars on a failed company when they were going to get all their customers anyway .
A few years later Borland really could have used that billion dollars .
These days , Borland is in a different business altogether .
HP buys Compaq Compaq had not done anything interesting or innovative for years .
It was a failing company , even if it appeared to be only slowly declining .
In the computer industry , it 's " lead or fail . "
What did HP think they were getting , and what did they think they could do with it ?
HP already made computers , at least somewhat better than Compaq did .
Was the plan to manage Compaq back from the brink ?
I can never figure out what upper management is thinking when they make decisions like this , especially with all the history of all the other acquisitions that have failed .
Perhaps they 're thinking " this time it will be different . "
One argument that always surprises me is " we 're buying their market . "
Why not , I think , spend all that money on making your own product better .
Then their market will just come over to you .
Perhaps buying a competitor is the act that shows that the " management Peter Principle " has been reached .
All the tricks in the management bag have played out , and we can't manage ourselves into creating better products .
So we fool ourselves into believing that we can " buy the market " since we can't create a better mousetrap .
Microsoft might buy Yahoo I do n't think Google is perfect , but I use their stuff .
Yahoo is still making little innovations here and there -- typically under marketplace duress , rather than leading because they 've come up with the next great thing .
But the only time I go to Yahoo is for Yahoo Movies , to find out when and where movies are playing .
Yahoo
Finance is supposed to be pretty good , too .
Yahoo itself admits that we should n't expect a turnaround before 2009 , and that sounds optimistic to me because one of the fundamental tenets of their turnaround strategy is to " open Yahoo's technology infrastructure to third - party programmers and publishers . "
Can this be done after the infrastructure of a company has been built ?
I doubt it .
It 's a bit like Microsoft trying to add " security " on top of Windows .
Windows was n't designed with networking and security in mind , and security in particular is not something that can be added as an afterthought .
Security must be part of the fundamental architecture , not an optional add - on feature ( see Unix for comparison ) .
Opening the technology infrastructure is only objective # 3 .
Yahoo's first two objectives are to be a starting point for the most consumers on the Web and to make the company a top choice for marketers seeking to place ads on sites across the Web .
Basically , to reverse the fortunes of Yahoo and Google .
How likely is this to happen ?
For that matter , how could it happen ?
What is it that 's going to make you go to Yahoo rather than Google when you want to search , or to place ads with Yahoo rather than with Google Adwords ?
Here are two places where Yahoo could get the jump on Google , although I think Google is already working on both of these .
First , charging for ads based on actual sales generated by the ads , rather than just click - throughs .
Think about it .
If you wanted to advertise something and you knew you 'd only have to pay for the ad when the ad actually sold something , would n't you advertise a lot more ?
It would be completely risk - free .
Yes , the cost of an ad - based sale would certainly be higher , but would that really make a difference if your choice was between selling something and not selling something ?
Personally , I think it would be a no - brainer .
The other thing that might bring me to Yahoo is the store system -- and I consider any changes in this area doubly unlikely because Yahoo already has an entrenched ( and expensive ) store system .
Plus Google is apparently working towards what I 'm about to describe .
What we need is a very easy way to know that a transaction has taken place , so it becomes trivial to program against the transaction - processing system .
Right now it 's far , far too hard .
I tried it with Paypal , and that turned me off .
The coupling is much too high .
What I really want to do is know when a transaction has happened , and what that transaction is , and that 's all .
My program can then do whatever it needs to do without becoming entangled in the transaction - processing API .
If this process becomes easy then it will cause a big increase in online transactions .
If Yahoo did it before Google then I might try it .
The downside is that it 's going to cost me more because of Yahoo transaction fees , and with Google Checkout all I have to do is buy some adwords each month and I do n't pay transaction fees .
So I might change to Yahoo for awhile , but as soon as Google solves the problem and becomes the cheap solution then I 'll probably just switch to Google .
And that 's really the point .
Maybe Yahoo has some fraction of the market now , and maybe they will recover in 2009 , but right now they 're kind of a failing company .
What is a hostile takeover by Microsoft going to do for that ?
Is Microsoft going to manage them back to health ?
It seems unlikely that the " maybe 2009 " recovery will happen sooner after a hostile takeover .
And the really big question : Microsoft already has an Internet division : MSN .
But they have n't been able to make that go anywhere .
Yahoo made a good start at the beginning of the Web revolution , but then got stuck and faltered .
Why on earth would combining the talents of Microsoft MSN and Yahoo produce anything other than more stumbling around in the dark ?
Which company would lead this recovery ?
At least Yahoo managed to make a strong start on the Web before driving into the weeds .
But no , it would be the company that takes over , Microsoft , who brought us both MSN and Windows Vista .
How does combining a failing company ( Yahoo ) and a failed division of Microsoft ( MSN ) produce a successful division of Microsoft ?
The one thing that the two companies have in common is the very thing that will make them both fail at this Web thing .
They both believe that it 's about centralization .
The companies are built around that philosophy .
Yahoo tried to create a central place where people would go on the Internet , which worked in the early wild - west days of the web -- Yahoo was the best thing out there for awhile -- and it's what caused Yahoo to slide as the Web became more decentralized .
Yahoo's centralized services are no longer as good as their decentralized competitors .
Now we have BBC for news , YouTube for video , etc .
And Microsoft , of course , is the " Cathedral " in The Cathedral and the Bazaar .
One Trick Per Company
I think each company rises to prominence , and then becomes ossified , based on a single Trick that they can do that other companies can't .
For awhile , this Trick keeps them out in front , nimbly anticipating anything the competition tries to do .
Everyone in the company starts feeling like they 've got it all figured out .
Managers and vice - presidents are chosen based on their dedication to and ability to mimic the Trick .
By this time , the Trick has become the only acceptable way of thinking within the company , so business innovation has become impossible ( but if the Trick is a good one , it can serve the company in its " stable " mode for a long time ) .
At this point , throughout management , people have set up fiefdoms based on their perception of the Trick ( which is usually distorted ) and will fight against any changes in the structure of the company , because it threatens the security of their fiefdom .
The company plays into this -- the company needs a way to keep managers in line so it usually measures them by how well they believe in the Trick .
At the same time , it can't quite let them think they are good enough at the Trick that they could leave the company and go off and do it themselves ( ironically , those are the very people that would be the best managers for the company ) .
At this point the company has become ossified .
They still believe in the mythology of their youth , but the world has changed around them , either implicitly or explicitly adapting to their Trick , so the Trick no longer works .
The company can't believe that it does n't , so it just repeats the trick with more force .
One thing I have n't seen is a company that has been able to realize that it 's old trick no longer works , and come up with a new one .
The entire company is built upon belief in this single trick , and it resists mightily any change in that belief system .
Before the computer age , companies went through these phases so slowly that very few Tricks worked , so most companies of a certain type tended to look like each other , and it became easy to say that " this is the way business works . "
Computers are about speed , and Tricks that never had a chance in the old world could work spectacularly well .
Thus we 've seen , in a short time , many companies gain success based on their Trick , and just as quickly go through ossification and eventually fail .
As the examples pile up it becomes harder to pretend they are special cases .
Here are the tricks of the companies we 're interested in : Microsoft : The Quick Move .
Everyone knows the story .
Microsoft bought MS - DOS from a little company and then turned around and sold it to IBM , cleverly keeping the rights .
As time passes , they improve the product .
The ideas always come from somewhere else ( Office and .NET are two examples ) .
First they get into the market , then over time they improve the product .
Yahoo : The Only Playground You 'll Ever Need .
When they started , there was no place to " go " on the Internet .
Yahoo provided the best place ( at the time ) to " go " , which was a great service , but then , instead of continuing to think in terms of serving the visitor , there was a subtle change : Yahoo wanted to keep the visitor within Yahoo .
So the goal went from " service " to " control . "
This looked better to shareholders and to sellers than it did to visitors .
And since there was no real fence to force visitors to stay at Yahoo , they began leaking away .
But within Yahoo , the shift was so subtle that they do n't realize what 's happened .
Google : Free Services to Sell Ads .
The reason this is deeply clever is that the money stream , which is where managers set up their fiefdoms , is completely decoupled from the products that attract and serve the consumers .
Which means that the product - creation part of the company can remain un -ossified for a much longer time .
Even as Google has become big , the products continue to be creative and customer - oriented , which suggests the lack of involvement by managers and marketing people .
On top of that , the business model -- the advertiser only pays for a click - through -- is so simple that there is less leverage in setting up a fiefdom , because there 's much less possibility to abstract or obscure information , and thus less potential for power .
The formulas behind the business model are controlled by technologists .
The one thing that will probably keep Google out in front no matter what Microsoft and Yahoo do is Google 's freedom to create end - user services .
Because Google 's business model is in selling ads , everything else they do can be done in the name of the consumer .
This minimizes the need for and influence of marketing people .
Which is not to say that technologists always create great things , but it seems that whenever marketing people get involved , their motivations and perspectives tend to make things that much worse .
Look at Microsoft Office .
Even with Microsoft 's vaunted " Usability Lab " they managed to come out with new versions of Office where they moved features around and basically hid them .
Now , instead of being afraid that the next version of Office will be more broken and buggy than the one you 're using , you 're afraid that you will have to go up an entirely new learning curve .
Microsoft 's goal is to own the desktop , and the desktop is slipping away from them .
Yahoo's goal is to keep people at Yahoo , and people leave the moment they find a better site .
Both of these goals are primarily designed to serve the shareholder .
Google has shareholders too , but those shareholders have been specifically told that revenue all comes from ads .
" Pay no attention to all those products and services , they are only indirectly associated with revenue .
Eyeballs , you know . "
I certainly do n't believe Google 's approach is flawless .
For one thing , I think Google has gotten far too mired in a single technology -- Javascript on the Browser -- even as Google themselves have demonstrated the implacable problems with that technology .
However , Google 's Trick looks like it 's going to work for awhile , far better than Microsoft 's or Yahoo's .
And the latter two companies seem to be fully in the throes of denial , as they repeatedly throw themselves against the wall , declaring " Trick ... works ... must ... try ... harder ! "
Microsoft would be better off buying a rocket and boosting their 44 billion dollars into space .
They would lose less money that way , because the 44 billion will just be the start of the costs .
All the restructuring and busy work and vision statements ( hey , for 3.75 million dollars I 'll come up with your new vision statement ! ) and opportunity costs while everyone sticks to their guns and nothing changes will add a lot more to the cost .
Ultimately they will discover that combining two failures will not produce a success .
As long as you 're mindlessly flinging money around , why not do something truly bold ?
Take a tenth of what it would cost to buy Yahoo , or less : " only " a billion , and start a skunkworks project .
Keep the management structure away from it , let it actually innovate something ( note that declaring that you are " innovative " does n't make you so ; in the words of the Bard , " Methinks thou dost protest too much " ) .
Keep the management structure very shallow and fiercely dedicated to supporting the project instead of building status .
You probably need to get managers who've never worked at Microsoft .
Heck , it 's only a fraction of what you 're talking about throwing away on Yahoo -- why not create a few of these projects .
Who knows what you might come up with ?
But if Microsoft buys
Yahoo , it will only produce yet another case study for business - management textbooks on why takeovers usually fail .
Here 's another take on what Microsoft should do instead with its 44 billion .
Talk Back !

Hind captured this image of a bat in Dingwall Bats found lying on the ground and being mobbed by birds flying in daylight could be linked to extreme hunger , an expert has said .
Anne Youngman , the Bat Conservation Trust 's Scottish officer , said the handful of incidents may be related to last year 's poor summer and autumn .
She said it was too early to tell if the problem was more widespread .
Last year , adult bats were reported abandoning their young as they struggled to cope with bad weather .
Mrs Youngman , who will travel from central Scotland to lead a bats workshop in Strathpeffer Community Centre , near Dingwall , on Thursday , said the first bats of the season were emerging from hibernation .
She said : " Down here in the central belt people have found grounded bats which were very weak and very hungry .
" This may be a reflection of last summer and juveniles not getting enough food to build up fat to survive through hibernation . "
Mrs Youngman said she knew of only a couple of incidents so far , but she added : " Someone visiting Mull reported seeing a bat flying during daylight and mobbed by birds .
" For bats to be flying in daylight is something strange and you do n't normally see and could mean the bat was really hungry . "
Cat food
In day time bats run the risk of falling prey to other animals and it has been known for them to be mobbed and eaten by crows .
She advised anyone finding a bat in difficulty to contact the nearest conservation officer , or the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals .
Hungry bats are often revived on meal worms , or the jelly from dog or cat food finely chopped up .
During Thursday 's workshop , Mrs Youngman will help people on how to identify common species found in the Highlands .
On 17 May , a workshop will be held in Contin Village Hall on red squirrels .
Conservationists are concerned for native reds following the first confirmed sighting of a grey squirrel in the Highlands .
The non-native species competes with reds for food and carry a virus fatal to the smaller animal .
Highland Council countryside ranger Martin Hind said : " These workshops are open to anyone who is interested in learning techniques to identify , record and learn more about the wildlife found on their doorstep . "

What are these ?
There is little doubt that during that last 60 years we here in America have transformed our manmade landscape in a way that is fundamentally different from any form of human habitation ever known .
While many have flocked to this new way of organizing the spaces in which we live , critics have noticed the shortcomings and have loudly pointed them out .
It ’s been suggested that the development of the suburbs here in the U.S. was a really bad idea .
Author James Kunstler describes suburbia as , ‘ the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world . ’
The ability of most citizens to own and cheaply operate an automobile means we ’ve had access to a level of mobility never before experienced .
The outgrowth of which has been a sprawling pattern of living that changed the rules about how and where we live , work , and play and how we get there and back .
We are now more spread out than ever before , mostly getting back and forth from one place to another by driving alone in our cars .
This could turn out to be a really bad thing .
As the cost of fueling those cars increases , it ’s becoming obvious we ’ve foolishly put too many of our eggs into one basket .
And as America wakes up to the realities of a changing climate , it ’s also painfully obvious that soloing around in a huge fleet of carbon emitters is n’t the most thoughtful way to transport ourselves from one side of suburbia to the other .
The question is , as the expansive nature of suburban life becomes too expensive , both economically and ecologically , what will we do with this great ‘ misallocation ’ of resources ?
Will we , as some suggest , simply abandon this experiment ?
The likelihood of moving everyone out of suburbia and into mixed use , walkable communities is quite remote .
Likewise moving everyone from the suburbs out into the countryside and onto farms is unlikely .
To be sure many , many people will move .
Some people are already choosing to move to places where they can safely walk and bike to meet more of their daily needs .
Others are choosing to reruralize , but completely depopulating suburban America is a project we have neither the fiscal resources nor the fossil fuel energy necessary to accomplish .
It seems reasonable to assume that lots of people are going to continue to live in the suburban communities we ’ve created all over this country during the last 60 years .
Will these places simply devolve into slums with roving bands of thieves stripping building materials and other valuables from abandoned homes and formerly homeless drug addicts burning them down while trying to keep warm ?
They ’ll probably be some of that especially if the housing crisis worseness ( and it will ) and the government continues to address it largely by bailing out banks .
The following is from a recent article in The Atlantic ,
At Windy Ridge , a recently built starter - home development seven miles northwest of Charlotte , North Carolina , 81 of the community ’s 132 small , vinyl - sided houses were in foreclosure as of late last year .
Vandals have kicked in doors and stripped the copper wire from vacant houses ; drug users and homeless people have furtively moved in .
In December , after a stray bullet blasted through her son ’s bedroom and into her own , Laurie Talbot , who ’d moved to Windy Ridge from New York in 2005 , told The Charlotte Observer , ‘ I thought I ’d bought a home in Pleasantville .
I never imagined in my wildest dreams that stuff like this would happen . ’
That is to say , this is already a problem .
And with more people defaulting on their mortgages and losing their jobs as the economy slumps we ’re likely to see this scenario play out repeatedly .
But it ’s important to take a moment and assess the possibilities presented by the problem .
That is , if we ’re going to do anything other than whistle while a large number of the communities in this country turn into the slums of the 21st century , we ’re going to have to comprehensively address the problem and that means starting with an assessment of not only the disadvantages of suburban America but the advantages we might have in this arrangement of living .
Could the problem actually turn out to be the solution ?
One of the results of a declining in the availability of oil and other fossil fuel resources will undoubtedly be a rise in the cost of food or even outright shortages of certain types of calories we ’ve grown accustom to acquiring quite easily .
Lots of people have written about this .
It ’s seems increasingly obvious that we ’re going to have to grow food differently if we have any chance of adapting to a low energy lifestyle with any semblance of grace .
Growing food means using land for some sort of agriculture .
Exactly what land we use is entirely up to us .
It ’s worth noting that while David Pimentel et al have suggested that it takes 1.8 acres of land to feed each of us now .
That number could be reduced to 1.2 acres per person while still meeting the nutritional needs of the average American .
But by 2050 we are likely to have only 0.6 acres person both because of the rise in global population and the loss of land due to desertification , salinization and soil depletion .
In the very near future we ’re not going to have enough land to feed ourselves in the manner in which we ’ve been doing so .
Where will more ‘ new ’ land come from ?
The suburbs were born out of an idea that each man could have his own cottage in the forest , his own unmolested paradise outside of the nastys of the industrializing cities and still go to work in those cities each day .
( Just how many of the problems we ’re facing today are born out of us wanting to both have and eat our cake ? )
The idea was that a man could still earn a living in the dirty city but return to his pristine piece of land where his wife and children could be free from pollution , crime , brown people , noise and traffic .
It never quite worked out that way , which is to say it has , since the beginning , failed to achieve what this experiment set out to accomplish ; to say nothing of the negative aspects of this way of developing our countryside .
But nevertheless , the end result is that a lot of people live on small amounts of land in communities that are n’t completely paved over with asphalt and concrete .
Many of us here in this country have access to land albeit in small amounts .
This provides us with the most important resource needed to address the rising cost of food - soil .
In other words , the fact that we ’ve chopped up much of the existing farmland that once surrounded major metropolitan areas in this country and parceled it out in fairly small sizes to many more people ultimately may or may not prove to have been a really bad idea .
But , not only is it the hand we have now been dealt , it might turn out to have been a fairly nifty way of developing and maintaining a moderately democratic land ownership policy here in America .
We still have , albeit in another form and with a reduction in the quantity and quality of soil ready for food production , a reasonable amount of land for growing food .
Again from the previously mentioned article ,
Arthur C. Nelson , director of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech , has looked carefully at trends in American demographics , construction , house prices , and consumer preferences .
In 2006 , using recent consumer research , housing supply data , and population growth rates , he modeled future demand for various types of housing .
The results were bracing : Nelson forecasts a likely surplus of 22 million large - lot homes ( houses built on a sixth of an acre or more ) by 2025 ‚Äîthat 's roughly 40 percent of the large - lot homes in existence today .
Fenrir or fenris is a name of a wolf that appear in Norse Mythology , which as a Wolf that predicted will kill every God that he meet in God ...
Update : Weil jemand gefragt hat : das Schriftbild ist so unruhig , weil das in dem anderen offenen Brief auch so war .
It is well understood that page loading speed in a web browser is limited by the available connection bandwidth .
However , it turns out bandwidth is not the only limiting factor and in many cases it is not even the most important one .
The graph above shows the time it took to fully load the Wall Street Journal front page ( chosen for its complexity which well represents many modern web sites ) with a recent WebKit .
Browser caches were cleared before each page load .
The Mac OS X dummynet facility was used to simulate various network conditions by introducing packet latency and capping the available bandwidth .
Since the testing was done against a live web site the actual connection latency was a factor as well ( ping time to wsj.com was ~ 75 ms ) .
From the figure it is clear that while available bandwidth is a significant factor , so is the connection latency .
Introducing just 50ms of additional latency doubled the page loading time in the high bandwidth case ( from ~ 3200 ms to ~ 6300ms ) .
Latency is a significant real world problem .
Wireless networking technologies often have inherently high latencies .
Packet loss and retransmits due to interference makes the situation worse .
Geographical distance introduces latency .
Just the roundtrip delay between US East and West Coast is somewhere around 70 ms .
Loaded web servers may not respond immediately .
Why does latency have such a huge impact on page loading speed ?
After all , to load a page completely a web browser just needs to fetch the page source and all the associated resources .
The browser makes multiple connections to servers and tries to load as many resources in parallel as possible .
Why would it matter much if it takes slightly longer to start loading an individual resource ?
Other resources should be loading during that time and the available bandwidth should still get fully utilized .
It turns out that figuring out “ all the associated resources ” is the hard part of the problem .
The browser does not know what resources it should load until it has completely parsed the document .
When the browser first receives the HTML text of the document it feeds it to the parser .
The parser builds a DOM tree out of the document .
When the browser sees an element like < img > that references an external resource , it requests that resources from the network .
Problems start when a document contains references to external scripts .
Any script can call document . write ( ) .
Parsing can’t proceed before the script is fully loaded and executed and any document .
write ( ) output has been inserted into the document text .
Since parsing is not proceeding while the script is being loaded no further requests for other resources are made either .
This quickly leads to a situation where the script is the only resource loading and connection parallelism does not get exploited at all .
A series of script tags essentially loads serially , hugely amplifying the effect of latency .
The situation is made worse by scripts that load additional resources .
Since those resources are not known before the script is executed it is critical to load scripts as quickly as possible .
The worst case is a script that load more scripts ( by using document . write ( ) to write < script > tags ) , a common pattern in Javascript frameworks and ad scripts .
The latest WebKit nightlies contain some new optimizations to reduce the impact of network latency .
When script loading halts the main parser , we start up a side parser that goes through the rest of the HTML source to find more resources to load .
We also prioritize resources so that scripts and stylesheets load before images .
The overall effect is that we are now able to load more resources in parallel with scripts , including other scripts .
You can see from the graphs above that these optimizations significantly reduce the impact of network latency and generally improve page loading speed .
For example with 50ms of simulated latency and no bandwidth limit , the overall page loading time was 2.8s faster ( 6.3s to 3.5s ) .
With bandwidth capped to 512 k bit /s the improvement was 5.9s ( 23.8s to 17.9s ) .

I thought it was kind of interesting that upon reading this McKinsey & Co study ( currently the top one in the list ) on education , Kevin Drum and a number of other left 'o center blogs pulled out this one chart to highlight .
It shows starting teacher pay ( i.e. out of college ) as a percent of the economy 's average )
The author's of the study argue that the countries higher on this list also have better student results .
Now , I will confess that this is a pretty interesting finding in the study -- that starting teacher pay is more important than teacher pay in later years , because the key is to attract talented people right out of college away from other professions .
Interesting .
But here is the quite fascinating selection bias by the lefty blogs : I have read the whole report , and this is absolutely the only chart in the whole study that in any way , shape , or form might be interpreted as a call for higher government education spending .
Even more interesting is what these bloggers left out .
This is the other half of the starting teacher pay analysis Drum et.
al. chose note to include , and makes clear that even this chart is not a call for more total spending :
South Korea and Singapore employ fewer teachers than other systems ; in effect , this ensures that they can spend more money on each teacher at an equivalent funding level .
Both countries recognize that while class size has relatively little impact on the quality of student outcomes ( see above ) , teacher quality does .
South Korea 's student - to - teacher ration is 30:1 , compared to an OECD average of 17.1 , enabling it in effect to double teacher salaries while maintaining the same overall funding level as other OECD countries ....
Singapore has pursued a similar strategy but has also front - loaded compensation .
THis combination allows it to spend less on primary education than almost any other OECD and yet still be able to attract strong candidates into the teaching profession .
In addition , because Singapore and South Korea need fewer teachers , they are also in a position to be more selective about who becomes a teacher .
This , in turn , increases the status of teaching , making the profession even more attractive .
Whoops !
Do n't want our friends at the NEA to see that !
Most of the study turns on McKinsey 's finding that teacher quality drives student results , way ahead of any other factor , from class size to socioeconomic background :
Well , now the NEA might be getting really nervous .
Something like this might cause parents to do something rash , like demand that low - performing teachers get fired .
Gasp .
Anyway , to get back to the cherry - picking and selection bias issue , the study is pretty clear that it thinks that " more spending " is a failed strategy for improving public education
If school choice is off the table , then I would be very supportive of a program to increase starting teacher pay , funded by larger class sizes and substantial reductions in useless administrators and assistant principals .
Anyway , it is kind of an interesting study , though you may find the pdf file format really irritating to try to read .
Lots of funny formatting .

Peru ’s cocaine industry , the world ’s largest and most violent in the late 1980s and early 1990s , is again on the upswing .
Plots of coca bushes , whose leaves yield cocaine , have increased by about one - third since 1999 , to about 127,000 acres , according to Peruvian and United Nations estimates .
And this time , the traffickers may be more difficult to combat because the flashy kingpins from Colombia have been replaced by a piecemeal network , a sort of gold rush of international entrepreneurs .
Production is still well below the record highs of the early 1990s , and neighboring Colombia has surpassed Peru as the global cocaine leader , supplying 90 % of the U.S. market , according to the State Department .
Moreover , President Alan Garcia is a staunch foe of the drug .
“ Peru will not resign itself to be a country of narco - trafficking , ” vowed the pro-U.S. Garcia , who took office in 2006 .

But Peru , the world ’s No. 2 supplier , feeds a booming demand in Brazil , Europe , East Asia and as far away as Australia , authorities say .
The density of coca plantings has doubled in some cases , experts say , and the fertilizer - nourished leaf now yields a greater proportion of cocaine alkaloid , the active ingredient in cocaine .
A wave of drug - related lawlessness -- assassinations , ambushes , threats against prosecutors -- has fanned fears of the kind of narco - instability that afflicts Colombia and Mexico .
The Tijuana cartel is suspected in the 2006 slaying in Lima , the Peruvian capital , of a judge hearing a case against an alleged cartel capo .
And renewed militancy among the peasants who grow the coca leaf has sparked road closures and violent clashes with law enforcement officers .
The Garcia administration initially agreed to suspend eradication efforts , a mainstay of the U.S. - backed anti-drug policy .
But Garcia later reversed course and even suggested that clandestine laboratories be raided and bombed .
With U.S. aid that totals about $ 50 million a year , Peru has trained and deployed hundreds of anti-drug police officers .

“ If we do n’t kill the danger now , ” Garcia declared , Peru could be confronted with “ an insurgency as large as occurred in our neighboring country ” -- a reference to Colombia , where cocaine underwrites guerrilla armies .
Former Interior Minister Fernando Rospigliosi has warned of the corrosive effect of a burgeoning drug trade .
“ Its tentacles always reach to the halls of the highest authority , ” he said .
During the 1990s , U.S. - backed enforcement efforts chased much of the coca trade to Colombia .
Now , some say , the wheel is turning : Pressure in Colombia is shifting production here .
But today ’s tableau is distinct from the brazen scenario of the late 1980s and early ‘ 90s .

Gone are the Colombian drug barons swaggering around in opulent jungle redoubts such as the nearby town of Uchiza , once dubbed the world cocaine capital , with its gaudy discos and bordellos .
Replacing the Colombians is a multinational network that reaches from the Amazon basin to a globalized market .
“ We ’re up against an army of ants , ” said Gen. Miguel Hidalgo , who heads Peru ’s national anti-drug police .
Authorities here have identified smuggling rings from Mexico , Colombia , Brazil , Nigeria and the Dominican Republic , among other countries .
A Peruvian gang allegedly headed by a petite woman known as Floricienta ( after the lead character in an Argentine soap opera of the same name ) is said to control a massive chemical - supply network .
Today , Peruvian traffickers produce pure cocaine for export , not the paste that was once regularly shipped to Colombia for final processing .

U.S. - supported police efforts have shut down clandestine landing strips and pinched road access to the isolated planting districts on the Andes ’ lush eastern flanks .
But ever - adaptable traffickers have expanded cultivation zones while employing pack animals and mochileros -- backpackers -- to maintain the illicit flow .
Negotiating extreme terrain , low - tech legions use mules to haul in the essential chemical precursors , and cocaine - laden backpackers stealthily travel age - old Inca trails beneath the canopy , creating invisible contraband thoroughfares .
“ Everything is now done on a small scale , a lot of little pieces , ” said Col.
Whitman Rios , head of special operations at the U.S. - supported anti-drug base here in the Upper Huallaga Valley , Peru ’s most notorious production zone .
This is an area of hypnotic natural beauty , where the mighty Huallaga River meanders through luxuriant hills and sumptuous flatlands like a chocolate - colored pretzel in a vast sea of green .
From the air , there is no hint of the battles raging amid the verdant expanses .

On the ground , government forces deploy against targets gleaned from satellite imagery and informants .
Then , Vietnam - era U.S. helicopters ferry in “ eradicators ” armed with metal tools designed to yank coca plants from their roots .
Unlike Colombia , Peru bans chemical spraying ; it is all done by hand .
Coca growers , known as cocaleros , have devised a crafty countermeasure :
Some plants are rigged with homemade bombs ; rat traps serve as triggering devices .
“ I reached for the bush and it exploded in my face , ” said Jose Angel Solano Gomez , 40 , an eradicator who lost his left eye and suffered other injuries in an encounter with a pipe bomb attached to a coca plant .
He says he was thrown three yards into the air .
In the last two years , 73 eradication workers have been wounded and two killed , the government says .
More than two dozen police officers have died in drug - related violence .
Advertisement
Flanked by armed escorts , eradicators set out in the stifling heat , like an odd amalgam of ancient and futurist warriors :
They don helmets , eye - protection gear and bulletproof vests and , when needed , carry 10 - foot lances that provide some distance from booby - trapped shrubs .
Paramedics tote antivenin for snakebites and medication for blast and gunshot wounds .
Teams of U.S. - trained bomb dogs sniff the fields .
“ The campesinos say we ’re taking away their livelihoods , ” said Hugo Gozar , 50 , a veteran eradicator , referring to the farmworkers .
Throughout the Andean Amazon basin , the imperative of the marketplace pushes peasants to the dependable coca plant .
About 65,000 Peruvian families make a living off the coca leaf and trafficking , according to a U.S. State Department report released last month .
Alternative crops such as oil palm and cacao have met with some success , U.S. officials say .
But many impoverished farmers insist that no legal product can replace the myth - shrouded bush and its profitable harvests .
Advertisement
“ Here , there is no alternative to coca , ” said Juan Leon Echegaray , a father of six and a cocalero near Tingo Maria .
“ They come and they offer us a few chickens and some cacao .
How am I to survive on that ? ”
Despite the cocaleros ’ hostility , authorities managed to eradicate about 27,000 acres of coca last year in the Upper Huallaga .
But that only kept pace with new plantings , often in previously eradicated zones .
Many cocaleros have migrated to ever - more - remote patches of the Apurimac and Ene river valleys known in narco - parlance as “ liberated zones . ”
“ The narcos and their sicarios [ hired killers ] act in these zones with complete impunity , ” said Rospigliosi , the former interior minister .
“ They ’ve bought off local officials and have complete control . ”

The flourishing narco trade , authorities say , is stimulating a fresh incarnation of the Maoist rebel group Sendero Luminoso , or Shining Path , which terrorized the nation before being beaten down in the 1990s .
Shining Path was never vanquished in coca country , where the rebels have long imposed “ taxes ” on traffickers , timber harvesters and others .
The Sendero band along the Huallaga is led by the elusive “ Comrade ” Artemio , a veteran guerrilla who commands somewhere between a few dozen and more than 100 armed men , authorities say .
Following the blueprint of Colombian guerrillas , police say , Shining Path cadres are deep into the coca trade , ambushing police , targeting eradicators and killing suspected informers .
The guerrillas also provide rolling security for cocaine - laden backpackers and secret drug labs , where handwritten signs warn recruits that loose lips can cost them their heads , literally .
Like their Colombian counterparts , authorities say , senderistas are integrating vertically : Insurgents have moved into the production side , planting coca , processing leaves and smuggling .

“ Shining Path is n’t about ideology anymore , ” said Gen. Juan Zarate , who heads Peru ’s eradication effort .
“ Now it ’s all about the narco - business . ”

I was having a very , very difficult afternoon .
After over a year of pondering , we finally had an excuse to wedge a date widget into our web - based intranet app .
Unfortunately , the Javascript library that we chose does n't exactly have a plethora of widget options unless you 're also using the underlying platform the library likes .
Yes , I 'm talking to you , Prototype .
Stop that , it 's annoying .
The date widget we picked is hardly feature - packed , but it gets the job done well .
Well , rather , it gets the job it was designed for done well .
It was n't designed to be a real date widget .
It 's just a calendar with decent support for doing whatever you want with it , and it even favors YYYY - MM - DD like we already use throughout our app .
Something it did n't do was automatically change its own date when the user manually edits the date field while the widget is active .
It was an annoying problem with an easy and straightforward fix .
But then I started testing .
Whenever I picked a date in August or September , the widget would n't update .
Every other month worked fine .
Deeply confused , I dug in more .
The 8th and 9th of the month also would n't update the widgets .
Confused , I dove back into the code .
var date_bits = element.value.match (/^( \d{4} ) \-( \d { 1,2} ) \-( \d { 1,2} ) $ / ) ; var new_date = null ; if ( date_bits && date_bits .
length == 4 && parseInt ( date_bits [ 2 ] ) > 0 && parseInt ( date_bits [ 3 ] ) >
0 ) new_date = new Date( parseInt( date_bits [ 1 ] ) , parseInt ( date_bits [ 2 ] ) - 1 , parseInt ( date_bits [ 3 ] ) ) ;
' 2008 - 09 - 01 ' was coming out of that regex as [ ' 2008-09-01 ' , ' 2008 ' , ' 09 ' , ' 01 ' ] , so no problem there .
parseInt ( '2008 ' ) == 2008 , good .
parseInt ( '09 ' ) == ...
If you guessed 9 , you fail .
No , it 's zero .
See , Javascript supports octal numbers .
Any number starting with a zero is octal , even if it can't be an actual octal number .
In certain languages , like Perl , trying to use a non-octal number as an octal number results in an error .
In other languages , like Javascript , it silently fails .
So , thank you Javascript , for teaching me something I did n't know about you ... and making me hate your quirks all the more .
21 ) Try out some digital workflow tools
It is perhaps not surprising that the problems of digital workflow has not really been solved , since the problems of paper workflow are still with us , and we have been using paper for a long time .
I have been through different versions of solutions ( del.icio.us anyone ? ) and I certainly remember the days when the worst part about upgrading a computer was losing my bookmarks file .
So I tried out Pocket , and I think there is potential there , at least for saving things that I know I want to read , but I do n’t want to keep for longer than that .
I do n’t yet have the habit of using it , but I have it on my ipad and my computer , and I will keep trying .
I also need to develop the habit of going there and then deciding what to do with the links I put there .
Sometimes I read them and delete , and other times I move them over to Pintrest ( in the case of some sewing patterns ) or leave them in Pocket for later use on my class Portal or something else .
22 ) Share a workflow
I do n’t know if other people would find it useful , but one of the few digital workflows I have developed that I really like is for grading papers .
It does not matter how the students turn them in ( right now I am using the portal , before that I used Moodle , before that email ) , but I end up with student work ( text files ) in folders by section on my hardrive .
They have turned them in in Word , Pages , and sometimes also . txt , .rtf , or .odt .
I open them all in Word ( for Pages this means opening in Pages and exporting , but it is quick , and worth it ) .
In Word , I turn on Track Changes , and I do all my comments and feedback there .
Then , when I am done , I save the Word file ( in case I need to go back and add something ) and then also save as a PDF , which I return to the student on the Portal ( or Moodle , or email , or whatever ) .
The PDF format can be read by every student , so it does not matter if their copy of Word is the same as mine , or if they like Pages better , they just need to view my comments .
If they want to make the suggested changes , they go back to their original document in whatever their favorite word processing program is .
The one thing students do n’t like is that I wo n’t take papers turned in as Google Docs .
I just do n’t have a good workflow for that , and I do n’t really want one .
But this question does sometimes require me to teach them about exporting from Google Docs as .rtf , a format most of them have not heard of .
Often they can download as a Word doc , but when that does not work .rtf is the next best choice .
My confusion from yesterday was due to a bug , which was promptly fixed — test case , fix .
Now that I understand what is intended , the situation is a lot clearer .
In Python 3.0 , there are two types of strings , Bytes and Unicode , and the determination of the type is static .
With Ruby 1.9 , there is one type of string , and the associated encoding is mutable .
The internal state of a given sequence of bytes with respect to the current encoding is : UNKNOWN , 7BIT , VALID , and BROKEN .
UNKNOWN is a mechanism to delay the binding , and the combination of the bug and the delayed binding made the situation confusing as correctness of the result produced depended on the order of the operations performed .
The bug affected gsub ! , but not sub , sub ! or gsub .
With the released 1.9.0 version of Ruby , gsub !
the state of the resulting string was not updated .
Oops .
Now that that is corrected , everything works as expected , for some values of expected .
Things I was not previously aware of :
Array # pack does not set the encoding .
For some cases , it is arguable that the encoding could be inferred , including the common idiom of [ Fixnum ] .
pack ( 'U ' ) , but Ruby 1.9 makes no attempt to do so .
Fixnum.chr( Encoding ) is the preferred alternative .
does not set the encoding .
For some cases , it is arguable that the encoding could be inferred , including the common idiom of , but Ruby 1.9 makes no attempt to do so .
is the preferred alternative .
String #ascii_only ? and String #valid_encoding ?
may be used to probe the internal state of a given string .
Once probed , the state is no longer UNKNOWN .
and may be used to probe the internal state of a given string .
Once probed , the state is no longer .
The meaning of " \xXX " depends on the encoding declared in the source file .
This may be turn out to be handy .
depends on the encoding declared in the source file .
This may be turn out to be handy .
Locale environment variables only affect the interpretation of data files , not source files .
This policy seems defensible .
In addition to " \uXXXX " , unicode strings may be expressed as " \u{X} " where X may be a space separated sequence of hex strings of any length .
\u {10464 } is a Faihu character and " \u{a3 a5 20ac} " produces the pound , yen , and euro characters .
The net result of all this is that any sequence of operations that produce a runtime exception in Ruby 1.9 would also produce a runtime exception in Python 3.0 .
Some use cases that are entirely safe will not produce an exception in Ruby 1.9 when they would in Python 3.0 .
Such an approach is entirely consistent with a dynamic language .

Wikileaks , the whistleblower site that recently leaked documents related to prisons in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay , was taken offline last week by its U.S. host after posting documents that implicate a Cayman Islands bank in money laundering and tax evasion activities .
In a pretty extraordinary ex-parte move , the Julius Baer Bank and Trust got Dynadot , the U.S. hosting company and domain registrar for Wikileaks , to agree not only to take down the Wikileaks site but also to " lock the wikileaks.org domain name to prevent transfer of the domain name to a different domain registrar . "
Judge Jeffrey
White in the U.S. District Court for Northern California signed off on the stipulation between the two parties last week without giving Wikileaks a chance to address the issue in court .
The Julius Baer Bank , a Swiss bank with a division in the Cayman Islands , took issue with documents that were published on Wikileaks by an unidentified whistleblower , whom the bank claims is the former vice president of its Cayman Islands operation , Rudolf Elmer .
The documents purport to provide evidence that the Cayman Islands bank helps customers hide assets and wash funds .
After failing to convince Wikileaks to take down the documents , the bank went after its U.S. hosting service , which responded by agreeing not only to remove the Wikileaks account from Dyndadot 's server but also to help prevent Wikileaks from moving its site to a different host .
Julie Turner , an attorney in California who represented Wikileaks prior to this latest litigation but is not counsel for the group on this matter , is surprised that the court sanctioned such a broad agreement .
" It ’s like saying that Time magazine published one page of sensitive material so ( someone can ) seize the entire magazine and put a lock on their presses , " she says .
Turner says she had been speaking with the bank last month on Wikileaks ' behalf when the negotiations fell through .
" The bank wanted the documents taken down and Wikileaks was not prepared to do so .
It was a pretty short negotiation , " she says .
When the bank 's lawyers indicated they would be filing a suit , she asked them to tell her where so that Wikileaks could find an attorney in the appropriate jurisdiction to represent it .
She says the lawyers refused to tell her .
Two and a half weeks later , the bank filed a restraining order against Dynadot and Wikileaks in San Francisco .
Wikileaks received notice only a few hours before the case went to a judge who accepted the agreement between Dynadot and the bank .
Turner says that rather than trying to censor the information , the bank could have simply responded to the claims on the Wikileaks site .
She also chastised the bank for not having better security over its documents .
" If you 're dealing with banking records . . . if your bread and butter is confidentiality in banking , then you ’d really better have mechanisms by which you can control documents .
The bank itself should have had better security mechanisms rather than allowing employees to take electronic copies of things or make copies of things and remove them .
That ’s not Wikileaks ' fault . "
Despite the ruling , Wikileaks continues to host the sensitive documents from servers located outside the U.S. Coincidentally , or not , the organization 's hosting center in Sweden was also struck by a denial - of - service attack , after which a fire erupted in the center as well .
Attempts to reach Wikileaks to obtain more information were unsuccessful .
Calls to Dynadot for comment went unanswered .
UPDATE : Readers have asked for links to access Wikileaks .
Cryptome has provided the bank documents in a convenient download .
You can also view a mirror of the Wikileaks site or download a torrent of the Wikileaks archive .
Alternatively , as a few readers have pointed out , you can still reach the original Wikileaks site by using this direct link to it .

Adam Deeley was described as " your regular lovely guy "
The owners of Swansea 's Monkey Cafe say they are devastated by the death of Adam Deeley , from Birmingham .
Staff and other guests tried but failed to revive Mr Deeley , 34 , who worked at the cafe , but was off - duty at the time .
His colleague Paul Cunningham said : " Do n't play these games because they can end in tragedy . "
South Wales Police are to interview other guests at the party , but said there were no suspicious circumstances .
Mr Deeley , who had recently finished studying graphic design at Swansea Metropolitan University and had worked at the cafe for the past year , died at the end of a party early on Friday .
Mr Cunningham , a sound engineer at the cafe , was not there on the night , but said it happened in the aftermath of a fund - raising event for an exhibition by a local artist .
The bottom line is , if anyone is going to start playing pranks by stuffing large quantities of food in their mouths , be wary
Paul Cunningham , friend
" Apparently a few of the staff and organisers were here finishing off what was left of the buffet , " he said .
" It 's just one of those unfortunate accidents .
" I was n't here , but I would have thought [ people would have said ] : fairy cakes lying around , let 's see how many of these we can stuff in our mouths to have a laugh .
" He was n't doing it alone , there were a few others doing it , from what I understand .
" The bottom line is , if anyone is going to start playing pranks by stuffing large quantities of food in their mouths , be wary . "
' Very kind and considerate '
Mr Cunningham said : " It 's something that we 've all done .
We 've all seen how many marshmallows we can put in our mouth , or cakes or biscuits or whatever it is , and this one went horribly wrong . "
He described his friend as " your regular lovely guy " who was " always very kind , very considerate and great fun to be around " .
" He would kind of sit in the wings and be there , but on occasions he would pop up say ' hello , here I am ' and become the life and soul of the party .
He was very well balanced and a lovely man . "
The club will organise a tribute to Mr Deeley after his funeral .
In a statement , club owners Amanda Davey and Paul Dyke said : " We are all devastated by this tragic accident .
" Adam was loved by his co-workers and friends at the Monkey Cafe - we are all in shock .
" It was a tragic accident and very sad and should serve as a cautionary tale .
" Our deepest sympathy goes out to his family . "
Flowers have been laid outside the cafe bar , with many bearing tributes .
Mr Deeley 's family have travelled to south Wales to identify his body .
A South Wales Police spokesman said : " The issue concerning cakes is something we are looking at as a contributory factor in his passing . "
A spokesman for the Welsh Ambulance Service said : " We attended after receiving a report a man was choking at the Monkey Cafe .
" A paramedic was sent initially but within 10 minutes a full emergency ambulance arrived which later took the patient to Singleton Hospital . "

5 A World War II Pilot Used Jell - O to Copy a Map
So it 's World War II .
You 've been sent into a secret Axis meeting room to obtain top - secret maps of the enemy 's troop movements .
You can't steal the maps because that would raise suspicions and you can't write down the coordinates because you 're retarded .
Or you do n't have a pencil .
Whichever is easier for you to believe .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
All you 've got is a wooden tray and a pocket full of Jell - O you snuck out of the mess tent .
You do n't know why you stole a handful of Jell - O , and you especially do n't know why you stored it in your pocket , but there 's no turning back now .
You can hear guards moving in and you 've only got a few minutes to get what you came for .
What should you do other than have the most pathetic last meal of all time ?
According to the book , Colditz -- The Definitive History : The Untold Story of World War II 's Great Escapes , a group of British pilots in the Colditz prisoner camp were in that exact same situation .
The boys gathered together some of the gelatin they had as rations , put the map face up on a wooden tray and poured the Jell - O ( lemon - flavored ) over them .
They then took the Jell - O and pressed it on a sheet of clear greaseproof paper .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
It worked .
They were able to make 30 copies of the map and enjoyed a tasty meal of lemon - flavored Jell - O because the British were clever , smart and have no taste buds .
Could MacGyver Have Done it Better ?
According to MacGyver , a map " can get you in and out of places a lot of different ways " other than just getting yourself from point A to point B .
As this video clearly shows , a map can help you unlock doors , distract women in burkas and beat an armed guard senseless :
If the video ran just a little bit longer , MacGyver also could have showed you how a map can help you break up with your pregnant girlfriend , pay off your student loans and establish a Palestinian state .
So , yes , while the Jell - O thing was impressive , with 30 copies of a map we 're thinking MacGyver could have ended the war .

Question for the next GOP debate : yea or nay on signing statements ?
Bush ’s abuse of signing statements has been a constitutional mess for several years now — with more than 151 signing statements challenging 1149 provisions of laws , Bush is without rival in American history — but this week , matters grew particularly ugly .
After a bizarre and unexpected veto , Congress passed a defense authorization bill , funding , among other things , salaries for U.S. troops .
The president signed the measure into law , but issued signing statements explaining which parts of the law he ’s decided to ignore .
Most notably , Congress ( you know , the branch with the power of the purse ) , prohibited the use of federal funds to establish permanent US military bases in Iraq .
Bush made the measure law , and then said he reserves the right to use federal funds to establish permanent US military bases in Iraq .
Dan Froomkin translated : “ The overall message to Congress was clear : I ’m not bound by your laws . ”
As one might imagine , lawmakers were less than pleased .
* House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) : “ I reject the notion in his signing statement that he can pick and choose which provisions of this law to execute .
His job , under the Constitution , is to faithfully execute the law – every part of it – and I expect him to do just that . ”
* Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) : “ Congress has a right to expect that the Administration will faithfully implement all of the provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 — not just the ones the President happens to agree with … .
With his signature these provisions become the law of the land .
Congress and the American people have a right to expect that the Administration will now faithfully carry them out . ”
* Sen. Jim Webb ( D - Va. ) : “ [ T ]he President of the United States — who has been in charge of the conduct of this war and whose administration has been in charge of executing these contracts , supervising them , making sure that they meet the requirements of fairness in the law — is now saying that he believes that a legislative body can enact a law that he can choose to ignore because he says it would interfere with his responsibility to supervise a war as Commander - and - Chief . ”
So , here ’s the question : where are the Republicans ?
More notably , where are the Republican presidential candidates , led by a sitting senator ?
We know what Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama think ; they ’ve both decried these extra-constitutional signing statements on several occasions .
But Matt at TP raises a good point : John McCain at least used to oppose Bush ’s favorite tactic .
In the past , McCain has spoken out aggressively against signing statements , saying they are “ wrong ” and that they “ should not be done ” : “ I would never issue a signing statement , ” the Arizona senator said at a Rotary Club meeting in Nashua , adding that he “ would only sign it or veto ” any legislation that reached his desk as president .
Perhaps McCain is keeping silent because he shares Bush ’s goal of an indefinite , long - term presence of American troops in Iraq .
Last month , McCain said it would be “ fine with ” him “ if we maintain a presence in ” Iraq for “ a hundred ” years .
Maybe some enterprising political reporter could follow up on this .
Do McCain , Romney , and Huckabee all believe Bush has the constitutional authority to give himself a pass on following certain parts of bills ?
Are any of them prepared to publicly criticize Bush ’s latest signing statements ?
Are any of them prepared to assure voters they wo n’t follow in Bush ’s constitutionally dubious wake ?
On a related note , most of the major dailies ignored the signing statement flap , but The Daily Show provided a pretty solid overview of why the president ’s tactic is so offensive .

Trouble is , I never sent this particular parcel .
My wife looked it over , and we realized that it had the right address , but there was no such apartment number .
We looked up the name at the top , but there is no R. Kent in the phone book , nor any people with the same last name with a similar street number .
A quick search on Canada Posts website reveals the postal code to be valid on a nearby street .
My wife opened it , and you can imagine our reaction to its contents .
We debated if it was a friend playing a joke on us , or if it was intended to be found and cause trouble .
However , Canada Customs never found out about the contents , so the point is rendered moot .
I will keep the contents for now , and remail the envelope with a photo of its former contents with a short note saying if he gets in touch with the person how mailed it orginally , he can drop by and retrieve it .
He better hurry though , as I only intend to hang onto it for so long .
Opening Ruby gems in TextMate
Update : Mike pointed out below how to avoid hard coding the path to your installed gems , so I 've updated the scripts to use gem environment gemdir accordingly .
Thanks Mike ...
How often do you find yourself wanting to check the source code of a locally installed Ruby gem ?
Do you find it painful digging around your filesystem to locate the gems directory ?
Rather than this :
mate / Library / Ruby / Gems/1.8/gems/activerecord-2.0.2
I now type this :
mategem activerec[tab ]
Note the [ tab ] key , which converts " activerecord " into " activerecord -2.0.2 " .
mategem is a bash script .
Here 's the code ( copy it into a file called mategem in the /usr / local / bin directory on your Mac ) :
#!/bin/sh usage ( ) { echo " Usage : $ ( basename $ 0 ) < gem > " 1 >&2 exit 1 } GEM = " $ 1 " [ - z " $ GEM " ] && usage mate " $( gem environment gemdir ) / gems / $ GEM "
Then make it executable :
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mategem
You now have a working copy of mategem .
The eagle eyed amongst you will notice that we 've not done anything to setup the behaviour of the tab key .
And you'd be right ; it wo n't work yet .
Tab completion is controlled by Bash ( the command prompt that is probably running in your Terminal ) .
To tell Bash how to convert " activerec " into " activerecord - 2.0.2 " , add this code to the end of your ~/. bashrc file :
_mategem ( ) { local curw COMPREPLY = ( ) curw=$ {COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]} local gems= " $ ( gem environment gemdir ) / gems " COMPREPLY =( $( compgen - W '$ ( ls $ gems ) ' -- $ curw ) ) ; return 0 } complete - F _mategem -o dirnames mategem
Now tell bash to re-read your ~/. bashrc file :
source ~/.bashrc
Test it by typing mategem and pressing the tab key twice .
You should then be able to browse through your locally installed gems .
Neat , eh ?
You can use this technique to browse the source of any programming language , not just Ruby ; just change a few paths , rename the command , and you 'll be away .

Voter registration down in N.O. , especially among Democrats and African - Americans
by Michelle Krupa , The Times - Picayune
A new study by a political scientist confirms what election - watchers have suspected since Hurricane Katrina :
The number of voters in the New Orleans area has fallen sharply , with African - Americans and registered Democrats losing the most ground .
The political landscape has shifted , especially in New Orleans .
Though voter rolls have remained virtually untouched since the flood , the comparison of voter turnout in the 2003 and 2007 gubernatorial contests shows that about 100,000 fewer people cast ballots last year in New Orleans and seven surrounding parishes than in the 2003 race .
Losses were n’t borne equally by racial and party - affiliated groups , according to the analysis by University of New Orleans political scientist Ed Chervenak .
For instance , a disproportionate loss among black voters across the region helped drive up white voters ’ share of the electorate , from two - thirds in 2003 to nearly three - quarters last year .
Democrats also lost ground , with their participation sliding from 58 percent of the electorate in 2003 to 51 percent in 2007 , the report shows .
Republicans , meanwhile , saw their share of the voting population jump from 28 percent to 33 percent during the period .
With the number of voters across the rest of the state staying about even during the four - year span , the drop in turnout in the New Orleans area suggests the region has lost political clout since the 2005 storm , Chervenak writes in the report .
“ The city ’s political voice was weaker in the last gubernatorial contest as voters here comprised only 6 percent of the state ’s overall electorate , ” compared with an average of 10 percent in the previous six races for governor , according to the report .
The study also offers a far clearer picture of how the voting population has shifted within city limits .
Reflecting patterns of damage from Katrina , turnout across Gentilly , eastern New Orleans and the Lower 9th Ward dropped nearly 60 percent from 2003 to 2007 , while turnout across the rest of the city dipped between 27 percent and 36 percent , depending on the neighborhood , the study concluded .
Reshuffling the deck
After reviewing the report , Silas Lee , a local pollster and political strategist , said that although it ’s impossible to know how New Orleans ’ repopulation will affect future elections , the UNO study portends new dynamics in regional and statewide races .
“ Anytime you lose 100,000 voters , it impacts influence , ” Lee said .
“ New Orleans will still be significant .
However , you have somewhat of a different political ideology than you had pre-Katrina — different kinds of voters with respect to social and economic and demographic status and political affiliation . ”
Christine Day , chairwoman of UNO ’s political science department , said the report offers a glimpse into how the region ’s politics might change after the 2010 U.S. census .
“ It has really important implications for the redrawing of districts — congressional districts and all the way down , ” she said .
“ Presumably , when districts are redrawn , Orleans Parish could lose clout .
That said , the suburban areas probably will gain some clout , especially Jefferson and St. Tammany . ”
Unlike previous analyses of voter turnout , which generally have relied on precinct estimates to gauge participation based on race and party affiliation , the UNO study uses hard numbers compiled by the secretary of state .
Records of who showed up to vote are matched with information provided in voter registration documents ; which candidate each voter chose remains a secret .
Chervenak reviewed voter turnout data from 2003 and 2007 for eight parishes in the New Orleans area : Jefferson , Orleans , Plaquemines , St. Bernard , St. Charles , St. John the Baptist , St. Tammany and Tangipahoa .
The decline of more than 100,000 voters between the two elections represented a 23 percent drop across the region .
Not surprisingly , change figures varied widely by parish .
Faring best was St. Tammany , where 6 percent more voters turned out last year than in 2003 , a bump that likely owes to the migration of residents from more flood - ravaged parishes .
All other parishes saw drops in voter participation , ranging from a 2 percent dip in Jefferson to a 52 percent plummet in St. Bernard .
‘ More racially balanced ’
In hard numbers , Orleans Parish showed the largest decline , with 60,000 fewer voters heading to the polls .
That loss , Chervenak writes , accounted for most of the region ’s decline .
Across the eight parishes , the number of black voters dropped 41 percent between the 2003 and 2007 gubernatorial races , while the number of white voters dropped just 15 percent , the report states .
The analysis suggests there has been a sharp change in the racial composition of the region , particularly in Orleans Parish .
In City Council districts B and C , a black majority in the electorate slipped away , and the districts are now almost evenly divided by race .
“ The city now has a more racially balanced electorate , ” Chervenak writes .
“ The days when local candidates could appeal to Orleans ’ overwhelmingly black electorate and receive a handful of white votes to win office may be a thing of the past . ”
He acknowledges that the analysis excludes children and teenagers who are too young to vote .
But the “ precise nature of the data makes it a robust measure of the population decline , ” he writes .
However , Allison Plyer , deputy director of the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center , cautioned against using the numbers to estimate population shifts across the region .
With many variables affecting whether voters go to the polls , the measure can be wildly uncertain , she said .
“ You can imagine that media spending and / or enthusiasm would differ greatly among certain populations , ” Plyer said .
“ It could be raining that day .
Literally , weather on the day of the election could have an effect on turnout . ”

At last !
Conservatives stand up against the Muslim menace
, including Michelle Malkin and , Ive heard , various commenters at the conservative website , evidently think this T - shirt is a brave and defiant gesture against militant Muslims .
Try to imagine H.G. Wellss Eloi puffing themselves up and thinking that they re being defiant against the Morlocks , and youd have something like this T - shirt .
These are the same conservatives  who see Mark Steyn as a Churchillian figure .
In fact , this tactic of taking what seems like a strong conservative stand only to retract it with a wink and a smile , as this cutesy T - shirt does , has been a characteristic feature of modern conservatism .
I first became aware of this when reading some of David Brookss articles in The Weekly Standard in the mid-1990s .
Brooks would start out decrying some decadent aspect of the culture , and youd really get into the article , thankful that a mainstream conservative magazine was saying these things .
But then , at the end of the article , Brooks would turn around and say that the very thing he had been so strongly critical of didnt matter anyway , that it was ok , that we could live with it .
So he aroused all kinds of genuine conservative thoughts and feelings , only to undermine them .
The impact of this technique of subversion is to silence and paralyze any actual conservative response to the ills of our time .
Mark Steyn , of course , is the ultimate practitioner of this method .

And here I always thought it was my period !
" Ooh , touchy !
You must be on the rag ! "
—
First we need to deal with the fact that anyone who says this is an idiot , and not just because they have the emotional maturity of a zygote .
The misogynistic " joke " here is predicated on the concept that women are " moody " when they have PMS , which stands for premenstrual syndrome .
Pre .
As in before .
As in not having her period yet .
For many PMS - sufferers , getting one 's period alleviates some of all symptoms of PMS , particularly as regards irritability and tension .
So the whole " on the rag " thing does n't really make a whole lot of sense , for a whole lot of women .
I suppose the sort of fuck - knuckle who uses a " joke " like this is n't too concerned about its medical accuracy , but I 'm a pedant , so there you go .
My real gripe , however , is the general presumption , which is widely held , even by some of the most feminist people I know , that women who suffer cyclical irritability with their menstrual cycles get " irrational " and / or express anger about things that do n't really bother them ; it 's just that they 're being " sensitive " because of the whole period thing .
The problem is that I 've seen people using that erroneous presumption as an excuse to not deal with the issue about which anger is being expressed , including women themselves , who have been told over and over that their periods do make them irrational and sensitive and thusly feel inclined to exhort partners to " just ignore " them — a request often obliged with no small amount of self - congratulation .
Let 's put this shit to bed right now : Women do n't lose their minds when they have period - related irritability .
It does n't lower their ability to reason ; it lowers their patience and , hence , tolerance for bullshit .
If an issue comes up a lot during " that time of the month , " that does n't mean she only cares about it once a month ; it means she 's bothered by it all the time and lacks the capacity , once a month , to shove it down and bury it beneath six gulps of willful silence .
Those are the things most worth paying attention to .
( By both people involved . )
Such a bargain was struck at Shakes Manor many years ago , with a conversation that went something like this :
Liss :
If I find one more of your trimmed whiskers in my fucking toothbrush , I will rip your throat out .
Mr. Shakes :
Why is it oonly when yer PMS - ing that my filthy bathroom habits toorn ye into a raving lunatic , wooman ?
Liss :
Your filthy bathroom habits annoy me 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
It 's only when I 'm PMS - ing that I lack the tolerance and inclination to bite my tongue .
Mr. Shakes : Oh .
I get it noo .
He tries not to get whiskers in my toothbrush .
I try to mention things before I 'm at the end of my rope .
If I get to the point where I 'm hanging on by a thread , we both pay particular attention .
That seems to work .
Oh , also ?
Not treating PMS like something about which I should be ashamed .
I experience it .
It makes me short - tempered .
There are things that make Mr. Shakes short - tempered , too — like being under the gun at work .
We pay attention in the same way , then .
He 's not ashamed , either — not that anyone was ever telling him he should be .
Even though this is technically Woman 101 , I 'm filing it under Feminism 101 , because I do n't feel inclined to create a separate category of informative posts about the mysteries of boobies and cooters .
I do , however , just want to take a moment to quickly address a myth about menstruation that has always aggravated me , but is now seriously grating on my last good nerve like a cheese grater to parmesan at the Olive Garden .
( And yes , sadly , it has reached a fevered pitch because a woman , and a post - menopausal woman at that , is running for president . )
A new computer centre in Switzerland is making novel use of the hot air thrown off by its servers and communications equipment : the heat is being funneled next door to warm the local swimming pool .
When computing companies talk about " greening " their energy - guzzling data centers , that usually means powering the centers with renewable sources or using more - efficient servers .
In a few cases , the heat produced by the computers is used to warm nearby offices .

I am sitting here terrified .
I am among the great unwashed at YVR , waiting to board my Air Transat flight to London , and I am not a good flier .
I am going , once I swallow a couple Ativans , to Glasgow , and there 's really only one reason why : Richard Ashcroft .
He 's the former / current lead singer of '90s Britpop band The Verve .
( You may recall them from their hit " Bittersweet Symphony , " a chart topper in 1997 , that now makes me feel a bit old when I hear it played elevator - style at Shoppers Drug Mart . )
But , though The Verve reunited last year in Glasgow , I am not going for The Verve , only for Ashcroft .
Ashcroft , you see , released one of my favourite albums , Alone With Everybody , in June 2000 , his first solo effort after the breakup of the monumentally popular The Verve .
Critics panned it , saying it was too sentimental , too lazily written and , most criminally , not at all like The Verve .
Myself , and my lifelong best friend , a woman with whom I have little in common except music , adored the album .
Dreamy and string - gilded , it was the sound of a man in love , whereas The Verve 's lyrics always come down to one dire message , best summed up in their 1995 single , " On Your Own " :
You come in on your own And you leave on your own Forget the lovers you 've know And your friends on your own
But in " Alone With Everybody , " the lonely warrior , Ashcroft , had found love , and felt an elation that required epic string sections and beautiful , sentimental lyrics .
It must have been played a thousand times when we lived together , my music friend and I , usually at the end of a long night of misbehaving .
We would place the album carefully in the player , then find a suitable spot to lie on the ratty old carpet of our living room .
" Alone With Everybody " was our holy ritual : a communion between Ashcroft , my friend and myself .
The singer exalted love and beauty , and the two of us believed every word of his gospel , despite the fact that love had not ( yet ? ) drawn us to make epic symphonic albums of our own .
It was lovely , and when I think of all the things I miss about my friend , who moved to Scotland a year ago , this is the memory I hold dearest .
So this week 's music pick is an oldie that never got its due .
I recommend starting with " You On My Mind In My Sleep , " which is pure Sticky Fingers - era Stones , or the lovely , pastoral " I Get My Beat , " which is as beautiful a love song as one could ever hope to inspire .
In a matter of hours , hopefully , the flight terrors will be over and my friend and I will be lying on the floor listening to these very songs .
It 's a testament to the power of the communion we shared that I 'd get on a plane to see her .
Music , as Ashcroft himself has said , really is power .

Tyee stories :
One of the most important architectural decisions that must be done early on in a scalable web site project is splitting the data flow into two streams : one that is user specific and one that is generic .
If this is done properly , the system will be able to grow easily .
On the other hand , if the data streams are not separated from the start , then the growth options will be severely limited .
Trying to make such a web site scale will be just painting the corpse , and this change will cost a whole lot more when you need to introduce it later ( and it is “ when ” in this case , not “ if ” ) .
In a classic online book - store example , book details , prices and shop categories are all generic .
They do not depend on any particular user .
Browsing the catalogue should produce the same results for any two users at the same moment .
Actions like buying a book or reviewing orders and transactions are user specific and they cannot be shared between different users .
Why is it so important to split these two streams right from the start ?
Because generic and user - specific data flows are affected by completely different caching and partitioning constraints .
Different constraints
Keeping session footprint low , caching and partitioning have been tried and tested as best practices for scaling web systems .
If there is only a single data stream , because of different constraints , these practices will be hard to implement and even harder to improve later .
For example , most generic data flow is completely stateless , but user - specific actions are often stateful .
If these two flows are clearly separated , then we can process generic actions with stateless services and servers .
Stateless services are much easier to manage and scale than stateful services , since they can be easily replaced without any effect on the system operation .
You can just stack more cheap servers and throw requests at them using round - robin or simple load balancing when you need more power .
Stateful services cannot be scaled so easy — they might rely on resource locking and load balancers have to send all requests for a single session to the same server .
If a stateful server dies , that has a visible effect on the system operation , so these services have to be much more resilient than stateless ones .
Generic data can be cached and shared between users and even servers .
User - specific data like account information or transaction statuses should never be cached .
Similarly , there is most likely no authentication required to get the generic data , but in most cases authentication rules apply to user - specific data .
For example , anyone can view book details , but a user has to be logged in to view an order status ( and the requested order has to belong to that particular user ) .
If the two data streams are mixed , then any caching mechanism will have to analyse and understand the context of requests , and decide what should be cached on case - by - case basis .
If the two streams are split , the decision is easy : everything generic is retrieved from the cache , everything user - specific does not even try to use the cache .
No error - prone analytics involved .
The generic data flow also does not have to suffer from the authentication overhead — you can save a lot of processor power by skipping authentication when it is not needed .
We can cache generic data into static files and avoid any dynamic processing on the web servers , getting much better performance .
On e-commerce systems , user - specific pages typically have to go through HTTPS , which adds even more overhead .
Because it does not matter where the generic data flow comes from , it is also much easier to partition .
Once the system grows over the capacity of a single database , we can just take the generic content out and split it into several databases .
Splitting account data and transactions is never that easy , because those details are bound by a single context and often constrained by business rules and validations .
How to split the flow
In the classic two - tier architecture , where the web site plugs directly into the database , data flow splitting starts with using a different data source for those two streams .
Even if , on the start , everything sits in the same database , use different connection pools to retrieve user - specific and generic data .
The generic data flow does not even have to run in transactions , which can make a big difference with some databases .
If an ORM mapping library is used , then caching should be turned on for this stream .
User - specific data flow , as a general rule of thumb , should be transactional and should never be cached .
It is a good idea to hide any user - specific tables from the generic data flow using database user privileges , so that any attempts to mix the two streams get caught quickly .
Internal web site services should be designed to clearly fall into one of those two categories , and not mix methods that retrieve generic data and perform user - specific functions .
This is all a preparation for the day when the two - tier system needs to be split into more levels .
With a clear separation of responsibilities , this divorce should not be painful at all .
In three tier architectures , I like to split the middleware straight from the start into user - specific and generic servers .
Web servers sit on top , get the generic data from the first middleware group and process transactions using the second middleware group .
Generic data - flow servers can be clustered and scaled easily , and any load balancing system will work right out of the box .
They can be restarted , taken out of the cluster or put back in without any effect on the rest of the system .
Transparent caching can be applied to those servers easily .
User - specific servers , on the other hand , are much more tricky in all those aspects and should absolutely never be transparently cached .
This split is a preparation for further scaling and caching , since generic data servers can be split regionally , put under several layers of cache servers , divided vertically by product range or type .
The functionality on user - specific servers is focused and isolated , so that we will have less to focus

Bush , Petraeus and an Endless War Editor ’s Note : Gen. David Petraeus returned to Capitol
Hill with more talk of progress in Iraq but little hope that America 's 140,000 - troop - strong expeditionary force will be coming home any time soon .
In this guest essay , former Democratic congressional staffer Brent Budowsky still sees a tragic war without end :
Our matinee idol general of the day , whatever his virtues and vices , is now the commander in chief of the war without end , which the new Congress , elected to end it , continues .

Digg Email

We now have a president who dresses up like a soldier , in costume , and a general who now assumes the role of president , and a Congress that now looks like the character in the movie “ Zelig , ” popping up as a bit player during great events .
Here are a few truths that have not been told in the hours of today ’s hearing that I was capable of watching , before I could take no more .
1 . The strategy of Bush and Petraeus is simple : Stall the game out to drop on the desk of the next president , and force the next president to either continue the war indefinitely or accept the blame of their failures .
2 . We will either keep paying the 60,000 Iraqis who formerly killed Americans and now take our money on long - term retainers , or , if our money stops flowing to them , they will resume killing either our people or other Iraqis .
In a war without end , we are paying hush money without end .
3 . The big winner , as always , as was inevitable from the beginning of this misbegotten war without end , is Iran .
This is a matter of history , geography and religion .
It was inevitable before Lieberman and neocons started hungering for this war in the 1990s .
It was inevitable when it began .
It is inevitable today .
It will be inevitable in perpetuity because Iran is Shiite and adjacent to Iraq , and we are not .
4 . The only rational outcome would include a diplomatic initiative that is regional and includes Iran with a political initiative that is credible and pressures Iraqis , yet President Bush will not do this , and Gen. Petraeus lacks the moral stature of Adm.
Fallon , and goes along .
5 . “ Our man in Iraq , ” the hapless Maliki , a good friend of Iran , and a not - so - good friend of ours , ignores our advice , attacks in Basra , journeys to the battle scene like Napoleon , and leaves with his tail between his legs when a thousand Petraeus - trained Iraqi “ troops ” run for the hills .
The question is not whether Gen. Petraeus should run for president .
The problem is , in this war without end , he already is , and the sad truth is , he is the Congress , too .

Today on Boing Boing tv , a sneak peek at a new documentary film on the subversive public art collective known as Graffiti Research Lab , who develop and distribute " open source technologies for urban communication . "
The voices you 'll hear in today 's episode — GRL founders James Powderly and Evan Roth .
Link to Boing Boing tv post with discussion and downloadable video .

From their statement , redacted by the " U.S. Dept. of Homeland Graffiti " …
From their origins in the trash room of a non-profit in Manhattan to their emergence as the instigators of an international art movement , Graffiti Research Lab :
The Complete First Season documents the adventures of an architect and an engineer who quit their day jobs to develop high - tech tools for the art underground .
The film follows the GRL and their network of graffiti artist collaborators ( and commercial imitators ) across four continents as they write on skyscrapers with lasers , mock advertisers with homemade tools , get in trouble with The Department of Homeland Security and make activism fun again .
Primarily using video footage from point - and - shoot digital cameras ( " The Pocket School " ) and found - content on the web , the movie 's visual style draws as much from the art of the power point presentation and viral media as conventional documentary cinema .
Narrated by GRL co-founders , Roth and Powderly , The Complete First Season makes a humorous and insightful argument for free speech in public , open source in pop culture , the hacker spirit in graffiti and not asking for permission in general .
The film was premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2008 .
Available 24/7 on The Pirate Bay .
Part two of today 's episode documents GRL's hijinks at Maker Faire 2007 .
That event 's 2008 edition is coming up next week .
GRL was mistakenly credited with the Boston Mooninite LED Terror Freakout ; while their work no doubt inspired the street marketing team responsible for the Aqua Teen Hunger Force debacle , Powderly told Boing Boing the day it happened that GRL was not involved .

There is a reason pride goeth before the fall .
Hubris is a blind simpleton who believes he sees all and knows all .
He wanders into a strange room confident in his vision until he stumbles and falls .
Success is failure ’s womb and hubris is failure ’s birth cry .
It is a paradoxical progression from success to failure .
When a society is in its infancy , it is pragmatic , flexible , and willing to grow through trial and error .
In time , it hits on a formula that is successful and the society prospers .
As this prosperity increases the formula ossifies until that which was once pragmatic hardens into an ideological routine that becomes increasingly resistant to change .
In the end , the world changes , but the society does not .
Entitlement is the mutant growth that clings to success ’s flanks .
As success becomes habitual , there grows the conviction that success is intrinsic to the society .
Blind luck is mistaken for destiny .
Failure is no longer an option .
If , God forbid , the society should fail , the fault is not its .
There are always “ others ” to blame be they liberals , bleeding hearts , reactionaries , Communists , postmodernists , artists , poets , gay Muslim abortionists , Neocons or radicalized toddlers .
The supply of scapegoats is endless .
America sits atop an industrial and financial behemoth made possible by a geological flicker known as the “ Age of Oil . ”
In our heart of hearts we believe it will last forever because we represent the end point of history .
The sweet irony of it all is that when the dust finally settles , the Age of Oil , and the Industrial Age it spawned , will barely register as cosmic farts in the grand scheme of things .
Still , we feel empowered because we think of ourselves as a “ Beacon on a hill ” that is shedding its light on the world .
We ’ve yet to realize that the beacon has become a smudge pot that is floating its noxious murk across the face of the earth .
Being blind makes it impossible to tell the difference between a beam of light and a lethal miasma .
As 2007 draws to a close , we are a tired people , fatigued by the strain of trying to ignore an administration bent on self - destruction as it pursues brain - dead policies that only increase the world ’s misery .
Capital is being sucked towards the top of the pyramid in the belief that manna will trickle down to the poor , although the only thing that trickles down is the urine of the rich .
Our foreign policy is crippled by a Neocon clique in the throes of delusions of grandeur .
They dream demented dreams of remaking the Middle East in their image with all of the zeal of the Christian missionaries of yore .
But , instead of bibles , they use bullets and bombs .
In the Neocon vision , a country is not a living culture throbbing with the births , marriages , traumas and celebrations that are the sum total of humanity .
In their countries no mother croons a lullaby , lovers never quarrel , nothing breathes , and nothing grows .
They reduce the country to a splash of color on a map .
If the inhabitants talk funny and dress funny , it is taken as prima facie evidence that the Neocons have a moral obligation to drag the country into the twenty - first century , and if bullets and bombs wo n’t do the job , the “ Washington Consensus ” will .
They hide behind their world of “ real politik , ” certain that their crippled vision of life is reality when the true reality is that humans are more cooperative than competitive .
The only people who believe that life is a constant battle are sociopaths , policymakers and CEOs .
But , by God , we will have our oil !
Bush was right when he said we were addicted to it .
Unfortunately , he forgot to direct us to the nearest rehab .
Like the addict , we are prepared to kill for it ; unlike the addict , we can do so on a grand scale .
Prosperity has beggared our soul , leaving a void that can only be filled with the beeps and blinking lights of our electronic toys , designer kitchens , and climate - controlled houses , all of which need the oil we are bleeding away to exist .
Our hubric entitlement finds its highest expression in our conviction that we get first dibs on the oil because we are who we are .
Hardship and want are for Africans , Arabs , Orientals , and anyone else whose skin is of an off - white hue .
Our children are pampered while poverty kills one child under five years of age every three seconds .
But that ’s okay .
They are n’t ours .
Death has never hampered policy , nor does hubris take time to mourn .
Proof of our supremacy can be found in a 2006 report , National Security Consequences of U.S. Oil Dependency , which assures the world that our military will secure the global oil trade against violent disruption .
Implied in this , of course , is the assumption that we ’ll get first crack at the oil since we ’re the one ’s defending it .
“ Fear not , ” said the fox .
“ I am in hot pursuit of the missing chickens . ”
Perhaps somewhere an obscure technician has figured out how many millions of barrels of oil we will burn to protect a shrinking supply .
It would be cute if we burned two units of energy for every unit we secured ?
There are times blindness is a blessing .
You do n’t see the safe plunging towards your head .
Colonialism has aged .
Where once it sent whitemen into the tropics to die of exotic fevers as they amassed their fortunes , it is now a worn and tired bureaucratic game played by sightless simpletons unaware that the world has changed around them .
Power distorts , for it feels failure and weakness breathing down its neck .
As fear begins to stir , clear thinking is exchanged for propaganda , buzz words and sound bites .
( The fastest gun in the west is always paranoid because he knows every young buck in the territory is gunning for him .
The Swiss have the right idea : be the slowest gun in the west and make a fortune selling pocket knives . )
But , they go on and on , bankrupting the nation to control a shrinking resource instead of spending the money to find viable alternatives to the fossil fuels that have corrupted us as a people .
( We become ruthless when our toys are threatened . )
It ’s not just pride that goeth before the fall .
It ’s also a blind fool carrying a lantern he cannot see , and the even bigger fools following in his footsteps .
It is fortunate that the human spirit is able to transcend the folly of its leaders .
We will suffer ; too many will die .
But when the fools are scratching their heads and wondering where they went wrong , we will crawl out of the rubble and start over again .
Hopefully , we will be purged of our foolishness and much wiser for the experience .
We will be flexible and grow through trial and error -- until we find a formula that works …

The French President Nicolas Sarkozy today became the first major world leader to threaten China with an Olympic boycott in protest at the crackdown in Tibet .
He said he could not rule out refusing to attend the opening ceremony of the Beijing games .
Mr Sarkozy has come under increasing domestic pressure to take a stance over the unrest .
He said he has not yet made a decision on what to do , but the mere suggestion of a boycott represented a clear threat to Chinese authorities .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A French boycott of the August opening ceremony would have extra importance because France will hold the rotating EU presidency during the games .
Asked whether he supported a boycott , Mr Sarkozy said he could " not close the door to any possibility " .
" Our Chinese friends must understand the worldwide concern that there is about the question of Tibet , and I will adapt my response to the evolutions in the situation that will come , I hope , as rapidly as possible , " the president said .
Violent protests in Tibet , the most serious challenge in almost two decades to China 's rule in the region , are forcing human rights campaigners and governments to re-examine their approach to the Olympic Games .
A French - based media freedom group , Reporters Without Borders , last week appealed for an opening ceremony boycott by heads of state and government , as well as royalty - an idea that has gained the support of many French .
In a poll for Liberation newspaper , 53 % said they were " rather favourable to the idea of Mr Sarkozy staying away from the opening ceremonies .
Reporters Without Borders made headlines again yesterday when three high - ranking members were arrested at the Olympic flame - lighting ceremony after unfurling a black banner showing the Olympic rings as handcuffs .
Jean - Francois Julliard , the group 's research director , welcomed Mr Sarkozy 's comments .

" We feel that things are starting to get moving , that political leaders are starting to change their attitudes , " he said today .
He was one of the three arrested in Greece and charged with " insulting national symbols . "
He said that to his knowledge , Mr Sarkozy was the first world leader to go so far in the boycott discussion .
Prince Charles has said he will skip the Olympics .
France has wobbled on how to handle the sensitive issue .
Pierre Moscovici , a leader of the opposition Socialists , was quoted in a French newspaper over the weekend as criticising Mr Sarkozy for a " deafening silence " about the situation in Tibet .
France 's foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , suggested last week he was open to a boycott of the Beijing Olympics ' opening ceremonies , calling it an " interesting idea . "
Later he backtracked , calling it " unrealistic " and saying , " We 're not in favour of it . "
France 's Foreign Ministry said today that EU countries are to discuss the crackdown in Tibet at an informal meeting of foreign ministers on Friday in Slovenia .
Mr Sarkozy said he has told Chinese President Hu Jintao of his concern , asking for restraint and the end of violence through dialogue in Tibet .
Mr Sarkozy also disclosed contacts between his office and that of the Dalai Lama , Tibet 's exiled spiritual leader .
" I have an envoy who spoke to the authorities who are closest to the Dalai Lama , " Mr Sarkozy said .
" I want dialogue to begin , and I will gauge my response based on the response that the Chinese authorities give . "
The Dalai Lama will be in France while the games are under way in Beijing .
He is there principally to deliver Buddhist lectures .

Obama Speaks The Language of Leadership
Is Barack Obama a cult , as suggested by the New York Times , the Wall Street Journal , the Los Angeles Times , and the Washington Post ?
How else could a young African - American US senator have suddenly become the likely Democratic nominee for president ?
Why else would people start to imagine that with Obama as president , their lives will be changed forever , possibly even leading “ to thin thighs ” ?
How does he reduce audiences into such an infantile state ?
Is he deviously playing on people ’s emotions , causing them to set aside common sense and think of entrusting the country to someone so relatively inexperienced ?
Why are n’t his platitudes about change seen for what they are ?
What is the mysterious magic that Obama is deploying to achieve such extraordinary results ?
In reality , there ’s nothing mysterious or devious or platitudinous or cult - like about what Obama is doing at all : he is using well - known principles of the language of leadership to reach people ’s hearts and change people ’s minds through the skillful use of narrative .
His mastery of storytelling was on display at the Jefferson - Jackson dinner in Richmond , Virginia on February 9 , where he wove four basic narratives into a speech that inspired widespread enthusiasm , and led to a decisive victory in the primary the following Tuesday .
He began with the story of who he is , telling the story of the disadvantages he faced as a presidential candidate , turning handicaps into badges of honor .
This story seamlessly merged into a story of who we are : we are a people who are tired of the divisive politics of the past .
This story then slid into the story of who we are going to be : we are a people who are going to write a new chapter in the history of American politics and get beyond partisan politics with a different kind of president , i.e. Obama .
This was interwoven with the story of who we have been : we are the party of Jefferson , Jackson , FDR , and JFK — a party that has successfully tackled great challenges , proud inheritors of a grand tradition .
He then went back and retold similar stories in the context of the economy , health care , education , global warming , foreign policy and then the Iraq war .
In each case , the story of who he is flowed seamlessly into the story of who are and the problems we face , and then on to the story of who we are going to be : we have done this before : we can do it again .
Meanwhile Hillary ’s speech at the same dinner made abstract arguments about her “ experience . ”
They were factual , methodical , abstract and ultimately boring .
Obama ’s narrative style has four distinctive characteristics .
First is the seamless flow between the basic stories .
The story of “ who I am ” merges seamlessly with “ who we are ” and then on to “ who we are going to be . ”
The implication is : this is not about me — it ’s about us .
And the stories told are tightly aligned with Obama ’s own conduct .
There is no gap between words and action , no jarring contradiction or inconsistency .
The story that Obama tells is the story that he is living .
The passion with which he delivers the speech leaves no doubt that he means it .
Touches of self - deprecating humor , such as his disappointment in finding himself related to someone as uncool as Dick Cheney , add to the convincing picture of the calm assertiveness of leadership .
What ’s more , he explicitly acknowledges the objections to his candidacy — “ lack of experience ” , “ hope mongering ” , mere “ pretty speeches ” , “ words not solutions ” — and uses simple narratives to show why these attacks are unfounded .
Experience in Washington is a problem , not a solution : for instance , it " caused the wheels to come off John McCain ’s Straight Talk Express . "
But most important , his version of the story of who we are going to be is incompatible with Hillary Clinton or John McCain being president .
Hillary , he says , has been , and will remain , his friend , but sadly she is a creature of yesterday 's divisive politics .
As he paints an inspiring picture of tomorrow that becomes more and more alluring , it becomes clearer and clearer that such a future can only happen if we all join together , get beyond politics as usual , and elect Obama as president .
The other candidates are “ the past ” .
We are “ the future . ”
It ’s true , other factors have played a role in Obama ’s success in overcoming the massive advantages that Clinton enjoyed as a candidate : better organization on the ground , stronger fundraising , and superior handling of YouTube and the web , along with her blunder in largely ignoring the caucuses .

Here 's Victor Davis Hanson :
Under pressure to produce some facts and specifics , the Obama team is beginning to release a little on the economy , taxes , and new entitlements .
Now the reason I balk at this is that I actually sat through a long Obama speech on taxes last year in Washington .
I could n't get through the details there were so many .
It bored the pants off me .
The notion that Obama has not released details and specifics on economic policy is a fantasy .
It 's a product of pundit laziness .
The cocoon right seems to believe that because they have n't done their homework , Obama has n't .
And because Obama actually inspires with oratory , they also assume he does n't have substance .
The premise is that you cannot be inspiring and detailed at the same time .
Two words :
Why not ?
What people fail to understand is that in politics , words are also substance .
The ability to inspire people is not inherently a dangerous phenomenon .
It is sometimes critical to effective governance .
Conservatives used to understand this .
Perhaps Churchill 's greatest actual weapon was the English language .
It did things no bureaucrat , soldier , armament , or policy could do .
The core of Ronald Reagan 's success was his rhetorical ability to reach over the heads of the Washington process to the people who can force Washington to change : the American people .
And I do n't recall conservatives decrying the rhetoric of hope reacting to George W. Bush 's inspired speeches after 9/11 .
Look : flim - flam and emotional hysteria are dangerous things .
There are moments when Obama 's rhetoric gets the better of his common sense .
But the record shows that he also does have common sense - more common sense than Charles Krauthammer or me when it came to predicting the practical consequences of an Iraq occupation .
And if a potential president has a head on his shoulders and is able to inspire millions , what on earth is wrong with that ?
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Last week , world renowned physicist Stephen Hawking gave a talk in honor of NASA 's 50th anniversary on the value of human space exploration .
If anyone knows the value of not ignoring pressing realities of the day , but still keeping an eye on the bigger picture and insuring that you are devoting resources to the bigger goals of life , it 's Stephen Hawking .
There will be those who argue that it would be better to spend our money solving the problems of this planet ... I am not denying the importance of fighting climate change and global warming , but we can do that and still spare a quarter of a percent of world GDP for space .
Is n't our future worth a quarter of percent ?
Hawking , 66 , has been in a wheelchair most of his adult life and lost his ability to speak in 1985 , but has still managed to write a book , make a movie and even float weightless in zero gravity thanks to some key computer technology , the support of some extraordinary people .
His website notes in his lecture " Life in the Universe " he states that with regard to intelligent life : " I shall take this to include the human race , even though much of its behaviour through out history , has been pretty stupid , and not calculated to aid the survival of the species . "
Hawking was making the case in this lecture that going into space is critical to our survival as a species .
It will completely change the future of the human race and maybe determine whether we have any future at all .
It wo n't solve any of our immediate problems on Planet Earth , but it will give us a new perspective on them and cause us to look outwards and inwards .
Hopefully , it would unite us to face a common challenge .
His inspiring lecture even included his daughter Lucy who has co-authored a book with him to get kids excited about science called , " George 's Secret Key to the Universe . "
They are working together to get young people excited about studying math and science again , like they were during Apollo .
" We live in a society that is increasingly governed by science and technology , yet fewer and fewer young people long to go into science , " said Dr Hawking .
The talk has gotten people thinking about the future of humanity and what we should do next .
LiveScience reported Friday that a Sergeant in Afghanistan ( Sgt Ruth ) even emailed them offering him and his men as the scout party for a group of human space settlers .
We are conditioned to live with the bare minimal ( of ) life ’s necessities and are trained to be prepared for … the worst conditions that any environment could throw at us ...
Me and most of my men are on our 3rd or 4th deployment into a combat area ...
We go before everyone else and spend time living off the land .
It is impressive .
I know that most of my space science and engineering friends have n't spent many nights in the " worst conditions the environment can throw at us " and especially not for three or four tours .
Maybe we would complain a little less about paperwork or bureaucratic processes if we had lived without the comforts of home and with the constant threat of danger for a year or two .
Thank you Sgt. Ruth , for your courage , your service , your interest in human space exploration and your willingness – as you say in the close of your letter– to make the ultimate sacrifice for your country , the entire human race .

MERIDIAN , Mississippi ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain on Monday dismissed Democrat Barack Obama ’s charge that he wants a “ 100 - year war ” in Iraq and belittled Obama ’s level of national security experience .

McCain began a trip down memory lane , opening a tour to places where he grew from rebellious youth to war hero and politician .
He was a Navy flight instructor in Meridian and the McCain airfield is named for his grandfather .
But he quickly got himself enmeshed in the politics of the day , responding to Obama ’s oft - repeated charge that McCain would leave the United States in Iraq for a century .
Obama had said earlier on Monday he did not think the charge was unfair , that McCain “ has not been clear about what exactly would lead him to decide it ’s time to pull out . ”
McCain gave the Democrats an opening on the issue by using the 100 - year description to describe how long the United States might need a presence in Iraq to help maintain regional stability .
But McCain said he was talking about something similar to the decades - old U.S. military presences in Japan , South Korea and Germany .
The Arizona senator , 71 , said Obama , a senator from Illinois , “ has n’t read or does n’t understand the history of this country , ” an experience - versus - youth theme likely to play out in the months leading to the November election if Obama defeats New York Sen.
Hillary Clinton for the right to face McCain .
“ In all due respect , he displays a fundamental misunderstanding of history , of how we maintain national security and what we need to do in the future to maintain our security .
But I understand it because he has no experience or background in any of it , ” McCain told reporters on his campaign flight back to Washington .
McCain also said he was surprised by an offensive in southern Iraq by Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki because he had gotten no word that Maliki had consulted the Americans before launching it .
He said whether the mission can be deemed productive should be known in the next day or two .
McCain expressed continuing annoyance at Iran , accusing Tehran of exporting weapons to Iraq and training Iraqi Shi’ite militias .
He said he believed Iran was still seeking to acquire the means to develop a nuclear weapon , although a recent National Intelligence Estimate had suggested otherwise .
MISSED ‘MINI - SKIRT ’ PHASE
McCain said his past gave him a better understanding of the future , and that this is why he had embarked on a tour of places like Meridian .
But he expressed some misgivings about his rebellious nature as a youth , saying young people should not do as he did , such as smoking and drinking to excess .
“ Some of my behavior was very immature , ” he said .
But he said , because he was a Vietnam prisoner of war for 5 - 1 / 2 years , “ I regretted that the mini - skirt phase came and went while I was away . ”
McCain will visit his high school outside Washington , D.C. , on Tuesday and stop at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis , Maryland , where he graduated near the bottom of his class .
He will also go to Florida and his home state of Arizona .
While reviewing his past , McCain came face - to - face with the present , riding on his bus in Meridian with Rachel Lee , whose son , Dustin Lee , a 20 - year - old Marine raised in Stonewall , Mississippi , was killed in an explosion last year in Iraq ’s al - Anbar province .
McCain , a strong supporter of the U.S. troop build - up in Iraq , told Lee that the United States honored her son ’s sacrifice .
McCain ’s wife , Cindy , wept as the woman told what happened to her son .
“ We ’re without words to describe how much we appreciate it .
I think we are winning the war -- we ’ve had a problem here in the last few days , but hopefully the Anbar province will stay quiet -- thanks to the Marines and Army , ” McCain said .

7 Things Americans Pay Too Much For Mar. 17 by TKK
We all hate overpaying for things .
Money 's tight and times are tough , so it 's no surprise that we all want to get fair value for every dollar we spend .
But there are some things in this world that costs way more than it should and we have no idea why .
So join us as we count down the seven things that we should n't have to overpay for .
7- Pizza Delivery
We all love pizza ( if you do n't , there is something wrong with you ) and nothing beats ordering in a piping hot disc of deliciousness for dinner .
But the one thing we hate about getting pizza delivered is that it 's freaking expensive .
Prices are high to begin with but then some pizza joints slap on a " delivery charge " and then when it arrives , you have to tip the delivery guy on top of that .
Seriously , do the math next time you order a pizza and see how much you 're paying per slice ; yeah , you 'd probably lose your appetite pretty quickly .
Yes , I know it 's convenient and the alternatives - making it yourself , buying frozen - are less than perfect but seriously , the price of pizza is just way too high .
Unless you 're kneading flakes of gold into that dough , Mr. Pizza Company Executive , you need to slash some prices .
Now , who wants to split an extra large pepperoni with me ?
It 'll be here in about thirty minutes .
6- Gas
We all hate the rising price of gasoline but you can't really complain : gas is a valuable commodity and there are probably tons of factors at work , like supply and demand , inflation and other economic mumbo jumbo that you 're not smart enough to understand .
Right ?
Wrong .
It seems to me that the only reason why gas prices keep going up is because the companies who make and sell said gas just keep hiking them up .
Look , I 'm all for companies making a profit and if the cost of producing gasoline is rising , then go on ahead and raise your prices accordingly .
But it 's sort of galling when you consider the fact that gasoline companies keep posting " record profits " year in and year out , is n't it ?
In a perfect world , the companies would make a reasonable amount of profit while the average consumer pays a reasonable price per gallon .
In the real world , however , it seems like the average consumer gets gouged while the gasoline companies laugh all the way to the bank .
God , it makes me mad just thinking about it ; I better go jump in my Hummer and drive around for a couple of hours to cool off .
5- Cable
You'd think that with the rising popularity of video games and Netflix , the cable companies would have taken notice and lowered their prices by now .
Let 's do the math : you can shell out about thirty bucks a month to use Netflix or Gamefly 's most plentiful packages or for that same amount , you can get your cable company 's limited basic standard package that includes nine channels .
What 's that ?
You want channels actually worth watching ?
Then you better shell out for the expanded service , which will only cost you another twenty bucks .
Oh , you want HD programming ?
Yeah , HD is the new hotness , is n't it ?
That 'll be ten bucks more .
You want a DVR for TIVO like functionality ?
Sure , you can have it : for another five bucks .
By the time you 're done , you 're out over a hundred bucks a month and that does n't even factor in premium channels like HBO and Showtime .
I 'm all for paying money if I 'm being entertained but that 's just plain ridiculous .
It 's enough to make me quit watching television altogether , which I will totally consider doing after this season 's American Idol wraps up .
( That was just a joke , by the way .
I 'd rather wash my face with bleach than watch American Idol . )
4- Bottled Water
Considering it comes right out of the tap and falls freely from the sky , it 's a little depressing to think about how much we pay for bottle water .
It 's sort of a sad commentary on the state of the world and what we 've done to environment ; we 've dumped so much pollution into the ocean and into our waterways that we have to actually buy sanitized water in order to feel safe about drinking it .
But I 'm sick and tired of paying almost two dollars for a modest sized bottle at the grocery store ; what 's a premium price tag doing on a basic necessity ?
It does n't have any added nutrients or chemicals and it wo n't get you drunk or high , so why the hell are you paying so much for it ?
Because it 's clean and comes in a fancy bottle and was bottled at the peak of some fancy mountain in some far off land ?
Heck , some bottled water is n't even that : it 's just municipal tap water that 's been filtered .
You know that joke about bottled air ?
Do n't think it can't happen ; there 's a proven formula for selling a widely available commodity in place already thanks to the bottled water industry .
Just wait until pollution gets so bad that we 're all walking around with rebreathers on ; some company is going to bottle purified air and sell it to you for a premium price and we 'll all line up to buy it .
God , I hate humanity sometimes .
3- Music
You gotta love the music industry .
It 's got its head buried so far up its ass , it can lick the back of its own throat .
Instead of adjusting with the times , this dinosaur of an industry has steadfastly stuck to its ways , charging the same amount for a CD ( read : too fucking much ) that it used to charge in the past .
What these idiots do n't realize is that much like movies and books and games , people will willingly pay for the music they want - if the price is right .
But if your only two choices are to engage in a somewhat shady act like file sharing or pay fifteen dollars for a CD , well , most people are going to save their money and just hop onto their nearest file sharing network .
The move towards DRM - free music is a good first step but the music industry has lower its prices to entice people away from file - sharing networks .
Also , stop treating your customers like criminals , recognize that music is viral and that any money you lose from people downloading tunes can be made up in other ways , like through merch sales live shows ( when online ticket sites are n't messing things up with $ 6 " service fees " to toss your tickets in an envelope and mail them 10 miles ) .
Also , recognize that the more people you have listening to music , regardless of how they got that music , is a good thing all around .
In other words , pull your head out your own ass and see daylight .
2- Stamps
It 's really mind - boggling to see the constant rise of stamp prices , which will hit 42 cents in May .
Sure , there 's gas prices , and a recession and important wars to fund , but the postal service should , if anything , be lowering postage prices .
First of all , there 's a little thing called email that seems to work just fine for much less ( it 's free , last we checked ) .
Secondly , delivery services like Fedex are just as reliable and affordable when it comes to sending larger items .
And paying bills online is becoming more and more common .
The only reason why the Postal Service is even in business right now is because it's a government sanctioned monopoly ; that , and because my damn grandmother can't figure out how to send an email and direct - deposit the five - bucks she sends me on my birthday into my checking account .
When you 're stuck in line at the post office in two months waiting 20 minutes to buy a dozen 3 - cent stamps , just remember , you do have other options .
1- Sex
There are really two ways to have sex with another person .
You can pay for the services of a professional , which is never cheap .
If the sex is cheap , then the STD treatment wo n't be .
And if you 're among the few people in the world who can actually attract the opposite sex , then getting your partner to a point where he or she will sleep with you means a long series of dates .
Flowers , dinner , movie and concert tickets , it all adds up to an amount that seriously makes you consider sticking to masturbation .
But man , have you seen the prices for porn ?
You can either spend $ 20 a month on a website featuring tons of content you 'll never use , or hit the shops , where a 60 - minute long DVD costs more than The Limited Edition Lord of the Rings set you pricematched across half a dozen websites .
I wonder how much castration costs ...
The process of natural selection can act on human culture as well as on genes , a new study finds .
Scientists at Stanford University have shown for the first time that cultural traits affecting survival and reproduction evolve at a different rate than other cultural attributes .
Speeded or slowed rates of evolution typically indicate the action of natural selection in analyses of the human genome .
This study of cultural evolution compares the rates of change for structural and decorative Polynesian canoe - design traits .
" Biological evolution of inherited traits is the essential organizing principle of biology , but does evolution play a corresponding role in human culture ? " said Jared Diamond , a professor of geography at the University of California - Los Angeles and author of Guns , Germs and Steel .
" This paper makes a decisive advance in this controversial field . "
The Stanford team studied reports of canoe designs from 11 Oceanic island cultures .
They evaluated 96 functional features ( such as how the hull was constructed or the way outriggers were attached ) that could contribute to the seaworthiness of the canoes and thus have a bearing on fishing success or survival during migration or warfare .
They also evaluated 38 decorative or symbolic features ( such as the types of carved or painted designs ) .
They analyzed mathematically the rates of change for the two groups of canoe design traits from island group to island group .
Statistical test results showed clearly that the functional canoe design elements changed more slowly over time , indicating that natural selection could be weeding out inferior new designs .
This cultural analysis is similar to analyses of the human genome that have been successful in finding which genes are under selection .
The field of cultural evolution is controversial because not all historians , social scientists or even biologists agree that cultural change can be understood in an evolutionary context .
Some say that human beliefs and behaviors are too unpredictable .

But Nina Jablonski , chair of the Anthropology Department at Pennsylvania State University , said she is sold on the research .
" This paper is revolutionary in its approach … one of the most significant papers to be written in anthropology in the last 20 years , " she said .
Authors of the study said their results speak directly to urgent social and environmental problems .
" People studying climate change , population growth , poverty , racism and the threat of plagues all know what the problems are and what we should be doing to solve them , " said Paul Ehrlich , the Bing Professor of Population Studies at Stanford .
Ehrlich , author of The Population Bomb and other books on dilemmas facing contemporary human society , said he does not understand why more effort is not going into urgently needed solutions .
" What we do n't know , and need to learn , is how cultures change and how we can ethically influence that process , " he said .
Deborah S. Rogers , a research fellow at Stanford , said their findings demonstrate that " some cultural choices work while others clearly do not . "
" Unfortunately , people have learned how to avoid natural selection in the short term through unsustainable approaches such as inequity and excess consumption .
But this is not going to work in the long term , " she said .
" We need to begin aligning our culture with the powerful forces of nature and natural selection instead of against them . "
Examples of cultural approaches that are putting humans at risk include " everything from the economic incentives , industrial technologies and growth mentality that cause climate change , pollution and loss of biodiversity , to the religious polarization and political ideologies that generate devastating conflict around the globe , " Rogers said .
" If the leadership necessary to undertake critically needed cultural evolution in these areas can't be found , our civilization may find itself weeded out by natural selection , just like a bad canoe design . "
This research is scheduled to appear Feb. 19 , in the online Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

Apes might eat soil to activate anti-malarial plants .
Dirty - mouthed chimps might munch soil for their health .
Jean - Michel Krief
Chimpanzees in Uganda have been spotted eating dirt along with fistfuls of leaves .
This might help to increase the plants ' anti-malarial properties , say researchers .
Many animals , including humans , are known to deliberately eat soil , a practice called geophagy .
Though the animals and people might not be aware of it , the main reason for this is that munching on dirt can have health benefits .
Soil contains scarce minerals , such as iron , and can counter diarrhea , absorb toxins , and facilitate digestion .
Eating earth can also reduce hunger pangs during famine .
Now , it seems that soil might also boost the pharmaceutical properties of foods .
Strange recipe
Sabrina Krief , a veterinarian at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris , noticed that chimpanzees in Kibale National Park often ate soil shortly before or after eating the leaves of Trichilia rubescens .
After finding that the leaves contained novel anti-malarial compounds , the researchers suggested that the apes were self - medicating1 .
The team collected 14 soil samples similar to those eaten by chimpanzees , along with T. rubescens leaves from the same area .
They then replicated chewing and digestion using a pestle and mortar along with acid and heat treatments .
They tested the soil , leaves , and soil - leaf combination against drug - resistant strains of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum .
Only the soil - leaf mix had significant anti-malarial activity , they report in Naturwissenschaften2 .
Active ingredient
The team also looked at the samples using high - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) .
This showed that mixing the leaves with clay reduced the amount of biologically available leaf compounds , presumably because they were bonded to soil particles .
ADVERTISEMENT
Krief thinks that the anti-malarial compounds stick to the clay less than other chemicals in the leaf , and so become concentrated in the soil - leaf mixture .
But her team did n’t isolate the anti-malarial compounds in their test , so they cannot confirm this .
Pharmacist Michael Wink of the University of Heidelberg in Germany suggests another mechanism .
It could be that reacting with the soil activates the anti-malarial compounds , he says : “ For me , that could be more plausible . ”
Further work is needed , he says , to identify and quantify the compounds at work , to determine what ’s going on .
ORURO , Bolivia ( AP ) 
A national assembly approved a new constitution Sunday that would empower Bolivia 's indigenous majority and let President Evo Morales run for re-election indefinitely .
The country 's main opposition party boycotted Sunday 's assembly vote on the new charter , which must now be approved by voters in a national referendum .
No date has been set for the referendum , although it is not expected to be held until September 2008 .
The document would give Bolivia 's indigenous peoples — some 62 % of the population — greater autonomy and control over their traditional lands , redressing what Morales calls centuries of discrimination by a corrupt political class dominated by a European - descended elite .
The constitution 's approval , 16 months after the popularly elected assembly first convened , was celebrated with fireworks and music by supporters in this pro-Morales stronghold high in the Andes .
But opposition is stiff in the country 's low - lying and richer eastern states .
Bolivia has been wracked by violent protests against the new constitution in recent weeks , with three people killed in rioting and various hunger strikes launched .
And a number of articles in the new charter that did not obtain a two - thirds majority even in the rump assembly will have to be approved directly by Bolivian voters .
Among them is an article that would limit the size of individual land holdings , a measure bitterly opposed by the country 's agribusinesses .
Moments after the document 's approval Sunday , Morales called it a source of " great happiness for the indigenous and popular movement " that " consecrates a peaceful transition . "
The new constitution would permit the indefinite re-election of Bolivia 's president — something Venezuelan voters denied their socialist president , Hugo Chavez , in a referendum last week .
But Morales on Sunday reminded his countryman of his plan , proposed on Wednesday , to place himself at voters ' mercy in a recall election in which he could be unseated if " no " votes were to exceed the number by which he won office in December 2005 , when he garnered 54 % of the ballots .
Under the proposal , voters would also decide whether to recall Bolivia 's nine state governors , six of whom are bitter opponents of Morales .

The long journey to Saratov has its wintry charms
Today was wintertime Russia at its very best .
I woke to crystal - clear skies and dazzling sunshine .
On days like this Russia can look spectacularly beautiful .
With the mercury down around minus 12C the countryside is transformed into a fairyland of ice and snow .
The freeze - dried birch trees stand out against the flawless sky like giant candyfloss .
The green pine trees look for all the world like they 've been covered with large dollops of icing sugar .
The snow under foot is deliciously hard and crunchy .
The city of Saratov is another unexpected surprise .
Russian cities are , as a rule , unrelentingly horrible .
The few historic neighbourhoods that were n't erased by Stalin , Khrushchev and Brezhnev are now being bulldozed by property developers .
Down on the waterfront I found an excellent German restaurant with real German beer and sausage !
The Volga here is almost five kilometres ( three miles ) wide , and at this time of year covered in a metre of ice .
The locals even take their cars out for a spin on it !
Silver Bears
But my real object in coming to Saratov is not to enjoy the winter weather , it is to track down a group of Russian Bears .
Not the four - legged , furry type .
The big silver type , with propellers and wings .
Just across the Volga from Saratov is Engels , home to Russia 's strategic nuclear bomber force .
For more than 15 years , since the end of the Cold War , Russia 's fleet of strategic bombers ( known in the West by their Nato codename " Bear " ) have been in hibernation .
But in the last six months the Tupolev Tu-95 Bears have been back on the prowl .
The huge silver bombers have been repeatedly intercepted approaching the coasts of Scotland , Norway and Alaska .
It 's led some to talk of a new Cold War .
My first problem was locating the base .
The old Cold War may be long over , but Engels airbase still does n't appear on my Russian road map , or my satnav .
When I finally did , the experience was distinctly unscary .
I 've been on a couple of American airbases , and the overwhelming impression there is of money and muscle .
They have the best of everything , and loads of it .
Engels looks like it has n't had a penny spent on it in 20 years .
The big silver Bears sit out on the edge of the runway exposed to the biting wind .
Amid the decaying base they , at least , look in excellent condition .
But there 's no getting away from the fact that the Bears are now fairly vintage aircraft .
They first started flying in the 1950s !
Sadly I was n't allowed to fly in one of the silver beasts .
" Foreigners are not allowed " , I was told by my delightful defence ministry minder .
" You might find out some Russian military secrets ! " she told me with a wry smile .
Instead I was invited to dinner at the home of a squadron leader .
Over vodka and caviar he described to me what the coast of Britain looks like from 10,500 metres ( 35,000 ft ) , at two o'clock in the morning .
" The whole place is lit up like a Christmas tree , " he said .
" You people must have far too much money if you can afford to waste it like that " .
We toasted the eternal friendship of the British and Russian peoples .
I was awarded an honorary flying pin , and I stumbled back to my hotel feeling warm and fuzzy .
It certainly did n't feel like a new Cold War .

The presidential campaign of Barack Obama released a memo today that they sent to superdelegates laying out their case that Obama is the best candidate to take on John McCain this fall .
The memo said , “ After 45 contests , Senator Obama has won more delegates , twice as many states and territories , and more of the popular vote .
He ’s won in every part of the country , and has scored victories among every segment of electorate .
He ’s inspired Democrats , Independents , and Republicans , building an unprecedented coalition of more than 1.4 million contributors .
And when it comes to head - to - head match - ups versus John McCain , Obama performs better than Clinton in key states and shows the potential to put new states in play for Democrats up and down the ballot . ”
They made the case that polling data shows that Obama would be stronger than Clinton against McCain this fall , “ Polling data from across the country , from large states and small , reflects the advantage Senator Obama would bring in a race this fall .
His ability to expand the Democratic base , and his ability to capture the crucial Independent vote , make him a stronger candidate than Senator Clinton , who would enter the fall campaign with the highest unfavorable ratings of any nominee in half a century . ”
Advertisements
The most interesting part of the poll numbers they cited was that Obama puts more battleground states in play than Clinton .
In Colorado , Obama is up 3 , Clinton down 14 . ( Rasmussen , 4/19 ) .
In Virginia , Obama is down 8 to McCain and Clinton is down 16 . ( SurveyUSA , 4/17 ) .
In Montana , Obama trails McCain by 5 , while Clinton is down 18 ( Rasmussen , 4/6 ) .
In Texas , Obama is behind McCain by 1 , but Clinton is down 7 ( SurveyUSA , 2/28 ) .
Obama does have some problems with certain groups of Democratic voters , but I do n’t think it is anything that ca n’t be overcome with a little extra work in the fall .
It is funny that Clinton would make the electability argument when she suffers from incredibly high negatives for a presidential candidate .
Hillary may be loved by a segment of the Democratic Party , but across the nation at large she is extremely polarizing .
I have consistently said that the best way for the Republicans to win in November is for the Democrats to nominate Hillary Clinton .
She is John Kerry in a pantsuit .

There was a time  many years ago  when Time magazine was considered to be an American and international " institution . "
That explained why the world ’s movers and shakers paid a lot of attention to the individual that the founder Henry Luce and his successors picked as the magazine ’s Man of the Year .
That choice  basically announcing who was the persona that had the power to change the world  reflected the wisdom prevailing then among the political and corporate elites , located mostly in New York and Washington .
But gradually , Time magazine was transformed from that institution into the older and serious brother of People magazine , and now it has become , for all practical purposes , the Lenin Mausoleum of American journalism , an institutional corpse that is being preserved for some reason ( prestige ? ) while People magazine , HBO and other media outlets keep the parent company in business .
Which leads one to ask : who really cares who or what Time selects as their person or " thing " of the year ?
I certainly do n’t .
But I ’m nevertheless curious .
Last year , the magazine opted for " You " as the Person of the Year , rejecting the " Great Man " theory of history according to which the powerful and the famous are the ones who shape our collective destiny as a species , and suggesting that instead in this age of globalization it ’s " You "  the individual consumer of information  that was taking control of political and economic events .
This year , Time , perhaps disappointed by the impact that " You " seemed to have on our lives , decided to adopt a the traditional approach , and has selected a real person as its annual shaper of destiny  Russian President Vladimir Putin .
So we seem to be regressing to the reactionary " Great Man " theory of history .
Mr. Putin is expected to evoke the memories of such Russian historical giants as Peter the Great and Comrade Joseph Stalin .
Personally , I ’m not as impressed with the new tough - talking man in the Kremlin .
Yes , Russia with its huge energy resources and large territory and population is reasserting its influence as one of the world ’s great powers .
But it is not emerging as a major economic and military " threat " to the US and it is certainly not posing an ideological challenge to the West as the Soviet Union did .
No , we are not about to enter a new Cold War , as Time seems to imply .
The new assertiveness of Russia is just another sign that we are gradually moving towards a multi-polar international system  although we are not there yet .
In fact , if I had to choose the " Thing " of the Year , I would have selected the move by the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation and the " unidentified Middle East investor " to inject a few billion dollars into the financially troubled Switzerland - based UBS , the fourth - largest European bank , as a clear sign that the balance of global economic power is changing in a very dramatic way .
The vast pool of financial wealth in East Asia and the Middle East  represented among other things by the Sovereign Wealth Funds ( SWFs ) is being poured into the world ’s largest financial institutions .
It all reads like a chapter from a volume of Alternate History : China Investment Corporation acquiring a 10 per cent stake in Morgan Stanley .
The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority bailing out Citicorp .
A Chinese government - controlled bank making a huge cross-investment in Bear Stearns and investing US$ 3 billion in the Blackstone Group , a private equity fund .
At the same time , Middle Eastern companies have been establishing a financial foothold in global financial centers like the NASDAQ and the London Stock Exchange as well in non-financial empires like Sony .
It ’s very difficult to make sense of these and other developments taking place in the global economic arena and to try to figure out if and how China and other emerging economies are going to translate their growing financial power into global political influence .
That the domestic political - social balance of power in these nation - states remain fragile and that their long - term economic development is uncertain , explain why one cannot promote with much confidence Welcome - into - the - China - Century grand forecasts .
While China , the Middle Eastern oil - producing countries and other emerging economies in East Asia and the Middle East , as well as in Latin America ( Venezuela ) may be challenging American global supremacy , the United States remains central to the global economic and military infrastructure , and there are no signs that any of the rising powers , including the European Union ( EU ) is ready to replace Washington in the driver ’s seat .
That is not to deny that America continued to experience serious economic and military setbacks in 2007 .
In addition to pushing the US economy towards a recession , the housing market crisis and the credit crunch  by exposing the dark side of the interaction between policymaking and business in the US  have raised serious questions about the notion promoted by Washington that the American liberal economic system should serve as a model for the economies of Latin America and the Pacific rim .
Moreover , economists are debating now whether the problems facing the US economy are cyclical or structural , whether the eroding power of the US dollar is just a part of the process of rebalancing the global financial system , which will make it possible to cut America ’s trade and current - account deficit , or whether the weakening US currency is a reflection of a long - term deterioration of its economic fundamentals .
It ’s doubtful that we will find out an answer to these question in 2008 .
More likely , as the US continues to print more dollars , the American economy will continue to muddle through .
Similarly , the US military " surge " in Iraq , coupled with the growing expectations that America is not going to attack Iran in 2008 and that the Israeli - Palestinian peace will continue to " process , " will allow the Bush Administration will sit out most of next year without igniting a major explosion in the region that could put even more downward pressure on the US geo-strategic position and bring about a massive increase in energy prices , unless that is , Israel decides to attack Iran .
But if the financial crisis at home has accentuated US geo-economic weakness in the form of massive deficits , a weak dollar and rising oil prices , the mess in Iraq and the continuing tension with Iran and other global military diplomatic problems like North Korea expose the erosion in US geo-strategic power .
It is less likely that the Americans will be able to fight two major wars around the world at the same time .
To put it differently , the US has less of the kind of economic and military leverage it used to employ in the past in order to affect the global balance of power .
That not only means that Washington will have to place on the backburner its global democratic crusade .
It will be more difficult for the Americans to energetically promote the liberalization of the global trade agenda .
It also points to the need for America ’s military and trade partners , as well as the rising powers of China , India and Russia to try to fill the vacuum created by the overstretching of US economic and military power .
The hope is that the next person in the White House after 2008 will be more inclined to work together with the rest of the world in trying to defuse global military tensions , especially in the Middle East and continue the process of economic globalization .
But the growing anti-globalization sentiment and anti-immigration mood in the United States in the form of political pressure in support of protectionism and isolationism suggest that the adjusting of US interests and policies to the changing realities of weakening American economic and military power will not be easy .

Democratic National Chairman Howard Dean has a plan that will produce a nominee before his party ’s convention in August , avoiding what he fears could be a “ really ugly and nasty ” fiasco .
Democratic leaders have begun complaining he has bungled the party ’s nominating process and alienated voters because of his failure to engineer a political compromise in the DNC ’s ill - advised decision to strip Florida and Michigan of all its delegates .
But Mr. Dean , whose polls show the party ’s internecine warfare is hurting its chances in November , has been talking to party bigwigs about a deal and now says the delegations will be seated before the nominating roll of the states is called .
The conventional wisdom says the battle between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton will go all the way to the convention .
But Mr. Dean wants it over well before that , and possibly before the last of the 10 remaining primaries are completed in June .
And it is likely that will happen .
The scenario Mr. Dean and party leaders fear most is a bitter political floor fight in Denver that will deeply divide the party and send a message to the country that if the Democrats can’t govern themselves , how can they govern the country ?
“ There ’ll be some nasty fights if it goes to convention , and people will walk out , ” Mr. Dean told the Associated Press last week in an unusually blunt interview in which he said the candidates ’ bitter infighting threatened to demoralize the party ’s base and weaken its chances in November .
Mr. Dean ’s stern admonition to both candidates to stop the attacks on one another , telling their supporters to “ keep their mouths shut , ” got lots of media attention .
His plan to bring the nominating fight to an end , possibly before June , got little notice .
That plan calls on the remaining 350 or so undeclared superdelegates to break their neutrality sooner rather than later , providing enough votes to produce the 2,024 - delegate majority needed to clinch the nomination .
“ There is no point in waiting , ” Mr. Dean said , adding that he has been “ talking to a fairly significant number of — by and large — nonaligned people about how we might resolve this . ”
Indeed , neutral superdelegates ( governors , members of Congress , Democratic National Committee members and other VIPs ) have begun to break their silence in the last two weeks , all breaking for Mr. Obama : New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and this week , Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar .
So far , the delegate math favors Mr. Obama .
Turning the corner into this week , he had 1,631 pledged delegates to Mrs. Clinton ’s 1,501 .
Even if Mrs. Clinton were to win a majority of popular votes in most the remaining primaries , she still would not be able to pass him , because the party ’s proportional delegate award system effectively preserves Mr. Obama ’s lead .
The deceptive nature of the system at its very worst was seen in Texas where Hillary won , yet Mr. Obama edged ahead of her in the state delegate count because of its Byzantine system of separate caucuses that gave him four more delegates than she received .
She will likely win in Pennsylvania , but Mr. Obama will take Indiana and North Carolina and probably most of the smaller Western states to come .
Meanwhile , Mr. Dean hopes the rest of the superdelegates will follow his advice and declare their vote during the coming weeks and effectively end the race .
If Mr. Obama ’s lead holds , as is likely , he will be close to 2,000 delegates , allowing the superdelegates to put him over the top .
As for Florida and Michigan , Mr. Dean is making it clear to party leaders that once the nomination race is all but over , there will be an agreement to seat both delegations under a proportional formula still to be worked out .
But neither campaign is ready to compromise at present .
“ Let me just say that the campaigns believe that kind of deal is premature right now , ” he said .
Meantime , John McCain has been effectively reaching out to the GOP ’s base to unite his party and assemble an organization for the general election .
He has put Lew Eisenberg , former partner at the big Wall Street investment bank , Goldman Sachs , in charge of fund - raising .
Insiders tell me contributions have risen significantly .
Mr. McCain picked conservative strategist Frank Donatelli , White House political director under President Reagan , to be the Republican National Committee ’s deputy chairman and the campaign ’s liaison to the RNC .
He has also hired former RNC political director Mike DuHaime , who ran Rudy Giuliani ’s presidential bid .
A veteran strategist who oversaw the voter turnout apparatus that re-elected President Bush , he will help build the RNC ’s campaign operation .
It may take months before the Democrats entirely get their act together , and how unified it will be remains a huge question .
Meanwhile , Mr. McCain is already running his campaign , airing TV ads , staffing state and regional operations and sharpening issues the GOP believes will defeat a divided and dispirited opposition .

The iPhone SDK announcement has come and gone and reality is beginning to set in .
The SDK provides opportunity for lots of great new applications on the iPhone .
However , there are also a great many restrictions .
As Quentin noted , we worry about the potential for innovation to be stifled , due to these restrictions .
In an effort to remedy this and remove some of the limitations , we ’ve submitted a number of bug reports to Apple .
Some of these are useful specifically for us , while others are beneficial to anyone , but our goal here is the same with all of them – we want to make the iPhone platform as robust and powerful as possible .
A list of our requests for enhancement is below – developers are invited to submit duplicates and Apple engineers can view the full submissions with the links provided .
Allow applications to be installed at the user ’s discretion , not Apple’s
This request basically asks for Apple to not be the exclusive provider of applications for the iPhone .
Having an App Store is certainly a great new venue for sales , but it should not be the only way to get software on the iPhone .
Just as Apple sells music , but also lets you load MP3s ripped from CDs onto your iPod , you should be able to install software from other sources .
This is perhaps the most important issue – if this restriction is lifted , many others become far less important .
Bug ID # 5788773
Allow applications to run in background on iPhone
The hardware is certainly quite capable of handling this .
Indeed , many of Apple ’s own applications run in the background , from Mail to SMS to iPod .
Not all applications need to do this , but an AIM or IRC client should , as well as anything involving file transfers .
Bug ID # 5788784
Allow access to root user on iPhone
Perhaps this one sounds outlandish , but the fact of the matter is , you own this device just as you own your Mac .
This access should be controlled , just like it is on desktop Macs , by some sort of password or setting .
Apps should not be able to get root without permission , but we believe an open platform is best .
Bug ID # 5788795
A MediaPicker API for accessing the iPod music files is needed
Just as applications can access photos and contacts , we want to access music .
This one has a very specific use in mind for us , Airfoil for the iPhone needs to be able to access music on the device .
However , many other applications could make use of this as well .
Bug ID # 5788792
Add option to allow iPhone applications to access entire filesystem
To do interesting things , some applications need access to data beyond what they create .
Image and Contact Picker are a start , but what happens when a suite of applications is made by one company ?
How will one app edit another app ’s data ?
This is an extension of needing a MediaPicker , but it would be much broader and more powerful .
Bug ID # 5788801
Allow iPhone applications to access the host computer when docking
There ’s a lot of valuable functionality to be had in an application which acts as an extension of a Mac or PC program .
Imagine automatically synchronized to - do lists , blogging / photo apps , instant messaging logs , and much more .
Without being able to access the host computer , these are forced to either go through local wifi or through some sort of centralized server , both of which offer a poorer experience .
Currently , only Apple can do this – with iCal , Contacts , and Safari bookmarks .
Other apps can certainly benefit from this as well .
Bug ID # 5788803
Permit Voice over IP on the cellular network
This limitation is arbitrary and is obviously motivated to placate AT&T .
VoIP has no more impact , and arguably less impact , on the cell network than a regular voice call .
Data should not be segregated .
It ’s all bits , and if my bits are coming out of a handset speaker in Beijing , Apple should n’t know or care .
We do n’t expect anything will change here , but it certainly should .
The principle here is the same as network neutrality for the Internet .
Bug ID # 5788806
Allow iPhone applications to access the docking port
The ability to communicate with peripherals would enormously expand the potential for third - party applications .
For example , an iPhone could be plugged directly into a camera to tag and upload photos to a web site from the field .
A plug -in GPS unit could be used for car navigation or trip logging .
A microphone could transform the iPod Touch into a mobile podcasting device .
And there are many more opportunities for innovation which would be created by allowing iPhone software to talk to such external devices .
Bug ID # 5788798
If you have an ADC account , you can submit your own bugs at http://bugreport.apple.com.
Plenty of things are still in flux , and with input from users and developers , Apple may just see what a powerful platform the iPhone can be .
Update ( 3/11/08 10:30 PM ) :
There seems to be a bit of confusion regarding bug filing and the use of bugreport .
apple.com to provide feedback .
Three things to know :
1 ) This is the method for providing feedback to Apple .
Do n’t let the name fool you – there ’s an “ Enhancement ” option which is what we ’ve chosen for these .
2 ) It was expressly suggested that we provide feedback in this manner by multiple Apple engineers , including those who ’ve worked on the iPhone team .
3 ) It was expressly requested by Steve Jobs himself that we provide feedback on the SDK .
We ’re not spamming Apple with this , we ’re providing Requests for Enhancement , in the exact manner their system is designed to be used .

I just bought a new Fujitsu Lifebook P8010 ( which I love ) .
It came installed with a 90 - day trial for Norton security suite .
Here is my observation on Norton :
It is hard for me to imagine a piece of spyware or malware that puts as many spam messages on the screen , exhibits so many bad behaviors , or is so hard to remove as Norton itself .
In the middle of a 30 - minute task that was within 30 seconds of completion , Norton just rebooted my computer for some reason .
It spams me with messages every startup , keeps adding its own toolbar to my browser , and I am having a terrible time getting it off my computer .
Norton is perhaps the worst spyware I have ever had on a computer .
Except maybe for the McAfee trial version on my last laptop .
NYT : Dem officials hope Gore can help avert ' convention rift '

The man that won the Nobel Peace Prize may not be visible this presidential campaign season , but according to a story in Saturday 's New York Times , some senior party officials are banking on him to play " mediator , " if needed .
" Former Vice President Al Gore and a number of other senior Democrats plan to remain neutral for now in the presidential race in part to keep open the option to broker a peaceful resolution to what they fear could be a bitterly divided convention , party officials and aides said Friday , " Don Van Natta Jr. and Jo Becker report in Saturday 's edition of The New York Times .
" Democratic Party officials said that in the past week Mr. Gore and other leading Democrats had held private talks as worry mounted that the close race between Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton could be decided by a group of 795 party insiders known as superdelegates . "
The article continues , " The signs that party elders are weighing whether and how to intervene reflects the extraordinary nature of the contest now and the concern among some Democrats that they not risk an internal battle that could harm the party in the general election . "
Excerpts from article : # A number of senior Democrats , including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and three candidates who have dropped out of the 2008 race , former Senator John Edwards and Senators Christopher J. Dodd and Joseph R. Biden Jr. , have spoken with Mr. Gore in recent days .
None have endorsed a candidate , although Ms. Pelosi made comments on Friday that were widely seen as supportive of Mr. Obama when it came to the process the party should use to make its choice of candidate .
....
But four close associates of Mr. Gores said senior party officials had actively consulted him for his advice about what the superdelegates should do if neither Mr. Obama nor Mrs. Clinton amassed the 2,025 delegates necessary to win the nomination after the final Democratic caucus in Puerto Rico on June 7 .
Party leaders described Mr. Gore as a potentially crucial mediator because the putative head of the party  and the man who chose him as his vice president 
Bill Clinton , is hardly a neutral observer when it comes to his wifes candidacy .
....
Several allies said that because of Mr. Gores bruising defeat in 2000 presidential voting in Florida , he would have the credibility with Democrats to carry the message that the will of the people should be respected .

If the USA seems too crowded and its roads too congested now , imagine future generations :
The nation 's population could more than triple to 1 billion as early as 2100 .
That 's the eye - popping projection that urban and rural planners , gathered today for their annual meeting in Las Vegas , are hearing from a land - use expert .
" What do we do now to start preparing for that ? " asks Arthur Nelson , co-director of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech , whose analysis projects that the USA will hit the 1 billion mark sometime between 2100 and 2120 .
" It 's a realistic long - term challenge . "
The nation currently has almost 304 million people and is the world 's third most populous , behind China ( 1.3 billion ) and India ( 1.1 billion ) .
China passed the 1 billion mark in the early 1980s .
Nelson 's projection assumes that current fertility rates remain constant but that longevity and immigration will continue to rise .
Jeff Soule , director of outreach for the American Planning Association , hopes it will be provocative enough to inspire planners who anticipate development patterns and infrastructure needs to look beyond their lifetimes and localities .
" We have to be more aggressive about looking out at the long term , " Soule says .
" It may get people thinking beyond their jurisdictions . …
It 's clear we have to think about such issues as food , water and basic transportation infrastructure . "
Nelson says China and India are accommodating billion - plus populations on less land area than the USA occupies .
" We have a surprising amount of space in existing urban areas , " he says .
" We can easily triple the population in our urbanized areas with much of that growth occurring on , of all things , parking lots . "
Nelson advocates converting parking lots into commercial and residential buildings and extending light - rail lines and rapid transit to reduce dependence on cars .
" We could accommodate half or more of the new population ( on parking lots ) , " he says .
" For the other half , we need to figure out which parts of urban areas need to be redeveloped .
We should start asking these larger questions now . "
The population projection is provoking some skepticism .
Robert Lang , Nelson 's co-director at the Virginia Tech institute , says he expects immigration to decline , largely because birth rates in other countries are declining .
" People are not going to have as many children , and their children wo n't have as many children , and there 'll be ( fewer ) people to immigrate to the U.S. , " Lang says .
" I would rather focus on the near certainty that we will gain 100 million people by 2043 . …
No one plans for 100 years from now except to preserve a national park . "
Population projections for most countries do not extend much beyond 2050 .
Carl Haub , senior demographer at the non-profit Population Reference Bureau , has estimated that India 's population could reach 2 billion around 2075 .
That wo n't happen , however , if India 's fertility rates decline at a faster rate than they have been , he says .
Nelson , who will become the founding director of the Center for the New Metropolis at the University of Utah this fall , says many events from disease to famine could throw his projections off course .
" We could certainly have a comet hit the planet and pulverize the atmosphere , " he says .
" But what if none of these things happen ? …
Do we plan on a calamity , do we assume that half the population 's planet might be wiped out ?
I do n't think that 's very responsible . "
What would a USA of 1 billion people be like ?
Would it be better or worse than the one we live in today ?
Enlarge AP file photo New York , seen here , has the second - highest population density of U.S. cities with at least 50,000 people , according to the 2000 Census .
Only Union City , N.J. has more people per square mile , the Census found .

Policeware is the new term to describe spyware that is used by law enforcement to gather evidence in law enforcement investigations .
It is highly likely that anti-virus and anti-spyware software will look the other way if they detect policeware .
Or , more likely , they wo n’t carry signatures for policeware at all .
So will it be possible to detect policeware ?
Possibly .
I think that policeware will be the backdrop for the next cat - and - mouse game between law enforcement and the underworld .
Hackers are anxious to get a copy of CIPAV , the investigative tool ( that gets installed on a suspect ’s PC ) used by the FBI to log outbound TCP / IP connections .
Certainly they will device tools to detect and block CIPAV and other such tools .
In fact , this may be history as I write this – the capability to detect and remove CIPAV may already exist .
And given that Magic Lantern and Carnivore have been around for several years , I ca n’t help but wonder if tools exist to detect its activities .

As the developer community eagerly awaits the release of the iPhone software development kit in late February , the question on everyone 's mind is what new applications it will enable .
Although Apple has not yet released any details on the SDK , speculation is rampant about what it will let programmers do – and how liberal Apple will be in allowing development for the iPhone .
" Initially , I think [ Apple 's ] going to let a thousand flowers bloom , " Yankee Group analyst Carl Howe says of Apple 's SDK strategy , " just like it does on the desktop side . "
Since the iPhone 's release in June 2007 , Apple has permitted developers to create iPhone applications through one conduit only : the phone 's browser .
That approach simplifies development , in that it enables anyone with HTML and JavaScript skills to create iPhone applications .
But it does n't give developers access to the iPhone 's full range of features , such as its accelerometer , voice capabilities and touchscreen .
After months of trying to get developers to " rethink " the way they approached iPhone programming , Apple caved last October and said it would release a full - blown SDK .
Developers and users alike praised the announcement , hailing it as a key move to transform the iPhone into a full - fledged platform that will support far - more - sophisticated programs that use a wider range of the platform 's capabilities .
As such , the first native applications iPhone users are likely to see will be those that " fill in the perceived holes in the platform , " Howe says .
Instant messaging , games , photo apps and video apps will all likely abound as developers scramble to provide solutions to the iPhone 's more notable missing features .
Apple is also positioning the SDK as a development tool for the iPod Touch and possibly for future Apple devices .
Daniel Jalkut , a Mac software developer and the founder of Red Sweater Software , says that while it's hard to predict precisely which applications will emerge first , we can bank on developers taking advantage of all the snazzy graphics capabilities of the devices .
That means , for example , photo apps that allow you to put frames and borders on your pictures , crop them and automatically upload them to Flickr .
According to Chris Messina , an open source advocate and co-organizer of the iPhoneDevCamp , iPhone users can also expect the SDK to deliver better documentation of the methods that people have already exploited .
In other words : official versions of the apps already available on those iPhones that have been modified with the " jailbreak " hack .
Those could include native versions of apps like Telekinesis , which lets iPhone users access their Macs remotely and stream music and video to their iPhones , or various movie apps and game applications like the popular Frenzic .
Yet while Steve Jobs confirmed Apple 's interest in creating a " vibrant third - party developer community , " the company will undoubtedly impose limits on this group .
In October , Jobs said one of the main reasons for the SDK 's delay was an ongoing effort to secure and protect the platform .
In all likelihood , that means the developer community wo n't have access to every feature on the phone .
Howe believes that Apple will give developers access to the prized pieces of hardware like the accelerometer and touchscreen UI , but not the phone - and voice - related aspects of the device .
That means there will likely be no voiceover - IP apps ( like Skype ) .
There will also be heavy restrictions on accessing anything having to do with the phone part of the platform – what Howe calls " the revenue - generating side of the phone . "
Finally , while Apple 's approach to cultivating a developer community is still unknown , the company will likely be following Nokia 's lead with its Symbian Signed program .
Developers of the iPhone will undoubtedly need to register and get Apple certification before they can begin to develop on the platform .
" The idea is that if this thing completely screws up , Apple wants your name and address , " Howe says .
Still , Jalkut says that Apple tends to be open about letting anyone develop for the Mac , and he sees no reason for this to change on the iPhone and iPod Touch .
Through the company 's Apple Developer Connection program , for example , developers can download sample code and gain entry - level membership for free , he says .
This generosity is really for Apple 's own benefit , he says , as it ultimately encourages further development on the Mac .
" Basically anything that [ Apple ] wo n't be injured by , they 'll give it away , " Jalkut says .

You have prob­a­bly heard about CAT and MRI scans ( pro­duced thanks to machines like the one to the top right ) .
So you know that these are tech­niques that doc­tors and sci­en­tists use to look inside the brain .
You have prob­a­bly also heard about brain fit­ness and how impor­tant it is to keep a healthy brain to be pro­tect­ed against age - relat­ed and dis­ease - relat­ed brain dam­ages .
The ques­tion we ask here is the fol­low­ing : Can we use brain scans to eval­u­ate how fit the brain is ?
Before we try to answer this ques­tion let ’s start with the basics and try to under­stand how brain scans work .
Brain imag­ing , also called neu­roimag­ing , allows one to pro­duce images of the brain .
There are dif­fer­ent types of brain imag­ing : struc­tur­al and func­tion­al .
Struc­tur­al imag­ing pro­vides infor­ma­tion about the shape and vol­ume of the brain ( CAT and MRI scans ) .
Func­tion­al imag­ing shows the brain cells that are active when one per­forms a spe­cif­ic task ( fMRI and PET scans ) .
CT or CAT scans .
Com­put­ed tomog­ra­phy or com­put­ed axi­al tomog­ra­phy is a tech­nique that takes a large num­ber of two - dimen­sion­al X‑rays images .
These images are used to dig­i­tal­ly com­pute 3D images of the inside of the brain .
The most fre­quent rea­son for a head CT is to diag­nose cere­brovas­cu­lar acci­dents and intracra­nial hem­or­rhage .
It is also often use to eval­u­ate facial and skull frac­tures .
MRI scans .
MRI stands for Mag­net­ic Res­o­nance Imag­ing .
This tech­nique uses mag­net­ic fields and radio waves to gen­er­ate 2 - or 3 ‑D images of the brain .
MRI is used to detect tumors and oth­er patholo­gies that affect the tis­sues of the brain ( e.g. , mul­ti­ple scle­ro­sis ) .
Com­pared to CT , it is more pre­cise and harm­less to the patient ( no poten­tial­ly dan­ger­ous X‑rays ) .
How­ev­er , CT is much cheap­er and more wide­ly used .
PET scans .
PET stands for Positron Emis­sion Tomog­ra­phy .
It mea­sures the emis­sion gen­er­at­ed by a short - lived radioac­tive trac­er inject­ed to the patient ( using the blood­stream ) .
The 2 - or 3 ‑D images pro­duced show brain activ­i­ty .
PET is used to detect tumors and for the diag­no­sis of brain dis­eases .
Since the 1990s , fMRI has sup­plant­ed PET due to its low inva­sive­ness , lack of radi­a­tion expo­sure , and rel­a­tive­ly wide avail­abil­i­ty .
fMRI scans .
Func­tion­al Mag­net­ic Res­o­nance Imag­ing relies on the mag­net­ic prop­er­ties of oxy­genat­ed and deoxy­genat­ed hemo­glo­bin .
This tech­nique pro­duces images of chang­ing blood flow in the brain asso­ci­at­ed with neur­al activ­i­ty .
The images show the brain struc­tures acti­vat­ed dur­ing per­for­mance of dif­fer­ent tasks .
fMRI is used to detect ear­ly changes in the brain fol­low­ing strokes or oth­er brain dis­eases .
What is brain reserve ?
Now you know about imag­ing tech­niques .
Our goal was to see whether we could use these tech­niques to eval­u­ate whether a brain is fit or not .
Fit brains are brains that have what sci­en­tists call cog­ni­tive brain reserve .
It is more or less the capac­i­ty of the brain to resist the expres­sion of symp­toms in the face of exist­ing neu­ropathol­o­gy .
In oth­er words , peo­ple with more cog­ni­tive brain reserve can tol­er­ate more patho­log­ic changes before they show any symp­toms .
If you have healthy brain , that is if you have cog­ni­tive reserve , you will still get old­er and you may still get Alzheimer dis­ease .
But brain reserve will help delay­ing the effects of age and the onset of demen­tia .
You may be won­der­ing : “ What can I do to get some cog­ni­tive reserve ?
Here are 2 fac­tors that seem cru­cial :
- Edu­ca­tion ( see Snow­don et al. , 1989 or Katz­man , 1993 )
- Lev­el of intel­lec­tu­al stim­u­la­tion ( through your job or your leisure activ­i­ties ) ( see Scarmeas et al. , 2001 ; Vergh­ese et al. , 2003 )
It looks like edu­ca­tion or intel­lec­tu­al stim­u­la­tion may increase brain reserve by increas­ing the den­si­ty of the con­nec­tions between brain cells ( that is by increas­ing synaps­es between neu­rons ) .
For more info about cog­ni­tive reserve see Alvaro inter­view with researcher Dr. Yaakov Stern .
Can you image brain reserve in the brain ?
In a recent study , Perneczky and col­leagues ( 2006 ) used PET to explore the effect of cog­ni­tive reserve on Alzheimer ’s dis­ease .
They scanned the brain of 93 patients with mild Alzheimer ’s dis­ease and 16 healthy con­trols .
It was expect­ed that peo­ple with the more severe Alzheimer ’s dis­ease pathol­o­gy would show less cere­bral blood flow , that is less activ­i­ty , in the regions affect­ed by the dis­ease .
Remem­ber that blood flow in the brain is what PET mea­sures .
Perneczky hypoth­e­sized that patients with more years of school­ing would have more pro­nounced deficits in regions typ­i­cal­ly affect­ed by the pathol­o­gy of Alzheimer ’s dis­ease .
How could this be ?
Did­ n’t I tell you ear­li­er that edu­ca­tion con­tributes to brain reserve ?
Here is the rea­son­ing : say that Ms A. has a low lev­el of brain reserve .
She has devel­oped Alzheimer ’s 2 years ago .
She does­ n’t have much pathol­o­gy in her brain yet and her symp­toms ( mem­o­ry prob­lems , etc. ) cor­re­spond to a mild stage of Alzheimer ’s dis­ease .
Ms B. has a high lev­el of brain reserve .
She has devel­oped Alzheimer ’s 5 years ago .
She has a high lev­el of pathol­o­gy in her brain .
How­ev­er , thanks to her brain reserve , she only shows symp­toms cor­re­spond­ing to a mild stage of Alzheimer ’s dis­ease .
Results of this PET study show that indeed patients with more edu­ca­tion ( such as Ms B. ) con­sis­tent­ly had more pro­nounced deficits in regions typ­i­cal­ly affect­ed by the pathol­o­gy of Alzheimer ’s dis­ease com­pared to patients with less years of school­ing ( such as Ms A. )
These find­ings sug­gest that edu­ca­tion is asso­ci­at­ed with brain reserve and that peo­ple with high­er edu­ca­tion can cope with brain dam­age for a longer time .
What if one does­ n’t have high­er education …
Is it too late to build cog­ni­tive brain reserve ?
The good news is that it is NOT too late !
Edu­ca­tion is not the only fac­tor .
One can always find ways to get enough men­tal stim­u­la­tion by choos­ing our jobs and engag­ing in leisure activ­i­ties such as read­ing , learn­ing new things , going to muse­ums , etc .

Nearly one in five “ HillRaisers , ” the elite big - money fundraisers for Sen .
Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s presidential campaign , have ties to the 1990s fundraising scandal that tarnished her husband ’s presidency by offering Democratic donors sleepovers in the Lincoln Bedroom and other perks inside the White House .
Forty - nine of the Clintons ’ Lincoln Bedroom guests are among the 250 HillRaisers listed on Mrs. Clinton ’s campaign Web page , who have pledged to gather , or “ bundle , ” at least $ 100,000 in donations .
Some have promised to raise $ 1 million or more for the 2008 campaign , the most costly in U.S. history .
Some of the HillRaisers are longtime friends who have given millions to the Clintons over the years , including Washington socialite Beth Dozoretz , who played a key role in the controversial , last - minute 2000 pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich .
A Lincoln Bedroom visitor , Mrs. Dozoretz , raised $ 2 million for Mr. Clinton ’s 1996 re-election campaign , $ 1 million for the Clinton presidential library and hosted a “ rally - around - the - president party ” that raised $ 1 million for Mr. Clinton ’s legal defense in the Monica Lewinsky scandal .
Mrs. Dozoretz dismissed concerns about the overnight visits — raised by Mrs. Clinton ’s Democratic primary rivals , Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois , and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina — saying the Clintons had simply opened up the White House to friends .
“ It is an experience that can be extraordinary , and Bill and Hillary Clinton sought to share it with a great number of people , ” she told The Washington Times .
“ They believed the White House was the people ’s house , and they shared it with as many people and in as many ways as possible .
“ Having friends stay at the White House was in no way a quid pro quo for those who had contributed .
No way , ” she said .
So far in the 2008 campaign , Mrs. Dozoretz has given $ 20,000 to the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) , $ 2,300 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , $ 12,650 to other Democrats and $ 4,200 to Mrs. Clinton , according to Federal Election Commission records .
Clinton spokesman Phil Singer did not answer questions e-mailed to the campaign this week about the overnight visits and the HillRaisers .
Instead , he responded with an e-mail saying , “ The only commitment Hillary Clinton has made is to be the best president she can be for the American people . ”
Mrs. Clinton , who has raised more than $ 118 million so far for her 2008 race , has acknowledged that campaign donors were invited to spend the night in the second - floor Lincoln Bedroom but denied that the visits were in exchange for campaign donations .
“ There ’s certainly no basis for believing that they are anything other than what they are , which is friends and supporters , ” she told reporters in 1996 .
“ There just really is n’t any reason for anybody to raise any questions about it .
The Lincoln Bedroom was never sold . ”
Broken system
According to a study by the Committee for Responsive Politics ( CRP ) , a bipartisan watchdog group , 15 of the Lincoln Bedroom guests in 1996 who are now HillRaisers also contributed $ 130,000 to Mrs. Clinton ’s 2000 Senate race .
Those same high rollers forked over $ 1.4 million to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and to other Democratic candidates .
The donations flowed despite complaints that the Lincoln Bedroom mattress was lumpy .
Collectively , according to the records , the Lincoln Bedroom guests , which totaled 938 including spouses and children , contributed $ 10.2 million to Democrats , including Mr. Clinton , an average of $ 10,847 each .
Mary Boyle , spokeswoman at Common Cause , a Washington - based campaign - finance watchdog group , said the influence of wealthy special interests in the funding of campaigns has eroded public trust in the nation ’s political system and discouraged political participation .
“ Sure , we ’re always concerned about large donations in presidential races , whether for Hillary Clinton or anyone else , ” she said .
“ Bundlers are the power brokers of this presidential campaign .
“ The bottom line is our campaign - finance system is badly broken and must be fixed , ” she said .
“ We need to restore the presidential public - finance system so our presidential races are not so much about who can raise the most money but who has the best ideas , policies , most support among voters . ”
‘ Caricature of itself ’
According to White House records and documents collected during separate Senate and House inquiries , the big donors in the 1996 re-election campaign not only were given overnight accommodations , but they were also ushered into the Oval Office for coffees , lunches and other meetings with Mr. and Mrs. Clinton , took rides on Air Force One , received invitations for golf with the president , got Cabinet members for fundraisers , and were put in touch with top policy - makers throughout the Clinton high command .
Republicans first raised questions about the propriety of the coffees and sleepovers , but so did the Justice Department ’s campaign - finance task force .
Its hand - picked chief , federal prosecutor Charles G. LaBella , recommended in July 1998 after a two - year investigation that Attorney General Janet Reno , a Clinton appointee , seek an independent counsel to probe accusations of White House fundraising abuses .
In a 94 - page report , Mr. LaBella said the “ intentional conduct and the willful ignorance uncovered by our investigations … resulted in a situation where abuse was rampant , and indeed the norm . ”
He said White House officials , including the president and the first lady , had a “ desperate need to raise enormous sums of money ” to offset losses to Republicans in 1994 and relied on the “ calculated use of access ” to the Clintons “ as leverage to extract contributions . ”
“ At some point , the campaign was so corrupted by bloated fundraising and questionable contributions that the system became a caricature of itself , ” Mr. LaBella said .
A November 1997 memo by FBI Director Louis J. Freeh said a “ core group ” of White House and Democratic National Committee officials were involved in “ an all - out effort ” to raise campaign cash — which led , in part , to the White House coffees and the overnight stays .
In the 22 - page memo , he said it was “ difficult to imagine a more compelling situation for appointing an independent counsel . ”
Miss Reno rejected the recommendations .
Mr. LaBella , now in private practice in San Diego , said this week that he could not comment on the Clinton presidential campaign but added that “ the report speaks for itself . ”
Big bundles
Mrs. Clinton ’s HillRaisers are part of a political landscape used by many politicians to bypass federal laws that cap , or limit , contributions .
By bundling donations , a single fundraiser can gather contributions from employees , clients , acquaintances and special - interest groups to effectively circumvent federal limits and restrictions .
While the HillRaisers are committed to raising $ 100,000 each , many have been encouraged by the Clinton campaign to gather as much as $ 1 million apiece .
Several of them represent large corporations , many of whom do business with the government .
Others have been identified as U.S. lobbyists working for foreign governments , including Matthew Bernstein , who represents Dubai and Turkey ; John Merrigan , Dubai , Turkey and Ethiopia ; Thomas Siebert , the Kurdistan Regional Government ; Timothy Chorba , China ; Gordon Giffin , Canada ; and former Sen. Robert Torricelli , Taiwan .
Mr. Torricelli of New Jersey served a single term in the Senate after 14 years in the House but decided not to seek re-election after being implicated in a bribery and campaign finance scandal involving David Chang , a Korean businessman who was imprisoned .
Other HillRaisers and Lincoln Bedroom guests were William Brandt Jr. , a Chicago bankruptcy lawyer and Democratic fundraiser who was investigated and later cleared in a $ 10,000 per-couple fundraiser he held for Mr. Clinton ’s 1996 re-election ; and Michael Turpen , former attorney general in Oklahoma investigated but not charged in 1998 in his solicitation from an Indian tribe of a $ 100,000 donation to the DNC in exchange for coffee with Mr. Clinton at the White House .
At least 16 HillRaisers have given $ 120,000 to Mrs. Clinton ’s political action committee , HILLPAC .
The sleepovers began as part of a re-election strategy by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes , who sought to raise $ 100 million using coffees , overnight stays and other White House perks .
The plan was personally approved by Mr. Clinton , who said in a January 1995 handwritten note : “ Ready to start overnights right away . ”
The White House coffees became so frequent during the Clinton administration that in a Jan. 19 , 1996 , memo , Evelyn Lieberman , White House deputy chief of staff , notified staff members who routinely briefed the president that they should be “ flexible during this period and accept that their briefings may be considerably truncated or eliminated . ”
Mrs. Lieberman now serves as chief operating officer of Mrs. Clinton ’s presidential campaign .
In his report , Mr. LaBella did not accuse the president , first lady or Mr. Ickes — who served as Mrs. Clinton ’s top campaign adviser in her 2000 New York senatorial race — of any criminal acts , but cited a “ pattern of conduct worthy of investigation ” by an independent counsel .
The report was not made public by the Clinton White House for more than two years , but was released in June 2000 by the House Government Reform Committee .
Former HillRaiser Norman
Hsu was sentenced in January to three years in prison in a $ 60 million fraud .
He had raised $ 850,000 for Mrs. Clinton ’s 2008 campaign , which has since been returned .
Howard Wolfson , a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton , said at the time that the campaign returned the money “ out of an abundance of caution . ”
WHITE HOUSE SLEEPOVERS
Nearly one in five big - money contributors to Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s 2008 presidential campaign , known as “ HillRaisers , ” are the same donors who surfaced in a 1996 White House scandal involving sleepovers in the Lincoln Bedroom and other perks to help re-elect President Clinton .

Administrative Discipline .—
If a court or appropriate department or agency determines that the United States or any of its departments or agencies has violated any provision of this chapter , and the court or appropriate department or agency finds that the circumstances surrounding the violation raise serious questions about whether or not an officer or employee of the United States acted willfully or intentionally with respect to the violation , the department or agency shall , upon receipt of a true and correct copy of the decision and findings of the court or appropriate department or agency promptly initiate a proceeding to determine whether disciplinary action against the officer or employee is warranted .
If the head of the department or agency involved determines that disciplinary action is not warranted , he or she shall notify the Inspector General with jurisdiction over the department or agency concerned and shall provide the Inspector General with the reasons for such determination .
In my previous post about learning Python programming through video lectures I stopped at three lectures on Design Patterns .
This time I continue from there .
If you do n't know what a Design Pattern is , think of it as a simple solution to a specific problem that occurs very frequently in software design .
For example , suppose you use a bunch of unrelated pieces of code .
It is a nice idea to bring the unrelated pieces of code together in a unified interface .
This design pattern is called Facade .
There are a bunch of patterns like this one .
The three lectures are given by Alex Martelli who works as " Über Tech Lead " for Google .
Python Design Patterns , Part I
Alex briefly covers the history and main principles of Design Patterns and quickly moves to discussing Structural and Behavioral DPs in Python .
Interesting ideas from the lecture :
[ 03:24 ]
The name " Design Patterns " was first used by Christopher Alexander , an architect , who abstracted the idea of building buildings as building them using well known patterns which can be applied to the same problem over and over again without ever doing it the same way twice .
[ 05:30 ] Design Patterns are mostly applied to Object Oriented programming because it's the most widely spread programming paradigm nowadays .
[ 08:36 ]
Design Patterns are not invented , they are discovered .
[ 10:00 ]
Alex says that the original book Design Patterns by the Gang of Four should be read only when you are a master of DPs .
[ 13:10 ]
Three classical categories of DPs are - Creational ( deal with object instantiaton ) , Structural ( deal with composition of objects ) and Behavioral ( deal with interaction of objects ) .
[ 14:05 ] " Program to an interface , not to an implementation . "
[ 17:00 ]
Use inheritance only when absolutely necessary , otherwise use " hold or wrap " principle .
[ 18:30 ]
Never have more than one dot - Law of Demeter .
[ 18:50 ]
Inheritance cannot restrict , use wrapping to restrict .
[ 21:41 ]
In most of the cases when you need a single instance of something in Python , use a module instead of a class .
[ 22:23 ]
Otherwise , just make 1 instance ( without enforcing one ) .
[ 22:59 ]
Singleton is also called " Highlander " .
[ 24:50 ]
There is basically no way to support subclassing well in Singleton .
[ 25:45 ]
Monostate is also called " Borg " .
[ 27:00 ] Python 's data overriding helps in Monostate Design Pattern .
[ 29:00 ] Each Python 's type / class is essentially a factory .
[ 32:06 ]
Python does a " two - phase object construction " .
[ 35:30 ] Adapter Design Pattern ( it tweaks the interface to your needs ) .
[ 41:22 ] Facade Design Pattern ( it provides a simple subset of a complex functionality ) .
[ 47:25 ] Bridge Design Pattern ( it abstracts interface from the implementation ) .
[ 49:30 ] Decorator Design Pattern ( it transparently modifies some functionality . ) .
[ 50:24 ] Proxy Design Pattern ( sounds the same as decorator just for access control ) .
[ 51:21 ] Q and A !
Python Design Patterns , Part II
In this lecture Alex discusses behavioral patterns .
Unlike the first part , he goes in depth of some of the patterns and explains how they can be implemented in Python .
Interesting ideas from the lecture :
[ 02:25 ]
Template Method is a great pattern with a lousy name , a better name is " self - delegation " .
[ 03:43 ] Example of Template Method Design Pattern ( text pagination ) .
[ 08:50 ] Template Method Rationale .
[ 09:45 ]
The " Hollywood Principle " - " do n't call us , we 'll call you "
[ 12:05 ]
In Python you can also override data .
[ 13:10 ] Example of Template Method in Queue .
Queue .
[ 14:05 ]
If you are a good Python programmer , use Queue in threaded applications .
[ 17:45 ] Customizing Queue .
[ 19:30 ] Example of Template Method in cmd.Cmd.cmdloop .
[ 21:22 ] Example of Template Method in asyncore .
dispatcher .
[ 22:30 ] Variant of Template Method - Mixin ( not presented in Gang of Four book ) .
It 's a class to be multiply - inherited from and supplies organizing methods only .
[ 25:50 ] Template Method in DictMixin class .
[ 26:45 ] Example of DictMixin usage .
[ 29:00 ]
Hooks can be factored out in another class .
Two examples of this from Python 's stdlib are HTML 's formatter vs. writer , SAX 's parser vs. handler
[ 32:40 ]
Hook method introspection example of cmd.Cmd.docmd .
[ 33:30 ]
There are three kinds of Template Methods - plain , factored into separate classes , and introspective .
[ 34:35 ]
Example of all three kinds of Template Methods used in unittest .
TestCase .
[ 36:17 ] State and Strategy Design Patterns .
Very similar classes in what they do .
They both factor out object 's behavior .
[ 40:40 ] Ring buffer example done via State Design Pattern .
[ 43:35 ] Q and A !
Python Design Patterns , A Recap
This video lecture was presented at Google Developers day .
It is a short version of the previous two video lectures .
It starts with an example of Facade Design Pattern , moves on to history and all the types of design patterns .
I did not write out the interesting moments from this lecture as it was a subset of previous two lectures .
If you liked these lectures , check out this geek song about another commonly used design pattern - Model - View - Controller Song .
Even though these were Python design patterns , to understand some of them I used Perl Design Patterns website .
See ya !
No task is more thankless than to write about accounting for a family newspaper , yet it must be shared with the public that " mark to market , " an accounting and regulatory innovation of the early 1990s , has proved another of Washington 's fabulous failures -- that is , if the goal were curing market uncertainty through " improved " accounting practices .
The atmospherics around the big subprime write - downs currently roiling Wall Street tell the story .
Start with Merrill Lynch 's giant $ 15 billion write - down of mortgage - related securities in January , which CEO John
Thain introduced with a curiously contradictory " I think we 're being conservative , but I do n't think that we 're likely to get much back on these things . "
Mmm. Either Merrill 's write - downs are conservative , in which case many of the assets will come back , or they are n't .
Is it any wonder Wall Streeters kibitzing about possible spectacular " write- ups " once the credit crisis passes point to Merrill as a top candidate ?
Or take AIG 's unexpectedly large write - down of subprime paper on Friday , blamed for the market 's sell - off .
Its chief told the world that its mortgages on paper had lost $ 11 billion in value , but sotto voce predicted these " unrealized " losses would eventually correct themselves .
Or take Sam Zell , a real - estate investor whose pronouncements are given great weight in the markets .
He pooh - poohed the red ink being liberally spilled on Wall Street , saying , " It 's not a cash crisis , it 's a ' mark ' crisis , " and predicted that write - ups would undo much of the damage once the " panic " subsides .
None of this should be surprising .
Overstating the importance of accounting rules is , indeed , the essential error that leads to excessive twiddling with accounting rules .
Whether a company values its assets at historic cost or market value or a value derived by some other formula , investors still have to make their own forecasts and judgments .
A thermometer is equally useful whether it says water freezes at 0 degrees or 32 degrees -- though it still does n't tell what the temperature will be next week .

Having kids opens one ’s eyes and spirit for ludic and everything related .
This article was brought to you from my love for playfulness .
These pictures represent actual robots , sculptures made by Gordon Bennett .
Combining new and old found objects emerging from garbage dumps , basements , construction sites and garage sales he managed to mix wood , metal , bakelite , glass , plastic , rubber and paint to create uniqueness .
Each of the Bennett Robot Works robots is a one of a kind creation and takes an average month to build .
Like a fantastic dream robots manufactory , the Bennett creations are n’t meant to be toys or to move around ( regardless of how much you ’d like to see them work ) , they just serve the eye and spirit , like I said at the very beginning .
Are you a collector ?
Or a playful spirit drove around on dreamy wings of joy in search for classifying rare , one - of - a - kind objects ?
If so , what makes your heart tick and eyes wink ?

WASHINGTON  Housing secretary Alphonso R. Jackson resigned on Monday , saying that he needed to devote more time to his family .
The announcement came as federal authorities were investigating whether he had given lucrative housing contracts in the Virgin Islands and New Orleans to friends .
His resignation , effective April 18 , also comes as the Bush administration is increasingly relying on the department ’s Federal Housing Administration to help stanch the widening foreclosures .
In recent weeks , Mr. Jackson had faced mounting pressure to leave his post .
The FBI has interviewed several of his employees , and two senior Democratic senators called on him to resign , saying the allegations of wrongdoing had undermined his leadership .
Lawmakers have also raised concerns about accusations that Mr. Jackson had threatened to withdraw federal aid from the Philadelphia Housing Authority after its president refused to turn over a $ 2 million property to a politically connected developer .
Mr. Jackson , who assumed his post as secretary in 2004 , did not address those allegations during his brief statement in the 10th floor briefing room of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development .
Polls are looking good for Obama as Hillary loses the big lead she 's held for most of the primary season .
Is Bill Clinton Hillary 's biggest liability , instead of the asset most assumed ?
Sure looks that way as Hillary falls while Obama rises .
P ollster John Zogby : " A very big single day for Obama in California ( 49 % - 32 % over Clinton ) and Missouri ( 49% - 39 % single day ) .
In California , Obama has widened his lead in the north and pulled ahead in the south .
He leads among Democrats and Independents , liberals and moderates , men ( by 21 points ) , among whites , and African Americans .
He holds big leads among voters who say Iraq and immigration are their top concerns .
Clinton holds a big lead among Hispanics ( though Obama has made some inroads ) , women , voters over 65 , and has pulled ahead among those citing the economy .
" In Missouri , Obama leads two to one in the St. Louis region , and has solid leads with independents , voters under 50 , and African Americans .
He also leads among Missouri women .
Clinton leads among whites and has big leads in the Kansas City and southwestern region .
" New Jersey tied in the single day as well as three - day .
It is razor thin close in all regions .
Obama has 12 point leads among Independents and men , while Clinton is up by 12 among women .
Obama has a 25 point lead among young voters , while Clinton leads among older voters .

Zogby : Obama and Clinton were dead - even in New Jersey , each with 43 % each and with 10 % of voters undecided .
Clinton was ahead among Democratic voters , 45 % to 42 % , but Obama had more support from independents , with 48 % of their support to Clinton ’s 34 % .
Half of women ( 50 % ) supported the former First Lady , compared to 38 % for Obama .
It was almost a mirror image among men , however , with 48 % supporting Obama to 35 % for Clinton .
This survey included 847 likely voters and carried a margin of error of +/- 3.4 points .
Obama 's problem is there are almost 50 % more women than men who vote democratic .
The USA Today Poll shows Hillary with 42 % to Obama's 41 %
CBS /NY Times poll puts Obama / Hillary Dead even at 41 % each
It looks like Americans are ready for a woman president , ready for a Black president , but , ironically , they may not be ready for a male first mate , particularly Bill Clinton .

80 Percent of Americans Think US is on the Wrong Track
The US survey revealed that 80 percent of Americans think that their country is moving in the wrong direction .
The poll conducted by The CBS News - New York Times showed that most Americans are dissatisfied with the situation in the country , which became worse and " things have pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track . "
That was the highest percentage since the beginning of the 1990s .
People of different ages , with different political views and educational level , men and women agree that United States is headed in the wrong direction .
Almost 78 percent of respondents agreed that the situation is worse than 5 years ago .
The results of the survey showed that two in three Americans agree that economy is in recession and only 21 percent believed that economic condition is good enough .
However , the rating of President George W. Bush did not change much with 28 Americans approving his job .
According to the findings , people think that government officials are responsible for housing crisis even more than banks , home buyers or other borrowers .
Americans also think that financial institutions should not be rendered assistance in mortgage crisis .
Most respondents explained that they would n't want the government to help banks even in case it could slow down temporary depression in economy .
As much as 53 percent of people said that government should take some measures to help those whose interest rates were rising .
The survey included 1,368 US respondents and was conducted from March 28 to April 2 .

On August 25 , Democrats will gather in Denver for their nominating convention .
Ironically it comes precisely 40 years since the party opened it 's 1968 convention in Chicago .
The 1968 convention was the most significant in my lifetime - until now .
The Democratic Party and the nation paid a horrible price for what transpired at that convention , a price we may be about to pay again .
The Democratic convention this August faces many of the same issues as Democrats face in 1968 .
Change vs. same - old , same - old .
Machine politics vs. people politics .
The will of the people vs. the will of party insiders .
They are all in play again .
I only mention this because the players are already setting up their plays for the August show down in Denver .
Hillary Clinton has made it clear that , if Obama wins enough delegates to match her , she and her party surrogates will demand that delegates from Florida and Michigan be seated , even though she had agreed with the party 's decision months ago to ban them if they moved their primaries up .
They did anyway and their delegates were decertified .
Now that she won Florida she wants to change the rules .
If that fight breaks out on the convention floor this August , get ready for trouble .
What kind of trouble ?
Big trouble .
That 's what kind of trouble .
A brief history is required .
Bear with me .
Because , it 's that important .
Flash Back :
Choosing a Presidential nominee in 1968 was particularly difficult for the Democrats .
As today a profoundly unpopular war raged ( in Vietnam . )
President Lyndon B. Johnson , who had repeatedly escalated US involvement in Vietnam , had come under so much pressure from anti-war Democrats that he decided not to seek re-election .
Robert Kennedy was a controversial upstart , anti-war candidate hated by Johnson and unpopular with party leaders who saw him as too ambitious and too young .
But Robert Kennedy was assassinated in June , nearly three months before the convention .
Senator Eugene McCarthy , D - MN , stepped up his aggressive anti-war campaign , calling for the immediate withdrawal from the region .
Kennedy 's former supporters flocked to McCarthy .
On the other side was the Democratic Party bosses ' choice , Vice President Hubert Humphrey .
Thanks to the oddities of Democratic primary rules back then , Humphrey did not participate in any primaries but still controlled enough delegates to secure the nomination if he wanted it .
Unfortunately Humphrey had been an early supporter of the war and currently mirrored Johnson 's strategy of continuing the war while trying to convince North Vietnam to negotiate a settlement .
Anti-war Democrats had heard enough of such , " give - me - a - hamburger - today and - I 'll - pay - you - tomorrow , nonsense .
They were n't buying .
McCarthy 's announcement re-ignited the hopes of a new generation of voters and political activists .
A former academic and Washington outsider , McCarthy 's nickname became " Clean for Gene , " leading many students to cut their hair off and shave their beards and mustaches .
McCarthy 's principled stand on the war faced it 's first , the New Hampshire primary .
Hundreds of students rushed to New Hampshire and campaigned door - to - door for McCarthy .
McCarthy won a startling 42 % of the vote , something that greatly upset and stunned party loyalists .
Meanwhile behind the scenes Vice - president Hubert H. Humphrey had been negotiating for delegates in non-primary states .
The fix had been put in already by party bosses .
Humphrey " won " the nomination in Chicago on August 25 - 29 , 1968 .
Three - thousand anti-war demonstrators stood outside the convention hall in shocked rage .
To add insult to injury the delegates to the Democratic convention voted down a Vietnam peace plan by a 1500 - 1000 vote .
( You see , even 40 years ago , Democrats lived in fear of being painted as " weak on national defense , " by their Republican opponents .
If a few thousand more US soldiers had to die for Democrats to look tough , so be it . )
So , despite strong showings in the primaries , McCarthy was able to gather only 23 percent of the delegates -- thanks to the control over the delegates wielded by state party organizations .
While Humphrey , was not clearly an anti-war candidate , some anti-war Democrats backed Humphrey hoping he might succeed where Johnson had failed in extricating the United States from Vietnam -- just as today some Democrats hope that Hillary , who was for the war before she was against it -- might just figure out how to extricate us from Iraq .

Defense Department documents handed over to the Associated Press under a Freedom of Information
Act request raised the possibility that the “ friendly - fire ” death of soldier and former NFL player Pat Tillman amounted to a crime .
Doctors examining Tillman ’s body after he was killed in Afghanistan in 2004 told investigators that the three bullet holes in his head appeared to have been fired by an M - 16 from less than a dozen yards away rather than the 100 meters or so that the military has claimed .
AP via Washington Post :
Army medical examiners were suspicious about the close proximity of the three bullet holes in Pat Tillman ’s forehead and tried without success to get authorities to investigate whether the former NFL player ’s death amounted to a crime , according to documents obtained by The Associated Press .
“ The medical evidence did not match up with the , with the scenario as described , ” a doctor who examined Tillman ’s body after he was killed on the battlefield in Afghanistan in 2004 told investigators .
The doctors — whose names were blacked out — said that the bullet holes were so close together that it appeared the Army Ranger was cut down by an M - 16 fired from a mere 10 yards or so away .
Ultimately , the Pentagon did conduct a criminal investigation , and asked Tillman ’s comrades whether he was disliked by his men and whether they had any reason to believe he was deliberately killed .
The Pentagon eventually ruled that Tillman ’s death at the hands of his comrades was a friendly - fire accident .

Highly complex honeybee communities are one example of phenomena that some scientists think can't be explained by the mainstream theory of evolution alone , but instead by a theory of self - organization .
Courtesy Todd Huffman / Flickr Nearly 150 years after Charles Darwin published
On the Origin of Species , evolution has been widely accepted by scientists – and , except for a few religious dogmatic types , the public – as the blueprint for the engine of life .
But not every scientist thinks that evolution as it's now understood and applied is complete .
They want to scale it up to the level of populations , even whole ecosystems .
Moreover , they say evolution is intertwined with other dynamics that science is just starting to understand .
" The process of evolution is fundamental to the universe .
Biology is the most obvious manifestation of it , " said Carl Woese , a legendary microbiologist and one of the first proponents of this newly revised evolutionary framework .
Darwin described how changes in an organism are passed from generation to generation , dwindling or spreading through populations depending on their contribution to survival .
Biologists later combined this with genetics , which had yet to be discovered in Darwin 's time .
The fusion – called the modern evolutionary synthesis , or neo-Darwinian evolution – describes evolution as we now know it : Genetic mutations produce changes that sometimes become part of a species ' heritage and , when enough changes accumulate , produce new species .
But to Woese and others , change and selection need to be studied at other levels : A honeybee colony , for example , is as much an individual as a single bee .
And when explaining how interacting units – bees , or bacteria , or cells – produce the qualities of the whole , change and selection alone might not suffice .
What 's needed is an understanding of the dynamics of complexity .
" There 's nothing wrong with neo -Darwinian evolution in its own right , " Woese said , " but it 's not large enough to encompass what we know now . "
Woese 's specialty is bacteria , and he's not afraid of bold theories that turn conventional scientific wisdom on its head .
In 1977 , he and colleague George Fox rearranged the animal kingdom from five branches into three , two of which comprise microbes .
Microbes make up much of Earth 's biomass , and they also cast into relief the shortcomings of neo-Darwinian evolution .
A bucket of seawater can contain 60,000 bacterial species , and to Woese , these must be seen as a collective rather than as disparate units .
At the collective level , said Woese , bacteria exhibit patterns of organization and behavior that emerge suddenly , at tipping points of population variation and density called " saltations . "
Natural selection still favors – or disfavors – the ultimate outcome of these jumps , but the jumps themselves seem to defy explanation solely through genetic changes or individual properties .
Such jumps do n't just call into question whether evolution is capable of producing sudden rather than gradual change .
That debate raged during the later stages of the last century , but has been largely settled in favor of what paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould termed punctuated equilibrium .
By contrast , Woese invokes yet - to - be- quantified rules of complexity and emergence .
These , he said , may also explain other exceptional jumps , such as the transition from protein fragments to single cells and from single - celled organisms to multicellular ones .
But even bacterial communities resist framing in isolation .
The human body , for example , contains nine bacterial cells for every cell of our own .
There 's no clear line separating our selves and our bacteria :
We 're walking ecosystems .
The same blurriness exists when considering any collection of interacting organisms .
If these principles seem nebulous in a bacterial context – microbes are , after all , invisible to the eye – then the same principles can be discerned more clearly in the insect world , where some biologists now see certain species , especially honeybees and ants , as forming colonies that should be defined as self - interested organisms unto themselves .
In these so - called superorganisms , individual characteristics – such as the chronologically varying reproductive stages of solitary female bees – lay the foundations for highly complex organizations , such as honeybee hives in which different reproductive stages are assigned to separate worker castes .
According to Arizona State University evolutionary biologist Gro Amdam , until recently , scientists thought the division of labor had a genetic basis , but after scientists sequenced the honeybee genome , they could n't find a trigger .
Hyper -specialization seems to be an emergent property of the collective .
" That 's a specific example of how a new pattern can be thrown into play , " Amdam said .
" You have an ordinary life cycle in an individual , but in a social context it 's exploited by the colony . "
The superorganism is still shaped by mutation and natural selection , but only recently have biologists , accustomed to thinking of evolution at the individual level , applied the superorganism concept to insects .
It may very well have even broader applications .
" Man is the one who 's undergoing this incredible evolution now , " Woese said .
" We see some in the insects , but the social processes by which man is evolving are creating a whole new level of organization . "
But as with bacteria and people , how can a sharp distinction be drawn between a honeybee colony and the flowers that both nourish them and rely on them for pollination ?
And between the flowers and organisms that in turn rely upon them ?
" Selection probably happens at all scales , from gene to individual to species to collection of species to ecosystem to we do n't even know what , " said Maya Paczuski , head of the Complexity Science Group at the University of Calgary .
Paczuski's group sees evolution as taking place at all these levels , with what happens in ecosystems rippling down to individuals , back up to populations , across to other populations , and so on – all simultaneously , and in tandem with the mysterious dynamics of networked complexity .
But does it all happen mechanically ?
Or does evolution obey some larger imperative ?
University of Nevada evolutionary biologist Guy Hoelzer calls that imperative biospheric self - organization .
" The idea of evolution is embedded within self - organization , " he said .
" It coordinates the ecological roles of species so that ecosystems persist and process a great deal of energy . "
Woese expanded the concept .
" Evolution is a better version of the second law of thermodynamics , of time - zero , which implies that things are going to degenerate until even the atoms fall apart .
But maybe that 's not the way it 's going to play out . "
Such theories are still new and controversial .
The scientific community at large may never accept them .
But ideas do evolve , even Darwin's .
" I think Darwin would be happy as a lark to come back and see what 's going on , " said Peter Bowler , co-author of Charles Darwin : The Man and His Influence .
" He 'd say , ' This is quite exciting ! ' "

On Darwin's Birthday , Dover Still Is n't Over
The Decline and Fall of the Animal Kingdom
BioShock was never meant to be a science lesson , but it contains some jargon and ideas that would be familiar to any life - science student .
We got in touch with Ken Levine , the creative director at 2 K games , to learn about the bits of science that he slipped into an amazing game .
" Let 's be clear : BioShock is not hard science fiction .
It 's science fiction as metaphor , " Levine says .
" Yes , gene splicing exists .
Yes , plasmids exist .
Yes , stem cells exist , but the applications in the game are pretty fantastical .
Our goal was to hand wave over the science enough that it sounded vaguely plausible but I would n't want to sit around with a geneticist and argue the finer points . "
Levine wanted the technical content to sound real , so it would suspend the disbelief of his audience .
Here is a list of our favorite concepts .
Most of them have the same general meaning in the game as in the real world , but their potential to do fantastic , or terrible , things is way overblown .
5. Pheromones
Many creatures use chemicals to communicate with one another .
Some of those molecules send an attraction signal .
Sticky pest traps use them to lure insects .
In the game , they are used to control splicers and other villains .
4. Bioethics
Rapture , the world of BioShock , is rife with unethical doctors and misused technology .
Luckily , most real scientists have strong morals , but they must sometimes face tremendous dilemmas .
For instance , Australian researchers unintentionally developed a virus that could kill nearly every mouse it infected , even vaccinated ones .
They chose to tell the entire scientific community about their discovery , even though some people think they should have stayed quiet .
3. Stem Cells
One of the forces that corrupted Rapture is ADAM , a line of stem cells taken from sea slugs .
In the real world , stem cells may have a tremendous ability to repair damaged tissue , but they would not corrupt people .
The best ones are autologous , which means they are implanted in the same person they came from – not from slugs .
2. Splicers
Genetic engineering permeates Rapture , and some of the most grotesque villains are splicers .
Their name , of course , references gene splicing , which figures prominently into our world as well .
Many of the crops we eat have been genetically modified to tolerate pests or herbicides .
Researchers routinely create lab animals that lack individual genes , or contain strange ones .
They have even made green fluorescent rabbits and glowing fish .
1. Plasmids
In the game , they modify your DNA , giving you the ability to use telekinesis , hurl electro bolts , and incinerate your enemies .
In the real world , they are circular DNA molecules that bacteria use to share genes with each other .
Researchers often create custom plasmids to give bacteria special abilities , like the power to resist antibiotics or a recipe for proteins that no bug would ordinarily produce .
When the newest “ Rambo ” movie opens later this week , there ’s going to be a lot of death and dying .
So I got myself an early copy , watched it several times through , stopping and starting along the way , to try to quantify exactly who was being killed and how .
My goal was to update a chart I had done several years ago on the earlier “ Rambo ” movies .
The body count below includes only people who visibly fall inert after being bombed ; garroted ; blasted ; stabbed ; strangled ; blown up by mines , artillery , grenades or other explosives ; shot by bullets , artillery or arrows ; incinerated by fires or flame throwers ; bludgeoned ; stomped or beaten ; disemboweled or beheaded ; or pushed or tossed off precipices or out of aircraft .
It also includes people who had their necks snapped .
In a couple of scenes , the action moved very quickly , and bodies became hard to distinguish ( such as when a whole bunch of people were mowed down by machine - gun fire ) , but in most cases , the death toll was clear .
In addition , there were many instances in which Rambo blew up occupied tanks , helicopters , cars , trucks , trail passages , guard towers or other buildings .
Fatalities from these episodes were not included in the body count unless the people inside were clearly shown to die by , for example , bolting into the open from their erstwhile place of refuge , clutching various body parts and collapsing to the ground .

Topics on Russia and the former Soviet Union
The nation 's top spy , Michael McConnell , thinks the threat of cyberarmageddon !
is so great that the U.S. government should have unfettered and warrantless access to U.S. citizens '
Google search histories , private e-mails and file transfers , in order to spot the cyberterrorists in our midst .
That 's according to a sprawling 18 - page story on the Director of
National Intelligence by Lawrence Wright in the January 21 edition of the New Yorker .
( The story is not online ) .
In the piece , McConnell returns , in flamboyant style , to his exaggerating ways , hyping threats and statistics to further his bureaucratic aims .
For example , McConnell regurgitates the hoary myth that computer crime costs America $ 100 billion a year .
THREAT LEVEL traced down the source of that fake - factoid in September to a former privacy officer for the state of Colorado .
Presumably using unsupported stats like that , in May 2007 McConnell convinced President Bush that a massive cyber - attack on a single U.S. bank would be worse for the economy than than the deadly terrorist attacks of September 11 , the article reports .
In response , the NSA developed a mind - boggling , but still incomplete , plan to eavesdrop on the internet in order to protect it .
In order for cyberspace to be policed , Internet activity will have to be closely monitored .
Ed Giorgio , who is working with McConnell on the plan , said that would mean giving the government the authority to examine the content of any e-mail , file transfer , or Web search .
" Google has records that could help in a cyber - investigation , " he said .
Giorgio warned me , " We have a saying in this business : ' Privacy and security are a zero- sum game . ' "
It says something ominous about McConnell 's priorities if he believes a DDOS attack on Bank of America , or even a computer intrusion that wiped out its database ( and magically purged its backup tapes ) , would be worse than an attack that killed 3,000 Americans .
Still , it 's hardly a surprising plan – given that McConnell was one of the main backers of the Clipper Chip , the government 's failed , early 1990 's proposal to put a backdoor in every encryption product .
McConnell also makes an astounding assertion that the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court recently crippled the NSA 's overseas signals intelligence collection with a string of soft - on - terror rulings .
McConnell said that federal judges had recently decided , in a series of secret rulings , that any telephone transmission or e-mail that incidentally flowed into U.S. computer systems was potentially subject to judicial oversight .
According to McConnell the capacity of the NSA to monitor foreign - based communications had consequently been reduced by seventy per cent .
In other words , McConnell claims the NSA could n't intercept a terrorist 's e-mail by tapping a fiber optic cable in Pakistan , if there was a chance the message would pass through a U.S. router or end up in a Hotmail account .
I 'm no rich man , but I 'll bet any reader $ 1,000 that , when and if those rulings are ever released , we 'll see they say no such thing .
Send me an e-mail to take me up this bet .
U.S. government officials are welcome to participate .
The FISA law that created the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court only applies to intercepts that physically happen within the borders of the United States .
The NSA has always been free to intercept foreign communications overseas – the mission for which they were created and funded – even if the call passes through a U.S. switch .
So in the case of the now debunked Iraqi kidnappers anecdote that leads off the New Yorker story , the NSA would only have needed to get a court order if its Iraqi targets initiated communications that flowed through U.S. servers or switches and the NSA decided to tap them physically at a United States internet or telecom facility , by burglarizing it , digging up its cables or getting the company to cooperate .
( As for why that happens and how common it is , check my story : NSA 's Lucky Break : How the U.S. Became the Switchboard to the World . )
Simply put , the FISA law is intended to prevent the NSA from operating inside the United States .
In any event , that restriction collapsed this summer with the fear - induced , strong - armed passage of the so - called Protect America Act .
That law radically re-architected the nation 's surveillance apparatus .
Now the NSA can turn Gmail 's servers and AT&T 's switches into de facto arms of the surveillance industrial complex without any court oversight .
And though the law ostensibly sunsets in February , any orders in effect at that time will have power for another 12 months .
Moreover , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nevada ) is reportedly planning to discard legislative attempts to rein in these new powers and will instead simply push to extend the current scheme another 12 months .
In short , McConnell 's politically convenient exaggerations have already worked well for him in winning domestic spying powers , despite their flimsiness under any real scrutiny .
That track record bodes ill for anyone concerned about his new plans to push for sweeping and unnecessary powers to put the NSA in the wires of the internet in order to prevent a computer attacks .
The Wall Street Journal 's intelligence guru Siobhan Gorman 's take is here .
Gorman wrote a groundbreaking story on the cyberspace initiative last September while at The Baltimore Sun .
UPDATE : Ex-spook Michael Tanji guest - posting over at Danger Room writes :
It 's bad enough that the Director of National Intelligence is trotting out a bogus threat so the government can snoop on all Internet traffic .
What 's worse is that this kind of mass surveillance is a pretty lame way to catch the honest - to - God bad guys .
Of more interest to observers of intelligence activities is the issue of quality vs. quantity and the slow creep towards doom that these efforts foretell .
The fact that we are essentially attempting to gill - net bad guys is a fairly strong indicator that the intelligence community has yet to come up with an effective strategy against information - age threats . [...]
Its not a question of listening in to you whispering sweet nothings into the ear to your significant other , it is simply a case of – as the late Sam Kinison joked – going where the food is .
That our intelligence agencies can intercept adversary communications is largely a given , they just want to do it from the convenience of the homeland , not some remote switch in the darkest hinterlands .

Over the years , different theories have emerged to describe the educated / less - educated divide .
Conservatives have gravitated toward the culture war narrative , dividing the country between the wholesome masses and the decadent cultural elites .
Some liberals believe income inequality drives everything .
They wait for an uprising of economic populism .
Other liberals divide the country morally , between the enlightened urbanites and the racist rednecks who will never vote for a black man .
None of these theories really fit the facts .
It ’s more accurate to say that the country has simply drifted apart into different subcultures .
There ’s no great hostility between the cultures .
Americans have a fuzzy sense of where the boundaries lie .
But people in different niches have developed different unconscious maps of reality .
They have developed different communal understandings of what constitutes a good leader , of what sort of world they live in .
They have developed different communal definitions , which they ca n’t even articulate , of what they mean by liberty , security and virtue .
Demographic groups have begun to function like tribes or cultures .
We can all play the parlor game of trying to figure out why Obama , a Harvard Law grad , resonates with the more educated while Clinton , a Yale Law grad , resonates with the less educated .
I ’d throw in that Obama ’s offer of a secular crusade hits a nerve among his fellow bobos , while Clinton ’s talk of fighting and resilience plays well down market .
But these theories only scratch the surface .
The mental maps people in different cultures form are infinitely complex and poorly understood even by those who hold them .
People pick up millions of subtle signals from body language , word choice , facial expressions , policy positions and biographical details .
Efforts to rebrand a candidate to appeal to down - market voters are inevitably crude and counterproductive .
The core message is that even if you take away the ideological differences between the parties , you are still left with profound social gulfs within the parties .
There ’s poignancy to that .
The upscale liberals who revere Obama have spent their lives championing equality and opposing privilege .
But they ’ve smashed the old WASP social hierarchy only to create a new educational one .

DET 89 73 CLE 88 74 MIN 78 84 CHW 78 84 KC 73 89
Team : Detroit Tigers
Prediction : 89 - 73 , 1st place
Why they ’ll be better :
The Tigers have arguably the best offense in the league , adding young stud Miguel Cabrera and Edgar Renteria to a lineup that scored the second most runs in the AL last year .
Curtis Granderson is one of the game ’s most exciting young players and while Magglio Ordonez will decline , he ’s still very good , and Carlos Guillenis one of the more underappreciated players in the league .
Why they ’ll be worse :
The rotation past ace Justin Verlander is a question mark , with the inconsistent Jeremy Bonderman and Dontrelle Willis along with 43 year old Kenny Rogers and Nate Robertson .
If all five stay healthy and pitch to their abilities , they ’ll be fine , but the odds of that are low .
The bullpen is a huge weakness , with closer Todd Jones walking a fine line and set - up men Joel Zumaya and Fernando Rodney injured .
Key Player(s ) : RHP Bonderman – Every year , he ’s expected to break out and establish himself as a true front - line starter , and every year he gets off to a good start followed by a shitty second half .
He has the stuff and command to be a top - 10 starter and if he ’s healthy all year , he ’ll give the Tigers the best 1 - 2 combination in the league with Verlander .
Outlook : The Tigers enter the season with expectations as high as any team in the league , two years removed from a World Series appearance and on the heels of the huge offseason trade with the Marlins that netted Cabrera and Willis .
I credit GM Dave Dombrowski for striking while the iron ’s hot – the window for contending is closing quickly .
While on paper they look strong , they are older and injuries could take a toll .
They have a good shot at the playoffs but I could see them having a disappointing year .
Team : Cleveland Indians
Prediction : 88 - 74 , 2nd place
Why they ’ll be better :
They won 96 games last season despite getting very little production from their outfield corners and the worst season of Travis Hafner ’s career .
Most of their core , including Grady Sizemore , Jhonny Peralta , Victor Martinez and Ryan Garko are still young and improving .
Why they ’ll be worse : Hafner looked awful in the playoffs and might be done .
C.C. Sabathia pitched a lot of innings last year and some decline from him and Fausto Carmona is to be expected .
Joe Borowski is still the closer .
As with most teams , the back end of the rotation is mediocre .
Key Player(s ) : Hafner and OF Franklin Gutierrez –
You pretty much know what you ’re gonna get from most of the Indians , but these two will determine how good the offense really is .
Hafner was one of the best hitters in the league before last year and a return to form will make up for declines elsewhere .
Gutierrez is a true 5 - tool talent , a guy who could go 20 - 20 and play outstanding outfield defense .
If they both flop , the Indians are unlikely to challenge the Tigers .
Outlook : The Indians made it within a game of the World Series last year , letting a 3 - 1 lead in the ALCS v. the Red Sox slip through their fingers .
Their roster was pretty much unchanged from last year and watching the Tigers get better only shows that might not be a good thing .
They have a lot of talent and are probably one of the top 5 teams in baseball , but that may not be enough to make the playoffs in the tough AL .
Team : Minnesota Twins
Prediction : 78 - 84 , T - 3rd place
Why they ’ll be better :
The return of stud pitcher Francisco Liriano and the continued development of Kevin Slowey , Scott Baker and Boof Bonser could give the Twins a underrated and strong pitching staff .
The bullpen led by Joe Nathan and my personal favorite ( and blogger ) Pat Neshek should be solid .
Joe Mauer and former MVP Justin Morneau should both put up good seasons .
Why they ’ll be worse :
It ’s never easy to rely on young pitchers , no matter how talented , and it ’s tough to know how Liriano will come back .
The lineup has holes and Mauer has been injury - prone in his career .
However , I do n’t see a lot of downside here and they should n’t be too much worse than a slightly below average team .
Key Player(s ) : OF Delmon Young –
The former # 1 overall pick and # 1 prospect in the game , and still just 22 years old , Young has been pegged by some as a future Hall - of - Famer .
However , the Tampa Bay Rays gave up on him in part because of attitude problems and shipped him to the Twins for pitching .
If Young shows some development towards becoming a franchise player , it will be a good foundation for the future of the Twins .
Outlook : The Twins looked around at their divisionmates and decided they could n’t contend and dealt Johan Santana , the best pitcher in the game , to the Mets for a pu-pu platter of 4 mediocre prospects .
It ’s unfortunate because with their new ballpark opening and some really great pieces like Mauer , Morneau , Young and Liriano they could have probably afforded him and stayed in contention .
I think they ’ll be better than most people think and with a couple more bats could be a contender again as early as next year .
Team : Chicago White Sox
Prediction : 78 - 84 , T - 3rd place
Why they ’ll be better :
Well , I do n’t think they will be – but I suppose if Jim Thome stays healthy and Paul Konerko and Jermaine Dye reverse their decline , that could be a good 3 - 4 - 5 .
Nick Swisher will be an improvement in he outfield and Cuban import Alexei Ramirez could be very exciting .
Why they ’ll be worse :
Their rotation past the underrated Javier Vazquez is pretty bad , with Mark Buehrle on the edge of a drop - off , and John Danks , Gavin Floyd and Jose Contreras do n’t belong in a major league rotation .
The offense is old and slow without much upside .
The bullpen ca n’t throw strikes .
Key Player(s ) : Ramirez – The Cuban import could be anything from the next Alfonso Soriano to the next Kendry Morales .
He is raw and toolsy , and anywhere between 25 and 29 , but his development is easily the most interesting part of this team .
Outlook : The White Sox somehow think they ’re a contender despite winning only 72 games last year and being in a division with two much , much better teams .
I would expect them to fall short of the 78 win prediction and could easily finish last .
Team : Kansas City Royals
Prediction : 73 -89 , 5th place
Why they ’ll be better :
If Gil Meche and Brian Bannister build upon their strong 2007s and Zack Greinke is actually over his emotional problems , they could actually have a decent rotation .
Alex Gordon and Billy Butler are both future offensive stars and this year could be their breakout .
Why they ’ll be worse :
The bullpen besides Joakim Soria is shaky and the offense is missing impact bats and has some holes .
The rotation is a question mark and let ’s be honest , they ’re still the Royals .
Key Player(s ) : RHP Greinke –
The once and future ace , Greinke has battled depression and other mental disoders and by the end of last season looked to have overcome them .
If he is truly over it , Greinke will give the Royals another block to build upon .
Outlook :
The Royals finally have some hope but they ’re still a couple seasons away from approaching .500 .
They ’re not the laughingstock of baseball anymore , and though it ’s a small step , at least it ’s one in the right direction .
Tomorrow : AL West

But others see undercurrents of racial unease that could boil into conflict , especially if hard times return .
“ In Irish literature there ’s a big fear of the returned immigrant who brings all sorts of chaos with him , ” said Mary Gilmartin , a geographer at the National University of Ireland , Maynooth .
“ Many people here feel threatened . ”
As recently as the 1980s , young Irish were fleeing unemployment in droves , many to work illegally in the United States .
By the late 1990s , an economic boom called the Celtic Tiger was luring them home , along with droves of foreign construction workers , farm hands , waitresses and nannies .
A wave of asylum seekers joined them , many from Africa .
Some had escaped harrowing wars or genital mutilation .
But officials grew skeptical of their claims as their numbers surged to about 12,000 in 2002 from a trickle a decade before .
Ireland not only offered citizenship to children born upon arrival ; until 2003 it also allowed their illegal - immigrant parents to stay , a shortcut many asylum seekers used to win residency .
Word got out : with a visa to Britain , a pregnant woman could reach Northern Ireland , take a cab across the border , and gain residency by giving birth .
Ms. Gilmartin argues that reports of abuse were exaggerated .
But a 2004 referendum changed the rules , reserving citizenship for the children of longtime legal residents .
It passed with nearly 80 percent of the vote .
By then , Ireland had about 18,000 mixed families of Irish children and illegal - immigrant parents .
Wary of the costs of large - scale deportation , the government ran a one - time legalization program that gave residency to about 95 percent of those parents .
The Dimbos were among the 1,000 or so families whose cases were rejected , and they have appealed to the Supreme Court .
Their situation , like that of millions in the United States , pits competing interests : those of children ( to live in their country with their parents ) against those of states ( to enforce borders for the perceived common good ) .
The Omega Point and the Final Fate of Life
How long can life survive in the universe ?
Can it evolve forever , or will the third law of Thermodynamics lead to universal heat death ?
Apparently there might be some ways around this fate , if intelligent life is sufficiently clever and tenacious .
Essentially life has to adapt as the universe grows older , changing itself to be able to survive when the stars grow cold .
If the universe is open , there will be plenty of time to work in , but energy will become very scarce .
Dyson has shown that a finite amount of energy is enough to guarantee infinite survival if it is spent sufficiently slowly ( this is called the Dyson scenario ) .
On the other hand , if the universe is closed , it will recollapse into a Big Crunch after a finite time , becoming hotter and hotter .
Life has to adapt and restructure itself to these conditions , and if intelligent beings accelerate the speed of their mental processes accordingly they can even experience a subjective infinite time during the last stages of the collapse ( this is called the Tipler scenario ) .
A third possibility is that the universe may be open or closed , but new baby universes branch off due to natural or artificial causes , and intelligent life can survive indefinitely by migrating into new domains as the old become uninhabitable .
This is commonly called the Linde scenario .

Frank J. Tipler has proposed that it is possible for intelligent beings to process and store an infinite amount of information in the universe , if certain conditions are fulfilled .
His definition of the Omega Point is essentially a future c-boundary which is a single point and an Aleph state , where
Information processing continues indefinitely along at least one world - line gamma all the way to the future c-boundary of the universe .
i.e. Life never dies out .
The amount of information processed between now and the future c-boundary is infinite in the region of space - time with which the worldline gamma can communicate .
i.e.
There will be an infinite number of thoughts , experiences and events .
The amount of information stored at any given time tau within this region diverges to infinity as tau approaches its future limit .
i.e. More and more is learned , and things never repeat themselves .
What has made his theory controversial is his claims that it is experimentally verifiable , that the beings near the Omega Point will resurrect anybody who has ever lived into a state close to classical descriptions of Paradise and that the Omega Point itself corresponds to the religious notation of God .
From a transhumanist perspective , the Omega Point is the logical conclusion of our striving towards higer levels , regardless of its nature .
It is more of an engineering problem than a philosophical question .

Yet another class action lawsuit has been filed against Apple and AT&T , targeting the two companies ' practices when it comes to the iPhone .
Extremely similar to the suit filed a week and a half ago by Californian Timothy Smith , California resident Lucy Rivello and Washington resident Paul Holman have accused Apple of entering into an unlawful agreement with AT&T that ultimately caused the two companies to commit a number of illegal acts .
This includes preventing the iPhone from being unlocked and used on other carriers , as well as keeping third - parties from developing software for the iPhone .
The 24 - page complaint details the history of the cellular industry in the US , going back to the differences between GSM and CDMA , EDGE and EVDO , the purposes of SIM cards and how phones that use them differ from phones offered by CDMA carriers , and so on .
Rivello and Holman also point out AT&T 's refusal to issue unlock codes to iPhone owners despite being willing to do so for phones from other carriers , which they say is illegal .
The suit cites the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) and recent provisions that allow customers to lawfully unlock their phones .
The plaintiffs also cite a statement made by Steve Jobs in September : " We try to stay ahead .
People will try to break in , and it's our job to stop them breaking in . "
This , combined with allegations that Apple worked directly against third - party computer applications to add legally - purchased ringtones to the iPhone , the discovery of multiple unlocking methods , and the plethora of third - party native iPhone applications , led up to the now - infamous statement made by Apple the following week .
" Apple has discovered that many of the unauthorized iPhone unlocking programs available on the Internet cause irreparable damage to the iPhone 's software , which will likely result in the modified iPhone becoming permanently inoperable when a future Apple - supplied iPhone software update is installed . "
Indeed , when the 1.1.1 firmware update was issued , many phones that had been unlocked were rendered inoperable , and all third - party native apps for the iPhone had been disabled .
The complaint says that this was no accident : Apple and AT&T conspired to make this happen , despite many claims to the contrary by Apple representatives .
" On information and belief , Apple expressly designed its software release version 1.1.1 expressly to disable Third Party Apps and to disable any unlocked SIM cards , and to create technical barriers to install new Third Party Apps or unlock the SIM cards , " reads the complaint .
The companies then proceeded to void the warranties of all iPhone owners who had installed third - party applications and refused to service them — more unlawful actions , say the plaintiffs .
Finally , the lawsuit accuses Apple and AT&T of being in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act , the California Business and Professions Code , The Cartwright Act , The Magnuson - Moss Warranty Act .
The Federal Trade Commission Act , The Communications Act of 1934 , and The Telecommunications Act of 1996 .
Now , to the meat of the manner : money ( that 's what I want ! ) .
The suit says that the plaintiffs and the class have been injured in their business and property and are entitled to direct and consequential damages of " no less than $ 200 million , " as well as punitive damages of " no less than $ 600 million . "
The plaintiffs also call for an accounting of all " improper earnings " by Apple and AT&T , an injunction prohibiting all of the aforementioned conduct , attorneys ' fees ( including interest ) , and for anything else that the court deems appropriate .
It 's a bit early to say whether this complaint will stand up in court , but it could prove to be a major irritant to Apple and AT&T if it is certified as a class action .
The lawsuit certainly covers a number of points about Apple 's and AT&T 's actions that have ruffled more than a few feathers .
It appears as if the crux of Rivello and Holman 's argument centers around the companies ' intent when it comes to bricking the iPhones and then voiding warranties .
The plaintiffs and the class may end up having to prove somehow that Apple intentionally wrote its 1.1.1 firmware to render unlocked and hacked iPhones inoperable .

The number of users browsing the Web from a mobile device continues to rise , yet most mobile websites are still sub-par .
The thing is , creating a great web experience for users of mobile devices is much easier than you might think .
In this article I ’ll introduce seven fundamental steps that , if followed , will help you avoid the pitfalls that have caused many other mobile sites to fail .
By the end of this article you ’ll know exactly where to focus your efforts in order to build a successful mobile site .
1. Do n’t Mix Up Your Markup
A few different types of markup are available for building a mobile website .
You ’ll need to choose one that suits the needs of your customers and stick with it .
WML
In the early days of mobile web devices , the only way to surf the mobile web was to browse WAP ( Wireless Application Protocol ) sites .
A WAP site uses WML ( Wireless Markup Language ) as its primary markup language .
WML is an XML markup language based on the card - and - deck metaphor .
Luckily for us , WML has since been superseded by several other technologies — in fact , if you ’re just getting into the mobile web game , you can probably ignore WML entirely .
WML is mostly used by legacy systems or by sites that explicitly target customers with low - end phones that are six years old or older .
One potential group of customers still using WML browsers , however , is those in developing nations .
The Nokia 1100 and 1101 , for example , are extremely basic , extremely cheap phones , of which an estimated 200 million units have been solid worldwide , making this phone the best - selling model to date , worldwide .
If your site is targeted to this market segment , WML might be the best solution for you .
XHTML
For most sites , we can ignore WML and make use of a markup language with which you ’re probably much more familiar — XHTML .
Most built - in phone browsers these days can handle XHTML just fine .
A mobile phone recognizes two flavors of HTML :
XHTML — the same , basic XHTML rendered by desktop web browsers XHTML - MP — the MP here stands for Mobile Profile
The difference between these two languages is that XHTML - MP consists of slightly fewer elements and tighter restrictions .
These differences exist to make it easier for the mobile device to parse and render a web document , but writing XHTML - MP markup should n’t introduce any significant changes to your process for writing regular XHTML .
Anecdotally , when my team and I develop mobile websites we usually use regular XHTML , and this approach has served us just fine .
2. Know Your Phones
As plasma and HD TVs slowly hit the market , broadcasters have run into the problem of where to place their logo and news tickers .
Previously , they knew that all TVs were the same 3 × 2 dimensions , so they knew the relative width of the screen .
Now , they ’re beginning to feel the pain of dealing with a wide assortment of TV resolutions and dimensions — an issue that web developers deal with on a daily basis .
Of course , the mobile world is even worse !
Not only must we cater for different screen sizes and resolutions , but also different shapes , as Figure 1 illustrates .
From rectangles that are short and long , to those that are tall and skinny , to perfect squares , the mobile world contains a rich tapestry of variation that almost makes you want to pull your hair out !
If you consider the most common phones available , they can be categorized on the basis of screen size — give or take a few pixels :
128 x 160 pixels
176 x 220 pixels
240 x 320 pixels
320 x 480 pixels
Knowing these screen dimensions helps you optimize some of your content , however it ’s best to keep the shape and style of your site as minimal and linear as possible .
There is no mouse on a mobile phone — only an up - down feature — so you ca n’t demand that users jump around the page .
i Phone / Internet - tablet versus old green - screen phones
There are a couple of exceptions to the norm in the mobile phone market .
They are the really high - end devices like the iPhone or the Nokia Internet Tablet , and the very basic , old “ green - screen ” monochrome dot matrix devices such as the Nokia 3310 , both of which are shown in Figure 3 .
Low - end mobile phones have several limitations , including screen resolution and a severely limited ability to render XHTML documents .
As I mentioned in the previous section , if a majority of your customers fall in this group , then maybe WML is still for you .
At the other end of the spectrum , high - end devices often have the ability to run a web browser that ’s comparable to one you might use on a desktop machine .
Delivering a quality user experience to these devices can be tricky — while the device may be perfectly capable of rendering a full , traditional web page design , it ’s probably transmitting data over a cellular network , which is much slower than standard broadband Internet speeds .
So even though the device can handle a normal website , the customer ’s situation and the reason why they ’re requesting your services may mean that sending them the normal version of your website is n’t the best solution .
We ’ll see in the next section what this means for the design of your mobile site .
3. Target the Right Customers
The goal for any website should be to know your customers in order to deliver to them the most appropriate content .
This goal is even more important with mobile sites — not only do you need to know your customers , but you need to know what they are likely to be doing on your mobile site , as well as where they ’ll be when they ’re doing it .
Traditional website customers are most likely sitting at a desk facing a large monitor that has a decent resolution .
Visitors who are browsing your mobile site are unlikely to be in the same circumstances — they might be waiting in line , riding on the train or the bus , running to the departure gate , or lost in an unfamiliar town late at night and trying to get somewhere .
Google is one company that has invested considerable effort into streamlining its web applications to suit mobile users .
The web developers at Google have identified and focused on three main groups , and they attempt to target their applications to those customers ’ needs .
These are three solid categories , and are worth examining for your own mobile site .
Let ’s look at them now .

Rep .
Don
Young is looking at a world of trouble right now .
He is accused of illegally adding a $ 10 million dollar earmark to a 2005 transportation bill after it had been signed off on by the House and Senate .
And that has made Sen. Barbara Boxer , chair of the Senate Ethics Committee , fighting mad .
Howie has more :
Barbara Boxer chairs the Senate Select Committee on Ethics , which is a pathetic joke .
David " Diapers " Vitter ?
Nothing , although he publicly admitted breaking the law .
Ted Stevens ?
Nothing , although the FBI and several other agencies have been searching his home in conjunction to a widespread corruption conspiracy that has tainted most of the Alaska GOP ( including his son Ben ) .
Pete Domenici ?
Nothing , even though he used his position as a senator to threaten a U.S. Attorney and attempted to force him to take on a punitive political role and , failing that , conspired with Heather Wilson , Alberto Gonzales , Karl Rove and others to fire the upright Justice Department official .
Larry Craig ?
Next to nothing , although he actually pleaded guilty to a crime .
The Senate certainly takes care of its own ; and really well .
Remember all those senators who were taking bribes from Jack Abramoff ?
Well Abramoff is in prison .
Not one senator has even been admonished .
That is n't to say Boxer does n't do anything regarding ethics .
In fact , right now she 's trying to figure out how to go after Alaska 's arch - criminal Don Young on ethics charges .
No , I do n't mean arch - criminal , Senator Ted Stevens ; I mean Congressman Don Young .
She 's promises to figure out a way of making this constitutional -- she 'll fail -- since the House takes care of its own ethical lapses ( or does n't ) and the Senate ... well the Senate is supposed to watch its own 100 miscreants .
Rogue archivist Carl Malamud writes ,
John Wonderlich of the Sunlight Foundation alerted me to a situation about a month ago that we 've been pursuing ( with EFF 's help ) at the Government Accountability Office , which is an arm of the U.S. Congress .
The law librarians at GAO have compiled complete federal legislative histories from 1915 on .
These are the definitive dossiers that track a bill through the hearing process and into law .
If you want to divine the intent of Congress , this is where you go .
GAO cut a contract with Thomson
West to have these documents scanned .
Thomson
West claims they have exclusive access to these public documents and even go so far as to boast that you should purchase this exclusive " product " from West because the GAO law librarians ( public employees ! ) have done all the work for you !
If you 're interesting in tracking this issue , I 've created a Scribd group that has all the documents we 've obtained so far .
Next step : we asked for a copy of every document scanned under the FOIA laws !
On the Heresy Corner blog , The Heresiarch has been writing about the recent news of twins who were adopted separately at birth and got married without knowing they were siblings .
He makes a good cases that it 's BS .
He also links to Jon Henley 's column in The Guardian :
Assuming your brain is still functioning like the well - oiled piece of precision engineering it is , your response would , I trust , be : " That 's a wind - up if ever I heard one .
Think about it for a minute – you mean these two meet by accident , discover not only that they were both adopted but were born on exactly the same day in exactly the same town , and still never pause to wonder whether they might be related ?
Pull the other one .
What did it say on their birth certificates ? "

At this moment , WhatsApp has over 1.2 billion monthly active users , which makes it one of the most popular mobile messaging applications out there .
However , in order to keep the application in the top most used ones , the developers need to continuously work on it in order to fix issues and to bring new features .
Today we will talk about the new WhatsApp 2.17.178 BETA that has just been released for devices running on Android OS .
First of all , we have to mention that the installation file of the latest WhatsApp BETA version for Android device has a size of 34.03 , which means that it is only 0.01 MB larger than the installation file of the WhatsApp 2.17.177 APK .
That being said , we can clearly say that the developers have not brought any new features or options to the application .
Instead , the developers have optimized the application and it seems that it is way more stable than before .
The bad news is that the developers have not confirmed yet that they are working on the “ Video Conference ” feature .
According to rumors , the “ Video Conference ” feature will allow you to make video calls with two or more users at the same time on WhatsApp .
We remind you that the latest feature that was added to the WhatsApp is allowing you to pin up to three chats ( groups or single chats ) in order to easily have access to them .

A new federal study from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ( part of the US Dept. of Health and Human services ) just confirmed that states with the highest levels of self - reported drinking and driving also have the safest highways .
The State of Wisconsin was the overall winner with more than 25 percent of its drivers reporting that in the previous year they had drank an alcoholic beverage before ( or perhaps while ) driving .
This was more than twice the national rate !
Clearly , this is compelling evidence that action is needed , but not in Wisconsin .
The “ facts ” from this federally sponsored survey , when correlated with federally produced highway safety data , suggest that many more states should follow Wisconsin ’s lead and increase their percentages of drinking drivers .
According to the most recently published federal data Wisconsin ’s highway fatality rate ( fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled ) is significantly lower than the national average ( 1.22 vs. 1.41 in 2006 ) .
The same widely published press release pointed out that Utah with its anti-alcohol Mormon population had the lowest percentage of self - confessed drinking drivers .
In the interest of full disclosure it should be pointed out that the highway fatality rate in Utah is lower than is Wisconsin ’s , but not nearly as low as Minnesota ’s , another drinking and driving haven .
Could it be that those Lutherans that charm Garrison Keiler are just better drivers than the Mormons ?
OK , enough satire .
This so - called survey is a glaring example of government propaganda , sloppy and lazy reporting , and misinformation on a grand scale .
Let ’s try a little dose of reality :
First , over a year ’s time the percentage of Wisconsin drivers that drink and drive , at least once , is nowhere near 25 percent .
The real percentage has to be at least 50 percent and probably nearer 75 percent .
A drink with dinner , a wedding reception , holiday gatherings , church picnics , softball leagues , retirement functions , euchre tournaments , bowling , community festivals , and a myriad of other occasions may involve having a drink , or more , and driving home .
And , contrary to the characterizations blathered in the mindless media revelations , these are not automatically episodes of “ drunk driving . ”
There is no doubt that the ethnic make - up of Wisconsin and its neighboring states encourages and condones the consumption of beverages containing alcohol .
That ’s one of the reasons Wisconsin residents “ self report ” drinking and driving at higher percentages than other states .
However , they are not immune to the neo- prohibitionist jihad and therefore they are not as candid as they might or could be .
The under - reporting in other states is undoubtedly equal to or greater than that in Wisconsin .
Here ’s what you can take away from this federal “ survey ” and its subsequent circulation :
Most self - reported behavior is disingenuous .
Drinking and driving are NOT synonymous with drunk driving .
Moderate drinking and driving are not synonymous with high accident or fatality rates .
And , all governments produce self - serving propaganda , and an unthinking press prints and circulates that propaganda .
End of story .

Hillary Clinton was the only Democrat running for President to vote with Bush on labeling the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organisation .
Having followed Bush 's lead on Iraq , it defies belief that she would vote to give him the same authority to attack another country on no serious evidence .
At ' The Daily Banter ' we only promote serious writers and journalists , and Paul Jay from ' The Real News Network ' is one of them .
Here he is , asking exactly why Clinton has made another serious blunder :
Energy consumption grows more and more concern , and with the popularity of Mr. Gore ’s An Inconvenient Truth , just about everyone is at the very least , semi-aware of energy consumption .
These 21 visualizations and designs were created to increase that awareness , so that maybe , a few more people will turn off the light when they leave a room .
I think Peter Crabb said it best ( which I borrowed from Tiffany Holmes ’ ecoviz paper ) :
[ P] eople do not use energy ; they use devices and products .
How devices and products are designed determines how we use them , which in turn determines rates of energy depletion .
Here they are – 21 dashboards , ambient devices , games , and calculators .
Environmental Dashboards
The growing availability of energy data has lent itself nicely to dashboards that let viewers keep track of how much energy is consumed at any given time .
They are perpetuated by the idea of living buildings and devices .

Rumsfeld ex-aide calls Iraq war ' major debacle ' whose outcome is ' in doubt '
RAW STORY
Published : Friday April 18 , 2008

Print This Email This Former senior aide to Rumsfeld delivers scathing indictment A 48 - page report written by a former aide to Donald Rumsfeld and issued by the Pentagon 's premier military educational institute has called the Iraq war a " major debacle " whose outcome is " in doubt . "
" Measured in blood and treasure , the war in Iraq has achieved the status of a major war and a major debacle , " the report 's opening line reads .
" As of fall 2007 , this conflict has cost the United States over 3,800 dead and over 28,000 wounded .
Allied casualties accounted for another 300 dead . "
Published by the National Defense Institute 's National Institute for Strategic Studies , a Defense Department research center , the report does not reflect the official views of the Pentagon or the Defense Department .
But it delivers a scathing indictment from the key educational arm of the US Armed Forces .
The report was written by Joseph Collins , a retired colonel and former senior adviser to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz .
It 's importance cannot be overstated , because it is based in part on interviews on former senior defense and intelligence officials who spoke candidly and played roles in preparations for war .
" Despite impressive progress in security , the outcome of the war is in doubt , " Collins writes .
" Strong majorities of both Iraqis and Americans favor some sort of U.S. withdrawal .
Intelligence analysts , however , remind us that the only thing worse than an Iraq with an American army may be an Iraq after a rapid withdrawal of that army . "
You can view the original report in PDF here .
The report released Thursday was barely mentioned by newspapers or media outlets , according to a search at this writing in Google News .
It received the heaviest treatment by Jonathan Landay and John Walcott of McClatchy Newspapers .
Collins writes : Iraqi civilian deaths mostly at the hands of other Iraqismay number as high as 82,000 .
Over 7,500 Iraqi soldiers and police officers have also been killed .
Fifteen percent of the Iraqi population has become refugees or displaced persons .
The Congressional Research Service estimates that the United States now spends over $ 10 billion per month on the war , and that the total , direct U.S. costs from March 2003 to July 2007 have exceeded $ 450 billion , all of which has been covered by deficit spending .
1
No one as yet has calculated the costs of long - term veterans ' benefits or the total impact on Service personnel and materiel .
The war 's political impact also has been great .
Globally , U.S. standing among friends and allies has fallen .
2
Our status as a moral leader has been damaged by the war , the subsequent occupation of a Muslim nation , and various issues concerning the treatment of detainees .
At the same time , operations in Iraq have had a negative impact on all other efforts in the war on terror , which must bow to the priority of Iraq when it comes to manpower , materiel , and the attention of decisionmakers .
Our Armed Forces especially the Army and Marine Corps have been severely strained by the war in Iraq .
Compounding all of these problems , our efforts there were designed to enhance U.S. national security , but they have become , at least temporarily , an incubator for terrorism and have emboldened Iran to expand its influence throughout the Middle East .
Excerpts Additional excerpts , as highlighted by Landay and Walcott : Operations in Iraq have diverted " manpower , materiel and the attention of decision - makers " from " all other efforts in the war on terror " and severely strained the U.S. armed forces .
" Compounding all of these problems , our efforts there ( in Iraq ) were designed to enhance U.S. national security , but they have become , at least temporarily , an incubator for terrorism and have emboldened Iran to expand its influence throughout the Middle East . "
" Despite impressive progress in security , the outcome of the war is in doubt .
Strong majorities of both Iraqis and Americans favor some sort of U.S. withdrawal .
Intelligence analysts , however , remind us that the only thing worse than an Iraq with an American army may be an Iraq after a rapid withdrawal of that army . "
" For many analysts ( including this one ) , Iraq remains a ' must win , ' but for many others , despite obvious progress under General David Petraeus and the surge , it now looks like a ' ca n't win . ' "
" ... the aggressive , hands - on Rumsfeld cajoled and pushed his way toward a small force and a lightning fast operation . "
Later , he shut down the military 's computerized deployment system , " questioning , delaying or deleting units on the numerous deployment orders that came across his desk . "
In part because " long , costly , manpower - intensive post - combat operations were anathema to Rumsfeld , " the report says , the U.S. was unprepared to fight what Collins calls " War B , " the battle against insurgents and sectarian violence that began in mid-2003 , shortly after " War A , " the fight against Saddam Hussein 's forces , ended .
The report also singles out the Bush administration 's national security apparatus and implicitly President Bush and both of his national security advisers , Condoleezza Rice and Stephen Hadley , saying that " senior national security officials exhibited in many instances an imperious attitude , exerting power and pressure where diplomacy and bargaining might have had a better effect . "
The report ends by quoting Winston Churchill : " Let us learn our lessons .
Never , never believe any war will be smooth and easy , or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter .
...
Always remember , however sure you are that you can easily win , that there would not be a war if the other man did not think that he also had a chance . "

" I spotted my first air disaster simulator on the tarmac at JFK , " Mosse wrote .
" You can see it yourself next time you fly into that airport .
It 's an intimidating black oblong structure situated dangerously close to one of the runways .
Ever since , I have hunted for air trainers while taxi-ing across each new airport that I 've had the chance to fly into . "

When I asked him about the actual photographic process – setting himself up near burning , abstract airplanes in order to get the right shot – Mosse replied : " They are extremely difficult to photograph .
First the water jets are turned on to douse the fuselage in water .
This is in order to stop the metal warping under the intense heat of the flames .
Then a pilot light comes on – and the spectacle begins . "

" But before you 've had a chance to cock your shutter and take the photo , " Mosse continued , " it is all finished . "
The firemen have put out the fire in seconds .
That 's their job , after all .
They do this with decisive brevity and great courage , sometimes walking right into flames – but it does n't make for an easy photograph .
It 's all a bit like the sexual act : the flames come up and men run in and spray everything with a high power water hose and then it 's all over .
But that act entails artistry and technique ...

And each airport is different : " The fire crew at each airport is always fiercely proud of their rig , " Mosse writes .
One crew invited their family along and held a barbeque to watch the training unfold over the course of an evening .
Another crew actually let me use their cherry picker bucket to get my camera into position .
At one airport , I was even fully equipped to let me work as close as possible to the flames .
During one shoot , a Royal Brunei jumbo hit a piece of debris upon take off and the entire crew were mobilized to battle stations .
For security reasons , I hid in a small shed while they dealt with the emergency , which they resolved without incident .
But that 's why these structures are built : to keep the crew fire fit at all times , always willing to jump into the flames .
It 's a kind of anthropological micro-culture of the air disaster simulation crew , eating barbecued chicken and running through flames .

In any case , I asked Mosse what the general idea behind this project was , and he explained that , in all his work , he 's been trying to show " the ways in which we perceive and consume catastrophe . "
The actual disaster is a moment of contingency and confusion .
It 's all over in milliseconds .
It 's hidden in a thick cloud of black smoke and you cannot even see it .
Battles , ambushes , hijackings , air strikes , terrorism : it 's the same with all of these , too .
But the catastrophe lives on before the fact and after the fact , as this spectacle .
That 's why I wanted to photograph the air disaster simulators ; they are the air disaster more than the thing itself .
We have built in our airports these enormous , absurd , phallic structures with kerosene jets and water sprinklers .
They are monuments to our own fear , made within the pared down , hyper - functional , green and black and grey symbolic order of militarized space .
Mosse has also photographed real plane crash sites :
As for the actual plane crashes , these are also difficult to photograph .
You must be prepared to travel immediately in order to photograph one , and you do n't know if you will even be able to get a photograph of it when you get there .
For very good reasons , press photographers are always corralled into a pen at a great distance from the disaster .
Most photographers take out their longest lens and zoom right in – but I do n't have a zoom lens .
I shoot with a wooden field camera , and so I am forced to shoot the disaster in its context , as a landscape photograph .
The results end up looking like something approaching early war photography from the 19th century ( Roger Fenton , Matthew Brady , Timothy O'Sullivan , etc. ) .

Love in The Time of Poverty Left Party Demands Free Contraception for the Poor

Now , they 're claiming it 's putting a dent in the love life of the German poor -- and are demanding free birth control for the needy .

Last year , decades after dumping 20 million gallons of the toxic chemical Agent Orange all across the Vietnamese landscape , the US pledged to contribute $ 400,000 USD to partially fund a new study on the topic .
What a relief !
I ’m sure that uncertainty regarding the outcome of this study is the only thing preventing the US from offering substantial assistance to people like May and Song , the articulate but impoverished parents of four disabled children , each conceived in the years following their father ’s sojourn in an area which earlier had been heavily doused with Agent Orange .
Finally , almost forty years after another young man emerged from a defoliated jungle with a bizarre skin condition to father a son with strange , canoe - shaped feet before he , himself , succumbed to cancer , the US will know what should be done to make amends .
Sixteen years after that man ’s son produced a daughter of his own , afflicted with the same canoe - shaped feet , the wealthiest and most powerful nation in the world is finally getting down to the business of deciding whether or not it might have an obligation to help families like these .
I have to wonder how the results of that million dollar study will ultimately benefit the generations of individuals and families afflicted with birth defects and early cancer deaths , who live in the poverty that still lingers following decades of US - imposed embargo , superimposed upon years and years of war .
Will the proposed $ 14 million project to isolate a patch of dioxin - soaked ground at the Da Nang airport bring them any solace ?
I ’ve been tagging along recently with a group of American college students affiliated with the SUNY Brockport Vietnam Program as they make their Thursday morning home - visits to families of disabled children here in Da Nang .
The students are studying to be social workers , so they do what they ’ve been trained to do : they sit down with families and ask them questions .
Then they listen .
Two weeks ago , we sat and listened to the diminutive mother of the canoe - footed girl tell us how sad she was that her daughter , a serious and dedicated student , could not attend high - school .
The school , she said , was too far to walk to , and the mother was not able to balance her daughter safely on the back of her bicycle in order to take her there .
( Her daughter ’s canoe - shaped feet not only prevented her from walking without wooden crutches , but also made it impossible for her to pedal a bicycle herself . )
A kind friend who lived next to the school , she said , had offered to let the daughter stay with her so that she could more easily attend school but , alas , that was impossible .
“ Why is that ? ” asked a student .
“ Because , ” confided the mother , “ my daughter cannot stand without her crutches and so cannot shower and attend to her ‘ personal hygiene ’ without my help . ”
Being the only physical therapist in the room , it fell to me to suggest that , perhaps , the girl might sit down on a plastic chair when she showered and that , if a hole were cut in the seat of the chair , it might allow her to attend to her own hygiene when she used a typical “ hole - in - the - floor ” Vietnamese toilet .
The mother ’s jaw dropped and the father beamed .
As we departed , they each pumped my hand vigorously , smiling broadly .
What had happened ?
Somebody sat down and listened to their story and made a simple suggestion .
And , because of that , a sixteen - year old , third - generation victim of Agent Orange might go to high school .
We did n’t need a million dollar study .
All it took was a few American college students and one middle - aged American PT , listening to one family ’s story .
Why is that so damned difficult ?
We did n’t even have to buy the plastic chair .
President 's brother flaks for Moon organization in Latin America while his curriculum on wheels is being investigated by the Education Department 's inspector general
Over the past several years , Neil Bush , the younger brother of President George W. Bush and the son of former President George H.W. Bush , has made several international trips of behalf of the Reverend Sun Myung Moon ’s assorted enterprises .
In late February , Bush called on Paraguay ’s president while in the country as a guest of a business federation founded by the Rev. Moon .
A source in the Paraguayan president ’s office , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , confirmed that Neil had met with President Nicanor Duarte “ along with a delegation from the Universal Peace Federation , ” a group associated with Moon .
According to its website , the UPF “ is a global alliance of individuals and organizations dedicated to building a world of peace , a world in which everyone can live in freedom , harmony , cooperation , and co-prosperity for all . ”
Meanwhile , back home , late last year , a number of news reports confirmed that the U.S. Department of Education ’s Inspector General was looking into “ allegations that federal money is being spent inappropriately on technology sold to schools ” by Ignite !
Learning , a company founded by Neil Bush .
Bush urges conference attendees to be ‘ transformers of their societies ’
In a statement issued on February 27 , headlined “ Call for Increased Collaboration in Paraguay , ” Dr. Thomas G. Walsh , the Secretary General of UPF , said that Bush called on people to become “ transformers of their societies ” during a speech at an International Leadership Conference entitled “ Toward a New Paradigm of Leadership and Government in Times of World Crisis , ” held in late February at the Excelsior Hotel in Asuncion , Paraguay .
According to Walsh , Bush “ spoke of a `culture of service ’ and a vision of uniting individuals and organizations to promote peace and the common good , calling service `an essential component of any complete life . ' ”
The conference , following on the heels of one in January in Uruguay , “ featured presentations from UPF ’s peacebuilding curriculum , ” Dr. Walsh ’s statement read .
Topics included God ’s Ideal for Peace , presented by Thomas Field , director of UPI for Latin America ; Spirituality and Leadership by Jorge Guidenzoph , President of the Uruguayan National Conference on Leadership ; the Cause and Origin of Conflicts , by Ricardo de Sena , Director of UPF ’s Office of UN Relations ; the Principles of Reconciliation , by Dr. Antonio Betancourt , director of UPF ’s Office of Government Relations ; and Character Education , by Lic. Jesus Gonzalez , President of the International Educational Foundation .
A photo worth …

One veteran Moon watcher filled in the blanks for Talk2Action :
From left to right , the first person is Dr. Thomas G. Walsh , the Secretary General of UPF ; Second from the left is Antonio Betancourt , a “ long time Moon follower ” who currently is the Director of Government Relations of UPF International and “ Character Education , ” and who was a major player in “ what was formerly called the Summit Council for World Peace or Summit Council , … a group active in Moon ’s effort to unite North and South Korea , to save the ‘ Fatherland ’ and to form Moon ’s sovereign nation ” ;
Third from the left is Chang Shik Yang , the Continental Director of the Unification Church now called the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification ( FFWPU ) .
Yang “ played a lead role in the development of Moon ’s black minister snagging unit , the American Clergy Leadership Conference ( ACLC ) , and also is Moon ’s top man in the Middle East . ”
Fourth is Neil Bush ;
On the far right is Larry Moffitt who is the Vice President of editorial operations for United Press International ( UPI ) , a news service owned and operated by Rev. Moon .
The ‘ greatest weirdest Bush Conspiracy ’
Neil Bush ’s trip to Paraguay is all the more interesting when considered against the backdrop of what columnist Ken Layne called the “ greatest weirdest Bush Conspiracy . ”
In a recent piece headlined “ The Bushes and the Moons , ” Layne wrote :
The story goes like this : George W. Bush and / or George H.W. Bush bought hundreds of thousands of acres in Paraguay , adjoining a similar spread owned by the Unification Church ’s Rev. Sun Myung Moon .
Both massive parcels are hidden within a remote South American wilderness atop the world ’s biggest freshwater aquifer adjoining a secret U.S. military airbase .
Oh , and there ’s a special non-extradition law to protect the Bush / Moon families as they enjoy their old age and run drug / weapons smuggling rings , safe from American justice .
And they ’ll own all the drinking water in the world , or something .
Travels with Moon
Two years ago , Neil Bush , along with Rev. Moon , visited the Philippines and Taiwan .
While in the Manila , Bush was present for the inaugural convocation of the Universal Peace Federation ( UPF ) , and he joined Moon in meeting with Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo .
The Manila Bulletin reported : “ Together with peace leaders that included Neil Bush … Moon arrived yesterday as part of a 100 - day tour that is taking him to 100 cities and 67 nations and covering a journey of almost 100,000 miles . ”
Ignite ’s COW
At home , Neil Bush is best known for his 1980s involvement in the Silverado Savings and Loan debacle , which cost taxpayers more than $ 1 billion ; the lurid details of a messy divorce from Sharon Bush , his wife of 23 years ; and his mother Barbara Bush ’s shameless demand that her contribution to a Hurricane Katrina relief foundation , working with those who had to be relocated to Texas , be used by local schools to acquire Ignite !
products .
Ignite sells what it calls a “ Curriculum on Wheels ( COW ) , ” a cart - mounted video projector and hard drive loaded with video content to help teach math , social studies , and science , which costs about $ 3,800 , not including yearly costs for licensing the content , eSchool News pointed out .
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) , a Washington , D.C. - based watchdog group , had called for the inquiry .
According to eSchool News , “ CREW contends school districts are using federal dollars inappropriately to purchase technology from ” Bush ’s Austin , Texas - based company .
CREW also claimed that “ there is no proof the company ’s products are effective and claim [ed ] that schools in at least three states are using the products mainly as a result of political considerations . ”
Ignite !
Learning ’s president , Ken Leonard , issued a statement denying the group ’s allegations :
“ While Ignite !
Learning welcomes accountability for ensuring that public school expenditures are in compliance with appropriation guidelines , Ignite !
Learning has no knowledge of any customer that has procured our curriculum solutions through means which are other than completely ethical .
According to a CREW press release , “ Ignite also has a program called Adopt - a - Cow in which corporations buy the equipment and donate it to schools or to charities supporting school districts .
An Ignite spokesman said seven Cows were donated last year to the Fund for Public Schools in New York City . ”
CREW also “ obtained documents through a Freedom of Information Act request showing that the Katy Independent School District west of Houston used $ 250,000 in state and federal Hurricane Katrina relief money last year to buy the Curriculum on Wheels . ”
Baitullah Mehsud has an aversion to publicity and photographs A top Taleban commander in Pakistan has ordered his followers to stop all attacks in the country .
Baitullah Mehsud is the man the Pakistani authorities say ordered the killing of Benazir Bhutto .
Pamphlets containing his order appeared in tribal areas along the Afghan border .
Mehsud said anyone found violating the order would be punished .
Pakistan 's new government has said it will deal with Islamic militancy through dialogue and development .
On Monday night the authorities set free Maulana Sufi Mohammad , the founder of an outlawed Islamist group that has fought in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
He was released under an agreement to renounce violence and help restore peace in the north - west valley of Swat .
The release has been welcomed by Pakistani Taleban .
' Firm order ' Baitullah Mehsud 's stronghold is in South Waziristan , an area that has seen many of the heaviest clashes between militants and the security forces in recent years .
" All members of Tehrik - e - Taleban ( Movement of Taleban ) are ordered by Baitullah Mehsud that a ban is imposed on provocative activities for the sake of peace , " according to a leaflet distributed in the South Waziristan region .
Anyone who defied the order would be punished publicly , the leaflet read .
" No arguments will be accepted .
It 's a firm order , " it said .
A spokesman for Baitullah Mehsud , Maulvi Omar , told Pakistan 's Dawn News channel that the Taleban had lately been in touch with the new government in connection with a possible new peace deal .
He said Maulana Sufi Mohammad 's release was part of that deal .
The BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad says reports now suggest that the authorities are close to a deal with Baitullah Mehsud 's tribe .
The reports say the deal calls for an end to militancy , an exchange of prisoners , and an army withdrawal from the area .
It also requires the Mehsud tribes to expel foreign fighters from their territory .
American officials cautiously support the new government 's efforts to reach peace through talks .
But they admit they are concerned and say there is a problem enforcing such agreements .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The idea of a deal followed by execution of development plans and promotion of education is the way to go against this menace

Our correspondent says that previous such deals have turned the tribal areas into a sanctuary for Taleban and al - Qaeda linked militants from where they have launched attacks on Nato troops in Afghanistan .
They also began hitting Pakistani targets when the army tried to stop them .
Taleban spokesman Maulvi Omar said Pakistani troops stationed in some areas of South Waziristan on Afghan border had already started withdrawing to pave the way for the peace deal .
Pakistan army spokesman , Maj - Gen Athar Abbas , however said " so far we have not received any orders from the government ( to pull out the troops ) " .
Baitullah Mehsud is said to command about 20,000 pro-Taleban militants and a majority of them belong to the Mehsud tribe .
The previous government , that supported President Musharraf , said it had evidence from phone intercepts that Mehsud had organised the killing of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in Rawalpindi in December .
He denies the charge .

What are these ?
general and Windows in particular gets a lot of grief for being evil or stupid or may evil - stupid or whatever .
Some of the criticism is surely warranted , but a lot is n't .
But hey , everyone likes to pick on the 800 pound gorilla .
Just when I start to think a bit more positively of Microsoft , I find out about their amazingly bone - headed WiFi design .
This article points out just about the craziest thing I have seen about Microsoft Windows .
I know that Microsoft inRead the linked article if you 're really interested in the details , but basically Windows XP and friends areto pretend to be certain kinds of WiFi networks that you might have connected to in the past ( a so - called AdHoc or peer - to - peer WiFi network ) .
AdHoc networks are n't that common , but the point is that if youtried to connect to one with your WinXP laptop , later on it will broadcast to the world that it is that network .
Then other laptops will see that network , and some will try to connect , and they are then " infected " with this broadcasting " virus . "
It 's not a traditional computer virus of course , just a set of behaviors that spread virally .
The most widely spread early names will continue to spread even more because of the nature of this system .
Ever see a network called " Free Public WiFi " but when you connect , it did n't work ?
Congratulations , you are now part of the problem .... This is n't a bug -- it was designed to work that way .
Now folks with WiFi enabled laptops -- nearly everyone -- try to connect to " Free Public WiFi " and it does n't work .
They are not only spreading the behavior virus , but are convincing themselves and others that public WiFi must be rife with evil people setting up nasty WiFi access points to infect computers with avirus , and they have just been duped .
They tell others " do n't connect to open public WiFi networks . "
Fear of public WiFi spreads , and so it becomes less used and hence less valued and so less valuable , and then goes away .
A single figure graces the pages of Charles Darwin 's groundbreaking work On the Origin of Species , first published in 1859 .
The figure in question depicts a tree - like sequence of branchings through time as hypothetical lineages diverge and new species arise .
To be sure , the metaphor of a tree was important in Darwin 's thinking about the history of life .
He wrote in the Origin ,
As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds , and these , if vigorous , branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch , so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life , which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth , and covers the surface with its ever - branching and beautiful ramifications .
The tree diagram in On the Origin of Species
Evolutionary biology has changed considerably over the past 150 years , but the concept of a tree of life remains central .
An entire field , phylogenetics ( Gr. phyle , tribe + genesis , birth ) , has arisen whose focus is on hypothesizing evolutionary relationships as reflected by branching tree diagrams .
The resulting phylogenetic trees , as Baum et al. ( 2005 ) recently noted , " are the most direct representation of the principle of common ancestry — the very core of evolutionary theory — and thus they must find a more prominent place in the general public ’s understanding of evolution . ”
Unfortunately , when it comes to interpreting evolutionary trees and the relationships that they represent , misconceptions are widespread .
This post marks the first in a series on evolutionary trees and the information that they do and do not convey , presented in honor of Darwin Day 2008 .
These are adapted from a forthcoming article in Evolution : Education and Outreach that is now available free of charge in preprint form .
Let us begin with a simple tree depicting hypothesized ( and well supported ) relationships among major groups of vertebrate animals .
In this figure , time extends from bottom to top , with the base of the tree representing a time in the distant past and the " tips " ( called " terminal nodes " ) occupied by contemporary species .
Each point at which two branches converge ( called " internal nodes " ) reflects a common ancestor shared by two lineages .
Thus , the lineage represented by cats and the one of which humans represent the terminal node are joined by a common ancestor some time in the past ( i.e. , an extinct ancestral mammal ) .
Lizards and birds also share a common ancestor ( i.e. , an extinct ancestral reptile ) , and this lineage joins with the mammalian lineage at an even deeper node representing an ancestor that was shared by all of these amniote lineages .
The amniote lineage shares an ancestor with the lineage represented by frogs at a still deeper node , and at the base of this tree ( i.e. , the deepest internal node , or the " root " ) is an ancestor shared by all of these vertebrate lineages .
The question is this .
In your reading of this tree , which group is the most closely related to fishes : frogs , lizards , birds , cats , or humans ?
As Baum et al. ( 2005 ) noted , the intuitive response provided by most people is frogs .
After all , frogs are closest to fishes on this tree , are n't they ?
Consider next the following tree :
In your view , does this tree depict different relationships ?
Does it imply that frogs and humans are closer relatives than are humans and reptiles ?
Is it less accurate than the first diagram ?
As counterintuitive as it may feel , there is absolutely no difference in the information presented in the two figures .
What matters is the order of branching , and in both cases humans share the most recent ancestor with cats , then this mammal lineage shares a more distant ancestor with the lineage represented by reptiles and birds .
These lineages share a common ancestor with the lineage represented by frogs , and then the lineage that now includes all of these tetrapods shares an ancestor with the lineage of which a bony fish is given as a modern representative .
Because they are all descended from the same common ancestor ( an ancestral tetrapod ) , frogs , humans , lizards , and birds are all equally related to fishes .
Think of it this way : you and your sibling are linked through a common ancestor ( your parent ) , and you are both equally related to your cousins ( to whom you are all linked through a shared grandparent ) .
An evolutionary tree is similar in a sense to a baby 's mobile : each node can rotate freely without changing the way that they are joined to one another .
As such , the order of the terminal nodes is meaningless .
One can not read across the tips .
The relationships depicted in a tree are historical , whereas the terminal nodes represent contemporaneous groups .
Whenever you encounter an evolutionary tree , practice rotating a few internal nodes mentally .
This is a simple exercise , but it is a powerful method for avoiding a number of common misunderstandings of evolutionary trees .

" You may not use ... Google 's products , software , services and web sites ... and may not accept the Terms if ... you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Google .
The problem with this , of course , is that all 50 states in the United States require that someone be at least 18 years old to form a binding contract .
As for what happens when a person under 18 attempts to agree to a click - through contract , the jury is still out on that one .
When contacted about the matter , a Google spokesperson initially told me that " users need to be at least 13 years old to use Gmail . "
However , when I pointed out that the language in the company 's terms of service contradicted her statement , she clarified her remarks , stating that : " We require users to be able to form a legally binding contract in order to use our services .
The actual age required to form a legally binding contract may differ based on jurisdiction . "
When I asked what the company would do if it found out that someone under 18 were using search , or Gmail , the spokesperson told me :
" We 're not in a position to verify the age or legal status of any user , given the tremendous number of users accessing Google services .
That said , when we become aware of a user who is violating our Terms of Service , including not being of proper age to accept the Terms of Service , we take appropriate action , which could include the termination of the user 's Google Account . "
After first seeing Google 's no-kids policy in the company 's terms of service , any rational person would assume that it 's just standard legalese that all companies are required to include .
However , it turns out that Google 's dot - com competition is far more kid friendly .
Facebook 's terms of service state :
" This Site is intended solely for users who are thirteen years of age or older , and users of the Site under 18 who are currently in high school or college . "
What about MySpace ?:
" By using the MySpace Services , you represent and warrant that ... you are 14 years of age or older . "
As for Microsoft 's Live.com search engine and Ask.com , their terms of service do n't mention age at all .
To this outside observer , it seems a little bit strange that 13 + year - olds can use social - networking sites like Facebook and MySpace , where many users post their gender , sexuality , religion , and a large number of potentially embarrassing photos .
Yet , those same teenagers are forbidden from conducting a Web search .
Surely things should be the other way around .

Google is currently running a Doodle 4 Google contest , in which K - 12 students take a shot at designing a Google company logo .
The winner will receive $ 10,000 and their art will appear on Google 's home page for a day .
When viewed in light of the " no kids here " policy in the terms of service , Google 's school outreach seems rather strange .
Ironically , the winner of the contest will be forbidden from viewing his or her artwork on the main Google page , unless a parent types in the URL for them .
This is hardly Joe Camel territory , but it is still very strange .
Why has the company gone out of its way to write up a terms of service that bans kids , yet at the same time , is engaged in kid-friendly promotions ?
Why does the site include anti-kid legalese that none of its competitors has opted to include ?
The answer , for now , will remain unknown .
Google 's PR people toe the company line , and its lawyers , well , remain lawyers .

PETER CHAIKO was adopted as a 9 - year - old from an orphanage in Siberia , and when he arrived in Hastings - on - Hudson he was a terror , scratching his teachers and kicking the principal in the leg .
His father , Theodore Chaiko , uses the term “ oppositional ” to describe Peter ’s behavior , but from several vivid accounts , that appears to be a euphemism .
The Hastings schools had the good sense to pair Peter with an upbeat Russian immigrant and tutor , Alexander Davis , who had the good sense to ply him with Russian songs and fairy tales and to notice on nature walks that there were creatures Peter could relate to  animals .
Mr. Davis arranged to have Peter placed in the Green Chimneys School here , a cross between a school , a farm and a zoo .
Besides an Old McDonald menagerie , it has an emu named Nova , two bald eagles , miniature horses , vultures and an Andean condor .
Like Dottie , a rotund Yorkshire pig that had been kept in a Bronx apartment , many animals were rescued from deplorable circumstances or because they had been hurt .
In other words , they have a lot in common with Peter , who wound up in an orphanage because of birth parents who , according to what Peter has confided to his family and school officials , combated the drabness of their lives with vodka and abandoned him to the streets .
Three weeks ago , 50 - year - old Mimi Norris strapped on black steel - toe boots , packed a face mask and a digital camera in her bag , and headed to work .
Her assignment : inspecting a foreclosed home in a blue - collar neighborhood of Akron , Ohio .
From outside , the small white house appeared to be in good condition , but as Ms. Norris unlocked the door , she braced for what might lie inside .
At worst , squatters or drug dealers she'd have to sweet - talk her way around , or mold so thick her throat would close up .
At best , she 'd probably find debris and tattered possessions , a snapshot of despair faced by the vacating homeowners .
Her job would be to capture it all on camera and make repair recommendations to the lender now in possession of the property .
Then the lender might hire her firm to arrange the fixes .
" You do n't know what you 'll find until you step foot inside , " says Ms. Norris whose firm JR Services LLC in Norton , Ohio , services foreclosed houses across Ohio .
As the mortgage - lending crisis spreads , business is booming among small mortgage field - servicing firms such as JR Services , which specialize among other things in " property preservation . "
Driving the trend : the national homeowner - vacancy rate , which measures how many vacant homes are for sale .
That rate rose to 2.8 % in the fourth quarter of 2007 , matching a record set in the first quarter of last year ; by some accounts , it has n't been this high since the Great Depression .
Meantime , U.S. foreclosure filings , a prelude to vacancies , surged 75 % last year to 2.2 million , according to RealtyTrac .
In December alone , there were 215,749 foreclosure filings , almost double from December 2006 .
Across the country , a web of handymen , contractors and inspectors like Ms. Norris are on the front lines of a battle to keep the vacated homes free from burst pipes , vandals , rot and animals until they can be resold -- and to preserve the integrity and living conditions of neighborhoods .
In some cases , these mortgage field servicers work for the lenders who are foreclosing on the house .
In others , they act as vendors to big national middlemen who handle large volumes of foreclosures and then farm out the fix - up work to these smaller regional shops .
While a large proportion of the companies , big and small , are private , some trade groups estimate mortgage servicing to be a $ 1 billion business with 8,000 to 10,000 active companies in operation .
While business has been building for these small companies over a couple of years , the recent surge is producing a share of angst .
Lenders faced with growing housing inventories they need to sell are pushing servicers to handle more houses , faster , piling on the pressure .
" Even the quality control of a good contractor who has been able to handle the volume in the past , he begins to slip and then it snowballs from there , " says Tim Doehner , executive director of National Association Mortgage Field Services Inc. , an industry trade group that includes 400 members .
For her part , Ms. Norris says business has tripled in the last year in terms of foreclosed homes handled .
Her firm is private , but she says revenue was between $ 300,000 and $ 500,000 ; Ohio ranked No. 6 in foreclosures in 2007 .
Likewise , Ginni Benderman of Eagle Inspections in Muskegon , Mich. , a state that was No. 3 in foreclosures with 136,205 filings last year , says business has doubled for her 10 - year - old firm over the last few years .
" Michigan , for lack of better words , has gone to hell in a handbasket , " Ms. Benderman says .
Much of Ms. Benderman 's new business filters down from the bigger national middlemen , which are struggling to keep up with requests .
Revenue has doubled in the last year for Mortgage Contracting Services LLC in Tampa and is expected to double again this year , says CEO Allan Martin .
Meantime , revenue tripled last year to $ 9 million for Houston - based Mercantile Group Ltd. , doing business as Integrated Mortgage Solutions .
The company now services 50 clients -- up from 15 eight months ago -- including lenders and their real - estate agents as well as investors and auction companies dealing in foreclosed homes .
" It 's such a whirlwind , " says IMS President Cheryl Lang .
" Hopefully it will calm down soon . "
The surge of foreclosures is also tempting droves of newbies -- some qualified , some not -- into the mortgage field services industry .
" You have to be very , very leery , " Mr. Doehner says .
" It 's not just a matter of owning a pickup truck and going out and doing the work . "
To that end , in December , Mr. Martin of Mortgage Contracting Services created an internal quality assurance department to try to ensure consistency and regulatory compliance among its some 600 vendors around the nation .
At IMS , before - and - after pictures are now required for all work performed and scrutinized by the company to make sure a job was really completed and that photos of cleanup work are n't fakes taken of other homes and submitted for claims .
" We know that in the middle of Michigan , for instance , there should be no leaves on the trees in the middle of winter , " Ms. Lang says .
It 's a strange and sometimes harsh line of business .
Work often begins when a homeowner is 45 days delinquent on mortgage payment and the lender requests an occupancy inspection .
A simple drive - by can yield clues : no toys in the yard , no car in the driveway , an overgrown lawn , no lights on at night .
If the owner continues not to pay , field - service reps might be asked to contact homeowners and try to resolve the default situation -- known as loss mitigation .
Finally , if a home moves into foreclosure , field - service vendors do everything from help pack up homes for evicted tenants to remove family pets , dead and alive , left behind when owners vacate .
Then the nitty - gritty preservation work to maintain the vacant property begins .
Among the smaller vendors that perform property preservation services , working faster in the middle of winter can be particularly tricky .
Doug Feinholz runs Property Preservation Services Inc. in Denver , where the terrain often impedes the job .
" We have to navigate remote canyons and unpaved roads , " he says .
" Even going up a mountain and hauling landscape equipment requires bigger trucks with more powerful motors , and the lack of oxygen can reduce the equipment 's horsepower . "
Navigating the finances of this industry is n't always simple either .
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development publishes guidelines of reimbursement rates that it will pay lenders for preservation services performed on homes whose mortgages HUD 's Federal Housing Administration unit insures .
Those guidelines are used as an industrywide benchmark .
For instance : $ 40 to secure a door with a new lock and $ 20 to inspect the exterior of a home for occupancy .
For some tasks , rates vary by state : $ 180 to remove a vehicle in Alabama vs. $ 240 in Michigan .
Often , field - service providers say , they must negotiate with lenders for more money .
" If you 're paying $ 40 for a guy in a van to drive 20 miles at $ 3 a gallon for gas and then you give the middleman anywhere from 5 % to 50 % of that for giving you the job , now you basically have a guy changing a lock for nothing , " says Ms. Norris of JR Services .
Then there 's cash flow .
For instance , Ms. Norris typically pays workers right away to change a lock or shovel snow but sometimes her firm is n't reimbursed for 60 to 90 days .
That has meant securing lines of credit to cover the gap .
" Five years ago , we did the majority of the work ourselves , " she says of herself and her business partner .
" Now we 've got 30 contractors working for us . "
The Akron house Ms. Norris inspected three weeks ago , which seemed in decent shape from the outside , turned out to have a hole in the roof , mold , and mushrooms growing out of the carpet where water had seeped in from the ceiling .
Piles of debris and a filthy recliner were left behind .
It took three men in Hazmat suits to complete the cleanup last week , to the tune of $ 4,000 ; Ms. Norris says her firm will see about $ 300 of that .
She 's waiting on approval to complete other repairs , including the roof .
" We are glad to be doing well , but this is sickening , " Ms. Norris says .
" We do n't like to see people lose their homes and there 's just far too much in places like Ohio and Michigan .
It 's deplorable . "

As an uncommonly outspoken business leader who was appointed secretary of the Treasury in 2001 , then forced out in short order after challenging President Bush ’s tax cuts , are you surprised by the recent flurry of depressing financial news ?
Not really .
We ’ve been creating this pass of events for several years .
Do you think it was appropriate for the Federal Reserve to lend a helping hand to Bear Stearns and save a private investment company from its own bad decisions ?
I would say they did n’t save Bear Stearns .
They saved the financial system from a panic collapse .
I reject the notion that they helped Bear Stearns .
Bear Stearns was destroyed .
No it was n’t .
It was purchased by JPMorgan , which will keep it alive .
They ’re going to keep the book alive .
But the institution of Bear Stearns has been destroyed .
They ’ve gone from $ 158 to $ 2 of equity .

Update : I was wrong : it turns out that New Zealand 's anti-circumvention rules are as good as they come — the Kiwis slipped one by old Uncle Sam !
Andrew sez , " Released by the NZPA on Wednesday , 09 April 2008 , this article mentions the passing into law of the Copyright ( New Technologies ) Amendment Bill in New Zealand . "
It does not change the balance between protection and access to copyright material , but makes sure the balance can continue to operate when new technologies are involved .
It introduces an offence , carrying a sentence of a maximum fine of $ 150,000 or up to five years imprisonment , or both , for commercial dealings in devices , services or information designed to circumvent technological protection measures .
" Thanks Uncle Sam . "
Thanks indeed — now New Zealand joins the growing list of nations where it 's illegal to sell digital lockpicks , even if you only use them to get at files you have the rights to , which have been locked up by greedy ( or bankrupt , or uncaring , or sloppy ) software and entertainment companies .

There really is something out there , bending the light from distant galaxies :
Galaxies , and galaxy clusters , appear to be surrounded by clouds of something invisible which interacts gravitationally .
It apparently also causes the rotation of galaxies to deviate from the simple prediction of Newton 's laws assuming that only the visible matter in galaxies is present .
This " dark matter " makes up nearly a quarter of the mass / energy density of the universe , whereas " light matter " ( stars , interstellar dust and atoms ) make up only a few percent .
Our prejudice is that dark matter has a particle nature .
Theories of particle physics beyond the Standard Model these days offer many possibilities for dark matter candidate particles , many of which could be detected via their weak interactions with ordinary matter .
Here we mean weak in the sense of interacting by exchanging a W or Z boson with the ordinary matter particles .
The common thread among the particles proposed for dark matter is that they are weakly interacting and massive ( of the order of hundreds of times the proton mass - one to several hundred GeV ) .
Particles in this general class of dark matter candidates are called WIMPs .
If WIMPs are really there , there are only a few per cubic meter in our galaxy , and most fly straight through ordinary matter without interacting .
But , if they can and do interact weakly , occaisionally they could transfer enough energy to a nucleus of ordinary matter that it would be detected , if our equipment is sensitive enough .
Also , there is hope that WIMP dark matter particles could be created in the high energy collisions of the Tevatron at Fermilab or soon at the LHC at CERN , and detected indirectly by the fact that they carry away apparently missing energy .
Experimentally , now , in the area of direct detection there is a race on between two main competing technologies for observing the feeble signal of WIMP interactions .
Until a few days ago , the most sensitive search for WIMPs was that of the XENON10 collaboration , using a detector of liquid and gaseous xenon as the target for the WIMPs .
The detector is kept deep underground at the Gran Sasso Laboratory in Italy .
But at the Dark Matter 08 meeting in Marina del Rey last week , the lead in this search was recaptured by the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search collaboration .
They use solid crystalline silicon and germanium detectors , cooled to liquid helium temperatures , to sense the nuclear recoil from WIMP interactions , taking extraordinary measures ( as all these experiments do ) to avoid false signals from cosmic rays , natural radioactivity , and stray neutrons .
They did a blind search , making carefully controlled predictions of the number of WIMP signal events they expected to see , and then " opened the box " earlier this month .
They expected 0.6 background events , give or take about half an event .
The result : nothing .
No signal from WIMPs or backgorund or anything !
To " measure nothing " is usually a great experimental challenge .
You do have to convince the world that you would have seen something if it had been there , that your apparatus is n't just mute for some other reason .
CDMS have done a great job convincing the world of this , I 'd say , and their result is nearly a factor of three more constraining than the previous Xenon 10 result .
They show it in this plot of WIMP interaction strength versus WIMP mass :
What the plot is saying is that assuming that all dark matter is a WIMP of a certain mass , there is less than a 10 % chance that , if the spin - independent cross section had some value greater than that indicated by the heavy black line , they would have seen no events in the detector .
This can be turned around to say that at the 90 % confidence level if such WIMPs exist , they must have even feebler interaction strengths than that indicated by the heavy black line .
These exclusion limits are starting to cut deep into the theoretically favored regions indicated on the plot ... and the fact that there really are zero events at this stage means that any sort of five sigma discovery could be a long way away .
In the mean time , there are larger xenon based experiments planned , including a larger version of the Gran Sasso one and the LUX experiment , to be based at the nascent deep underground facility DUSEL .
And , perhaps as early as later this year , the LHC experiments CMS and ATLAS will begin to get a glimpse of the results of protons " colliding in anger " as a colleague of mine likes to put it .
The Tevatron has seen no hint of WIMP production / decay yet , and so with seven times more energy , the LHC maybe able to produce the heavy particles that decay down to lighter ones which may include WIMPs such as the neutralinos predicted by supersymmetry .
I muse from time to time on the possibility that dark matter may really only interact with " light matter " gravitationally .
Perhaps it is composed of an entirely separate sector which does not interact with light matter .
It may be several or many particles which interact amongst themselves , forming structures we can only speculate about .
If our only probe of dark matter is gravity , there will be a very long road ahead to understand it .
I hope the cosmologists among the readers here can offer us more hope that indeed , there are strong reasons to believe dark matter interacts weakly ...
Every society produces its own distinct brand of social misfits , I suppose , but our social structure seems to produce significant numbers of people with rank - link imbalances .
That is to say , they have all of the social skills required to improve their social rank , but none of the social skills that lead to genuine bonding .
They are good at vertical relationships with mentors and bosses , but bad at horizontal relationships with friends and lovers .
Perhaps they grow up in homes with an intense success ethos and get fed into the Achievatron , the complex social machine that takes young children and molds them into Ivy League valedictorians .
They go through the oboe practice , soccer camp , homework marathon childhood .
Their parent - teacher conferences are like mini-Hall of Fame enshrinements as all gather to worship at the flame of their incipient success .
In high school , they enter their Alpha Geekdom .
They rack up great grades and develop that coating of arrogance that forms on those who know that in the long run they will be more successful than the beauties and jocks who get dates .
Then they go into one of those fields like law , medicine or politics , where a person ’s identity is defined by career rank .
They develop the specific social skills that are useful on the climb up the greasy pole : the capacity to imply false intimacy ; the ability to remember first names ; the subtle skills of effective deference ; the willingness to stand too close to other men while talking and touching them in a manly way .
The US Supreme Court has ruled that all states can demand photo identification papers from voters in a decision which could impact on the US presidential race six months before the elections .
By six votes to three , the judges upheld an appeals court decision backing a controversial Indiana law demanding voters provide proper picture identification such as a passport or driving licence before voting .
The ruling , which said demanding identification did not violate people 's constitutional rights , could lead to many people being turned away at the ballot box .
In Indiana , some 43,000 residents of voting age , mainly elderly people , have neither a passport nor a driving licence .
Those most likely to vote are the old - 78 % of the over - 65s .
Is that because they are dutiful citizens ?
No , it is because they have deeper affiliations stretching back to the days when parties did stand for identifiably distinct values .
Above all , parties stood for different class and economic interests .
Them - and - us was spelled out loud and clear : whose side are you on , who stands up for people like us ?
There is no united British civic interest , except in matters of national security .
There is as clear a difference in economic interest now as ever there was : indeed it is getting stronger .
Twenty years ago , FTSE chief executives earned 17 times the pay of their workers , now they earn 75 times more .
But no party has anything to say about that , none daring not to be the party of the rich .
Yet great economic divides are there : the median earners on £ 22,000 and below are 50 % of the voters - but that 's a bit less than MPs get as expenses for running their second homes .
So much gold dust is kicked in the nation 's eyes by scores of TV programmes selling property beyond most people 's imagining , or celebrity handbags costing thousands , that the delusion that most people are affluent has entered Labour 's lexicon and even its soul .
Labour needs a coalition of interests - but not to deny those interests .
Disgruntlement with politics may not express itself as a question of class , but it is the job of politicians to articulate people 's strong if inchoate feelings , to crystallise ideas and describe society as it is .
If they pretend that Britain is one great homogenous affluent bloc , with a few dysfunctional poor people to be sorted out , they sell a warped picture of the way we live now - and , instinctively , voters know it .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) -
As a teenager , Mazin Tahir dreamt that the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq would bring new freedoms and democracy with the fall of Saddam Hussein .
Students walk out from Mustansariya university in Baghdad March 11 , 2008 .
Psychiatrists fear that young Iraqis , so badly disillusioned after their teenage hopes and dreams were dashed , might turn to more drastic measures than just seeking to leave .
Haider Abdul - Muhsin , a psychiatrist at Baghdad 's Ibn Rushid hospital , said that disillusionment -- and poverty -- force many teenagers and young adults to leave school and university early .
Bitter and without direction , young people then become easy targets for exploitation by militants whose violence has killed tens of thousands of Iraqis since the invasion began .
REUTERS / Thaier al - Sudani
As a young adult , his hopes have been replaced by despair after five years of unremitting violence .
“ It ’s sad , or funny .
The Iraqi dream has turned into a nightmare , ” said Tahir , who was 15 when the Americans came .
“ When I was young I dreamt of getting rid of the dictatorship and replacing it with democracy .
Saddam has gone but Iraq is in worse shape .
There are killings every day , politicians are like thieves ... it ’s like a curse from God . ”
Tahir had his life before him when the invasion started and his heart was full of hope .
Now , like many others who grew from teens to adults during the occupation , he just wants to get out .
Fatma Abdul - Mahdi was 17 at the time of the invasion .
“ When Saddam was ousted I thought the doors of happiness would be opened , I thought I could stop wearing second - hand clothes and I could be like the girls I was watching on TV , ” the 22 - year - old said .
Fatma now works as a teacher in the southern oil hub of Basra but , like so many of her peers , she says her life is worse and her family is poorer after five years of instability and hardship .
“ I still wear second - hand clothes .
If I could find a job , even in Sudan or Somalia , I would flee Iraq as soon as possible .
I wish I had never been born in Iraq , ” she said .
Psychiatrists fear that young Iraqis , so badly disillusioned after their teenage hopes and dreams were dashed , might turn to more drastic measures than just seeking to leave .

TEENAGERS AN EASY TARGET
Haider Abdul - Muhsin , a psychiatrist at Baghdad ’s Ibn Rushid hospital , said that disillusionment -- and poverty -- force many teenagers and young adults to leave school and university early .
Bitter and without direction , young people then become easy targets for exploitation by militants whose violence has killed tens of thousands of Iraqis since the invasion began .
“ That is the start of their suffering .
They leave because they think their studies will not guarantee them a bright future , ” Abdul - Muhsin told Reuters .
“ Some of them are then exploited by armed groups into conducting violent acts .
Teenagers are an easy target , ” he said .
Young Iraqi adults suffer in other ways , too , when they see the way their peers live in richer , more stable Arab states and in the West .
Security fears mean it is hard to keep up social networks and there are few entertainment options .
While no statistics are available , he says he is seeing far more patients now than before 2003 .
“ Mostly their families come to my clinic complaining that they suffer from insomnia , or they are taking drugs or they have psychiatric problems , ” Abdul - Muhsin said .
Of course , the pain is even more acute for the many thousands of Iraqis who have lost family members in the violence .
Sabreen Jawad , a 21 - year - old Sunni Arab , left school after her father , a member of Saddam ’s elite Republican Guard , was killed during the invasion .
“ Can you imagine my feelings ?
A girl my age adores her father , he was always pampering me , ” she said .
“ From having a social life and luxury and servants we became a displaced family , ” she said .
Her family fled to Syria before returning to Baghdad recently .
Abdul - Muhsin said many young Iraqis have become reserved and introspective while the more resilient take a pragmatic approach to what has happened .
Nooreldin Ibrahim , from the ethnically and religiously mixed city of Baquba north of Baghdad , was also 15 and in high school when U.S. - led forces invaded .
He , too , had dreams of liberties unthinkable under Saddam , like mixing freely with girls .
Those dreams started to fade after about a year when shops slowly began to close as Baquba became a hotbed of insurgent and sectarian fighting .
Now studying for an Arts degree in Baghdad , he says he has come to terms with the constant interruptions to his studies since universities became frequent targets for attacks .
“ One day we ’ll study and then we ’ll have to stay home for 10 days .
I love football so that means I am able to play my favorite sport , ” he said .
“ I do n’t have any more dreams now , just finish my studies and become a civil servant , ” he said .

Medical correspondent , BBC News
They may look like any three - day - old embryos , but in fact these are hybrids Scientists at Newcastle University have created part - human , part- animal hybrid embryos for the first time in the UK , the BBC can reveal .
The embryos survived for up to three days and are part of medical research into a range of illnesses .
It comes a month before MPs are to debate the future of such research .
The Catholic Church describes it as " monstrous " .
But medical bodies and patient groups say such research is vital for our understanding of disease .
They argue that the work could pave the way for new treatments for conditions such as Parkinson 's and Alzheimer's .
Egg shortages
Under the microscope the round bundles of cells look like any other three - day - old embryos .
In fact they are hybrids - part - human , part- animal .
We are dealing with a clump of cells which would never go on to develop
Professor John Burn
Newcastle University
What are hybrid embryos ?
They were created by injecting DNA derived from human skin cells into eggs taken from cows ovaries which have had virtually all their genetic material removed .
So what possible justification can scientists offer for doing what the Catholic Church has branded " experiments of Frankenstein proportion " ?
The Newcastle team say they are using cow ovaries because human eggs from donors are a precious resource and in short supply .
The hybrid embryos are purely for research and would never be allowed to develop beyond 14 days when they are still smaller than a pinhead .
Scientists want to extract stem cells , the body 's master cells , from the embryos , in order to increase understanding of a whole range of diseases from diabetes to stroke and ultimately to produce treatments .
Professor John Burn from Newcastle University says the research is entirely ethical .
" This is licensed work which has been carefully evaluated .
This is a process in a dish , and we are dealing with a clump of cells which would never go on to develop .
It 's a laboratory process and these embryos would never be implanted into anyone .
" We now have preliminary data which looks promising but this is very much work in progress and the next step is to get the embryos to survive to around six days when we can hopefully derive stem cells from them . "
Free vote allowed
The research in Newcastle was approved by the UK's fertility regulator , the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority .
It is difficult to imagine a single piece of legislation which more comprehensively attacks the sanctity and dignity of human life than this particular bill
Cardinal Keith O'Brien
It acted ahead of the passing of new legislation which will specifically allow the creation of hybrid embryos so as not to hold back research .
The bill setting out the new legislation is not due to be debated in the House of Commons until next month .
It is highly controversial and last week Prime Minister Gordon Brown gave in to demands for a free vote on the issue .
Critics from the Roman Catholic Church say the creation of hybrids is immoral .
" It is difficult to imagine a single piece of legislation which more comprehensively attacks the sanctity and dignity of human life than this particular bill , " Cardinal Keith O'Brien , archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh declared last week .
Dr David King , of Human Genetics Alert , said : " For anyone who understands basic biology , it is no surprise that these embryos died at such an early stage .
" Cloning is inefficient precisely because it is so unnatural , and by mixing species it becomes even more unnatural and unlikely to succeed .
" The public has been grossly misled by the hype that this is vital medical research .
" Even if stem cells were ever to be produced , like cloned animals , they would have so many errors of their metabolism that they would produce completely misleading data . "
Not for the first time developments in science have outpaced the debate from legislators .
For supporters of embryo research the creation of hybrid embryos is a small but significant move forward .
For opponents it is a step too far .

There was an interesting post the other day which criticized Safari ’s choice to completely overhaul their event system and , in the process , seemingly cripple the keypress event for non-character keys .
At first glance to me , and to many others , it appeared as if a dramatic flaw had been introduced into Safari ’s event system – completely castrating its practical use .
It was at this point that I contacted Yehuda Katz ( Merb and jQuery contributor ) – he knows more about the inanity of cross - browser keyboard events than anyone I know .
Here ’s his responses to a few questions that I bounced off him :
John :
At first glance through WebKit ’s changes it appears as if they ’ve significantly crippled the keypress event , is this the case ?
Yehuda : People should not have been using the keypress event to get the character that was pressed .
That ’s because the keydown event only provides information about the actual key that was pressed ( the A key , the right arrow , etc. ) , but does not tell the user what character will get added to ( for instance ) an input box .
Since arrow keys do not get added as text , keydown provides all the information that is needed .
There were a couple of quirks with using keydown in certain cases previously which are resolved by their changes that prevent keypress from getting called if keydown ’s default handling is blocked .
What this means is that if people were using keypress before ( and relying on Safari ’s native results for arrow keys , such as 63232 ) , their code will break .
However , this was a bad idea all along ; people should use keydown to detect and block non-character keys .
My mantra has always been : keydown / keyup if you want to know the key that was pressed ; keypress if you want to know what text was detected .
John : Being able to access non-character keys must be useful – granted Safari gave strange results previously – but at least some value is better than none , right ?
Yehuda :
The keypress event does not provide any additional benefits over keydown for these non-character keys .
Keep in mind that IE does not fire the keypress event for some non-character keys ( e.g. delete , end , enter , escape , fkeys , etc. ) .
Because Safari appears to have fully resolved issues with suppressing default events from keydown , there should be no problem with using keydown for non-character keys .
John :
So we have charCode , keyIdentifier , and keyCode along with keyup , keydown , and keypress – is there a solution that we can safely use in a cross - browser manner ?
Yehuda :
There ’s a reasonably good writeup at : http://unixpapa.com/js/key.html.
Effectively , you can use e.keyCode for all modern browsers in keydown / keyup ( although you ’ll need to consult the chart at the bottom of that page to determine whether the keyCodes returned by the browsers are consistent ) .
For keypress , e.charCode || e.keyCode should work ( Mozilla and Safari define e.charCode , while IE defines e.keyCode which returns the ASCII value ) .
What that means is that you have a close - to - cross - browser keyCode for keyup / keydown and a pretty reasonable charCode for keypress .
As a result , keypress can be used for key events that produce text for which you need to know its ASCII value ( A vs. a ) .
keyup / keydown can be used for events for which you care about the physical key that was pressed .
Again , there are some quirks , which can be summed up in the tables at http://unixpapa.com/js/key.html.
I ’d like to thank Yehuda for taking the time to clear these points up .
Effectively if you were doing key - related development , previously , in a non-cross - browser manner then you hit a wall with this recent change .
If nothing else this should encourage you to keep a good separation , as Yehuda notes : “ keydown / keyup if you want to know the key that was pressed ; keypress if you want to know what text was detected . ”
