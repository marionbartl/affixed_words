For nearly half a century , Pat Robertson has built a media juggernaut on the twin foundations of religious fundamentalism and hard - nosed politics .
He has enjoyed unmatched influence , but is it the end of an era ?

I spoiled Pat Robertson ’s birthday .
I know , because he told me so .
On March 22 , 2007 , the day he turned seventy - seven , the televangelist and I sat eyeball - to - eyeball across the corner of a long table in a dark - paneled conference room at the Christian Broadcasting Network ’s cross -shaped headquarters in Virginia Beach .
Also at the table were two CBN lawyers and the editor , publisher , and lawyer from the newspaper I write for , the Virginian - Pilot .
We had been summoned for a tongue - lashing over a story I had written about Robertson .
It was a vicious piece , full of lies , he fumed — and what ’s more , I had consciously timed its appearance to ruin his birthday .
He demanded a retraction , a correction , an apology .
If he did n’t get it , he implied none too subtly , he would sue .
“ You guys are as crooked as a snake , ” he sputtered .
“ I ’ll have you all in depositions for the rest of your life . ”
The story traced the saga of Pat ’s Diet Shake , the latest commercial spin - off from Robertson ’s soul - winning empire .
In a legal tussle worthy of a John Grisham yarn , Robertson had been sued by Phil Busch , a street - smart Dallas bodybuilder who appeared on the broadcaster ’s
The 700 Club talk show claiming to have lost 200 pounds chugging Robertson ’s diet concoction .
Busch charged that Robertson had used him as a poster boy to promote his product without compensating him .
At one point during the dispute , Busch filed a police report alleging that Robertson had threatened his life while giving a deposition in the case .
Robertson said he had merely warned Busch that “ almighty God is going to take your strength away . ”
Busch ’s lawsuit was ultimately unsuccessful , but it produced a sheaf of internal correspondence revealing the fuzzy line between Robertson ’s for - profit enterprises , such as his weight - loss drink mix , and his nonprofit operation , most notably the bully pulpit of his television network , which enjoys tax - exempt status .
The paper never retracted the story , and Robertson did n’t sue .
But , at least , he had the opportunity to tell me in person that I needed to atone .
“ God says , ‘ Confess your sins , ’ ” he told me , and as I shook his hand on the way out , added : “ I ’m going to pray for you . ”
Over forty - six years of electronic ministry , this icon of evangelicalism has done a lot of praying , and he says it has paid a multitude of dividends .
He declares with utmost confidence that God speaks to and through him , has diverted hurricanes at his urging , and has healed thousands of the sick and lame in answer to his pleas .
He claims to have had personal encounters with Satan and the demons at his command , and in January 2007 he told his national audience that God had personally warned him of a major terrorist attack , “ perhaps nuclear , ” that would occur before year ’s end .
Given this track record , it would be easy to dismiss Robertson as a caricature .
But that would be a mistake .
Since Jerry Falwell ’s death , Robertson is the most visible evangelical leader in America .
A recent public opinion survey conducted by Christian pollsters the Barna Group found that Robertson was the only religious figure besides Billy Graham — who has retired from preaching — known to at least half the population .
Perhaps of most import for the nation and the world , he has pioneered a unique marriage between theology and politics .
This is a man who ran for president because , he said , God told him to , but that brief campaign twenty years ago would be merely a footnote in American political history were it not for the potent legacy it spawned .
Robertson has never really left the political stage .
He opines on world events daily on his TV show and regularly interviews national and world leaders .
Presidential hopefuls give major speeches at Regent University , the school he founded , where former attorney general John Ashcroft is on the faculty .
Out of the ashes of the Robertson presidential campaign came an army of Bible - believing religious fundamentalists which has won a degree of political power unprecedented in modern times .
It is not just happenstance that the White House is now occupied by a born - again Christian who , like Robertson , intimates that he has the ear of God ; whose administration is stocked with dozens of Regent graduates ; and who is waging what many on both sides are coming to perceive as a worldwide holy war .
And Robertson sees himself as the movement ’s latter - day John the Baptist , sent to prepare the world for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ , who he believes will rule the world in a “ perfect theocracy . ”
Marion Gordon “ Pat ” Robertson came by his twin passions , politics and religion , naturally .
His father , A. Willis Robertson , a conservative Democrat , was in the Virginia State Senate in 1930 , when Pat was born , and progressed to Congress and the US Senate by 1948 .
Pat ’s mother , Gladys Churchill Robertson , an intensely religious woman , was proud of her heritage , which included Winston Churchill and two US presidents , William Henry Harrison and Benjamin Harrison .
She was fond of telling her son he was born for leadership .
Both Willis and Gladys Robertson were the children of preachers and raised their son as a strict Southern Baptist .
Robertson attended military prep schools and majored in history at Washington and Lee University in his hometown of Lexington , Virginia .
After a stint in the Marines during the Korean War , he entered the Yale law school .
While at Yale , Robertson met his wife - to - be , Dede , a Catholic nursing student from Ohio .
He received his JD in 1955 but failed the New York bar exam and never practiced law .
Instead he decided to try his hand at business , working for the conglomerate W. R. Grace and later starting his own electronics business .
He and Dede had set up housekeeping in a chauffeur ’s cottage overlooking New York Harbor on Staten Island .
They were trying to be “ sophisticated New York swingers , ” he wrote in his 1972 autobiography , Shout It from the Housetops , hanging a huge Modigliani nude over the sofa and keeping Courvoisier on the bar .
But Robertson could n’t find his niche and soon became “ burdened with the futility of life . ”
He contemplated suicide .
“ You need to be born again , ” his mother told him , bombarding the couple with gospel tracts .
At her urging , Robertson had dinner with an acquaintance of his mother , an itinerant evangelist named Cornelius Vanderbreggen , at an elegant restaurant in Philadelphia .
Robertson was impressed .
“ I was used to the expensive bistros around New York , but that a faith missionary should say the Lord had led him to dine at this restaurant where the waiters wore white tie and tails was more than I could comprehend , ” he wrote .
“ I thought that God ’s people wore shabby clothes , baggy trousers , and suit coats that did n’t match .
I thought they ate hamburger and boiled turnips . ”
By the next day , Robertson had undergone a conversion experience .
“ Dede , I ’m saved ! ” he exclaimed to his wife .
He took the nude down from the wall and put it out with the trash and , to Dede ’s consternation , poured all their cognac down the drain .
Although his wife was seven months pregnant , Robertson trekked off to a Christian summer camp in the Canadian woods to commune with God .
“ Please come back .
I need you desperately , ” Dede pleaded in a note .
“ I ca n’t leave .
God will take care of you , ” Robertson replied .
Robertson believes that one night in his cabin , as he lay on his cot , Satan spoke to him , trying to dissuade him from his path .
But Robertson resisted .
He returned to Manhattan and entered the Biblical Seminary in New York , a conservative evangelical school later renamed the New York Theological Seminary .
Hungering for spiritual ecstasy , he and a group of friends became close to Harald Bredesen , a Pentecostal Lutheran minister who was instrumental in the birth of the modern charismatic movement .
They began holding all - night prayer meetings .
One night in 1959 , Bredesen began speaking in tongues while he clapped his hands and spun around in a tight circle .
“ It seemed as if a heavenly teletype machine had mysteriously been activated , ” Robertson wrote .
“ Everyone in the room knew we had heard from God . ” Robertson , too , began speaking in tongues , which sounded like “ some kind of African dialect , ” he wrote .
Eventually Dede underwent a conversion experience and took up the practice , too , which in her case sounded like French .
Soon after graduating from the seminary , while Dede was in Ohio nursing her sick brother , Robertson sold most of their household possessions , gave away the proceeds , and moved the family into a rat - infested brownstone next door to a brothel in the rundown Bedford - Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn .
The brownstone was the home of a seminary friend , Dick Simmons , who had taken a pastorate there .
For two months Robertson and his friends held predawn prayer meetings , spoke in tongues , performed baptisms in Long Island Sound , and commanded the demons to come out of Ruby — the madam next door .
“ Her hair stood straight up on her head , she screamed ‘ JESUS !’ and was delivered , ” Robertson wrote .
Dede hated life in the brownstone and was overjoyed when Robertson announced in November 1959 that God had new plans for him .
He had learned of a bankrupt UHF TV station for sale in Portsmouth , Virginia , and God had told him , “ I want you to have it . ”
He even specified the price Robertson was to pay : $ 37,000 .
With that , he loaded the family ’s remaining possessions into a U - Haul trailer and drove their 1953 DeSoto to Hampton Roads to become a pioneer in the brave new world of electronic evangelism .
Robertson had his work cut out for him .
Thanks to the Virginia Beach–based Association for Research and Enlightenment , founded in 1931 by famed seer Edgar Cayce , Robertson found the area overrun by “ mediums , clairvoyants and necromancers ” drawn by “ satanic vibrations . ”
The giant Norfolk Naval Base , too , had left the region “ rampant with sin . ”
Robertson later wrote that Hampton Roads “ was literally a spiritual wasteland .
For years it had been in the grip of demon power . ”
And the residents were none too eager for Robertson ’s brand of salvation .
He was even turned down for membership in one Baptist church , because they rejected his belief in speaking in tongues .
He scraped by for 1960 and most of 1961 , while he made his preparations for broadcasting .
Only local philanthropist Fred W. Beazley , a longtime friend of Robertson ’s father , kept the young preacher going by providing a $ 100 - per - week stipend and allowing his family to live in an old mansion on the campus of Frederick College ( later defunct and sold to the state to found Tidewater Community College ) .
Worst of all , in September 1961 just as Robertson ’s fledgling TV station was preparing for its first broadcast , Hampton Roads was threatened with devastation by Hurricane Esther , a category - 4 storm pushing northwest across the Atlantic .
Nearly 15,000 residents were evacuated from the Norfolk area , where the National Weather Service predicted the hurricane would make landfall , but Robertson refused to leave .
From a ballroom at the top of the Monticello Hotel in downtown Norfolk , he prayed that God would divert the hurricane and spare the station .
The storm slowed and turned northward , skirting the Virginia coast and eventually making landfall on Nantucket Island and the coast of Maine .
Robertson claimed credit for the miracle — and now says he has prayed away several other hurricanes from Hampton Roads in the years since .
“ For the past 45 years or so , ” he wrote in Miracles Can Be Yours Today , published in 2006 , “ God has set an invisible shield around our area . ”
On October 1 , 1961 , just days after the storm had passed , Robertson ’s WYAH — as in “ Yahweh ” — went on the air , with the evangelist praying in front of a cardboard cross .
Such humble beginnings notwithstanding , God wanted only the best for WYAH , which would expand into the goliath Christian Broadcast Network .
Robertson wrote that the Almighty had told him , “ Pat , I want you to have an RCA transmitter ” — the most expensive FM transmitter then on the market at $ 19,000 .
In the beginning , pricey and divine demands like these strained Robertson ’s budget to the breaking point .
Expenses continued to skyrocket , and the future of the station seemed constantly imperiled .
In 1962 , Robertson came up with a solution for his financial woes by holding a telethon .
The goal was to find 700 viewers who were willing to each pledge $ 10 a month , enough to cover the station ’s expenses .
Robertson dubbed this group The 700 Club .

On a brilliant cloudless morning , I strolled along the riverfront - shopping promenade in Branson , Missouri .
The Eagles’ “ Tequila Sunrise ” blared from street - side speakers .
Just steps from Victoria ’s Secret , a Christian Outdoorsman kiosk was hawking I ’m Hooked on Jesus T - shirts .
Up the street , an old - fashioned five - and - dime featured an Elvis fiber - optic light box — depicting the King resplendent in a rhinestone - studded outfit — for the strangely specific amount of $ 43.97 .
Welcome to Middle America ’s Vegas .
At night , on a gaudy strip ablaze with neon stretching westward from downtown , you can hear a down - home crooner at the God & Country Theatre or see racing pigs at the Dixie Stampede .
On stages lining either side of the highway , you can see people you may not have known were still alive : Andy Williams .
Bobby Vee. Fabian .
Jim Bakker .
Yes , that Jim Bakker .
Pat Robertson ’s fallen prodigy has risen again .
His new Jim Bakker
Show is taped daily in Branson and beamed into millions of homes via satellite .
The high - flying days of his PTL ( “ Praise the Lord ” ) TV show and the multi-million - dollar Christian complex he built outside Charlotte are long gone , felled by a sex - and - blackmail scandal .
Before it was all over , Bakker suffered a nervous breakdown , during which he had to be coaxed from a fetal position under a sofa in his lawyer ’s office , and spent five years in prison in the 1990s for fraud .
He lost a lot of hair , and he lost his bubbly blond wife and ministry partner , Tammy Faye , who divorced him to marry his best friend .
He came out of prison a chastened man .
But Jim Bakker is back onstage .
He has a new bubbly blond wife , Lori , who co‑hosts his show , and he has a new message — one of restoration , of new beginnings , of broken spirits healed .
“ God is such a good God , ” he told the studio audience of about fifty on the day I visited .
“ He ’s the God of the second chance . ”
In homage to his adopted Ozarks home , he hosted the taping dressed in denim overalls and a plaid work shirt .
“ I plan to live in these hills until the Rapture , ” he said .
The TV format is that of a late - night talk show .
Bakker sits behind a desk and banters with his guests and his wisecracking sidekick , Kevin , who sits on an adjacent couch .
The chatter is casual and largely ad - libbed .
It ’s a format he pioneered in Christian TV , Bakker told me after the show .
He came up with it while working for Pat Robertson .
He had no experience in TV when Robertson hired him and Tammy Faye to help develop programming for the nascent CBN in the early 1960s .
“ I had a dream as a young evangelist , ” he said .
“ I used to like watching the Johnny Carson show , because it was so different from church .
I thought , you know , it ’s too bad there is n’t a Christian Johnny Carson .
I said to Pat , ‘ I want to do a late - night talk show . ’
He said , ‘ Okay , if you do a kids ’ show first . ’” Jim and Tammy Faye had been putting on a puppet show for several years as part of their itinerant ministry , so together they devised the simple format — Tammy Faye putting on voices for Susie Moppett and Allie the Alligator and Jim out front interacting with the puppets .
Everything was done on such a shoestring that Jim had to build all the sets himself .
When Come On Over debuted on WYAH in September 1965 , Tammy Faye was so nervous she could n’t utter a word , but soon she grew at ease in front of the camera , and audiences loved the young couple .
“ They ’re Tidewater ’s answer to Captain Kangaroo and Mr. Green Jeans , ” the Virginian - Pilot reported in 1970 .
Bakker led me downstairs to his crowded office , its walls lined with memorabilia from his forty - five years of ministry , and pulled down a framed copy of the puppet show ’s nameplate .
He smiled , remembering the happy early days , but those times were rarely easy .
Robertson ’s station was always teetering on the brink of collapse , and Bakker told me that they decided in 1966 to extend their usual donation time into an all - night telethon in a last - ditch effort to stay on the air .
In the wee hours , overcome by exhaustion , Bakker broke down on camera and wept like a baby .
Donations poured in , erasing the station ’s debts .
“ That night , ” Bakker said , “ The 700 Club was born . ”
For the next eight years , Bakker hosted the daily broadcast of The 700 Club — alone at first , joined later by Robertson — as the self - styled Christian Johnny Carson he had always imagined .
While most televangelists at the time thundered from a pulpit in a bombastic , fire - and - brimstone style , Bakker talked to the guests and the audience in a folksy , chatty manner , with a self - deprecating charm .
He discussed the news , family finance , parenting , and lifestyle choices .
To all appearances , The 700 Club was formatted like any secular talk show , except for periodic testimonies of salvation and miraculous healings accompanied by Bakker ’s reminding viewers that the phone bank was open to take donations and prayer requests .
To keep calls coming , Robertson repeatedly emphasized the “ prosperity gospel ” — the belief , common among televangelists , that Christians are entitled to claim financial rewards as evidence of God ’s favor .
Robertson likes to call it the Law of Reciprocity , telling viewers that if they are true - believing Christians , financial rewards are theirs for the asking .
( “ We are to command the money to come to us , ” he once wrote . )
As a result , Robertson never had to feign guilt over indulging in the just financial rewards of his spiritual successes .
Today , he lives in a $ 3 million , 6,600 - square - foot house with six and a half bathrooms , and he is partial to Corvettes .
“ You can be just as holy when you are financially comfortable as you can be when you are poor , ” Robertson has written .
“ Poverty is a curse , not a blessing . ”
One of the best ways to strengthen both piety and pocketbook , Robertson liked to remind his audience , was by donating to his ministry .
To this day , The 700 Club features frequent stories about viewers who claim to have enjoyed dramatic financial gains after becoming regular donors .
It ’s no surprise , then , that the prosperity gospel which originally had drawn Robertson to evangelical Christianity became cemented in the financially shaky early days of his TV ministry , when he and Bakker would sometimes stay on the air until 4 a.m. , hoping the phone would ring one more time with another donation .
To avoid the risk of alienating potential givers , Robertson ’s one on - air rule was no discussion of politics .
Even when Robertson ’s father was running for reelection to the Senate in 1966 , Robertson stayed decidedly out of the political arena .
He later explained that God had told him not to get involved by campaigning for his father .
“ You can not tie my eternal purpose to the success of any political candidate , ” God said .
Robertson insisted his role was to save souls and not to influence voters .
That political neutrality changed with two events — Watergate in 1972 , and his father ’s death in 1974 ; the first outraged him , and the second , perhaps , freed him to express that outrage .
Robertson covered the Watergate scandal extensively on the network , repeatedly voicing his sense of betrayal and anger toward the White House .
When Jimmy Carter — a fellow Baptist — ran for office , Robertson interviewed him and followed his campaign with great interest , but he soon grew dissatisfied by Carter as well .
Eventually , as the Carter administration faltered , Robertson began to offer , to what he saw as the alienated Christian right , his own politics as an alternative .
And having done so , Robertson drew an ever - wider audience .
In the decade between the time The 700 Club became a daily program and the midseventies , CBN purchased a new facility in Portsmouth with a 175,000 - watt transmitter , then a staggering 2.25 - million - watt transmitter that could reach most of the mid-Atlantic coastline .
Robertson also purchased five radio stations in New York State and new TV stations in Atlanta and Dallas .
Then , in 1976 , CBN bought a satellite and , months later , broadcast its first feed from Jerusalem .
Robertson ’s teleministry was now big business .
In 1972 , Robertson wrote that you ca n’t “ worry about technical production when the cameraman is caught up in the Spirit and begins to weep over someone ’s testimony . . .
Who cares about the time if God is moving ? ”
But only a few years later , CBN ’s brand of production had become distinctly professional .
No longer were broadcast slots subject to whim .
No more was airtime filled with homemade puppet shows .
Along with the increasingly political slant of the show came more and more secularized programming , aimed at broadening the network ’s appeal .
CBN began showing family - friendly reruns like Lassie to help finance pricey advertisements for The 700 Club on other networks .
Soon , secular shows took up the bulk of CBN ’s airtime .
This shift led to Robertson ’s first run-in with the government , when the state of Massachusetts realized that the programming on WXNE - TV in Boston , purchased by CBN in 1977 , was more than 50 percent secular .
The station could be tax - exempt only if it functioned as a church instead of a business .
Robertson subsequently shifted his holdings to a new company , Continental Broadcasting — some said this shift was to prevent the state from accessing CBN ’s financial records .
This glitch did little to slow CBN ’s progress , however .
The station was finally beginning to turn a profit , after years of surviving on charity from Robertson ’s father and local donors .
The gifts had often been generous ( a local car dealer , for example , once gave Robertson a free Lincoln ) , but Robertson ’s wife still had to work in a local hospital to support their four children — two boys and two girls .
By the middle seventies , though , Robertson ’s risky decision to “ renounce wealth and privilege ” to pursue a life of Christian televangelism was suddenly paying off in a whole lot of wealth and privilege .
But in spite of the network ’s burgeoning success — or perhaps because of it — tensions were growing between Bakker and Robertson .
One night , Bakker failed to show up for work , and Robertson was tempted to fire him .
But as he was on his way out the studio doors , Robertson wrote later , he heard the voice of God say , “ Do n’t fire Jim Bakker , ” so he relented .
But eventually Bakker decided to leave on his own — or , as he told me in his Branson office , God told him to resign .
“ He said , ‘ I want you to move , and I want you to resign . ’
I said , ‘ But God , I do n’t have another job . ’
He said , ‘ I told you to resign . ’
I said , ‘ God , you sell the house , and then I ’ll resign . . .’
I put the sign out , and within three days . . .
God sold the house .
Just sold it , just like that . ”
Why did God want him to split with Robertson ?
God did n’t say .
But Bakker admitted to me that in addition to his divine orders , “ I was getting restless . ”
He insists now that it was an amicable parting , but in his autobiography , I Was Wrong , published in 1996 , Bakker said simply : “ Pat and I were never close after that . ”
Bakker had little time for looking back .
By the mid-1980s , Bakker had his own daily TV show and had built the biggest Christian retreat center in the world , featuring a hotel , seven restaurants , time - shares , condos , a dinner theater , and a water park .
He quickly parlayed his new empire into political clout , meeting with presidents and presidential hopefuls .
Among the memorabilia on the walls in Branson are photos of Bakker with Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan .

A short hop from the glitz of Hollywood and the opulence of Beverly Hills , in a drab office behind a Quiznos sub shop in Burbank , California , Gerard Thomas Straub — Gerry to his friends — sits in front of a video monitor and watches endless pictures of poverty flash by .
A leper colony in Brazil .
A teeming slum at the base of a mountainous garbage dump in the Philippines .
Homeless people living in cardboard boxes on Los Angeles ’s skid row .
Starving children lying helpless in the dirt in the remotest reaches of Uganda .
A gifted photographer and storyteller , Straub weaves these distressing images into documentary films aimed at exposing Americans to the harsh reality of persistent poverty .
The films are difficult to watch .
The scenes of abject squalor are presented with an unblinking eye , in an all - too - real cinema - verité style .
Straub himself is nearly gnomelike in appearance with his droopy mustache and balding pate rimmed with longish hair .
He grew up in Queens and still talks with a New Yorker ’s staccato brio — one minute pondering the images on the screen , the next joking with his two young assistants about starting a cable TV channel with the slogan “ All Misery , All the Time . ”
Straub knows that his films will penetrate only a tiny fraction of the audience he once reached , back when he made a cushy living producing soap operas such as General Hospital .
But he does n’t care .
He believes he is doing the Lord ’s work .
“ We try to find people who are living their faith , ” he told me when I visited his small , windowless studio , which held a tangle of electronic equipment and mismatched office furniture .
“ People who exemplify a kind of self - emptying love , giving themselves away . ”
Straub came to embrace this brand of Christianity — emphasizing social justice , concern for the poor , peace , and nonviolence — after a long and winding spiritual odyssey that included a life - changing stint with Pat Robertson and a public fracture that threatened to shake the ministry to its foundation .
The journey began when Straub , flipping through channels , caught Robertson on The 700 Club and was impressed .
“ I thought televangelists were buffoons , ” he told me .
“ But Pat seemed sophisticated , intelligent .
He did n’t seem like a phony . ”
Straub wrote to CBN — and was promptly offered a job .
“ I thought I ’d landed in heaven , ” he said , convinced , as he was , that it was the perfect opportunity to marry his twin passions : television and the Christian faith .
At the show , he advanced quickly , soon becoming a 700 Club producer and a Robertson confidant .
The two men developed what Straub later described as almost a father–son relationship .
“ But it did n’t take long to discover that their faith was different from mine , ” Straub told me .
He grew particularly uncomfortable with Robertson ’s claims of miracle cures for everything from acne , goiter , and varicose veins to arthritis , diabetes , and brain tumors .
To this day , Robertson holds hands with his co-host , scrunches his eyes shut , and delivers “ words of knowledge ” to his viewers — accounts of people being healed as they watch the show .
Even “ a little shaggy dog ” was being healed , he announced on one show in 2006 .
“ Not a soul in the place ever questioned what was happening , ” Straub wrote later in his book Salvation for Sale .
“ I just assumed that someday I would understand .
I was wrong . ”
Most people felt that everything was justified by Robertson ’s apocalyptic theology .
From the beginning of his ministry , Robertson has made plain that he expects to live to see the Second Coming of Jesus , and he is preparing for Christ ’s final battle with the Antichrist , a demon - possessed man who will have ruled as a worldwide dictator for at least three and a half years .
Robertson says lust , homosexuality , drunkenness , gluttony , and witchcraft can be expressions of demonic activity and believes that Adolf Hitler and Karl Marx were demon-possessed .
At various times during the 1970s , he warned that Ouija boards , visits to fortune - tellers , and playing Dungeons and Dragons were potential sources of demonic possession .
“ It was dark , ominous , ” Straub told me .
“ They saw evil everywhere . ”
And Robertson emphasizes that he does not regard such evil as mere metaphor for human failings .
He believes , for example , that a wave of depression that he once experienced in a motel near Seattle was much more than self - doubt .
“ I realized I was under demonic attack , ” he wrote .
“ I immediately took control over it and said , ‘ Satan , in the name of Jesus , I cast you forth . ’
The minute I said that , my mind was free and my despair was gone . ”
Equally important to Robertson ’s vision of the end - time is the nation of Israel .
He sees Israel ’s establishment in 1948 as a fulfillment of biblical prophecy — an event that set the clock ticking toward the creation of Christ ’s kingdom — and took it as a sign from God that Israel ’s Six - Day War began on the same day in 1967 that CBN broke ground on its new headquarters in Portsmouth .
“ In my thinking , the ministry of CBN was an end - times ministry , ” he wrote .
“ Like John the Baptist , we had been called to proclaim the end of the old age and to prepare the people for the coming of Jesus Christ and the new age . ”
For Robertson the pact was sealed at a dedication ceremony for the new building when his old friend Harald Bredesen channeled God in a “ word of prophecy , ” intoning into the mike : “ I have chosen you to usher in the coming of my Son . ”
In order to prepare for the imminent Second Coming — which Robertson believes will occur on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem according to biblical prophecy — he acquired METV ( Middle East Television ) , a station then based in southern Lebanon that could broadcast into Israel .
Straub was given marching orders to be ready to televise Christ ’s return .
CBN executives drew up a detailed plan to broadcast the event to every nation and in all languages .
Straub wrote : “ We even discussed how Jesus ’ radiance might be too bright for the cameras and how we would have to make adjustments for that problem .
Can you imagine telling Jesus , ‘ Hey , Lord , please tone down your luminosity ; we ’re having a problem with contrast .
You ’re causing the picture to flare . ’ ”
Straub says it took him five years to deprogram himself after he left — a forced departure .
Robertson had become convinced that Straub was having an affair with a married co-worker — a relationship Straub now admits .
He says that Robertson , determined not to be brought down by sexual scandal as so many of his peers had been , had him followed and his office phone tapped .
“ Pat always seemed ill at ease around women , as if they were only temptations to be avoided , ” he wrote later .
“ He is obsessed with the sins of the flesh . ”
As soon as Robertson was confident of the indiscretion , he let Straub go .
Now Straub describes his former boss as rigid , hard - driving , cutthroat , and intolerant of dissent — but on the subject of his firing he betrays surprisingly little animosity .
Whatever else he may have been , Straub insists , Robertson was not a charlatan .
He considered what Straub was doing immoral and a threat , so he let him go .
“ Every fiber of his existence believes totally in his message , ” Straub said , and he was forever seeking new avenues to win converts to his cause .
As a generation of ministers before Robertson knew , one of the best ways to spread your message is to found a university .
Pioneer broadcast evangelist Bob Jones founded his own college in South Carolina in 1927 — the same year that network radio was launched and his daily radio ministry was picked up all along the eastern seaboard .
Subsequent generations of televangelists followed suit .
Oral Roberts founded Oral Roberts University in 1963 , and Jerry Falwell founded Lynchburg Baptist College ( later Liberty University ) in 1971 .
And Robertson , of course , had lived on the campus of conservative Frederick College in the early sixties and seen firsthand the remarkable influence the institution wielded over its students .
An alumnus recently remembered , “ Students could not be married ; everyone had to live on campus ; everyone had to go to chapel ; women had to wear skirts or dresses and men wore ties and jackets .
No one was allowed to have a car .
I knew that once I was behind those gates , I was there to stay . ”
But Robertson claims that the idea of a university had never occurred to him until he had a revelation in August 1975 at Disneyland ’s Grand Hotel just outside Los Angeles .
He was seeking guidance from God about whether to purchase a few acres in an empty section of land in Virginia Beach for his expanding television ministry .
The WYAH studio building located in Portsmouth , according to CBN ’s own website , “ was taxed beyond its limits , ” and Robertson worried about handling the additional expense .
As he bowed his head to give thanks for his lunch of cantaloupe and cottage cheese , Robertson later recalled , “ I sensed the Lord speak to me .
‘ Buy all 143 acres and build an international communications center and school for my glory to take the message of Jesus Christ to the world . ’
Little did I know then what God was about to do . ”
Three years later , seventy - six students , under the direction of a mere seven faculty members and Robertson as president , began their graduate program in communication in rented classrooms in Chesapeake for what was then known as the Christian Broadcasting Network University .
In 1980 , that first class graduated , and the following fall the university took up its permanent home on the Virginia Beach acreage .
The university ’s original mission was to influence the media through its communication graduates .
( In a later interview , Robertson imagined a day when “ all three presidents of the major TV networks happened to be trained with master degrees from CBNU . ” )
In 1986 , however , he saw a new opportunity .
Early in the year , Oral Roberts University announced that it was abandoning its longtime goal of opening an accredited law school .
Robertson acquired ORU ’s law library ( of nearly two hundred thousand volumes ) and welcomed its twenty - five students and five faculty members to CBNU .
In 1990 , the name was changed to Regent University — a regent is one who governs in the absence of a sovereign , in this case , the “ second earthly incarnation of Jesus ” — as part of a concerted effort to separate the university from the rest of the CBN empire and create the appearance of autonomy .
The new identity also would allow greater anonymity for its graduates , whose stated charge , according to Robertson ’s authorized biographer , John B. Donovan , would be to “ gradually infiltrate secular society . ”
Robertson began to imagine a future in which graduates of his law school would find footing in the world of politics and in the halls of justice .
Robertson had long rued the day in 1947 when the Supreme Court , in Everson v. Board of Education , enshrined Jefferson ’s 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptist Convention describing a “ wall of separation between Church & State . ”
That decision , he has written , paved the way for the high court ’s rulings in the early 1960s banning organized prayer and Bible reading in the public schools , which Robertson blames for “ virtually every social pathology ” in the United States today : the exploding prison population , teen pregnancy , drugs , divorce , murder , alcoholism , and low scholastic achievement .
The lamentable result , he insists , has been the “ establishment in the public schools of the religion of secular humanism with its attendant sexual permissiveness , embrace of one - world government , and Marxist - inspired economic theory . ”
By training a new generation of lawmakers , Robertson hoped to reverse the Supreme Court ’s wayward path .
The first step would be to reject the legitimacy of the court ’s landmark Marbury v. Madison decision of 1803 , which established the concept of judicial review — the ability to declare laws unconstitutional .
The final corrective , he wrote , would be for Congress to “ nullify the decisions of the Supreme Court ” by refusing to allow it to overturn new Christian - based laws : “ Then those laws will remain in effect . ”
At the same time , however , Robertson was pursuing a second strategy — a bid for the presidency .
A president , he wrote , could simply refuse to enforce the court ’s decisions .
After all , he noted pointedly , the court has no army .
According to Straub , as early as 1979 , Robertson shared his presidential aspirations during private moments in the dressing room before 700 Club tapings .
“ Pat Robertson hopes he can ride his wave of spiritual superstardom straight to the White House , ” Straub wrote .
In 1986 , Robertson made a pilgrimage to Charlotte to convince Jim Bakker to help him capture the evangelical vote .
Bakker received his old mentor and also met with George H. W. Bush but ultimately endorsed neither — a snub that reportedly outraged Robertson .
It turned out to be a blessing in disguise .
A year later , as candidates were beginning to announce their runs for office , revelations surfaced of Bakker ’s brief sexual fling with Jessica Hahn , a twenty - one - year - old church secretary , and his ministry ’s subsequent payments of hush money to her .
An ensuing investigation produced charges that Bakker fraudulently oversold “ lifetime memberships ” to his luxury hotel , resulting in his criminal conviction and imprisonment .
Robertson reportedly viewed Bakker ’s downfall as divine retribution for not endorsing an evangelical candidate .
Such thinking troubled Straub .
“ I would be terrified , ” he wrote , “ to have the president of the United States be a person who has daily conversations with both God and the Devil . ”

On October 1 , 1987 , Robertson returned to the front steps of the Brooklyn brownstone where thirty years earlier he and Dede had lived to announce his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination .
It is a peaceful scene today , a tree - lined block , the graceful old townhouses humming with the renovations of gentrification .
Back then , however , it was still a rough neighborhood , and Robertson was not exactly welcomed with open arms .
He had to shout to be heard over dozens of protesters chanting , “ Go home , Pat , ” “ Bigot , bigot , bigot , ” and “ Shame , shame , shame . ”
He pressed on , saying he had “ a direct call and a leading from God ” to run for president .
It was not the first time he had heard from the Lord about who should occupy the Oval Office .
The days when God ordered Robertson not to mix his spiritual mission with a political agenda were long over .
“ I am persuaded , ” he had written in 1984 , “ that in the year 1980 Ronald Reagan was God ’s choice as president of the United States . ”
Reagan was not a man particularly noted for his piety .
But his right - wing politics suited Robertson to a T .
By 1986 , Robertson was foreshadowing his own plans .
“ What began in 1980 with the march and the election of President Reagan must be continued in 1988 or all that we have gained as a nation may be lost , ” he wrote .
Election Day 1988 would be “ another date with destiny . ”
Robertson clearly believed he would fulfill that destiny .
During the campaign , along with the traditional evangelical agenda , Robertson advocated a muscular foreign policy .
He supported the legalization of assassinations of foreign leaders — a theme that he has famously revisited over the years .
He suggested the United States should bankroll an invasion of Nicaragua by a government in exile and told interviewer David Frost he “ would n’t have hesitated ” to have Libyan leader Mu‘ammar al - Gadhafi killed .
During a debate in New Hampshire in February 1988 , Robertson alleged that Fidel Castro had twenty - five Soviet nuclear - armed missiles in Cuba — an incendiary charge for which no evidence ever surfaced .
“ Complete poppycock , ” a Pentagon officer responded .
“ Outrageous , ” said one of Robertson ’s Republican opponents , Vice President ( and former CIA chief ) George H. W. Bush .
It did n’t take long for Robertson to be seared by the new scrutiny of national press coverage .
A week after his announcement of candidacy , he was embarrassed by a story in the Wall Street Journal reporting that , contrary to his earlier account of getting married on his birthday , March 22 , he and Dede did n’t actually tie the knot until August 27 , 1954 — just ten weeks before their son Tim was born .
He explained that this was before his “ born - again ” experience .
Robertson also had to contend with allegations by Paul “ Pete ” McCloskey , a former Republican congressman from California who served with him in the Marines .
McCloskey claimed Robertson had boasted about his politician father pulling strings to get him out of combat duty in Korea .
McCloskey also said Robertson served as the “ division liquor officer ” for his outfit , flying booze in from Japan for his fellow troops .
Robertson , a vocal teetotaler , denied the allegations and filed a $ 35 million libel suit against McCloskey .
Unfortunately for him , the trial was set for the worst possible time : Super Tuesday , the day of several critical Southern primaries .
On the eve of the trial , Robertson finally dropped the lawsuit .
A week later , less than a year after Jim Bakker ’s very public downfall , another televangelist , Jimmy Swaggart , tearfully confessed on TV to sexual misconduct and was suspended from preaching .
Robertson suggested the scandal was engineered by the Bush campaign to raise doubts about all televangelists , even all evangelical Christians , as a way to embarrass him by association .
His campaign already faltering , Robertson took a body blow on Super Tuesday , finishing second in two states and third or worse everywhere else , including Virginia .
He suspended his campaign and returned to CBN , which was hemorrhaging millions of dollars in revenue and laying off hundreds of employees in his absence .
He remained unbowed , however , declaring at a church service in Denver that God had given him a new mandate : Run again in 1992 .
“ That is his plan for me and for this nation , ” he said .
But Robertson would never run again .
Instead , he and his evangelical constituency seamlessly moved into Bush ’s camp , and the remnants of his campaign were reconstituted as the Christian Coalition — a lobbying group aimed at drawing evangelical Christians into the political process .
Robertson endorsed Bush , Bush embraced Robertson , and Robertson reshaped the religious right into the group we know today .
In a joint appearance , Robertson received a warm welcome from the vice president ’s son and key political adviser , George W. Bush .
Just three years earlier , the younger Bush had been visited by Billy Graham at the family compound at Kennebunkport .
George W. had been a heavy drinker , often confrontational and even violent , but after a few days of walks on the beach with Graham , he had experienced a spiritual rebirth .
Now , he was the ideal person to bring Robertson and the Christian Coalition into the Republican mainstream .
“ We need your energy .
We want your ideas , ” the younger Bush said .
“ You ’re in , and we want you in . ”
In the nineties , being “ in ” allowed the Christian Coalition to pull in as much as $ 25 million a year in revenue from more than two million members ; in return it launched major direct - mail campaigns built around hot - button issues , such as abortion , and issued millions of its infamous “ voter guides ” — brief , pocket - size cards distributed in churches before elections , portraying candidates ’ positions on issues of interest to evangelicals .
The coalition always said the guides were nonpartisan , but critics attacked them as thinly disguised endorsements of particular conservative Republican candidates .
Such partisan tilt ran afoul of both the Federal Election Commission and the Internal Revenue Service .
Finally , in 1999 , the IRS denied the group tax - exempt status , forcing a reorganization .
The IRS also clamped down on Robertson ’s mother ship , CBN , retroactively revoking its tax - exempt status for 1986 and 1987 — related to improper campaign activities in the mid-1980s as Robertson was gearing up to run for president .
Robertson left the Christian Coalition in the wake of its tax troubles , but this setback did little to dim Robertson ’s successes as he continued to rake in the cash at CBN .
In 1997 , the Family Channel , as the cable channel that carried The 700 Club was now called , was sold to Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch for $ 1.9 billion .
That mega - deal sent a river of cash gushing through the organization — including a $ 147.5 million infusion into the Regent University endowment .

In April 1994 , the bloody civil war in Rwanda turned into all - out genocide as the Hutu military began rounding up all Tutsis for extermination , driving over a million refugees into neighboring Zaire .
CBN launched a media blitz , pleading for donations to send medical teams and win two million souls for Christ through Robertson ’s international charity , Operation Blessing .
For months
The 700 Club aired regular reports on their teams ’ successes in Rwanda .
Thousands of lives were being saved , the show ’s stand - in hosts told viewers , rolling footage of sick and dying refugees interspersed with images of Robertson being cheered and hugged by throngs of smiling African children .
At one point Robertson told viewers he was buying a Lockheed L-1011 jumbo jet and planned to transform it into a “ Flying Hospital ” equipped with state - of - the - art surgical gear .
He conducted a weeklong phone - a- thon to raise funds for refurbishing the huge plane .
“ Imagine a hospital plane that is also a flying ambassador for the gospel wherever it goes , ” an announcer said .
“ The Operation Blessing hospital plane will be a beacon of hope soaring on wings of healing to those in need . ”
Robertson urged viewers to send in generous pledges .
Premiums were offered for different levels of giving : a lapel pin for $ 100 , a desktop model of the plane for $ 250 , a bronze model for $ 1,000 , a gold - plated one for $ 5,000 .
Ultimately , Operation Blessing spent a staggering $ 25 million to buy and outfit the Flying Hospital , which was rolled out with considerable fanfare at Dulles International Airport in May 1996 , complete with a keynote speech by former president George H. W. Bush .
The plane , it turned out , was too large to reach the remote , medically underserviced areas where it was needed , and the cost of using it was largely prohibitive anyway .
By 2001 , it was sitting unused in the Arizona desert .
In the meantime , however , Robertson told viewers he had acquired some cargo planes and implied that they were being used to ferry doctors and medicine into Zaire ’s teeming refugee camps .
“ We actually carved an airstrip , ” he said at one point , showing his co-host some photos .
“ This is a 3,000 - foot airstrip carved by hand in two weeks by natives with machetes and mattocks .
They were so excited . . .
The whole village came out , because they were so thrilled to have a little airport . ”
What Robertson did n’t tell viewers was what I learned from two pilots who flew the planes :
The airstrip was actually built so the planes could bring in equipment to dredge diamonds from a remote jungle riverbed for the African Development Company , a for - profit owned by Robertson and registered in Bermuda , where there is no corporate income tax and business regulations are lax .
The three planes , two of which were registered to Operation Blessing , were used almost exclusively for a mine deep in the jungle , the pilots told me .
Only one or two of more than forty flights were charitable .
Chief pilot Robert Hinkle , a former Peace Corps volunteer , said he became so embarrassed by what he considered the duplicity of the operation that he had Operation Blessing ’s name removed from the planes ’ tail fins .
His account was backed up by notes he kept during most of the flights .
On one day that Robertson was a passenger , the notes read , “ Prayed for diamonds . ”
God was not the only one Robertson turned to for help in his mining venture .
He also gained the blessing of Mobutu Sese Seko , the Zairean dictator and one of the most notorious African leaders of the Cold War era .
Mobutu had amassed a large , plundered fortune at the cost of the Zairean people and such a horrific human rights record that the United States government banned him from traveling to this country .
In return for granting the mining concession , Robertson vocally lobbied for the reversal of the travel sanctions .
Virginia State Senator Janet
Howell spotted these red flags as well and asked the attorney general to investigate Robertson for possible misuse of charitable funds .
The attorney general referred the complaint to the state Office of Consumer Affairs .
That office conducted a yearlong investigation and found evidence that Robertson “ willfully induced contributions from the public through the use of misleading statements and other implications ” — which , if proven , would be a violation of the state charitable solicitation law .
The investigators also reported that Operation Blessing repeatedly delayed providing requested materials and that the materials submitted were incomplete and conflicting .
Lawyers in the office of Attorney General Mark Earley — to whom Robertson had given $ 35,000 in campaign contributions — agreed Robertson had made false claims that the airplanes were involved in humanitarian efforts .
But they determined that he could not be successfully prosecuted because they could n’t prove that he intended to defraud donors .
Robertson reimbursed Operation Blessing $ 400,000 for the use of the planes and agreed to some new procedural safeguards , including a ban on business dealings with the charity ’s directors or their families .
In 1999 , I published an article in the Virginian - Pilot revealing the investigators ’ findings .
Robertson responded by calling a press conference to denounce me .
He was livid .
He demanded not only that the story be retracted but that I be fired — and my editor , too .
He condemned my reporting as “ blatantly and maliciously wrong ” and threatened a lawsuit .
“ I ’ve turned my other cheek so many times , my head is dizzy , ” he said .
There was no retraction and no lawsuit , and yet , when we met in 2007 , Robertson clearly was still steamed over that ten - year - old story .
The publicity cost him a bundle , he complained , and the crowning indignity was the venture ’s meager output .
“ We got one tiny little diamond ! ” he exclaimed .
* * * * *
This , however , was not the last time I would hear about Robertson ’s prospecting for African profit , or of his alliances with thuggish dictators .
In 1999 , I learned that Liberian President Charles Taylor had signed a mineral development agreement with Freedom Gold — another Robertson for - profit company incorporated in another well - known tax haven , the Cayman Islands .
The agreement awarded the company mining rights in a region of Liberia believed to have substantial gold reserves .
In 1983 , after being accused of embezzling $ 1 million from the Liberian government , Taylor fled to the US where he was arrested in Massachusetts .
Two years later , he escaped from prison with a hacksaw and a rope of knotted bedsheets and was n’t seen again until 1989 , when he resurfaced in Liberia with an armed band of rebels .
In his long , bloody march to power , half of Liberia ’s three million people were killed or displaced .
Human rights advocates blamed Taylor ’s forces for forced labor , torture , and executions .
As president , Taylor exchanged arms and logistical support for diamonds mined by rebels in next - door Sierra Leone who were notorious for hacking limbs off civilians and slicing open the bellies of pregnant women .
In response , the United Nations slapped Liberia with an arms embargo , a travel ban on government officials , and a prohibition on diamond exports .
Robertson lobbied vigorously to get the sanctions lifted .
In a letter to Secretary of State Colin Powell , he wrote , “ May I respectfully inquire as a taxpayer of the United States and one with significant financial investment in Liberia , why the State Department of the United States of America is determined to bring down the president of Liberia ? ”
In 2002 , Taylor was the star attraction at a three - day “ Liberia for Jesus ” rally , which Robertson helped organize and covered on The 700 Club .
Lying prostrate on the red-carpeted stage of Samuel Doe Stadium in Monrovia , the Liberian capital , Taylor told his long - suffering people : “ I can not help you .
All help comes from God. ” Robertson ’s efforts notwithstanding , Taylor stepped down in 2003 in the face of mounting international pressure and is now on trial for war crimes in The Hague .
At last report , Robertson ’s gold - mining venture , which had been disrupted by the factional fighting , had resumed operations .
Operation Blessing did just fine though , and hit a goldmine of another kind in recent years .
Thanks to President Bush ’s “ faith - based initiative ” — implemented by executive order — billions of federal dollars have been funneled to religious groups , including $ 14 million to Operation Blessing in 2005 alone .

On April 29 , 2007 , about a month after my dressing - down in the CBN conference room , I stood on the Virginia Beach boardwalk under a dazzling sun , fanned by a gentle ocean breeze .
Bikini - clad beachgoers strolled by , staring curiously at a sea of believers , their faces upturned , many carrying American flags or white plywood crosses .
In front of the crowd was a stage with a huge American flag as a backdrop under a banner reading one nation under god .
The religious fervor was palpable .
At one point , two women , one on each side of me , grabbed my hands and closed their eyes earnestly as a speaker led the crowd in prayer .
This was Assembly 2007 , a gathering billed as a Christian corollary to the commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the English settlement at Jamestown .
Among the speakers were two Republican members of Congress and a passel of evangelical superstars .
Pat Robertson delivered the opening prayer .
After he finished , Chief Carl “ Lone Eagle ” Custalow of the Mattaponi tribe presented Robertson with a “ peace flute ” and , noting that one of the evangelist ’s forebears was a preacher in the Jamestown colony , offered : “ Thank you for bringing the gospel to my ancestors . ”
Robertson is fond of recalling his Jamestown roots and his connection to the religious component of the English settlement .
He has written about a little - remembered venture of those early settlers that never panned out : a college at Henrico , up the James River toward Richmond , intended to Christianize the Indians .
Construction of the college was underway by 1622 , but was abandoned after settlers were massacred by Indians at the site .
Robertson believes he is fulfilling the prayers of his ancestors — whose dreams of a Christian college were dashed 400 years ago — through Regent University , just ten miles inland from Cape Henry , nestled among magnolias and crape myrtles adjacent to the neocolonial CBN complex .
During the relative peace and prosperity of the Clinton years , Regent grads had little luck fulfilling their mission of “ infiltrating ” secular politics .
However , after the election of George W. Bush in 2000 and the nomination of John Ashcroft for attorney general , Robertson gained both a sympathetic presence in the Oval Office and unprecedented access to the judiciary .
Shortly thereafter , Bush tapped Kay Coles James , the dean of Regent ’s government school , to direct the White House ’s Office of Personnel Management , and Ashcroft changed the process for hiring to severely reduce the role of career civil servants , pushing out many who had worked under Clinton and making way for a different kind of employee .
The Bush administration has since hired more than 150 Regent graduates — a fact touted on the school ’s website but not brought to national attention until early 2007 , when Monica Goodling , a government lawyer who served as senior counsel to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and as Justice liaison to the White House , became the most prominent federal official since Oliver North to invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid testifying before Congress .
Goodling graduated from Regent Law School 1999 .
It ’s not known whether she passed the bar exam that year , but according to Regent ’s own numbers , 60 percent of her class did not — and the program overall remains ranked by U.S. News & World Report as a fourth - tier school , its lowest ranking .
Nevertheless , Goodling was hired by the Republican National Committee and worked as an opposition researcher , and then secured a job in the Justice Department .
She enjoyed a meteoric rise — though her only noteworthy contribution , according to the National Journal , was the expenditure of $ 8,000 on drapes to conceal the partially nude Art Deco statues of Justice in the department ’s Great Hall .
But while Goodling became the most infamous of Regent ’s graduates in the Bush administration , she was hardly alone in having high placement despite thin credentials .
In October 2003 , Bill Condon , then a Regent student interviewing for a job at the Department of Justice , was asked to name the Supreme Court decision with which he most disagreed .
Condon chose Lawrence v. Texas — the ruling that struck down a sodomy law on the grounds it violated the civil rights of gays .
One of the interviewers chimed in , saying that the Lawrence decision was “ maddening . ”
“ I knew I correctly answered the question , ” Condon wrote in the Regent Law School newsletter .
The committee recommended a post in the Civil Rights Division , “ because I went to Regent Law School . ”
It was his only job offer or , as Condon put it , “ God opened only one door to employment . ”
Under Ashcroft ’s instructions , the department pushed out numerous career lawyers .
Goodling , who ultimately resigned in the scandal over the politicization of US attorney appointments , appears to have been among a handful of people who oversaw the politically tinged firings .
Granted limited immunity from prosecution , she admitted to the House Judiciary Committee in May 2007 that she “ may have gone too far ” in applying a partisan litmus test not only to political appointees but also to career Justice Department employees — a possible violation of the Hatch Act .
These more seasoned lawyers were replaced by attorneys who had announced memberships in conservative or Christian groups , many of whom were placed in the Civil Rights Division .
Since the housecleaning began in 2001 , the Division , created to protect African Americans from voter and workplace discrimination , has brought no voting cases and only one employment case on behalf of an African American .
The new focus , instead , has been on cases of discrimination against Christians .
As late as February 2007 , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales authorized a new initiative called the First Freedom Project ( so named because religion is the first freedom addressed in the Bill of Rights ) and a Religious Freedom Task Force to commit the department to “ even greater enforcement of religious rights for all Americans . ”
The extent to which these appointments and initiatives may continue depends largely on the outcome of the upcoming presidential election .
One imagines that any Democratic president would replace all the US Attorneys , as Bill Clinton did in 1993 , but a Republican president — especially one who had relied on conservative Christian voters — might not be so quick to make changes .
Perhaps this is why Pat Robertson invited Mitt Romney to deliver the commencement address at Regent in May 2007 , when Romney was leading in the polls ; perhaps this is why Robertson offered Rudy Giuliani his endorsement in November .
Ever the practitioner of power politics , perhaps Robertson will back whichever candidate he judges to be the strongest Republican horse .
For his part , John Ashcroft announced his resignation as attorney general immediately following Bush ’s reelection in November 2004 and officially left his post the following February .
Within a month , he was named a Distinguished Professor in the schools of law and government at Regent University , where he now teaches the course “ Human Rights , Civil Liberties , and National Security . ”
Instrumental in wooing Ashcroft was Jim Davis , assistant dean for the Robertson School of Government , who had been hired by Ashcroft in 2001 as the Deputy Director and Counsel of the Department of Justice ’s Task Force for Faith - Based & Community Initiatives , where he “ provided guidance on constitutional issues to the White House . ”
According to Stephen L. McPherson , assistant dean for student affairs at the law school , Ashcroft “ has been a great friend to us .
We ’re thankful that he is a part of this community . ”
On November 30 , just weeks after endorsing Giuliani , Pat Robertson resigned as chief executive of CBN and turned the reins over to his son Gordon .
The younger Robertson told the Associated Press that his style is distinct from his father ’s , pointing to their differing approaches to chess .
“ Dad likes the bold strikes and bold moves , ” Gordon said .
“ I like looking at the end game , and I think it ’s good to do that . ”
He declined , for example , to endorse a presidential candidate .
Under Gordon ’s leadership , CBN may assume a less public stance on matters of the day , but one can be assured that the empire constructed by his father will continue to generate vast wealth and that those resources will continue to be put toward educating students in Robertson ’s signature brand of Christianity .
Those graduates , in turn , will have influence in the halls of justice and the upper echelons of executive power for generations to come .
The exposure of Monica Goodling may spell an end to Robertson ’s latest gambit to win influence , but he has shown remarkable savvy — and single - minded tenacity — in realizing his vision for the “ perfect theocracy ” of America ’s future .
He will continue to push for a ban on abortion ( “ the height of pagan barbarity ” ) , limits on other rights for women , restrictions on gay rights ( “ a sign that a society is in the last throes of decay ” ) , narrower guidelines for artificial insemination and stem cell research , implementation of corporal punishment in schools , an end to teaching evolution ( “ There is no reproductive evidence to support evolution ” ) , raising legal standards for granting divorce , expansion of capital punishment , and an end to the nation ’s progressive tax structure ( “ the creation of Marxist communism ” ) .
Most of all , Robertson will continue to insist on a Christian litmus test for the nation ’s highest office .
Yet that very insistence seems to be of fading importance to Americans at the moment .
The strong showing by Mike Huckabee in Iowa , as Robertson himself knows well , does not necessarily translate to the rest of the country .
And for many , Robertson seems less a vital part of the political process than a reminder of a hard - right past that has become a liability for the Republican Party .
And , perhaps , such conviction no longer serves even the ends of a man such as Pat Robertson .
In the weeks just before the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , President Bush was reading each morning from a book of evangelical sermons by an itinerant Scottish Baptist preacher , Oswald Chambers , who accompanied soldiers massed in Egypt for the British invasion of Palestine in 1917 — dubbed “ the Last Crusade ” by some enthusiasts .
Chambers urged the troops to become “ ablaze for the glory of God . ”
In a closed - door meeting with Robertson , Bush related some of what he had been reading and revealed his plans for the invasion .
According to Robertson ’s later account on CNN , he warned Bush , “ The Lord told me it was going to be ( a ) a disaster and ( b ) messy . ”
Robertson remembered cautioning , “ Mr. President , you had better prepare the American people for casualties . ”
“ Oh , no , ” he said Bush replied , “ we ’re not going to have any casualties , ” and he broke out in a benign smile that reminded Robertson of Mark Twain ’s line about “ the serene confidence which a Christian feels in four aces . ”
So there they sat — two soldiers of God , each with his marching orders , each equally sure of his divine mission , a world on the line .
“ The Christian with Four Aces ” elicited a response from Pat Robertson ’s attorney , which we have made available in its entirety .
Brian Stelter has a great piece in the New York Times that I urge anyone interested in the media business to go and read right now — I ’ll wait — and that includes reporters , editors and ( most of all ) managers , and probably IT departments and designers as well .
The context of the piece is political reporting and political news , but I think the points Brian is making are relevant to the entire industry as a whole .
It ’s not that there is anything earth - shatteringly new in the piece , mind you .
But I think it does a great job of describing how digital “ word of mouth ” — in other words , social networking of all kinds including Twitter , IM , Facebook and so on — has become a dominant means of news delivery for young people in a way that I ’m not sure old geezers like myself quite grasp , no matter how often people describe it ( and Stelter knows whereof he speaks , since he was still in university when the NYT hired him away from TV Newser ) .
As Brian describes it in the story :
In essence , they are replacing the professional filter â€ ” reading The Washington Post , clicking on CNN.com â€ ” with a social one .
And then Stelter mentions Jane Buckingham of the Intelligence Group , a market research company , and says that during a focus group , one of the subjects — a college student — said to her :
â€ œIf the news is that important , it will find me.â€ 
Think about that for a second — or longer , if necessary .
I think that sums up , in ten simple words , what has happened to the way that many people ( and not just young people , but those who use RSS readers and blogs and social networks as well ) consume the news ( Mark Cuban seems to think so too ) .
Not only is there just so much of it out there that it ’s virtually impossible to consume it all , but the very fact that someone you know — or trust — has passed on or blogged or Twittered or posted a link makes it more likely that you will read it .
Are most websites designed with this kind of principle in mind ?
Not really .
Most of them are still designed as though people read the news the same way they do in the paper — starting at the front and moving page by page towards the back ( of course , many people do n’t read the newspaper this way either , but that ’s another story ) .
In reality , people come from every conceivable angle , dropping into stories and then disappearing , finding them through links and posts and Digg and elsewhere .
If the news is that important , it will find me .
A winner has finally been declared in Hollywood ’s high - definition DVD war .
So why is n’t there more cheering ?
In the 1980s , the triumph of VHS over Betamax helped develop the lucrative home entertainment market .
DVDs , introduced in the 1990s , turned into an even bigger gold mine , accounting for roughly 60 percent of studio profits in recent years , analysts say .
The entertainment giants have positioned high - definition DVDs as yet another blockbuster business .
But the victory of Sony ’s new Blu-ray high - definition disc over a rival format , Toshiba ’s HD DVD , masks a problem facing the studios : the overall decline of the DVD market .
Domestic DVD sales fell 3.2 percent last year to $ 15.9 billion , according to Adams Media Research , the first annual drop in the medium ’s history .
Adams projects another decline in 2008 , to $ 15.4 billion , and a similar dip for 2009 .
So instead of celebrating the Blu-ray format  which remains a nascent business  the studios are scrambling to introduce an array of initiatives aimed at propping up the broader market .
Some efforts , like the addition of new interactive features and changes in how DVDs are packaged and promoted , are intended to prevent further market erosion while nurturing Blu-ray .

One Christmas I was investigating the fridge when I discovered a huge bowl of brandy butter .
I was about to reap the rewards of my find , when my sister walked into the kitchen .
" You should n't eat that " , she said flatly .
" Oh really ! ? "
I asked , " and why not exactly , will you tell ? "
I then performed a dance around the kitchen table clutching the bowl , while I sang " will you tell , will you tell , WILL YOU TELL ??? ? "
At the climax of this performance I scooped an enormous handful of the stuff into my mouth , which turned out to be translucent wobbly chicken fat .

I 'm still kinda working on this one .
This is kind of a long and involved ramble without a punchline , so bear with me .
I live on the south side of Richmond Virginia , just outside of the city limits .
I can travel ten miles from my house and either be in the city itself or in the middle of nowhere .
As I have been laid off yet again , I have a fair bit of time on my hands .
As one can only do job hunting for so many hours per day , I find myself needing to get out of the house on my own a bit .
Being unemployed , I have no money coming in , so I have to do things on the cheap .
One of the things I decided to do was play around with photography .
So one day I got in my car and drove out along one of the main roads here in the direction of countryside , as I knew that there were some old farm buildings to be photographed out thataway .
So after poking around in this building a bit and finding that it was n't safe to go upstairs or even through some of the downstairs , I decided to look further out and see what else I could find .
And sure enough , as I went by a bit of a hill that they had cut into for the road , I saw the peak of an old structure back in the trees .
So I backtracked and found the old driveway and parked at the end , and continued on foot .
As I approached the house I became a little more hesitant - I could see curtains in the windows and other signs of habitation , yet the place was clearly not inhabited now .
I stepped between rotted pieces of furniture on the front porch to the front door , and saw that it was standing open behind the screen door .
Not sure what to expect , I stepped inside .
The house is full of furniture , clothing , dishes and glassware , much of it kind of scattered about - someone had obviously ransacked the place looking for anything of value , then left it where it was to decay .
The roof has holes in it , so the ceiling has fallen in throughout much of it and the floors have begun to rot through - and throughout it all are someone 's abandoned possessions .
I was morbidly fascinated by this and looked around very carefully , and realized the following :
- the house had been inhabited by an elderly black couple .
I found women 's clothes as well as men's , and two photos of little black kids - apparently their grandchildren .
And amid the wreckage I found his social security card - but instead of being paper like mine , it was a small aluminum plate .
I do n't think they 've issued those since the beginning of Social Security .
- the woman had predeceased the man .
Her bedroom ( they stayed in separate rooms ) was in advanced decay , with much of her stuff gone .
At a guess I would say she was gone between one and three years when he died , judging from the state of the house - it had been rather messy before it was ransacked .
- the man was one of those old black handymen that you rarely find anymore , the kind who drive an old pickup with some tools in it and can fix anything that ever worked in the first place .
Behind the house sit a number of old vehicles , and his pickup truck - with some tools in the cab , along with his last load of laundry , still in the basket .
-he died there in that house , most likely in his sleep .
There was still food in the kitchen and old bedding on his bed , his razor and toothbrush are still in the bathroom , his glasses were on the kitchen table , and I found what appeared to be his cane lying next to the bed .
Apparently they took out his body , his relatives rooted around for anything they might want , and left the rest to decay where it was .
In his bedroom are about a hundred ties and at least fifty suits , still hanging .
All of his books , his records ( there was still an LP in the record player ) , his papers , everything he had , are still there in the rot .
I do n't know what kind of karma the old man had to be treated in this way -
Google turned up nothing at all on him , not even an obituary .
Were it not for his Social Security card , I would n't have any idea of his name - and in another few years there wo n't be anything to show that he ever existed .
His family obviously does n't care - and that 's what really sent a chill through me , so that I had to get out of there , fast .
And yet ... well , I did take a few things from there , which I will cherish and use .
I took his Social Security card , his glasses , his cane and a few hand tools that I can put to use .
I 'm going to see if I can find out who currently owns the property so I can contact them and ask if I can take the rest of his stuff out of there for the Salvation Army .
If his family does n't care about him or his stuff , then I will .
Someone needs to .
No one should die so ignominiously .
And an interesting note to this : when I picked up the cane it rattled a little .
I found that the brass tip unscrews , so I tightened it - and still it rattled .
So I twisted the top , and it unscrewed in my hand and came off .
I turned the cane upside down - and a long piece of wood emerged , with threads on one end and a cap on the other .
The cane is actually a full length pool cue , with a very elaborate dragon carved into the handle .
I 'm going to take it with me one night and shoot a game or two in his honor .
RIP , Emmitt .
EDIT : w00t , it 's my b3ta birthday today !
Update : his family are still in the area , and very nearby .
It appears that they 're still using his identity , which is even more horrid , despite the fact that Social Security records his death in 2000 .
If my kids do this to me after I die , I 'm going to come back and haunt them by playing Barry Manilow in the night .

Karma ?
This is n’t a particularly easy post for me to make , but because of this week ’s question I thought I ’d share …
Usually this story is one I only tell people who have known me a fair length of time because , believe it or not , I ’m actually a very
private person .
However , I was once asked to do some work for
Good grief - that sounds terribly worthy – I 'm not , but the story is .
*****************
Many years ago during the summer of my 21st birthday I had it all – I was at uni studying history with plans to become a primary school teacher , I had my own car , good friends , and a handsome boyfriend who was two years later to become my first husband and as I was also to discover , gay ….
but that ’s another story …
One day I was laying in the bath feeling smug about my perfect life when I noticed a small lump sitting on the top of my right breast , in fact more on the flat part of my upper chest .
I thought it strange as I ’d never noticed it before and put it down to hormonal fluctuations – surely it would disappear when I ’d had my period .
So I left it for a couple of weeks waiting for it to go .
It did n’t .
Full of shame and embarrassment I booked an appointment with the nurse at my doctors ’ surgery – why the shame and embarrassment ?
Need I remind you I was a good catholic girl ?
Despite having long since lost my virginity I had not had many boyfriends , I was not accustomed to whipping out my boobs at any drunken opportunity – to my mind ( despite obvious evidence to the contrary ) I was fat and therefore unattractive – in other words I was pretty much an ordinary young woman .
So with head hung down to hide my burning cheeks I took off my t- shirt and bra to show the nurse the lump I ’d found on my breast .
She took one look , called me silly for coming to see her and not the doctor and called in my GP .
This man had known me all my life – seen me go through measles , chickenpox , german measles , mumps – in fact , you name it , I ’d had it .
My shame deepened – he was going to see my breasts !
He examined me and told me , " Oh , that ’s nothing , just a fibroid adenoma . "
A what ?
" Very common .
Nothing to worry about . "
Weeks passed and finally in the late autumn I saw the surgeon .
" This lump – yes , probably a fibroid adenoma , but let ’s take it out just to be on the safe side "
Fast forward to March – two months before my 22nd birthday .
I go in for day surgery to have this lump taken out – I ’m in the hospital at around 8 am and have left by 3 pm feeling fine but a little sore .
Told to come back in a week to have the stitches taken out .
All the other appointments I had attended alone – I ’m a very independent person , always have been .
This time however my mum came along – I made her sit in the waiting room , as I would n’t have her see my breasts !
In the examining room I sat with a nurse , she was probably in her early thirties and was there to help the surgeon remove the stitches and act as female chaperone .
The surgeon came in and before he began to attend to the wound he very gently told me that unfortunately the lump had n’t been a benign fibroid adenoma but instead it was a malignant tumour .
Breast cancer .
When I got up from the emotional number 8 bus which had just run me over my first question , the obvious question , “ Am I going to die ? ”
And to his credit he did n’t lie to me or fob me off – he was completely honest , “ I do n’t know .
Come back this afternoon , speak to a colleague of mine , an oncologist , and he will be able to tell you more . ”
He then took out the stitches , squeezed my hand and wished me good luck .
Then he went to get my mother .
I was left with the nurse who simply kept repeating , “ Oh please do n’t cry !
Do n’t cry , please do n’t cry ! ”
I drove myself and my mum home – she ’d already phoned my dad who happened to be having a day off .
I do n’t honestly remember much about those few hours between being told and then going back to the hospital in the afternoon .
Except that I truly believed I would die within the year .
I went for a shower and stood under the water sobbing with regret that I would never be married , never have children , never have a life .
Then I began to pull myself together – the strangest things get you through times like these – I kept on thinking of all the young servicemen who had been killed in wars – they would have been a similar age to me and they were dead now .
If they could get through it , so could I .
The next six months passed in a daze – I had been reassured that I was not terminal , everything had been caught at an early stage .
However because of my age they needed to be sure that that I did n’t have a reoccurrence .
I had chest x-rays , a bone scan , ultrasounds of my liver and then the treatment .
First off was six weeks of radiotherapy – just like having an extended x-ray – three times a week for about 20 minutes at a time .
During those six weeks I was n’t allowed to wear deodorant or even talc because they would interfere with the treatment .
The skin on my breast and under my arm became reddened then sores opened – I had to wear a t - shirt under a bra like some sort of bizarre female superman .
Around the same time I also began a regime of chemotherapy – I was lucky my hair did n’t fall out , but I had it all cut off to a short crop just in case .
After the radiotherapy finished I spend a week in hospital alone in a lead - lined room with five radioactive wires skewering my breast and no one was allowed to visit me for more than fifteen minutes a day to protect them from the radioactivity .
Throughout the entire six months no one would have known I was ill – I looked just the same , yes I ’d cut my hair and I was a little tired , but I did n’t lose any weight or look ill .
I saw other patients – thankfully mostly old – come and go , many of them dying , including a young woman only a few years older than myself who had two young children .
Karma ?
I did wonder for a long time what I ’d done in a previous life to deserve this .
But …..
Fast forward six years – I ’m divorced from the handsome gay man and have remarried .
One month after the wedding we decide to start to try for a family – no hanging about as I had been warned that I may find it difficult or even impossible to conceive because of all the treatment .
And that ’s where the Karma comes in ….
First attempt .
Twins .
Non identical twins – that ’s two eggs – in other words , do n’t sit to close to men on buses as you are über - fertile .
Healthy pregnancy , boys delivered full term and large – both around seven pounds .
That was ten years ago .
I continue to go for regular mammograms but my chances now of developing cancer are the same as anyone else .
If that ’s Karma , I can deal with it .

Flatmate from hell
OK , so I 'll get straight into it ...
In 2002 I went to uni in Edinburgh .
Initially I was quite anxious as it was quite a way from where I 'm from ( NW England ) and I was the only one I knew going there , but it is a beautiful city and student life is great .
Turns out anyway , that Edinburgh uni does n't really present much of a cross section of Scotish society , being largely made up as it is of rich English people from Surrey eager to try out the snowy wastelands on Daddy 's tab .
Cue the end of 2nd year .
My group of friends and I are choosing who lives with who as we move from halls to flats .
My course is pretty intensive so 9 times out of 10 I would have to turn down any invitation for a night out / spliff / party .
Hence , my name was not too high up on people 's wishlist when it came to populating their soon - to - be uberparty - pad .
So I got lumbered with 3 other guys .
Now , two of these guys are fine , one ( Joe - a rather wealthy Surrey boy ) was unknown to me and , as you 'll see , turned out to be a bit of a shit .
We got lucky with our flat .
Super - close to the new Parliament and with 3 floors for 4 people , the rent was undervalued hugely because it was brand new and we were the first tenants .
Everything was gleaming - it was worth £ 500 k apparently .
Not bad for £ 270 pm each in Edinburgh .
So we got everything signed and went to our prospective homes for summer to work etc .
Except for J , who decided to hang around for summer and enjoy the festival .
The last I see of him is when I leave for home having just put all my coursework , architecture models , computer stuff etc in my room and locking the bedroom door behind me .
About a month later , I 'm heading up to Edinburgh with 2 friends .
We decided to celebrate my birthday by having a week in the festival .
Why not ?
I 've already paid for the rent .
On the train up I get a phone call from one of the other flatmates telling me he 's moving out .
' What ? ! ' says I , a tad surprised and concerned .
' It 's the flat , man .
It 's fucked up .
Joe 's fucked it all up ' .
Says he .
It does n't sound good .
So I tell him I 'll check it out for myself and not to tell Joe that I 'm coming .
We arrive in Waverly , walk the short distance to the flat and get ready for what awaits us .
The plan was set : go quietly straight up to my room on the top floor , leave our stuff then have a look around .
Up we go .
As I reach the top of the stairs I notice something different about my bedroom door .
There seems to be only half of it left on the hinges , the rest splintered across the floor .
Shit .
We go in to my room .
There 's three tussled but empty sleeping bags .
I step on a used condom .
I survey the room .
My flatmate 's description was accurate : it 's fucked .
The blinds have been torn and snapped off the wall .
The en-suite ( nice flat as I say ) - brand new until now - was a tip .
Piss everywhere .
Smears of what I can only assume to be shit along the shower walls .
The shower head is smashed and hanging like a New York payphone .
I open my wardrobe .
Coursework : crumpled into a ball .
Architecture models : completely decimated .
Computer : side has come off and one of my jumpers has be shoved inside it .
On inspection the insides have been smashed .
Time to see Joe .
We go down to the kitchen via the living room .
The living room is off the kitchen with double doors , so it 's pretty much one huge space .
Walking in , we see about 10 sleeping bags and a mattress ( we had no furniture at this stage ) .
In the corner is a comatosed Joe half on the matress , half on the floor .
His head being on the floor .
We step over him and enter the kitchen .
What followed was the most breathtaking site I 've ever seen ( including goatse ) .
Scattered amongst spilled beans and cans of beer were : 1 large pile of coke - the scale of which can only be described as ' Scarface ' , the remenants of about 50 lines , a bag of ketamine , 5 large bags of pills , 2 ( !! ) ounce - bags of weed .
Many discarded pieces of foil with burn marks ( I presume crack , heroin ) .
The fridge is ajar .
It 's full - to the point it wo n't close - of mushrooms .
And there , in the middle of all this , is one used syringe .
I walk over to Joe to wake him up .
His eyes are deep pink .
His expression on seeing me standing over him was a lot like the 2 girls 1 cup mammal thing on the front page .
Imagine your expression if your dad walked in on you wanking over a picture of your mum .
That 's the kind of shock / shame / fear in his eyes right now .
He stares at me .
I stare at him .
Finally he pipes up with , ' What the fuck are you doing in my flat ? ' .
Come again ?
' Get out , man .
This is my flat now .
You can fuck off .
Go find yourself another place to stay . '
This went on for a while .
Me pointing out the obvious , him still tripping off his tits telling me to get out of his newly - conquered territory .
I 'll cut this bit down as this is getting long ...
Basically , I looked for another flat .
Eventually , I realise I 've got a good one as it is and should n't have to be spending my birthday flat hunting because he decided to fuck up our current flat .
I decided I 'd better get the landlords involved .
We met the next day outside the flat ( we were staying at my mate 's in the meantime ) .
On the way we walked down Princes St . We saw something rather bizarre : some guy leaning forward off a traffic light post in the middle of the road ( think Titanic , king of the world scene ) staring at oncoming traffic as if wanting a fight .
He then lets go and runs straight at the oncoming cars .
Cue much beeping , running over bonnets , and narrowly avoiding a bus .
All while half naked and screaming ' Wahoooooo ! '.
Wierd .
But it is festival time .
Anyway , I explain everything to them .
They were shocked but , to their credit understanding .
They appreciated the honesty and the chance to save their expensive new property .
We say thanks and stand back as they enter the flat ...
Now , you know that scene from Ratatouille where the woman 's ceiling falls down and about 10,000 rats come flooding out of the house .
Yeah , like that but with Spanish and French people .
Some half naked , some fully .
All fucked up and running as if Robocop himself had just walked in .
I 've never seen so many bouncing dredlocks in all my life .
After about 5 mins it 's pretty quiet except for a shouting / whimpering exchange .
Then , just as things look like they 're coming to a close someone sprints past us heading for the flat , bumping us on the way :
' Wooohooooooooo ! '
The half naked guy pelts straight in ready to join the party .
About 3 seconds later he comes running out again , minus the woohoo .
So yeah , the karma is , he got kicked out , he lost many friends and fucked up his degree .
The one stand out moment , though was when my friends and I were sitting in my bedroom window a few minutes later .
I was enjoying the fact that I no longer had to face flat hunting at the worst time of the year or be homeless , while my mates were happy to be watching the spectacle .

( , Wed 27 Feb 2008 , 7:14 , OK , so I 'll get straight into it ... In 2002 I went to uni in Edinburgh .
Initially I was quite anxious as it was quite a way from where I 'm from ( NW England ) and I was the only one I knew going there , but it is a beautiful city and student life is great .
Turns out anyway , that Edinburgh uni does n't really present much of a cross section of Scotish society , being largely made up as it is of rich English people from Surrey eager to try out the snowy wastelands on Daddy 's tab .
Cue the end of 2nd year .
My group of friends and I are choosing who lives with who as we move from halls to flats .
My course is pretty intensive so 9 times out of 10 I would have to turn down any invitation for a night out / spliff / party .
Hence , my name was not too high up on people 's wishlist when it came to populating their soon - to - be uberparty - pad .
So I got lumbered with 3 other guys .
Now , two of these guys are fine , one ( Joe - a rather wealthy Surrey boy ) was unknown to me and , as you 'll see , turned out to be a bit of a shit .
We got lucky with our flat .
Super - close to the new Parliament and with 3 floors for 4 people , the rent was undervalued hugely because it was brand new and we were the first tenants .
Everything was gleaming - it was worth £ 500 k apparently .
Not bad for £ 270 pm each in Edinburgh .
So we got everything signed and went to our prospective homes for summer to work etc .
Except for J , who decided to hang around for summer and enjoy the festival .
The last I see of him is when I leave for home having just put all my coursework , architecture models , computer stuff etc in my room and locking the bedroom door behind me .
About a month later , I 'm heading up to Edinburgh with 2 friends .
We decided to celebrate my birthday by having a week in the festival .
Why not ?
I 've already paid for the rent .
On the train up I get a phone call from one of the other flatmates telling me he 's moving out .
' What ?!' says I , a tad surprised and concerned .
' It 's the flat , man .
It 's fucked up .
Joe 's fucked it all up ' .
Says he .
It does n't sound good .
So I tell him I 'll check it out for myself and not to tell Joe that I 'm coming .
We arrive in Waverly , walk the short distance to the flat and get ready for what awaits us .
The plan was set : go quietly straight up to my room on the top floor , leave our stuff then have a look around .
Up we go .
As I reach the top of the stairs I notice something different about my bedroom door .
There seems to be only half of it left on the hinges , the rest splintered across the floor .
Shit .
We go in to my room .
There 's three tussled but empty sleeping bags .
I step on a used condom .
I survey the room .
My flatmate 's description was accurate : it 's fucked .
The blinds have been torn and snapped off the wall .
The en-suite ( nice flat as I say ) - brand new until now - was a tip .
Piss everywhere .
Smears of what I can only assume to be shit along the shower walls .
The shower head is smashed and hanging like a New York payphone .
I open my wardrobe .
Coursework : crumpled into a ball .
Architecture models : completely decimated .
Computer : side has come off and one of my jumpers has be shoved inside it .
On inspection the insides have been smashed .
Time to see Joe .
We go down to the kitchen via the living room .
The living room is off the kitchen with double doors , so it 's pretty much one huge space .
Walking in , we see about 10 sleeping bags and a mattress ( we had no furniture at this stage ) .
In the corner is a comatosed Joe half on the matress , half on the floor .
His head being on the floor .
We step over him and enter the kitchen .
What followed was the most breathtaking site I 've ever seen ( including goatse ) .
Scattered amongst spilled beans and cans of beer were : 1 large pile of coke - the scale of which can only be described as ' Scarface ' , the remenants of about 50 lines , a bag of ketamine , 5 large bags of pills , 2 ( !! ) ounce - bags of weed .
Many discarded pieces of foil with burn marks ( I presume crack , heroin ) .
The fridge is ajar .
It 's full - to the point it wo n't close - of mushrooms .
And there , in the middle of all this , is one used syringe .
I walk over to Joe to wake him up .
His eyes are deep pink .
His expression on seeing me standing over him was a lot like the 2 girls 1 cup mammal thing on the front page .
Imagine your expression if your dad walked in on you wanking over a picture of your mum .
That 's the kind of shock / shame / fear in his eyes right now .
He stares at me .
I stare at him .
Finally he pipes up with , ' What the fuck are you doing in my flat ? '.
Come again ?' Get out , man .
This is my flat now .
You can fuck off .
Go find yourself another place to stay .
' This went on for a while .
Me pointing out the obvious , him still tripping off his tits telling me to get out of his newly - conquered territory .
I 'll cut this bit down as this is getting long ...
Basically , I looked for another flat .
Eventually , I realise I 've got a good one as it is and should n't have to be spending my birthday flat hunting because he decided to fuck up our current flat .
I decided I 'd better get the landlords involved .
We met the next day outside the flat ( we were staying at my mate 's in the meantime ) .
On the way we walked down Princes St . We saw something rather bizarre : some guy leaning forward off a traffic light post in the middle of the road ( think Titanic , king of the world scene ) staring at oncoming traffic as if wanting a fight .
He then lets go and runs straight at the oncoming cars .
Cue much beeping , running over bonnets , and narrowly avoiding a bus .
All while half naked and screaming ' Wahoooooo ! '.
Wierd .
But it is festival time .
Anyway , I explain everything to them .
They were shocked but , to their credit understanding .
They appreciated the honesty and the chance to save their expensive new property .
We say thanks and stand back as they enter the flat ... Now , you know that scene from Ratatouille where the woman 's ceiling falls down and about 10,000 rats come flooding out of the house .
Yeah , like that but with Spanish and French people .
Some half naked , some fully .
All fucked up and running as if Robocop himself had just walked in .
I 've never seen so many bouncing dredlocks in all my life .
After about 5 mins it 's pretty quiet except for a shouting / whimpering exchange .
Then , just as things look like they 're coming to a close someone sprints past us heading for the flat , bumping us on the way : ' Wooohooooooooo ! '
The half naked guy pelts straight in ready to join the party .
About 3 seconds later he comes running out again , minus the woohoo .
So yeah , the karma is , he got kicked out , he lost many friends and fucked up his degree .
The one stand out moment , though was when my friends and I were sitting in my bedroom window a few minutes later .
I was enjoying the fact that I no longer had to face flat hunting at the worst time of the year or be homeless , while my mates were happy to be watching the spectacle .

Karma , dish out your own .
A couple of years a go I found out my loving fiancée of 2 and partner of 6 years was fooling about with a lard ass fool at the local bar behind my back .
I hacked her email to discover she had changed a holiday we had booked and I paid for , got the travel agent to change my name for his on the tickets .
When I confronted her she denied everything , even when I showed her the ticket change as proof .
I could n’t believe that the bitch could look me straight in the eye and lie through her teeth without even blinking .
As it was my house I dumped her gear in the driveway while she was at work , changed the locks and as a parting gift I put Immac hair removal cream in her shampoo and pissed in her conditioner .
Come holiday time that I paid for , her and the new fat lad went away on my trip .
Now as I hacked her email I was able to reset her EasyJet account password and then was able to change flight details , you can see where this is going .
I never changed the outgoing flight but when they arrived at Malaga airport for the return flight they found themselves 24 hours too late .
Turns out the could n’t get another flight home for 2 days and as it was last minute had to pay £ 100 ’s extra for a seat .
On her return she bleated to the cops who came to my house and nicked me .
I ended up at the loal cop shop where all the coppers patted me on the back pissing themselves laughing saying that was the best revenge they had ever seen and telling me the bitch deserved it .
All I got from the cops was a caution from a grinning sergeant much to my ex’s dismay .
She wanted full prosecution to which the cops told her to look at her own 2 - faced actions .
2 months down the line the fat lad grew bored and kicked her out of his place too .
She now lives in a room above the crappy bar she picked him up in where as i now own the 3 bed semi and have a 23 yo girlfriend who i know would do anything for me .
Karma .... gotta love it .

What goes around , comes around .
Not really sure if this is Karma , but since when has that stopped anyone from posting a good tale ?
When I was about 10 , one of the houses that back onto my folk ’s place was owned by a local “ hard nut ” gangster - wannabe type , along with his wife and two kids .
Really nasty piece of shit he was .
Every Sunday , he had the same routine , he would drive his prized BMW 5 - Series to a pub a few miles away , have nine or ten pints with his “ well ’ard ” cronies , probably glass some poor fucker who looked at his pint funny , then drive home .
Once he got home , it would start “ MY DINNER ’S COLD YOU STUPID BITCH ! ” * SMACK * “ HOW MANY ” * SMACK * “ TIMES ” * SMACK * “ HAVE I ” * SMACK * “ TOLD YOU ” * SMACK * and so on .
It would then move on to “ AND YOU TWO CAN SHUT UP AS WELL ! ” * SMACK SMACK *.
You could hear this shit through two closed windows and a distance of about two hundred feet .
And it would last for hours .
His two kids went to my school , but kept having time off with things like “ measles ” , which they must have got a couple of times a year and “ the flu ” which caused mysterious swellings around their eyes .
So anyway , lovely guy .
One Sunday , he was down the pub as usual when he spotted a black kid walk past the afore mentioned Beemer .
Did I mention he was n’t exactly fond of the darker - skinned members of society ?
Well , he was n’t .
He comes flying out of the pub and accuses this kid ( who was about 8 ) of first trying to steal his car , then of keying it .
After hurling a bit of racist abuse about , he gives this kid a normally reserved for immediate family members slap and goes back to his drinking and general hardcuntness .
Ten minutes later little black kid arrives back in the pub , still crying , being dragged by his dad , points at knobhead neighbour and says “ that ’s him ” .
Guy goes up to big bully boy and says “ what the fuck do you think you ’re doing hitting my kid ” .
Bloke , safe in the knowledge that 1 ) He ’s well ’ard ( in his mind at least ) and 2 ) he ’s with 10 of his “ crew ” , turns to the guy and says “ Oh fuck off , you stupid n*****” ( radio edit for racism ) .
Father of crying child sticks the head on the racist , bullying prick , slamming him straight down to the deck .
One of the “ crew ” looks like he might intervene , but is stopped by a look from the now very angry father .
This angry bloke then proceeds to paint the pub with the guy who hit his kid .
He proper battered him .
He actually beat him so badly that he lost an eye and walked with a limp for the rest of his life , since he was pretty much paralysed down one side .
All while the guys “ crew ” stood and watched , shitting themselves in case they caught some of what he was getting .
Funnily enough , we never heard him hit his wife and kids after that , possibly because he could n’t anymore .
He moved out about 9 months later , since he could no longer afford the mortgage and , rumour has it , his wife took the kids and fucked off not long after , since she was no longer scared of him .
You lie down with dogs …

I work with a man who is utterly abhorrent .
He 's an arrogant American chap who , at Christmas , rammed his version of festivity down the entire office 's neck .
This included lots of tinsel , a singing nativity set and an advent calendar that he guarded WITH HIS LIFE .
So , one of the guys ate the largest chocolate ( designated for Christmas Eve ) and left

Karmic Retribution ?
I was 16 , severely messed up from events I do n't need to go into here , and pretty emotionally vulnerable , ( not to mention very immature ! ) - some of the reasons I got ensnared into a bizarre underworld which , by comparison , make the shenanigans of Shameless look pretty tame ...
I got pregnant at 16 , and , while in such a happy condition , my partner ( to give you a flavour of his lovely nature ) was basically shagging anything that walked , buggering off out of our flat at 6 am to go to his mum's with the only set of keys , so I was either forced to stay at home or wander the streets til he decided to come home ... he spiked my tea with lsd ' for a laugh ' , seduced his 15 year old cousin in our flat , sided with some of his mates who'd raped a girl by holding her down in turns ( which , incidentally , was so similar to the reasons I left home as could not tell my alcoholic mother / workaholic father ) ... I obviously did n't know the last fact til I was pregnant and had burnt all my bridges and teenage pride ... stupidly , one of the reasons I was attracted to him was because I thought he'd stop anything else evil happening to me ...
It culminated in him beating me up and locking me in the car one sunny August afternoon after I 'd asked for a few hours with friends instead of incessant baby care and housework - basically , even though they were all female , we were playing pool , I was 3 stone overweight , he accused me of playing around .
As we sped around the hole of the town where I grew up he told me he was going to knock me out and torch the car with me in it ...
There are n't many times I 've been so terrified - I did the only thing I thought I could and leapt out of the car - hey , better to kill yourself that sit by and let someone else do it .
I just vaguely remember seeing out of the corner of my eye the spreading pool of blood on the road and hearing people screaming ...
Fast forward a bit ( I have to , I 've lost months / years of detailed memories because of losing so many brain cells on the road - though , funnily enough , my dad says that 's what finally knocked some sense into me - every cloud huh ? )
He got it together with a younger girl ( I was 18 by the time of the accident ) and they had another baby .
The only time I saw him cry was when that baby was born ...
Before anyone starts yelling at me - this is NOT NOT NOT the karmic point ( although he , the stupid bastard that he is , thought it was god 's way of punishing him for being a C*nt )
She was born with Down 's syndrome - and is really badly affected by it ( I 've got a couple of mates with Down 's and you can only tell they have it by the physical characteristics - it affects different people to different degrees ) and as one of the side effects had hole in her heart .
Surgery to correct this caused alopecia , so little Beth is bald , she also has massive difficulties in speaking , so communicates part by speaking , part by sign language - my son ( there 's a 3 year age gap ) learnt it , so they always got on really well - she really loves her big brother .
Anyway , the Karmic Retribution for Charlie was Beth , not because of her genetic makeup - but because she 's the only woman who 's ever stood up to him .
Now , Beth 's perfectly able to have a conversation and know exactly what she wants , and is a loving and beautiful young lady - if you can be bothered to listen to her and learn to speak with her - but this guy 's way of bringing ( hauling ) up the next generation is to belittle , intimidate , bully and insult them .
He told me about 5 years ago he thought our son would grow up gay ( as if it mattered ) because he was always in clean clothes and had nice manners ....
So a strong minded , ' no - shit ' attitude little girl who has so far grown up to far out - weigh his 9 stone 5 ' 6 " frame seems to be just what he needed .
Seeing her thwack him one in his shins when he 's putting her , or someone she loves down , is quite heart warming ... and it makes me love her all the more for it ...
She takes no shit from him , she tells him like it is , seeing her one time tip a whole bucket of MuckDonalds fizz on his head as he was driving ( his un - mot'd , un- insured car , the toss ) when he was being his characteristic , knob - like self was hilarious .
She has no fear , she does not give a duck for social niceties , she 's never been worried by thoughts of ' scared of being rude to my dad even though he 's a bucket full of
She tells it like it is , and that is a gift , not a disability .
She 's the daughter I always wanted , feisty , strong minded , perfectly intelligent , ( just unable to communicate in the way than the majority of people can )
The icing on the cake is that she is the only person who can let him know what a fuckwit he is - and know that he does n't know what to make of it .
Heh , Beth rocks !
As a little p.s. my own son , Kieran finally got shot of his father about 6 weeks ago - he ( nearly 15 , skateboarding , guitar playing , Kurt Cobain lookalikee , friends with girls because they 're people too , and doing bloody well despite having such shits for parents thus far ) had a call from him , and nearly vomited when his father ( sperm donor ) informed him he was trying to impregnate a girl the same age as most of Kieran 's friends - 18 .
Kie put the phone down ... thought about it ... asked me and slimtallgoth 's opinion ... and promptly rang him back , and left the following message - you 're a f*cking paedophile and if you ever come near me I 'm going to rip a door off it 's hinges , ram that down your throat and shove the knob up your ar$e !
I do n't think Beth could have put it better herself .

Not entirely Karma but very close
My best mate at school was a young man who has gone on to be a successful Premier League Footballer .
Currently at Manchester City but previously of the mighty Aston Villa .
Anyway shortly after he established himself as a regular first team player at Villa we went out for a few drinks in Birmingham .
While stood at the bar we were approached by a local gent who proceeded to berate him for his latest performance which even my mate accepted was crap .
The tone of the conversation changed somewhat when this chap started complaining that the only reason he was picked was
" ' cos he was a n*****" .
The chap then went on to say how brilliant his son was and how he could do everything that my mate could do but he did n't get into the Villa setup cos he was n't a n*****.
This continued for a few minutes and my normally placid buddy was getting mighty irate , with all of this my son can do that you can't crap , and all the racist bullshit that was now being aimed at him he cracked and responded with a retort that still makes me smile .
He took his wallet out of his pocket took about a £ 100 quid out of it and promptly set it alight with another mates lighter .
" Bet he cant do that though can he , you redneck cunt " .
Hearing my god fearing mother loving chap come out with such a response left the whole of our group somewhat shocked .
Not as shocked as the redneck was though .
Racist twat .

The chap then went on to say how brilliant his son was and how he could do everything that my mate could do but he did n't get into the Villa setup cos he was n't a n*****. This continued for a few minutes and my normally placid buddy was getting mighty irate , with all of this my son can do that you can't crap , and all the racist bullshit that was now being aimed at him he cracked and responded with a retort that still makes me smile .
He took his wallet out of his pocket took about a £ 100 quid out of it and promptly set it alight with another mates lighter .
" Bet he cant do that though can he , you redneck cunt " .
Hearing my god fearing mother loving chap come out with such a response left the whole of our group somewhat shocked .
Not as shocked as the redneck was though .
Racist twat .

Looking after a friends pet is too much of a risk
This is n't my story but I feel it needs to be shared .
A mate told me of his friend 's dog-sitting experience ...
A family friend had asked her to look after the family pet Labrador whilst they were on holiday for a few weeks .
Seeing no particular problem with this she agreed and it was arranged that she would go to their house every day to feed and walk the dog .
Everything was going smoothly until a week or so in to the dog - sitting when she was alarmed to find it had died overnight .
Unwilling to bring the bad news to the family over the phone and ruin their holiday , she decided the best course of action would be to take the doggy - corpse back to her flat and hold it there until the family came home , so she loaded it up in to a suitcase and headed for the tube .
When she arrived at her stop , she found the escalator to be out of action meaning she would have to drag the Labrador suitcase up the stairs .
Already feeling quite uncomfortable with the whole situation , she tried her best to carry it , declining several offers of assistance .
After a while she admitted defeat and asked for help from the nearest passer by .
As they were walking up the stairs the man began to ask what she was carrying that could be so heavy .
Thinking on her feet she blurted out that the suitcase contained her boyfriends DJ equipment and she was carrying it across town for a gig he had that night .
At this point the not so friendly passer - by seizes the opportunity and makes off with what he thinks to be several thousand pounds worth of musical equipment .
Really it was just 80 lbs worth of dog .

It was a beautiful beautiful moment
Some years ago I was out of work for a while .
Most of the people at the DSS were OK , punctuated by the odd cunt .
On one occasion and only one occasion I missed my signing on time , and popped in the net day , apologising for not being able to make it the previous day
Cunt :
What 's you excuse ?
Me : Excuse !?
I can tell you the reason if you like ?
Cunt :
Go on then .
Me : My 18 month old daughter was throwing up , I could have come in , but there would be sick everywhere .
Cunt :
But you have to be available for work or interview .
Me : I am .
If I had an interview I 'd have arranged child care , but this was jut signing on .
Cunt :
But you have to be available for work ....
The cunt was in robot mode , and told me the next time my child was ill they 'd stop my payments .
Nice .
Anyway a few month later I 'm an IT Support Manager and all is right with the world .
2 years later I 'm interviewing for 4 - 5 new help desk people .. you know what 's coming .
In walks the cunt .
I could n't believe it .
I actually had to make my excuses and leave the room for 5 minutes to calm down , and THANK THE LORD .
No doubt some others on here would have wreaked long winded and complicated revenge .
I just explained to cunt that I was someone who'd been on the receiving end of her ' customer service skills ' at the DSS and there would n't be a place for here .
She demanded to know the details , but I told her ' I 'm not going to waste my time on this ' and ended the interview .
All with a fucking huge grin on my face mind .
So there you have it .
For those couple of minutes my universe was wonderful ordered place run by a benevolent divine power .

bullying chicken
My family used to keep chickens , and there was one rooster who was a terrible bully , always pecking the others and harassing them .
But karma got him in the end .
The other chickens staged a coop .

I think I have finally come around
I got married early and had a reasonable job ( working with Doctor When ) with reasonable money , our own place ( rented ) and a rock club at the end of the road ( XLs in Edgbaston ) .
Every few months we'd get a performance related bonus of a few hundred quid ( back mid-90s it was good money ) every four months and life was sweet .
Then my ex fell out with her boss and the income dropped .
She could n't find another job and as we were just above the benefit line , we got no help .
I changed jobs for a percieved improvement in pay but lost the job as it was a contract and they did n't need to give me any notice .
The only job I could find was at my dad 's engineering firm so ended up working 12 - hour shifts from 6 pm till 6 am , back breaking work although it did improve my upper body strength ...
Then her mum became ill with Motor Neurone disease ( like what Stephen Hawking has ) and we moved down to Cornwall to look after her .
She died very quickly and as it was where she grew up , my wife of the time did n't want to move back up to Birmingham .
I could n't get a job anywhere - all the electronics industry was miles away and I had no car to get there .
To get a job in the deep SW at the time you needed to be in the tourism industry or self - employed tradesman .
We were stuck both living with her parents .
Eventually the only place I could get a job was at Flambards ' theme park for the summer season , and for a pittance .
The people were mainly pleasant but I was cooking in the SW sun all day and my eyes felt like they were hot gritty marbles because we were n't allowed to wear sunglasses .
Eventually a company relocated to the town and I got a job in electronics again , assembling equipment .
Not great , but I learned stuff and the people there were generally nice , including my best mate down in Cornwall who I still keep in contact with 11 years later .
However we were under threat of eviction from my wife 's dad who , at the time , turned nasty after his wife had died and was making a grab for all the money she saved while he spent all of his .
My daughter was born at this time and he was persuaded by the wife 's older brother to let us stay while paying rent but he got us out eventually , sold her childhood home and pocketed the cash after burning his wife 's will which left the house to my wife .
We rented a place in town but the wife was sufferring from all the stress and developed two auto - immune diseases triggered by the hassle .
She was in hospital and almost died .
Eventually we managed to get a place of our own on an affordable mortgage for part - own through a housing association and wrote her dad out of our lives .
But all the stress and pain caused my ex to lash out on the only person she felt would put up with it - me .
I for my part had become sullen and withdrawn and unresponsive which made her madder .
I played my part in the downward spiral of destruction .
Hands up .
By the time my daughter was four I 'd been through years of hostility , anger and frustration and our relationship was torpedoed .
I moved out and lived in a pitiful bedsit earning toss - all money and having to live on beans and sausages on toast - 1 meal cost about 30 p - to pay for rent and the mortgage on my daughters ' place .
I had to get a better job to be able to afford my divorce and the only option was contracting up in Cheshire - but it was 350 miles away from my daughter .
For three weeks out of four I 'd try to come down to Cornwall with a car given to me by my dad ( a huge Volvo estate ) and do the 700 - mile round trip to see her .
I was exhausted permanently but gaining experience and had some peace during the week .
Me and my wife got divorced amid the usual acrimony but because I was coming to see my daughter every fortnight she let me ( and still does ) crash on the sofabed so we learned to mainly get on , if very uncomfortably , with the occasional fall - out .
Then that contract came to an end and I was out of work for three months , during which timke the lease terms on my new car meant I owed £ 1000 and they reposessed it , screwing over my credit record for years to come .
I had to move back in with my folks , and anyone who has moved abck in with their parents will know it 's hardly ideal and causes friction .
I was driving 90 miles a day , 5 days a week to get to work and celebrated my 30th birthday with no money at all .
Miserable .
The new job was closer than Cheshire so my trips to see my daughter became bi-weekly plus holiday time in the summer , easter and christmas .
I was on a lower wage but respectable - I cruised for a few years doing this while the company that employed me contracted me out to a car maker in the West Midlands for more and more each year based on my growing exp[erience and skills but passed on very little of their increase .
I started getting depressed and took days off for being ill - this came and went on - and - off for years .
The turning point came when I moved in with friends from work - we had a shared house and the social suport of having friends to come home to after work instead of a silent house and the cheap cider .
I cheered right up , even with the occasional relapse .
I then tried to leave my company and go to work for the bigger client direct but I was backstabbed and prevented and found myself in a hellhole role which plunged me back into despair .
After a year I started looking in earnest for another job and found one working out in Peterborough - a 140 mile round trip but in a calm , clean , decent position , but boring - I had been so hyped up for difficult work I found this well - paid sedentary work difficult to adapt to - then I got a call from a manager I used to work for briefly a few years before - he had a role to fill and would I like to come and talk to him about it ?
I went to see that fellow and came away determined to go there .
After giving a months ' notice I went .
I had to drop a couple of pounds an hour pay but the job was the best ....
Now my ex is calmer , happier and my daughter is 11 and relatively well adjusted , all things considered .
I still come down every fortnight but now I often get to borrow a car from the work development fleet of prototypes ( for which they pay for the fuel ) and I 'm getting paid enough to be able to treat my daughter and even my ex occasionally .
I 'm happy in my job and am privelidged to be able to drive the cars .
Karma has paid me back in spades .
( Oh , I now work at Aston Martin BTW ... nothing cheers up a bod than a weekend with a DB9 or a Vantage , unlimited petrol and 700 miles of driving a posh car )

Have a look on Friends Reunited
And that 'll disabuse you of any delusions that karma could exist .
For example :
1 ) Nobby Smith - the school bully who kicked you in the knackers and stole your sandwiches almost every day .
He failed all of his GCSEs and got arrested for GBH .
Now he 's happily married with kids and has his own carpentry business earning more than you .
2 ) Vincent Bodkin - brainy kid whose parents were both university professors .
He was bullied mercilessly for years on account of his large head and thick specs and went on to get five As at a level .
Now he 's dead - cancer of the colon aged 31 .
3 ) ' Chip - pan ' Katy - daughter of unemployed scumbags , she was a slag who'd toss off anyone for a Curly Wurly and who got pregnant aged 14 by a man she met outside a pub .
Expelled for sniffing glue .
Now she 's a lottery winner living in Mauritius .
4 ) Bruce Legover - handsome but utterly ignorant football player with the charm and presence of a fart .
Treated girls like shite and bullied boys who did n't line up to be on the team .
Now playing for Man United on £ 100 , 000 a week .
Fuck karma .

Prince set for ' secret hip replacement '
The Age Melbourne - February 26 , 2008 - 10:17AM
Fingers crossed ... pop star Prince reportedly requires hip replacement surgery .
Pop singer Prince - who released his first album in 1978 - is being forced to undergo the surgery at just 49 - years - old after suffering excruciating pain as a result of years of blistering performances .
A source told Britain 's News of the World newspaper : " For months Prince , who always puts on the most energetic shows , has been complaining of pain every time he moves .
" He is totally crushed because he knows he will never be the same again . "
The surgery will involve removing the ball and socket of Prince 's damaged hip and replacing it with a titanium joint .
What with all the fuss about the Purple Pain a few weeks ago , I thought B3ta should be the first to know . . .
I should n't giggle , but man - * that 's * karma . . .

Instant Karma , just add idiot
This only happened last weekend , I went down to MotorWorld with my brother as he was looking to buy a car stereo with all the bells and whistles .
He found one , that had bluetooth on it and in his infinite wisdom decided to scrap CD 's and continue playing his awful R 'n ' B from his phone , through his huge boom box via bluetooth .
Now , the thing with my brother is he is a bit* of a slag , i mean he usually has 3 - 4 girls in his company , and he 'll sleep with one until she gets boring and then move on to the next and then repeat the whole process and the poor naive young girls have no idea what hes up to !
well one of the cooler features of his stereo is the option to put a call through your speakers via bluetooth and my brother was giving one of his girls a 125 point inspection when his phone rings and is automatically put through to the stereo !
( your supposed to accept the call but somehow it happened automatically , i suspect this was karma playing its part )
and who is on the other end ?
one of the other girlfriends , and when his current girlfriend heres the call coming through the sub she starts yelling and demanding who it is etc..etc , but of course the girl who had phoned him can now hear this girl who is in the car and she starts yelling and demanding and then she hangs up and the girl in the car gets out ... without her knickers she had left them in the passenger footwell and stormed out ,
unfazed my brother puts said knickers in the glove compartment of the car and drives around to another of his girlfriends houses to sate his sexual frustration .
She gets in the car and asks if she can put a CD on he agrees and she opens the glove compartment to get a CD .....
you could n't make this kind of crap up .

Icy Goodness
One cold and snowy day , I was amongst a bunch of commuters walking out of Marylebone Station in London - the forecourt was covered with a sheet of ice and it was extremely tricky to find a way across .
Subsequently , we were all picking our way very slowly and probably looking like a selection of mongs .
Some twunt in a pin-striped suit ( there 's a lot of 'em here ) was obviously pissed off with our tremulous progress and pushed past , shouting , " Excuse me ! " and tutting loudly .
Rather predictably ( although not to him , obviously ) his doom was close at hand .
The ice and his speed combined to make him slip in the best way I have ever seen anyone do it - both legs raised high up in the air , where he seemed to hang for a delicious amount of time , before smacking down very heavily onto his arse .
I am proud of my fellow commuters - they joined me in pointing at him and laughing in a loud and prolonged manner ( no mean feat when also trying to maintain one 's balance ) .
Watching him slip over again when trying to stand up served only to increase our joy .

Karma 's a bitch
I 've been lurking for years now , and only recently realised that I 've had story for nearly every QOTW so far .
So I 'm finally IN .
So I left the girlfriend 's place early one morning after getting in late and it'd been raining .
As I stepped over the gutter I noticed a worm wriggling about in the stream .
Feeling sorry , I lifted it out with a key and carefully put it down on the grass footpath .
As I look up I see a glowing AUD $ 50 note on the road .
I run over and claim my Karmic prize .
As I cross the road to my car , I see another worm in the opposite gutter .
" What the hell " I think , and lift him to his muddy salvation with his mate .
As I turned to go back to the car , something caught my eye .

( , Tue 26 Feb 2008 , 13:48 , I 've been lurking for years now , and only recently realised that I 've had story for nearly every QOTW so far .
So I 'm finally IN .
So I left the girlfriend 's place early one morning after getting in late and it'd been raining .
As I stepped over the gutter I noticed a worm wriggling about in the stream .
Feeling sorry , I lifted it out with a key and carefully put it down on the grass footpath .
As I look up I see a glowing AUD $ 50 note on the road .
I run over and claim my Karmic prize .
As I cross the road to my car , I see another worm in the opposite gutter .
" What the hell " I think , and lift him to his muddy salvation with his mate .
As I turned to go back to the car , something caught my eye .
Another $ 50 note on the road .

Karma is the best teacher
The house that I grew up in backed onto an old stately home which was owned by the council .
During the time we lived at that house the stately home went through many various uses .
At one time it was a hospice , then an old people ’s home and then , for about three years , was a day centre for the handicapped .
I was about 10 at this time – my brother was about 18 .
Everyday the kids and adults would arrive in their yellow bus and spend the day playing games and learning life skills with their friends .
During the summer I would often jump over my fence and play football with the more able bodied .
Once in the winter we had a massive snow fight .
I became friendly with a lot of them ( and still am ) and was allowed to join in the games and help the care workers .
They may have had a tough break in life but they were lovely people with the biggest hearts I have ever known .
My brother on the other hand was a complete cunt to them .
At every possible occasion he would gleefully shout out spastics , window lickers etc .
He would spend his days finding new and inventive ways to upset them for his own enjoyment .
It started off with verbal abuse but it finished quite seriously .

Pedestrians crowd fifth avenue as the holiday weekend approaches and temperatures reach the mid 40's in the metropolitan area Friday , Dec. 22 , 2006 in New York .
Men are more tolerant of discrimination than women are , but both tend to accept prejudice against some immigrants and Arab - Americans , according to a new study .
The results come from telephone and online surveys of more than 3,300 people conducted in 2002 by University of Southern California researchers .
Each of the questions dealt with a form of discrimination that targets a distinct class of people .
Here are some details of the overall findings :
- A larger percentage of men than of women accept discrimination , in general .
For example , men on the phone were 7.6 percent more likely than women to tolerate discrimination against the obese and 8.9 percent more likely to accept racial profiling of African - American motorists .
- The “ sex gap ” – that is , the difference between the percentages of men and women accepting discrimination , as a percentage of their average – was smallest when it came to discriminating against Arab - American airplane passengers and greatest in regard to African - American motorists , among those surveyed by phone .
- The highest percentage of people in both the phone and Web surveys accepted discrimination against “ poorly educated immigrants ” ( 27.7 percent and 32.3 percent , respectively ) , followed by acceptance of discrimination against Arab - Americans ( 26.4 percent of phone respondents , 17.8 percent of online respondents ) .
- Respondents were least likely to accept discrimination against the genetically disadvantaged , or people who are revealed via genetic testing to be at high risk for diseases that require expensive medical care ( 6.7 percent of phone respondents , 3.2 percent of online respondents ) .
- Men were 19.6 percent more likely than women to tolerate discrimination against the obese and 17.4 percent more likely to accept racial profiling .
Edward J. McCaffery , a USC law professor , who co-authored the study with Timur Kuran of Duke University , said that an individual who sees nothing wrong with certain kinds of biases will often find others objectionable .
“ Many political struggles of our time , in the United States as elsewhere , amount to clashes over the appropriate boundary between permissible and impermissible forms of discrimination , ” McCaffery said .
“ We have found that , while discrimination in its traditional forms – based on race and gender – may be receding somewhat , discrimination in other domains , as based on appearance , persists .
Study design and results
Respondents to the telephone and online surveys were presented with five scenarios , each of which dealt with a form of discrimination targeting a distinct class of individuals : Arab - American airplane travelers , seriously overweight people , the genetically disadvantaged , poorly educated immigrants and African - American motorists .
All questions used the same format , first explaining a controversy and then providing a statement in favor of discrimination followed by a consideration of justice .
An overwhelming percentage of the respondents chose the equality position in every category .
“ As a matter of practice , people morally opposed to discriminatory policies based on reviled forms of prejudice do not insist on equal treatment for everyone , in every context , ” McCaffery said .
“ The surveys reported in this article validate this poorly appreciated fact in reference to several matters of political importance .
In addition , they show that expressed attitudes toward discrimination vary by sex as well as context . ”
The results will be detailed in the June issue of the journal Political Research Quarterly .
The research was funded by the USC - Caltech Center for the Study of Law & Politics .

Here we get the news : " The Baghdad military command said Tuesday that unauthorized vehicles and motorcycles will be banned in the capital from 5 a.m. to midnight Wednesday .
The vehicle ban is aimed at preventing violence on the fifth anniversary of the capture of Baghdad by U.S. troops about a month after the war started ....
The boom of explosions could be heard across much of Baghdad , apparently coming from the neighborhood in eastern Baghdad .
Low - flying jets circled the center of the capital several hours before sunrise . "
WASHINGTON  The Federal Aviation Administration will add a runway version of traffic signals at 20 busy airports in the next three and a half years , the agency said Monday .
The signals are part of a program to keep taxiing airplanes or vehicles from intruding on runways where other planes are taking off and landing .
Reducing runway incursions has been a difficult problem for the F.A.A. as the tempo of airport operations has increased .
The system will use a computer to determine when a runway is in use , and then turn on red lights embedded in the pavement at each intersection .
Thus it would help to counter errors by pilots and controllers at the 20 airports , which include Kennedy International and Newark Liberty International , but not La Guardia .
The system could have prevented two close calls at airports in New York .
In July 2005 at Kennedy , a fully loaded Boeing 767 moved onto an active runway as a cargo plane , a DC - 8 , was taking off ; the cargo plane climbed steeply to avoid the passenger plane ’s tail .
In July 2007 at La Guardia , a controller mistakenly cleared a commuter plane to taxi across a runway as another jet touched down ; the controller told the commuter plane to hurry up .
First , looking at the turnout number ( 14 % ) , it needs to be noted that this is a low - ball number .
CIRCLE does n't just calculate the turnout within the Democratic Primary , they calculate it for the entire electorate .
Last night there were no exit polls for the Republican primary , making it impossible for CIRCLE to crunch the data on that side of the aisle .
So the 14 % comes purely from Democratic turnout , but it 's representative of the entire electorate .
If CIRCLE were able to add in data from the Republican turnout , that number would surely rise .
Second , because there were no exit polls at all done in Pennsylvania in 2000 or 2004 , we have no data against which to compare these numbers .
We can , however , make a few very good guestimates .
What we do know is that turnout doubled in Pennsylvania last night , and that in 2004 , the average youth " share of the electorate " was 9 % .
So in a year in which turnout doubled overall , young people gained a 3 % greater share of all voters than they did in 2004 .
So youth turnout yesterday was likely more than double what it was in 2004 .
As per usual , youth turnout also went heavily for Senator Obama .
According to CNN Exit polling , 18 - 24 year olds broke for Obama 66 - 34 % .
Among 25 - 29 year olds the race narrowed , though Obama still carried the cohort 55 - 45 % .
As I noted earlier in the week , Ohio and Pennsylvania are very demographically similar states .
If Obama was to win or be competitive tonight , he needed youth to turnout be a greater share of the electorate in PA than it was in OH .
That did n't happen .
In Ohio , the youth share of the electorate was 3 percentage points higher , at 15 % ( pdf ) .
There were likely a number of factors that kept youth turnout down .
There have been some reports of problems at the polling place , but a greater problem was likely the fact that many students - who have made up a disproportionately high number of young voters this cycle - missed the registration deadline , which bumped up against spring break , or they voted absentee in their home state during the previous contests .
There is also the matter of brain - drain .
Pennsylvania is one of the oldest states in the country , in no small part due to the fact that young college graduates leave the state to find work elsewhere .
In other states , college - educated young voters have played a large role in boosting youth turnout .
While it 's great news for Democrats , the Obama campaign , and youth activists that , in spite of those hurdles mentioned above , young voters turned out yesterday in greater numbers than every before , there was still room for growth .
Young voters in PA made up 21 % of the eligible electorate , so young people still did not vote in proportion to their share of the population .
There was a 9 % gap between what happened , and what was possible .
Look at previous contests and you will see that this gap has occurred time and again this primary season .
We 've seen big gains - double , triple , even quadruple turnout - in every single state , but with the notable exceptions of Iowa and New Hampshire , these numbers have lagged behind young voters ' share of the population .
Why is that so ?
In Iowa and New Hampshire , which saw the largest share of the electorate and the largest turnout rate , respectively , among young people , youth organizers were moving full - steam ahead .
Every 501c3 , c4 , and 527 was on the ground working to turn out young people .
This has not been the case in the rest of the primary contests and caucuses .
Progressive youth orgs just do n't have the budget to run full youth campaigns during the primary season and no one thought this contest would go past February 5th .
We were all caught unprepared for this and the youth vote in the remaining states is not turning out as much as it could be as a consequence .
There 's a strong argument to be made here that the Obama campaign , for all the incredible work that it has done in energizing young people , needs help .
It ca n't turn out the youth vote to the greatest degree possible on its own .
It will need the support of outside youth organizations like YDA , The League , Young Voter PAC and more .
If Obama donors who are maxed - out want to continue to help his candidacy , they could do a lot worse than directing some funds to these independent youth organizations that will be on the ground this cycle , and well after the polls close in November .
As I 've said in my book and many times in the past , Millennials are a larger generation than the Baby Boom , and research shows that if you can get someone to vote for a party in their first three major elections , you can lock in their partisanship for life .
Getting these young voters out now is about more than the Obama campaign .
It 's about building partisan loyalty and securing a progressive majority for the next 40 - 50 years .
That 's a worthwhile longterm investment .

Capt Hicks died a day after paying tribute to one of his men
The former Oundle schoolboy chose the latter .
It cost him his life , but won him a place in the regiment 's history .
Capt Hicks , from the 1st Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment , will receive the Military Cross .
It was August 2007 and he had been commanding C Company at a forward patrol base near Sangin in Helmand Province .
His commander was on leave and it was a mark of the respect he had already earned that the Army was prepared to put the 26 - year - old in charge .
The patrol base they were defending had been under ferocious attack for several weeks .
The troops were tired , getting little sleep and the previous day one of his men , Pte Tony Rawson , had been killed on patrol .
We knew he was under attack but that was the life that he chose and we have to accept that
Lesley Hicks
One of his last conversations was to convey a message of sympathy to the soldier 's parents .
Capt Hicks had been on the phone to his own girlfriend back in England when the Taleban attack began .
She heard the rockets coming in and he told her : " Sorry I have to go " .
It was to be the last words she heard from him .
Rocket propelled grenades , heavy machine guns and mortars hit the base .
Capt Hicks climbed up a forward control tower to co-ordinate the defence .
He was hit in the chest by fragmentation from an RPG , which injured five others .
Severely injured , he is reported to have told medics trying to treat him not to administer morphine so he could return to battle .
But his injuries were so severe , he later had to be airlifted to Camp Bastion where he died from his wounds .
Afghanistan was one of the regiment 's toughest tours
In a letter to Capt Hicks ' parents , 1st Battalion commander , Lt Col Stuart Carver , said : " I know nothing can ever compensate for the loss of your son , but you may draw some comfort from the fact that his action undoubtedly saved the lives of some of the men and inspired by his selfless example the attack was defeated . "
His mother Lesley said : " The welfare of his men was always uppermost in his mind .
" I think it was an element of the frustration , anger of what was happening and I can sum that up in sheer bloody mindedness .
" He was tired and he knew the men were getting frightened .
He would n't ask them to do something he was n't prepared to do .
" You only get news from his letters of what is in the media .
What we have learnt what we were getting was very understated if he was in danger he would n't let us know or he would skim over it .
" We got to know " being busy " meant being shot at .
We knew he was under attack but that was the life that he chose and we have to accept that . "
Capt Hicks grew up in Cambridgeshire and spent five years at Oundle school where he joined the Combined Cadet Force .
He passed out at Sandhurst in the top platoon and had served in Iraq before deployment to Afghanistan .
He was a fine soldier and he was a fine son and a brother .
But above all he was a fine man
Inscription to be put on Capt Hicks ' grave
His father , Alun , a former finance director for Bespak in King 's Lynn , said : " He lived life to the full and did n't hesitate when the chips were down , when an extraordinary response was required . "
Speaking before the medal announcement , he said : " We would be delighted if he received an award that is representative of the appreciation of the nation for men like David and the sacrifice they have to make .
" Having said that he will always be our hero ... nothing compensates for his life at the end of the day .
" The day he deployed to Afghanistan for the first time I had reason to go to his room to pick up some books or other .
" I asked him why everything was packed in boxes and he came back with a blunt reply : " If I was killed it is easier and convenient for you to collect my things . "
His family has decided the inscription to be put on his grave .
It will read : " He was a fine soldier and he was a fine son and a brother .
But above all he was a fine man . "
BBC East is making a documentary about the bravery of the Royal Anglians , to be shown later in the year .
Hillary Rodham Clinton might have the endorsement of two of the top Jewish names in Pennsylvania politics — Governor Ed Rendell and Rep. Allyson Schwartz of Philadelphia — but 70 other leading Jewish professionals from the Keystone State would rather see Barack Obama at the top of the Democratic ticket .
Josh Shapiro , the deputy speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives , drafted an open letter to the state ’s Jewish community on behalf of Mr. Obama , the candidate who boasts what Mr. Shapiro calls a “ 100 percent voting record on Israel issues . ”
In an interview , Mr. Shapiro said it ’s time to , “ as Jews , stand up and say how much we admire Senator Obama for condemning the words of his pastor and making sure he is Israel ’s ally in the Middle East . ”
The letter , which can be found online here at the Jewish news service JTA , praises Senator Obama at length for his recent speech on race and argues that he should n’t be held accountable for incendiary remarks made by his former pastor , Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr .
While we are profoundly disturbed by the unpatriotic , bigoted and anti-Semitic comments of the retired pastor of Senator Obama ’s church , we are moved that Barack stood up at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia earlier this month , and “ condemned in unequivocal terms the statements of Reverend Wright ” and expressed his own views on issues near and dear to the heart and soul of the Jewish community .
Specifically , in repudiating the remarks of his former pastor , Senator Obama said Reverend Wright “ expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country … a view that sees the conflicts in the Middle East as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like Israel , instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical Islam . ”
“ We respectfully ask that you stand with Senator Barack Obama and vote for him on April 22 , ” the letter ends .
Henri Barkey , chairman of the international relations program at Lehigh University in Bethlehem , Pa. , is an unpaid foreign policy adviser to the Obama campaign who affixed his signature to the letter .
Senator Obama has been “ misrepresented ” by his association with Reverend Wright , Mr. Barkey said , and Jewish people should hear the truth about Mr. Obama ’s pro-Israel policies from fellow Jewish people .
“ This is how American politics can get — very dirty and personal , ” Mr. Barkey said .
“ My sense in this day and age is you do n’t let anything fester .
You set the record straight , and perhaps that should have been done earlier .
When you do n’t respond quicker , people assume it ’s true . ”
WebTV Anecdotes
Two stories that should n't be allowed to fade out of history .
I also put a couple of old 30 - second TV spots up on youtube .
The wrong error message
In the late hours of September 17th , 1996 , the day before the WebTV service was scheduled to go online , a group of us ( Rick Daley , Lennart Lövstrand me ( Andy McFadden ) , probably Arnold de Leon , plus several others I can't remember ) had gathered in the operations center in 275 Alma St. , Palo Alto .
A collection of network operations and service software engineers were hanging around to bear witness to the official launch of WebTV .
When the fated hour struck , one of the netops folks , Bryce Jasmer , started to go through the registration process with his WebTV box .
As with any online service , we figured the good names would go quickly , so it was important to get in and register before The Masses signed up .
Besides , there was something nifty about being one of the first people to ever sign up on the " real " service .
Until this day , all accounts were " disposable " test accounts .
A few of us were standing around , watching him type , feeling giddy with anticipation and lack of sleep .
He 'd entered his name , address , and other personal information , and was typing in his user name .
This is the name used as the e-mail address .
He typed in " jazz " , so his e-mail would be " jazz@webtv.net " .
When he hit " enter " on the wireless keyboard , we heard the " whoom " sound that meant an error dialog was coming up .
All eyes turned to the screen .
To understand what happened next , it 's important to understand a little something about how the service worked .
WebTV was meant to be a family - oriented service , so it was important to screen all user names and other externally visible features for profanity .
It 's impossible to catch everything , but it 's not hard to catch obvious things .
The user names were compared against a set of regular expressions .
Regular expressions allow you to match against a pattern .
For example , " fu.* bar " would match against all names starting with " fu " and ending with " bar " .
With carefully - chosen patterns , you can catch and reject blatant instances while accepting words like " shitake " and " matsushita " that have a profane word embedded within them .
The same mechanism was also used to prevent users from selecting " forbidden " names , such as " postmaster " , " root " , " admin " , and " help " .
We had a text file that looked like this :
admin .*
User names may not start with " admin " .
postmaster
You 're not the postmaster .
poop
That 's a bad word .
weenie
That 's a bad word .
An entry had two lines .
The first was the regular expression to match , the second was the error message that would be displayed to the user .
The service code read the file , grabbing two lines at a time , and when a user name was entered it compared the name against every regular expression .
An error dialog was displayed for the first one that matched .
If nothing matched , the user name was accepted .
The code that read the file knew how to skip over comments .
It did not , however , give any special treatment to blank lines .
Someone had made some changes to the file with the profanity expressions , and while doing so had added a single blank line after the end of the " reserved " names and before the start of the profane words .
When the code read the filter list , it grabbed the blank line as the regular expression , and the word that followed as the error message .
As luck would have it , a blank - line regular expression matched anything .
It 's midnight .
We 're all a little punchy .
Bryce types in a user name , and the box responds with a very simple message ( click here to view ) .
We start laughing hysterically .
Other people come over , wondering what 's up .
We point at the screen .
They start laughing hysterically .
Over in a different building , Mark Armstrong ( the guy in charge of QA ) is sitting with Bruce Leak ( one of the company founders ) in front of a rack of sixteen WebTV boxes .
The setup , dubbed " racksville " , is connected via a video multiplexer to a large TV that is showing all 16 boxes simultaneously .
They 've started through the registration process with all of the boxes , using the infra-red keyboard to broadcast commands .
We call them up on speaker phone .
Us : " So , how 's it going ? "
Them : " Everything 's fine here . "
Us : " Oh , okay .
You might notice something when you register a box . "
Them : " Really ?
We have n't seen anything odd yet . "
Us : " You will . "
Them : " Okay .
We 're entering the zip code ... seems fine .
< more typing > < pause > WHOA !! "
The friendly dialog was now popping up on the screens of all sixteen boxes .
They suggested that maybe we ought to fix that glitch sometime soon .
We thought that was a fine idea .
We fixed the filter file , and eventually changed the code to recognize and ignore blank lines .
As far as I know the WebTV service never said " oh , f - - k " to any actual customers .
Ode to a cron job
When the service was still under development we had some daily scripts , run by a program called " cron " , that would generate reports .
The reports were run by a user called " production " .
This was n't a real person , and in fact any mail sent to " production " went to a few dozen people .
For a brief period , the report generator was malfunctioning and spitting out hundreds of error messages .
The " cron job " dutifully reported the full text to " production " , which meant that a few dozen people would get a rather lengthy collection of highly repetitive nonsense every morning .
It usually looked like a few hundred lines of this :
* HandleHTTPAction ( ) ReportUsage .c:975 ( unknown ) [ 6851 ] -/- 07/23 00:38:03 Missing " bytes - served " for action " http " * HandleHTTPAction ( ) ReportUsage .c:983 ( unknown ) [ 6851 ] -/- 07/23 00:38:03 Missing " visit-url " for action " http " * HandleHTTPAction ( ) ReportUsage .c:975 ( unknown ) [ 6851 ] -/- 07/23 00:38:03 Missing " bytes - served " for action " http " * HandleHTTPAction ( ) ReportUsage .c:983 ( unknown ) [ 6851 ] -/- 07/23 00:38:03 Missing " visit-url " for action " http "
This had been going on for several days , and the owner of the reports did n't seem inclined to fix it .
Late one night -- actually , early one morning -- I composed the following .
Lines starting with '>' are from the original message .

Many outdoor enthusiasts love to agonize over what belongs in their survival kit .
Here are the supplies that we think belong in a small pack for quick trips into the wilderness .
Of course , a GPS unit and a satellite phone would be handy , but this collection is meant to be a cheap backup for times when those items are damaged or inaccessible .
10 . High - Calorie Protein Bars
Hunting and fishing may be more trouble than they are worth .
You may burn more calories in search of prey than you would gain from eating their flesh .
Save yourself from some agony by packing a few snacks .
9. Flashlight
Flashlights can be seen by search and rescue teams from a great distance .
They are a great way to attract attention to yourself and could come in handy if you have trouble making a fire .
8. Whistle
When you are lost in the woods , signaling for help should be a high priority .
Blowing a whistle periodically requires much less energy than yelling and the high pitch sound may travel further .
7. Backpacker Hammock
In extremely hot or cold environments , protecting yourself from the elements is half the battle .
You can always disassemble it to construct a more elaborate shelter .
6. Water Purification Supplies
Drinking brackish water can do more harm than good .
By properly filtering and decontaminating your beverages , you can avoid getting in even more trouble .
5. Plastic Trash Bag
Thin and light , they are worth their weight in gold and have a plethora of uses .
Use them to catch rain , cut three holes to improvise a rain poncho , or windproof your shelter .
Bring several of them .
Trash compactor bags are the sturdiest .
4. First - Aid Kit
Medical emergencies are an even bigger deal than being lost .
Your kit should contain items to deal with serious injuries – not just cuts and scrapes .
Pack some Quick Clot or Celox to deal with serious bleeding , tweezers , a needle and thread , antibiotic cream , a bit of sunblock , and any special medications that you may need .
3. Metal Cup or Can
Staying hydrated is far more important than finding food .
With a metal container , you have the option of boiling the water to kill nasty microbes .
2. Butane Lighter and Tinder
Starting fires with a mischmetal flint in a dry climate is easy , but in wet weather , you may need a cigarette lighter and some flammable helpers to get your fire going .
Cotton balls covered in wax , solid backpacking stove tablets , or a flask of Bacardi 151 are all viable options .
1. Knife
Never leave home without one .
A sturdy blade is essential for building shelters , preparing food , making campfires and countless other tasks .

Freeman thinks virtual reality could be used as a tool to help patients test out their fears in virtual worlds like this one where avatars ride a virtual underground subway .
Paranoia is far more pervasive in the general population than anyone was willing to admit , a new study finds .
Mumbling and furtive glances seem to be everywhere .
In our daily interactions with others , we pick up on facial and other cues that help us judge whether or not to trust another person .
These judgments , however , are error - prone and can lead to exaggerated or unfounded fears about threats from others .
These paranoid thoughts can range from thinking strangers are looking at you critically , or that others are spreading nasty rumors about you , to the feeling that others are deliberately trying to harm you in some way .
" Paranoid thoughts are often triggered by ambiguous events , such as people looking in one 's direction or hearing laughter in a room , " said lead researcher Daniel Freeman , Wellcome Trust researcher at the Institute of Psychiatry at King 's College London .
This phenomenon can be tricky to study , Freeman said , because it 's difficult to recreate such social interactions in the lab .
" Virtual reality allows us to do just that , to look at how different people interpret exactly the same social situation , " he said .
Freeman and his colleagues equipped 200 volunteers with virtual reality headsets .
The volunteers stepped into a virtual London underground subway , where they walked around during the four - minute trip between stations .
Scattered throughout the train car were avatars that breathed , looked around and sometimes met a participant 's gaze .
One avatar read a newspaper and another occasionally smiled if looked at .
The participants reacted differently to the same avatars .
While the volunteers most commonly perceived the virtual train riders as friendly or neutral , nearly 40 percent of participants reported at least one paranoid thought .
" It is an excellent example of the importance of interpretation , " Freeman told LiveScience .
" Two people can see the same things but draw completely opposite conclusions . "
For instance , one participant said , " There was a guy spooking me out – tried to get away from him .
Did n’t like his face .
I ’m sure he looked at me more than a couple of times though might be imagining it . "
One woman reported , " Felt trapped between two men in the doorway .
As a woman I ’m a lot more suspicious of men .
Did n’t like the close proximity of the men .
The guy opposite may have had sexual intent , manipulation or whatever . "
Another participant reported perhaps a more threatening fear : " There ’s something dodgy about one guy .
Like he was about to do something — assault someone , plant a bomb , say something not nice to me , be aggressive . "
The researchers also evaluated the volunteers before entering the virtual train car .
Those who were anxious or worried or worst - case scenarios painters or had low self - esteem were most likely to report paranoid thoughts .
The research , funded by the Wellcome Trust , will be detailed in the April 1 issue of the British Journal of Psychiatry .
Chatting with Avi Bryant - Part 2 2007 December 22 , 20:36 h
And stay tuned !
I hope to have Evan Phoenix , Hal Fulton , Peter Cooper and Adrian Holovaty as my next guests .
Lot ’s of material to begin 2008 in great style .
As I always say – and Avi is competent pointing out -, Ruby has its drawbacks – most of them being improved on Ruby 1.9 , JRuby and Rubinius .
Avi gives us good reasons why Smalltalk is yet another great platform to learn , bringing back decades of evolution and maturity .
So , here goes , the unabridged version of the interview .
If you did n’t read it , take a look at Part 1 where we get to know more about Avi Bryant and his amazing product Dabble DB .
In Part 2
Avi goes a little bit more in elaborating his technology opinions and points of view .
It ’s a very insightful reading for every programmer .
AkitaOnRails :
Some people still try to make the case in favor of Smalltalk as it being the “ purest OO language out there ” .
Even this being a fact , do you think that this alone is compelling enough to make a case against every other language , like Ruby which is kind of a multi- paradigm language ?
I hope you ’re not pesky about ‘ language pureness ’ :-)
Avi Bryant : Actually , I am pesky about it – not from an academic or aesthetic point of view , but from a pragmatic one .
“ Pure ” languages make a lot of things easier : development tools , VMs , and infrastructure like distributed object systems or transparent persistence all get much simpler and better when you have a small , consistent language .
One experience I had , for example , was being hired to port my client library for the GOODS object database from Smalltalk to Python ; I spent a huge amount of time dealing with special cases in the Python semantics ( is this a class ?
a type ?
a new - style class ?
implemented in python or in C? ) that simply never came up in Smalltalk .
Ruby does pretty well here , better than most in the scripting language space – I would n’t call Ruby “ multi- paradigm ” , by the way – but it could stand to do better .
AkitaOnRails : I think you once said that you only consider a language “ finished ” when it is fast enough to extend itself .
This is very true for Smalltalk , Java and other platforms .
Ruby is undoubtedly lacking in its current position .
That was one of the reasons we now have parallel efforts like John Lam ’s IronRuby , Charles and Thomas ’ JRuby and Evan ’s Rubinius .
One of the most criticized points is that Ruby does n’t have a formal spec for the language or its core libraries .
You also said that the Java VM is not suited enough for Ruby as Strongtalk would be , for example .
Does this still hold today as we see JRuby 1.1 in the horizon ?
Avi Bryant :
It still holds .
JRuby currently seems to benchmark on par with MRI , and the best numbers from any Ruby implementation are maybe 3X MRI on average .
I think we can do 25X MRI for basic language feature benchmarks ( message sends , block evaluation , etc ) , which should be enough to make Ruby implementations of the standard libraries feasible .
Even if the net result was a similarly performing system , the side benefits would be extremely valuable .
AkitaOnRails : I remember that you started the Smalltalk.rb initiative a while ago , and if I am not mistaken it was an effort to make Ruby translate into equivalent Smalltalk code so it could run in any of the available Smalltalk VM implementations out there .
Is this project still going on , do you still think it is feasible to pursue such a goal ?
Avi Bryant : I still think it ’s a worthwhile and realistic goal .
The project is still going in the sense that I ’m still taking to people about how to make this happen , but I ’m not able to spend time writing code for it myself at the moment .
I have some reason to hope this project will progress more concretely next year , but we ’ll see .
AkitaOnRails :
Some time ago I read a snippet of an IRC transcript between you , Evan , Chad and even Charles .
You started talking about standardizing primitives ( they are C - based in MRI today ) .
My bet is that Rubinius is the project destined to be the “ next big thing ” for the Ruby community .
To me it seems that you and Evan collaborate a lot , is that correct ?
Avi Bryant : I would n’t say that , but Rubinius is certainly the Ruby project that most closely aligns with my own interests and goals at the moment , and it ’s great to see how much effort is being put into it .
Engine Yard also deserves a lot of kudos for their financial support of the project .
I have high hopes that the work Evan and crew are doing will be of great benefit not just to Rubinius but to all of the Ruby implementations – which is why I was advocating for a standard primitive set .
AkitaOnRails :
You know a lot of people , I wonder if you ever talked with Koichi Sasada himself to input some of your ideas for the YARV project as it ’s going to be the “ official ” Ruby virtual machine out there a few months from now .
Avi Bryant :
No , I do n’t believe we ’ve never spoken .
I would certainly love to meet him some day .
AkitaOnRails :
Then , we get one level up to applications .
Your Seaside framework is pretty amazing .
You ’re very right about WebObjects as well .
As a Java programmer I always pitied that it never got mainstream .
Today it ’s mostly relegated to Apple related websites , while lesser Java frameworks took the front .
Tapestry and Cayenne are trying to top WebObjects ’ features but seems they are nowhere near yet .
Do you still program some Java ?
What are your opinion on current mainstream frameworks as Spring , JSF ?
For non-starters , what was it in WebObjects that makes it different than the rest ?
Avi Bryant : I do n’t do any work in Java any more ( thankfully ) , so I ca n’t really give a qualified opinion on the state of frameworks there right now .
However , the main thing I think WebObjects did right was to focus on the state and behavior of the application , rather than on the mechanics of URLs and HTML and HTTP requests .
So rather than worry about what a field was named , you would just say “ this field is bound to this instance variable in my model ” , and rather than worry about what URL a link went to , you ’d say “ this link triggers this method on my page object ” .
Transitioning between pages was done by constructing a new page object and setting it up directly in Java , rather than constructing a URL that was going to be parsed to build a page .
That directness and general style is something that very heavily influenced Seaside .
AkitaOnRails :
Many people may not immediately understand as it as a word that is new to most of them : “ continuations ” .
Meaning that instead of manually controlling the flow between events , with manual marshaling and unmarshaling of objects , you program as a cohesive and continuing flow .
Can you explain this in a way that a novice would understand ?
What are the benefits and drawbacks of this approach ?
Avi Bryant :
Well , it ’s really all about being able to get modal behavior in a web app .
In a desktop application , for example , you might occasionally have a call like “ file = choose File ( ) ” or “ color = pickColor ( ) ” that opens a modal dialog , gets a result from the user , and keeps going from there .
Seaside ’s use of continuations is just to allow exactly that kind of interaction in the context of the web .
The tricky bit is that because of the backbutton , the user might go pick a different color from the same dialog later , and the “ pickColor ( ) ” call has to return a second time .
This is confusing to think about , but mostly it Just Works .
From an implementation point of view , what we ’re doing is saving a copy of the stack at the point the call is made so that we can come back to it later , more than once if need be .
AkitaOnRails :
You started these concepts in the Ruby land with IOWA .
Once upon a time there was a framework called Borges that was also discontinued .
Then Koichi mentioned taking continuation support from the next Ruby .
Do you think the Ruby land is giving a step back with lack of support for continuations ?
Avi Bryant : Continuations are a great abstraction , and allow a lot of interesting experimentation with language semantics .
However , I would n’t consider it a tragedy if they disappeared from Ruby ; there are more important things to worry about .
From a web perspective , I think that AJAX is starting to replace a lot of the use cases where having server - side modal logic used to be important – Dabble DB , for example , barely uses Seaside ’s continuation features at all .
AkitaOnRails :
Your blog has a peculiar name , HREF considered harmful .
You probably got your inspiration from Edsger Dijkstra / Niklaus Wirth ’s Goto Statement Considered Harmful paper where Edsger made his famous case against GOTO .
At the assembler level it is impossible to not JMP all the time ( at least not without some macro help ) but at a C level you can avoid GOTO ’s altogether .
Even Basic had both GOTO and GOSUB and you could just ignore the former .
I am being simplistic here , but now you ’re kind of saying that URLs play a similar role in a way that they disrupt the normal flow , going back in unpredictable ways and so on .
On the other hand the Internet would not be what it is without URLs .
How do we deal with this conundrum ?
Avi Bryant : I do n’t think it ’s a conundrum .
I think your analogy is a good one : it ’s impossible to not JMP all the time , and it ’s also impossible not to use URLs all the time , but we do n’t have to always be aware of either one .
Back when everyone wrote in assembler , people probably obsessed about having meaningful or “ pretty ” JMP labels the same way they obsess about having pretty URLs today .
I think we need to allow ourselves to make the same leap up in abstraction level on the web that we did with higher level programming languages .
That ’s not to say we should never be thinking about URLs : any website needs to export meaningful URLs to be referenced and used externally , just like any C library needs to export meaningfully labelled function names so that it can be linked into other programs .
But that ’s as far as it needs to go .
AkitaOnRails : Components were a big deal in the early 90’s , with RAD tools and so forth .
Today it seems that they are showing up slowly , with initiatives as JSF and ASP .
NET .
Rails initially packed a very crude support for ‘ components ’ but it was dropped very early on as a bad thing ( because of the jury rigged way it was implemented ) .
Nothing new came to replace it what feels like there was n’t enough need for it at the Rails level .
On the other hand Seaside is heavy in componentization .
Can you expose a little bit about the differences in this approach ?
Avi Bryant : “ Component ” is one of those terms like “ MVC ” or “ open ” that gets used to mean so many different things it ’s hard to talk seriously about it .
One concrete feature of Seaside ’s approach is that each piece of UI is quite independent of what other pieces of UI may be on the page .
There ’s no central controller which is responsible for request processing , choosing a template , or so on – all of those responsibilities are distributed among many smaller objects .
There ’s also no chance of naming conflicts because you do n’t directly name links or form fields , so you can have many copies of the same form / widget / etc on the same page without any confusion .
This allows a level of modularity that ’s very hard to reproduce in most traditional frameworks .
AkitaOnRails :
Another thing that might shock some people is that there is no traditional templating system in Seaside , no code mangling between HTML tags all over the place .
Instead all HTML is abstracted in a object hierarchy that renders itself .
In the Rails world there are a few alternatives that attempts some of that like HAML , Markaby .
What do you think are the fundamental differences ?
Avi Bryant :
The HTML rendering API is a very core piece of Seaside , and a huge amount of the framework was designed with that underlying approach in mind .
I think that ’s the main difference when compared with HAML or Markaby , which are meant to be dropped into other frameworks .
Once you get rid of templates and switch to programmatic HTML generation , the design space just completely changes , and you need to re-evaluate almost every other decision that you made – this was a process that I went through with Seaside between the initial release , which used templates , and the 2.x versions , which do n’t .
So I think we ’ll have to see a framework that takes , say , Markaby as a starting point and asks “ where can we go from here ” before we can make any real comparisons .
with Adrian Holovaty , from Django fame
AkitaOnRails :
You also touted the shared - nothing vs share - all dilemma .
And you obviously have a strong case because this is not just techno - babble but you do have a successful product running on top of that vision .
Do you still think it pays off to sacrifice a little bit of performance for more clean code and productivity ?
In a way it ’s sort of what DHH himself said about Rails when people said it was slower than PHP or Perl .
Actually this also has to do with your talk as being a “ heretic ” in a way that you ’re doing things in a different way than we all are now .
Can you elaborate on that ?
Avi Bryant : “ Share nothing ” is great advice for making the maximum use of your server resources .
For sites like yahoo.com or Facebook , that ’s clearly very important because your business depends on serving millions of users every day .
“ Share everything ” is really hard on your servers , but it makes maximum use of your developer resources .
For a startup like Dabble DB , where we have 4 developers , that ’s really important .
And since our revenue model only requires serving thousands of users every day , not millions , it ’s ok to spend a little more per user on server hardware .
It ’s been a very worthwhile tradeoff for us .
AkitaOnRails :
And speaking of DHH , you probably met in several occasions .
You ’re both opinionated guys with antagonist visions .
Smalltalk vs Ruby .
Seaside vs Rails .
Share - all vs Share - nothing .
One could feel tempted to draw you two as Superman vs Batman kind of dispute .
Though I know that smart people do n’t fight over pesky stuff .
What do you think of him and his ideas , how do you think both communities could cooperate if there ’s any chance for that ?
Avi Bryant : I have a lot of respect for David .
The only time I ’ve felt antagonistic towards him was this last summer at Foo Camp .
We were playing a game of Werewolf , and I was a werewolf and he was a villager .
Now , as a werewolf the best thing you can do is get the person nearest you to trust you , and that happened to be DHH .
And it worked – Kevin Rose was totally on to me but David managed to persuade him not to lynch me , and I ate them both and won the game .
Pn3d !
Anyway .
There ’s probably a lesson in there somewhere .
Also , in a fight between me and DHH , Neal Stephenson would win .
AkitaOnRails : Finally , Brazil still has a young and growing community .
Any closing regards for our audience ?
Avi Bryant : OlÃ ¡ and good luck !
I ’ve been told Rio is even more beautiful than my home of Vancouver , and I hope to visit some day .
Do n’t miss the TWiT podcast interview with Avi !
In advertising , superlatives rarely mean what they are meant to .
However , there are times when " truth in advertising " gets stretched beyond reasonable limits .
Case in point : the introduction of " unlimited " mobile data service plans by network providers such as Rogers ' new Unlimited On - Device Mobile Browsing Plan in Canada .
At first glance , the plan seems fairly straightforward : unlimited mobile data and Internet access for a mere extra $ 7 per month on top of your existing phone plan .
However , when you look a little more closely , the " unlimited " deal turns out to be anything but unlimited .
There is a limit of 2,500 sent text messages per month , and 1,000 picture or video messages , despite the fact that these too are " data " and should be unlimited .
Of greater concern is the fact that the deal only applies to select phones and does not include Blackberries , Windows Mobile devices , laptops using PC cards for mobile data access , or unlocked devices such as Apple 's iPhone .
The latter is still officially unavailable in Canada , but many wondered if the revealing of this " unlimited " plan was a clue that Rogers was about to announce that they had secured exclusive access to sell the iPhone in the Great White North .
This does not appear to be the case at the moment .
If you do n't have an approved phone , each of which require a three - year contract , charges will accumulate at CAN$ 0.05 per kilobyte .
Rogers does have data access plans for BlackBerry owners , but they top off at a paltry 1.5 MB of data per month .
Rogers calculates this to be a good deal by estimating web pages to average at a mere 4KB each , something far removed from reality .
Of course , unlimited plans that are n't actually unlimited are not unique to Canada .
Most US service providers also put a bandwidth cap on their " unlimited " plans as well .
And even for regular wired Internet access , most ISPs have hidden bandwidth caps .
Rogers has even been found to inject content into web pages to inform users that they are about to hit the bandwidth cap .
Suddenly " unlimited " starts to look very limited indeed .

Cisco posted a decent 2008 fiscal second quarter , yet remains gloomy about its near - term sales forecast in the US and Europe .
Revenue increased 16.5 per cent to $ 9.8bn , compared with $ 8.4bn year - over - year .
Net income climbed 7.2 per cent to $ 2.1bn , compared with $ 1.9 bn a year ago .
Operating income increased to $ 2.4bn from $ 2.1 bn a year ago .
The earnings matched average analyst estimates , which predicted revenue around $ 9.79 bn .
But investors seem more interested in the switching giant 's forecast , used as a gauge of upcoming corporate spending .
CEO John Chambers told analysts today that due to " factors out of our control or influence " he expects revenue to grow by about 10 per cent next quarter — below the company 's long - term expectations of 12 - 17 per cent growth .
Customers in US and Europe are currently " cautious , " according to Chambers .
" As we enter the second half of the fiscal year , our innovation pipeline is in excellent shape , our balanced product momentum across core and advanced technologies continues to be solid , and execution against our long - term strategy remains unwavering , " he said .
Three months ago , Chambers spooked the tech sector with liberal use of the word " lumpy " to forecast US corporate spending .
Cisco clearly fears it 's not out of the woods yet .
But Chambers said he 's optimistic about Cisco through a wide - angle lens .
This apparently did n't cheer investors very much .
While shares remained flat at closing , Cisco 's stock fell 7.5 per cent in after - hours trading . ®
Making language implementations easier
I 've noticed that the greater population of working programmers seems to consider designing and implementing a new programming language a black art that only large - corporations or super - gurus know how to do .
And really , it has traditionally been the case that an enormous amount of work is involved .
In the past , you had to know how to use parsing and scanning tools like lex and yacc ( or you built your own recursive descent parser from scratch ) , you had to use tree transforms to build an intermediate representation , then you either had to build a virtual machine that could run on the intermediate representation , or you had to compile the intermediate representation down to machine code .
And , of course , this is n't even counting things like various forms of optimization and type validation .
Even if you understand the theory involved very well , building out a language implementation like this takes a ton of work .
Fortunately for potential language designers , new tools and technologies have started making things easier .
Step 1 : Reusable Virtual Machines
The existence of widespread , reusuable VMs like the JVM and the .
Net CLR have made life a lot easier for language implementers .
Instead of having to design your own VM and implement things like garbage collection , JIT compilation , and virtual method dispatch yourself , you can just use a pre-existing implementation that has the virtues of being well - tested and highly optimized .
The advent of these VMs has led to a great variety of language implementations for them , such as Scala , Groovy , IronPython , JRuby , and F# .
But even with a virtual machine , there 's still a fair bit of work left for a language implementer to do .
You still have to do scanning and parsing , and you still have to generate all that bytecode from your abstract syntax tree .
Step 2 : New Parsing Technologies
Of course , if you 've been following parsers , there are a lot of cool technologies for making parsers a lot easier .
Parser combinators such as Parsec make parsing a lot easier .
In fact , there are quite a few ways to put together a parser fairly easily these days .
I saw several last week at Lang .
Net 2008 .
Roman Ivantsov presented a very cool new toolkit called Irony that makes writing a combined parser / scanner about as easy as writing a BNF grammar .
Harry Pierson presented some cool work he'd been doing with Parsing Expression Grammars in F# , and also was nice enough to suggest I go check out FParsec , an F# port of the Haskell Parsec library .
I 'm planning on spending some time trying out all of these over the coming months , to try and see which is the best fit for how I work .
I 'll try to post blogs as I work through some of these .
So that simplifies two out of the three hard parts , but what about building bytecode ?
Step 3 : The DLR is awesome for generating bytecode
The DLR contains a general - purpose system of expression trees ( a superset of the LINQ expression trees , if you 're curious ) that allow you to define not only simple expressions like x + 2 , but statements such as variable assignment , function definition , control flow ( loops and branches ) , and so on .
Once you construct a DLR expression tree out of these common constructs , it handles all the work of rendering your code to IL and just - in - time compiling it .
In other words , once you build an abstract syntax tree , you 're done .
Martin Maly from the DLR team has started publishing a lot of useful information on his blog on how to work with the DLR , but the easiest entry point may be to download the latest IronPython 2.0 alpha ( which includes the DLR ) and play with the ToyScript sample .
IronPython , the DLR , and ToyScript are all released under the open source Microsoft Permissive License , so feel free to reuse anything you see for your own purposes .
To give you some idea of what I 'm talking about , here 's the toyscript source for taking a binary operation expression off the parse tree and constructing an equivalent DLR expression tree .
protected internal override MSAst.
Expression Generate ( ToyGenerator tg ) { MSAst.
Expression left = _left .
Generate ( tg ) ; MSAst .
Expression right = _right .
Generate ( tg ) ; Operators op ; switch ( _op ) { // Binary case Operator .
Add : op = Operators .
Add ; break ; case Operator .
Subtract : op = Operators .
Subtract ; break ; case Operator .
Multiply : op = Operators .
Multiply ; break ; case Operator .
Divide : op = Operators .
Divide ; break ; // Comparisons case Operator .
LessThan : op = Operators .
LessThan ; break ; case Operator.LessThanOrEqual : op = Operators .
LessThanOrEqual ; break ; case Operator .
GreaterThan : op = Operators .
GreaterThan ; break ; case Operator .
GreaterThanOrEqual : op = Operators .
GreaterThanOrEqual ; break ; case Operator .
Equals : op = Operators .
Equals ; break ; case Operator .
NotEquals : op = Operators .
NotEquals ; break ; default : throw new System. InvalidOperationException ( ) ; } return Ast. Action .
Operator ( op , typeof ( object ) , left , right ) ; }
Operator is a ToyScript enumeration of all of the supported operators , while Operators is the DLR enumeration of all supported operators .
And , of course , if your language supports some exotic operators that do n't exist in the DLR , you can just generate a function call .
Does n't get much simpler than that , does it ?
So if you have a cool idea for a new language and you 're not allergic to the .
Net platform , consider trying out the DLR .
You 'll spend a lot less time implementing the back end for your language , which will leave you more time to concentrate on whatever interesting new characteristics you want your language to have .

( CNN ) --
A former Wal - Mart employee who suffered severe brain damage in a traffic accident wo n't have to pay back the company for the cost of her medical care , Wal - Mart told the family Tuesday .
Debbie Shank , 52 , has severe brain damage after a traffic accident in May 2000 .
" Occasionally , others help us step back and look at a situation in a different way .
This is one of those times , " Wal - Mart Executive Vice President Pat Curran said in a letter .
" We have all been moved by Ms. Shank 's extraordinary situation . "
Eight years ago , Debbie Shank was stocking shelves for the retail giant and signed up for Wal - Mart 's health and benefits plan .
After a tractor - trailer slammed into her minivan , the 52 - year - old mother of three lost much of her short - term memory and was confined to a wheelchair .
She now lives in a nursing home .
She also lost her 18 - year - old son , Jeremy , who was killed shortly after arriving in Iraq .
When Debbie Shank asks family members how her son is doing and they remind her that he 's dead , she weeps as if hearing the news for the first time .
Wal - Mart 's health care plan lets the retail giant recoup the cost of its expenses if an employee collects damages in a lawsuit .
And Wal - Mart set out to do just that after Shank and her husband , Jim , won $ 1 million after suing the trucking company involved in the wreck .
After legal fees , the couple received $ 417,000 .
Wal - Mart sued the Shanks to recoup $ 470,000 it paid for her medical care .
However , a court ruled that the company could only recoup about $ 275,000 -- the amount that was left in a trust fund for her care .
The Shanks appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court , but the court declined in March to hear the case .
CNN told the couple 's story last week , prompting thousands of angry blog responses and at least two online petitions to boycott the company .
On Tuesday , Wal - Mart said in a letter to Jim Shank that it is modifying its health care plan to allow " more discretion " in individual cases .
Watch Wal - Mart reverse its decision »
" We wanted you to know that Wal - Mart will not seek any reimbursement for the money already spent on Ms. Shank 's care , and we will work with you to ensure the remaining amounts in the trust can be used for her ongoing care , " Curran said .
" We are sorry for any additional stress this uncertainty has placed on you and your family . "
Wal - Mart 's reversal came as shock to Shank .
" I thought it was an April Fool 's joke , " he told CNN .
" I ( would ) just like to let them know that they did the right thing .
I just wish it had n't taken so long , " Shank said .
" But I thank them and I hope they come through with all that they said they 're going to do .

The usual suspects : George Clooney , Brad Pitt and Matt Damon .
The plot : rob a casino .
The method : hijack the vault 's security camera video stream and replace it with a static image .
" Fiction ? " I do n't think so .
This post is not going to be about how to hack into the video surveillance networks of your local government but rather about my personal opinion about the current state of security implemented by the latest video technologies .
I hope that the post is as entertaining as enlightening and helpful in your work .
I also hope that it gives you the edge to go ahead and implement better , more secure surveillance systems that will actually protect whatever needs to be protected .
Over the past week , I 've been heavily involved with exploring several techniques for attacking IP - based video cameras .
Apart from the usual vulnerabilities that you find across these types of embedded devices ( XSS , CSRF , Authentication Bypass , Brute force attacks that really work , Overflows , etc. ) , I 've come up with some quite interesting observations , which may come as a no-surprise to some of you , but nevertheless they worth to be mentioned as we are often unable to comprehend the simplicity of the matter ) .
So here you go :
The concept of TRUST is fundamentally broken !
Simply put , there is no way of knowing whether the camera on the other end is the device that is expected to be .
Currently , there is no trust model that is implemented by IP - base video surveillance systems .
The attack method is rather simple .
Go ahead and disconnect the camera and hook a notebook on its place .
Done !
The Video surveillance software will never know that the camera has bee replaced by a static video stream produced by another device .
" Is that surprising ? " I hope not because this is the reality .
The next time you watch a movie where the bad guys replace a video stream from the security surveillance system by hooking a device to the network , count it as a real and very possible hack !
Installing rogue video cameras is easy !
Many of the IP - based video surveillance solutions are based on simple discovery protocols such as mDNS and UPnP .
Both of them work on multicast addresses .
Therefore , it is extremely easy to fake as many cameras as we want .
Here is how to do this .
The [ register .
py ] ( / files/2008/01/register.py ) script will register a brand new AXIS 206 camera , while the [ server .
py ] (/ files/2008/01/server.py ) will feed MJPG video stream from an external source .
This is how we use them :
register .py **[ your mac address here ] ** & server .py
http://152.1.130.216/mjpg/video.mjpg
**# MJP video stream **
Keep in mind that we can register as many video cameras as we want and as such cause a panic or a simple misdirection .
We can also do funky thinks like making the video surveillance system to believe that the camera at the back of the casino is actually the camera installed at the entrance ?
Computer networks are vulnerable to all sorts of attacks : ARP spoofing / hijacking , rogue DHCP servers , rogue DNS servers , routing issues , subnet hopping , eavesdropping , etc .
The list goes on and on .
In order to mitigate these problems , we often rely on higher ( mostly level 7 ) encapsulation mechanism that guarantee the integrity of the lower encapsulation levels ( think of SSL ) .
IP - based surveillance systems simply does not have these types of security layers yet .
They are largely based on the assumption that no one has access to the network where these devices are located .
It might be harder to physically access a video network , but it is not impossible .
Think about it .
Every camera is a potential entry point , no matter how high on wall you will put it .
Given the fact that a lot of these video surveillance systems have WiFI these days , the situation becomes even more concerning .
Administrative functions are handled over ancient security mechanisms
All embedded devices can be accessed via their HTTP server with the need of Basic Authorization credentials .
Basic
Auth is sniff - able and easily reversible - able .
This is why it is called basic .
Moreover , it can be easily used for stealing access credentials of the video surveillance system .
For that to work , the attacker needs a fake " credentials - hijacking " camera .
The [ stealing_server.
py ](/files/2008/01/stealing_server.py ) script part of the PoCs comes into play .
This is how we launch the attack :
register .py **[ your mac address here ] ** & stealing_server.py
http://152.1.130.216/mjpg/video.mjpg
" AXIS 206 " 5 **# MJP video stream , realm AXIS 206 , 5 consequent tries **
Upon execution , the register .py will register a new AXIS 206 camera .
Then the stealing_server .py will activate .
It wo n't take long until the video surveillance software calls for video initialization .
At this stage a Baisc Authentication realm will be provided .
Since most video surveillance systems provide facilities to store all your camera credentials so that it is easy to manage them all , these credentials will travel to the rouge camera server , where they will be decoded and displayed to the attacker .
The chances that the same credentials are used across all devices are pretty high .
So , there you go .
Now the bad guys have access to all your video resources .
Mitigations
I do n't know where to start really .
I guess that when thinking about embedded devices we should really think of something that is extremely flawed .
Therefore , they endangers the surrounding clients and the network to which they are connected .

Forget Swift Boats ; this election year could become the battle of the armadas .
Thanks to the success of misleading ads against John Kerry in 2004 — as well as recent Supreme Court and Federal Election Commission actions — the current presidential contest promises to be more cacophonous and mud strewn than any in recent history , with a record number of down - and - dirty ads financed on the sly by big - money interests .
Attacks bankrolled by “ independent ” groups — businesses , unions , and millionaires — and amplified by YouTube and reporters starved for news “ will play a much greater role than ever before , ” predicts a top gop strategist .
There ’s just one catch : Groups that make it their express aim to influence federal elections — campaign and party committees , for example — are limited to $ 5,000 contributions from individuals and can’t take money from corporations or unions .
But recruiting enough $ 5,000 donors to underwrite a multimillion - dollar ad buy is a chore .
So for those hoping to destroy a candidate with a clever spot or a cheap shot , the key question is which campaign - finance loophole to use .
In 2004 , the answer was 527 committees , named after the tax - code provision covering them .
These groups can take unlimited donations .
Billionaire George Soros alone gave nearly $ 24 million to 527s that year , including America Coming Together and the Media Fund , which together netted about $ 140 million in support of John Kerry .
On the gop side , the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth and the Progress for America Voter Fund raised about $ 58 million , of which T. Boone Pickens pitched in $ 4.5 million .
The Federal Election Commission recently ruled that these four 527s had violated campaign - finance law — that they essentially were campaign groups in disguise and should have abided by the $ 5,000 limit .
Yet for what amounted to nearly $ 200 million in illegal spending , the groups were fined , in total , only $ 2.4 million , three years after the fact — a punishment easy to dismiss as “ the cost of doing business , ” in the words of Fred Wertheimer , president of the clean - campaign advocacy group Democracy 21 .
Nevertheless , the fec action has made some donors think twice about 527s , says Wertheimer — which is why political operatives are busy cooking up other stratagems .
One involves funneling money to nonprofit advocacy groups like MoveOn and the nra , known as 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) s after another tax provision , for voter organization efforts and election - related ads .
( Donations to these organizations , unlike those to educational and charitable nonprofits known as 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) s , are n’t tax deductible ; many groups , such as the Sierra Club , have both a ( c ) ( 3 ) and a ( c ) ( 4 ) arm . )
Under the 2002 McCain - Feingold act , these advocacy groups were banned from running “ issue ads ” directed at candidates within two months of a general election .
But the Supreme Court modified that ban last June .
Now a nonprofit could , say , run a spot just before election time noting that Candidate X once voted against building a wall on the Mexico border , warning that — cue the ominous music !
— X is willing to let terrorists sneak into the United States , and exhorting viewers to call X to register their outrage .
So long as the ad has n’t ( officially ) been coordinated with X’s opponent and does n’t outright say “ vote against X , ” it ’s fine .
And here ’s the best part :
There are no limitations on the size of a contribution to a ( c ) ( 4 ) , nor do its donors have to be disclosed .
Moreover , due to that same Supreme Court decision , unions and corporations can now directly finance their own issue ads , expanding the number of players who can slam — or slime — the candidates in 2008 .
Wertheimer identifies a few outfits likely to emerge as major independent spenders this year .
On the gop side , a likely big player is Freedom ’s Watch , a ( c ) ( 4 ) founded last summer .
In 2007 the group — whose top donor has been casino mogul Sheldon Adelson — spent at least $ 15 million to support the surge in Iraq , and according to spokesman Jake Suski , it plans to expand its operations in 2008 .
( See “ Betting on Red ” in our last issue or at MotherJones.com . )
In the Democratic camp , strategists including Clinton White House chief of staff John Podesta and Service Employees International Union ( seiu ) official Anna Burger have launched a 527 named the Fund for America to raise money and distribute it to ( c ) ( 4 ) s doing voter organization in 10 to 12 key states ; a parallel entity headed by Tom Matzzie , the former head of MoveOn ’s Washington office , will produce issue ads aimed at undercutting the Republican nominee .
The Fund for America is hoping to raise at least $ 100 million .
The legality of this circuitous strategy , admits one Fund for America official , is not fully tested : “ We ’ve built into the budget a little money in the expectation that we ’re unintentionally going to go beyond the boundaries of the law .
We know we ’ll get challenged and will have people watching us every step of the way . ”
The good news for the independent spenders is that a congressional tussle over the appointment of commissioners left the fec with four of its six seats vacant at the start of the year , effectively shutting it down .
“ If you believe there ’s no sheriff in town , ” Wertheimer says ruefully , “ anything goes . ”
Sure enough , the primary season has already seen some sneaky independent action .
Prior to January ’s Iowa caucuses , a ( c ) ( 4 ) called Common Sense Issues set up the website TrustHuckabee.com to recruit pro-Huckabee precinct captains — a blatant and probably prohibited scheme to create a parallel campaign infrastructure .
( “ They are looking at a lot of litigation , ” says a former fec official who asked not to be identified .
“ This is way beyond anything anybody should try . ” )
And a 527 named Alliance for a New America , financed in part by seiu affiliates , ran issue ads in Iowa hailing John Edwards ’ anti-lobbyist proposals .
The Alliance received $ 495,000 from Rachel “ Bunny ” Mellon , the 97 - year - old daughter - in - law of industrialist Andrew Mellon .
A lawyer holding power of attorney for Mellon is an Edwards supporter , and he refused to explain how the generous contribution had come about .
Clearly , political operators were n’t very fearful of the fec or irs .
The recent rule changes , though , could make Swift - Boat - style character assassination tougher this year .
If a 527 or ( c ) ( 4 ) group funded by unlimited contributions produces ads attacking a candidate ’s past or fitness for office , it will be difficult for the group to claim them as issue ads .
“ I suppose a group can say , ‘ We ’ll file as a 527 not for the purpose of influencing the election , but to educate the public on the quality of the candidates , ' ” says Jan Baran , a veteran Republican campaign - finance lawyer .
“ But that would be skating on thin ice . ”
Which leaves the diy option :
There are no restrictions on how much an individual can spend to influence an election , as long as she or he does n’t coordinate efforts with a candidate or party .
Though most big - money people prefer a degree or two of separation from bare - knuckle politics , this year ’s high stakes could nudge some in that direction .
“ There is the possibility a billionaire will spend $ 100 million on the presidential campaign ‘ just because I feel like it , ' ” says Democratic consultant Guy Molyneux .
“ There ’s the potential for a huge ratcheting up .
And we will see some pretty tough stuff . ”
After all , the lesson of 2004 was that it only takes one good ad campaign to undo a candidate .
“ We ’re looking at an enormous shift in control from parties and candidates to outside groups , ” says the former fec official .
“ For a candidate , this can mean a loss of control of your message .
And this also covers congressional candidates .
Imagine if three weeks before the election , someone dumps $ 600,000 into your House race and you have no idea who it is . ”
Candidates , he adds , “ should be scared .
Very scared . ”
Maybe voters , too .

HOLLYWOOD action star Chuck Norris , known for his martial arts prowess and tough - guy image , has become a cult figure among the US military in Iraq and an unlikely hero for some in Iraq 's security forces .
A small cardboard shrine is dedicated to Norris at a US military helicopter hub in Baghdad , and comments lauding the manliness and virility of the actor have been left on toilet walls across Iraq and even in neighbouring Kuwait , soldiers say .
" The fastest way to a man 's heart is with Chuck Norris 's fist , " reads one message at the shrine , which consists of a signed photo of the actor surrounded by similar statements .
We have strong disagreements with all the Republicans running for president .
The leading candidates have no plan for getting American troops out of Iraq .
They are too wedded to discredited economic theories and unwilling even now to break with the legacy of President Bush .
We disagree with them strongly on what makes a good Supreme Court justice .
Still , there is a choice to be made , and it is an easy one .
Senator John McCain of Arizona is the only Republican who promises to end the George Bush style of governing from and on behalf of a small , angry fringe .
With a record of working across the aisle to develop sound bipartisan legislation , he would offer a choice to a broader range of Americans than the rest of the Republican field .
We have shuddered at Mr. McCain ’s occasional , tactical pander to the right because he has demonstrated that he has the character to stand on principle .
He was an early advocate for battling global warming and risked his presidential bid to uphold fundamental American values in the immigration debate .
A genuine war hero among Republicans who proclaim their zeal to be commander in chief , Mr. McCain argues passionately that a country ’s treatment of prisoners in the worst of times says a great deal about its character .
Why , as a New York - based paper , are we not backing Rudolph Giuliani ?
Why not choose the man we endorsed for re-election in 1997 after a first term in which he showed that a dirty , dangerous , supposedly ungovernable city could become clean , safe and orderly ?
What about the man who stood fast on Sept. 11 , when others , including President Bush , went AWOL ?
Headaches and Sex : " Yes , Tonight Dear " Doctors discuss how sex can both cause and cure headaches .
Feb . 5 , 2008  -- Popular culture always sends us mixed messages about sex .
First there was the old cliche of " not tonight dear , I have a headache , " implying sex makes pain worse .
Then Marvin Gaye turned the tables on the sex - pain connection with his 1982 song " Sexual Healing . "
So , who is accurate — Gaye or the tired spouse ?
Does sex make or break a headache ?
Well both , say headache researchers , depending on the person and the headache .
Much of sex 's influence on a headache remains shrouded in mystery , but doctors know a little and are discovering more .
A Discovery
In 1988 , a forthright woman in a headache treatment study inspired an Oklahoma doctor to question the sexual healing of migraines .
" This lady said ' I really do n't need a pill , I need a guy 's phone number , " said James Couch , a neurology professor at Oklahoma Health Sciences Center .
The patient told Couch she had trouble curing her headaches since her husband had divorced her and she 'd signed up for a pain treatment study .
Couch thought this was interesting , in a scientific way , of course .
" A physiologic process — the climax — is turning off another physiologic process , " said Couch .
So he asked 84 other female migraine patients if they ever had sex during a headache and , if so , what happened ?
Two out of three women reported having sex during a migraine — those intense debilitating headaches characterized by nausea and sensitivity to light , or sound .
Doctors estimate about 18 percent of women and 9 percent of men get migraines often .
Of the women who tried sex with a migraine , 61 percent reported some sort of relief .
Not bad , compared to the latest migraine drugs called triptans , which might soothe 60 percent to 80 percent of headaches , says Couch .
Perhaps more intriguing to Couch was the reports that sex could sometimes stop a migraine dead in its tracks , instead of slowly dulling the pain .
More than 20 percent of women reported that sex cured their migraines , while triptans might cure migraine in 30 percent of patients , says Couch .
" Four women said it literally stopped the headache , period , " said Couch .
" No matter when the headache occurred , it stopped the headache cold . "
Researchers may guess why sex can cure a migraine , through endorphins and other pain - relieving hormones released during orgasm , or through the stimulation nerves that trigger pain relief in childbirth .
But , says Couch , no one really knows why sex works .
" I have n't really figured out how to follow up with that study , " said Couch with a laugh .
He added that he wo n't start prescribing sex as a cure .
Sex as a Cause ?
While sex might help some migraines — at home — sex can be a trigger that causes headache in up to 10 percent of all people who suffer from migraines , says Randolph Evans , clinical professor of neurology at Baylor College of Medicine .
And sex can trigger other kinds of headaches , especially in men .
One type of headache starts as a dull ache in the head and neck .
The pain may feel mild at the beginning of sexual activity , but gets worse the longer the couple continues , says Evans .
Another type of headache — the orgasmic headache — is a sudden , severe " explosive " headache that builds just before or during orgasm .
The intense pain may last for several hours afterward .
" It 's a big issue with some people , " said Evans .
Luckily , the explosive headache , called coital cephalalgia , only occurs in about 1 percent of men and often resolves itself spontaneously before becoming a pattern .
But as many men grow older , they face a new threat of headache with sex — Viagra .
Headache is listed as a side effect of Viagra and other erectile dysfunction drugs .
Obviously , says Evans , men will get the headache side effects of the drugs just when they wanted to get the good effects .
What to Do
Because sex can sometimes be a cure , and sometimes be a cause for a headache , it 's largely up to headache sufferers to decide what works for them .
Preventing headaches in the first place can go a long way .
Evans suggests tracking migraine triggers , getting regular sleep and exercising regularly , even if it 's only walking a mile a day .
" I doubt that sex is a reliable treatment for headache , " said Evans .
" You can't grab somebody in the office and say , ' Hey , it 's a medical emergency ! ' "
A 20 - year - old woman and a 72 - year - old man were “ intimate friends ” until their romance turned to violence , said Denver District Attorney ’s spokeswoman Lynn Kimbrough .
Jennifer Stroth was arrested on a domestic violence charge Feb. 17 in Loveland .
An investigation turned up evidence of two earlier knife attacks when the couple shared a home in the 4900 block of Raleigh Street in Denver , Kimbrough said .
Stroth is accused of stabbing him Feb. 1 and Feb. 16 .
The man was seriously injured , said prosecutors , who did n’t identify him because he is an alleged victim of domestic abuse .
Stroth is in the Larimer County jail .

Most of the people profiled in PaW provide some sample of their programming or thought process .
Hertzfeld has the best one : an assembler program that makes Susan Kare 's Macintosh icons bounce around a window .
Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama veered from collegial to clenched and combative in a debate on Thursday , with Mrs. Clinton turning especially aggressive as she all but accused Mr. Obama of plagiarism and derided his political message as “ change you can Xerox . ”
Mr. Obama , buoyed by 11 straight victories in the most recent nominating contests , sought to maintain a positive tone throughout , though at one point he accused Mrs. Clinton of suggesting that his supporters were “ delusional ” or “ being duped ” by his themes of hope and unity .
Those few sharp rejoinders , as well as an emotional closing comment by Mrs. Clinton that seemed to move the audience  and even Mr. Obama  were the most memorable moments in a debate that had been loaded with expectation , with Mrs. Clinton seeking to stop the Obama juggernaut .
After the 90 minute face - off was over , it was not clear that Mrs. Clinton , in the toughest position of the campaign for her , had done enough to change the course of the contest .
The Democratic leadership in Congress wants the war to be around in 2008 so that a Democrat can win the White House by " opposing " the war .
Congressman Rahm Emanuel has explained this to the Washington Post .
The ONLY way to convince the top Democrats that this calculation is wrong is to promote in the presidential primary the only candidate who is trying in every way possible to end the war now .
If we do that , the Democrats will understand that they cannot wait until after November of 2008 to end the war .
We 've tried Congressional elections .
We won a huge mandate for peace and resistance to Bush - Cheney .
Then the White House escalated the war , and Congress played along .
We 've tried marching .
On January 27th a half a million people encircled the U.S. Capitol demanding peace .
We 've tried lobbying , public forums , protests , sit-ins , counter - recruitment , and refusal to serve .
We 've tried media activism and exposure of the lies and the crimes that make up the war .
We could always do more , and we should do more of all of these things .
And what we have done has prevented worse horrors and won minor victories and grounds for hope .
There is always hope .
But we have not yet tried using a presidential election to achieve peace .
The media claims that it is now election season .
Coverage of the November 2008 presidential election gives the impression that the day of the vote is almost upon us .
This cheap journalism is a massive drain on citizen participation in our democracy , most of which should have nothing to do with elections .
But what the media says in this matter goes , and it is therefore undeniably election season .
And yet , we have not been informed and never will be informed what the candidates in this election would do if elected .
The media stories are all about money , polls , and fluff .
But that fact actually makes things easier for us .
We do n't have to leave our homes to have a major impact on the movement for peace .
If the 500,000 people who marched , in D.C. alone , in January were to each give ( or in the case of children ask their parents to give ) $ 50 to the presidential campaign of the only candidate who voted against the war , has voted against funding it , favors ending it immediately , and opposes an attack on Iran , that $ 25 million ( in unprecedented and unimaginable small donations ) would be the top news story for months .
And whether or not it determined the Democratic nominee , and whether or not we even want it to do so , it would have a decisive impact on the positions of all the candidates , not to mention members of Congress .
They ALL speak the language of the dollar .
Do you think John Edwards is handsome and wish he'd oppose an attack on Iran and be willing to join the majority of Americans on more issues ?
Then back Kucinich now .
Do you think Barack Obama makes an attractive blank slate and wish he'd stop voting to fund the war , support ending it , and take a nuclear attack on Iran off the table ?
Get behind Kucinich right away .
Are you impressed by Hillary Clinton and wish she 'd admit she voted wrong , stop funding the war , support ending it , and oppose a new aggressive war on Iran ?
You get the idea .

The money will drive the polls , which will drive the debate in Congress and force real action .
Dennis Kucinich is very far behind the first few candidates at this ridiculously early stage in both fundraising and in polls , including the polls done by the corporate media and the unscientific polls done by liberal websites tied to the Democratic Party .
DailyKos has John Edwards at 42 % , Barack Obama at 25 % , Bill Richardson 13 % , Hillary Clinton 3 % , and Kucinich 2 % .
MyDD has similar results : Edwards 43 % , Obama 34 % , Richardson 8 % , Clinton 4 % , and 1 % each for Kucinich , Joe Biden , and Chris Dodd .
I suspect that the voters on these sites dislike Clinton for all the right reasons , and above all for her support of the war .
But I 'm certain they oppose Kucinich for all of the wrong reasons ( the media does n't cover him , he 's short , he agrees with us TOO much ) .
But the media covers money , so we know how to handle that .
And while Kucinich 's positions have n't changed much in four years , Americans ' opinions have changed by moving in his direction on the war , on health care , and on trade .
Kucinich 's height may be hard to change , but he does n't fall off everything he rides , give inappropriate shoulder massages , or shoot his buddies in the face .
Democracy for America is a grassroots group closely tied to the Democratic Party and born out of Howard Dean 's presidential campaign , many of the supporters of which favored positions like those of Kucinich .
In DFA 's poll results , Kucinich comes in third with 10 % , behind Obama 's 28 % and Edwards ' 24 % .
Democrats.com is an activist group that more often challenges the positions of the Democratic leadership , and more often tells people what progressive Congress Members like Kucinich are doing .
Democrats.com has been fully engaged in the peace movement .
In its poll Kucinich comes in second with 24 % behind Edwards ' 41 % .
Moveon.org has done a poll as well .
And it polled its members immediately after posting audio and transcripts of each of the candidates answering questions about the Iraq War .
Kucinich finished third with 17 % behind Obama 's 28 % and Edwards ' 25 % .
Polling only people who attended a house party to listen to the interviews , the result did n't change much for Kucinich , 16 % , or Edwards , 25 % .
But Obama dropped to 18 % and Richardson jumped into the mix at 21 % .
From these unscientific polls , we can draw the following tentative conclusions : 1. - The race is still wide open .
2 . - The indisputable fact one week is overturned the next and forgotten3 .- Kucinich does better when Iraq is the topic or the peace movement is the audience ( and Iraq will be the topic , and the peace movement is now a majority of Americans ) 4. - Obama loses some of his glow when he tries to answer a few serious questions .
If you do n't know Dennis Kucinich , watch him in this recent interview on CNN : http://kucinich.us/node/4300/play
Kucinich argued against the war prior to the vote to authorize it , published his case against it , helped persuade his colleagues to vote No , voted No , and sued the President to try to prevent the war .
He proposed a detailed plan to end the war over three years ago , a plan that is largely still right and embodied in his bill , HR 1234 .
He has voted against every new funding bill for the war , including the recent Supplemental .
He supports using the power of the purse to end the war .
He opposes any attack on Iran and proposes formally forswearing the use of so - called preventive war .
He has proposed the creation of a Department of Peace to address international and domestic violence .
He would ban the weaponization of space and work for nuclear disarmament .
His chief tool would be diplomacy , not death .
We might persuade one of the other candidates to move toward one or more of these anti-war positions , but their change of heart will not be based in the deep understanding of peace and violence that drives Dennis Kucinich .
And we will almost certainly never persuade any of them to take Kucinich 's position in favor of slashing wasteful Pentagon spending in order to fund useful non-military projects .
Only Kucinich would move us toward an economy not driven by war .
And , ultimately , that is the only way we 'll prevent future wars .
Wow .
Wonderful .
But is that how to win the swing voters ?
Well , did you ever wonder why the Republicans seem so much less obsessed with swing voters ?
Chris Bowers has presented a strong case that these mythical creatures do not actually exist . [ http://www.alternet.org/blogs/peek/50646 ]
Only 4.7 % of voters changed their mind during the last election from Bush to Kerry or Kerry to Bush .
Kerry may have been swiftboated , but hardly anyone changed their mind from backing Kerry to backing Bush .
What did happen , of course , is that millions of supporters of Kerry ( and of Bush too ) did n't bother to vote or to register to vote .
What would it take for the Democrats to register and turn out likely Democratic voters in sufficient numbers to beat election fraud ?
It would take a candidate who was n't for the war before he was against it .
The mushy middle turns potential voters away .
There are peace activists who favor the creation of a third party , and who argue against backing Kucinich because they think he 'll lose and then endorse a less desirable candidate .
But Kucinich is less likely to lose if those who agree with him support him .
Supporting him now will serve primarily to help end the war prior to the election .
And supporting Kucinich will not make the task of building a third party any more or less daunting .
A third - party peace candidate would need everything Kucinich has and much more in qualifications , and much , much more in money in order to have a chance .
And here 's something interesting about Kucinich .
He supports all the reforms to our election and campaign finance systems that would make it possible for third parties to compete , and he does not go back on his word after he wins elections .
When Kucinich was elected mayor of Cleveland at the age of 31 on a promise not to privatize the city 's electricity , he stuck to his word in the face of an all - out assault from the city 's media and corporate rulers .
When his decision was vindicated years later by the fortune he'd saved the city , he re-entered politics .
When the Democratic leadership pulled out every trick to pressure congress members to vote for the Supplemental spending bill that now sits in conference committee , Kucinich voted no .
Efforts to build decent third parties like the Green Party are to be applauded , but backing Kucinich is one way to do that .

I strayed off my beat a bit yesterday to write , with David Kuhn , a story on how little the memory of 9/11 got Rudy :
Rudy Giuliani's distant third - place finish in Florida may put an end to his bid for president , and it seems also to mark the beginning of the end of a period in Republican politics that began on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Giuliani's national celebrity was based on his steady , comforting appearance in Americans ' living rooms amid the terrorist attacks , and his campaign for president never found a message beyond that moment .
The emotional connection he forged that day , it seems , has proved politically worthless .
After months of wonder that the former mayor seemed to have no ceiling to his support , he turned out to have no floor , trading fourth - place finishes with Ron Paul , a little - known Texas congressman .
" There 's a paradox for Rudy , " said former Nebraska Sen .

Why is Bear Stearns Trading at $ 6 Instead of $ 2 ?
John P. Hussman , Ph.D .
All rights reserved and actively enforced .

Well , the ECRI ( one of the more reliable private economic analysis groups ) has finally thrown in the towel - " With the Weekly Leading Index having dropped more than 13 points in the last nine months , it is exhibiting a pronounced , pervasive , and persistent decline that is unambiguously recessionary . "
The possibility of a " bear market rally " aside , if the S&P 500 has already set its low , it will have been the first time that the market has responded to a similar economic downturn with less than a 20 % loss on a closing basis .
If we define the recent downturn as a bear market anyway , the recent low will represent the highest level of valuation that has ever prevailed at the bottom of a bear market .
I expect neither of these to be true for long , but as usual , we 'll respond to the evidence as it unfolds - without the need to forecast any particular scenario .
Though our investment horizon of interest is a complete market cycle , we do n't generally think in terms of bull and bear markets , because they can only be determined in hindsight .
We prefer observable measures that allow us to identify the prevailing state or " Market Climate " at every point in time .
We do n't expect various Market Climates to overlap tightly with actual bull or bear markets .
Instead , we expect that , on average , the return / risk profile in " favorable " Market Climates will significantly exceed the return / risk profile in " unfavorable " Market Climates .
Accordingly , if we accept a greater amount of risk during favorable conditions , and less during unfavorable conditions , we expect to perform strongly - at controlled risk - over the complete market cycle .
For now , we remain defensive , but we recognize the potential for a " bear market rally " despite conditions that , as yet , do not provide enough evidence to warrant removing a significant portion of our hedges .
Why is Bear Stearns trading at $ 6 instead of $ 2 ?
As I emphasized last week , the large " term financing " and " term securities lending " programs initiated by the Fed do not expose the Fed to default risk in mortgage collateral it accepts from the banks that act as primary dealers .
Even if the underlying securities default , those facilities involve repurchase agreements , so the bank putting up the collateral has to repurchase the collateral at the original price plus interest after a term of 28 or 90 days .
The Fed only stands to lose if the bank itself fails , and so spectacularly that the bank 's liquidation value goes negative even after zeroing out bondholder claims and stockholder equity .
Even in the present environment , this is unlikely .
Alarmingly , immediately after the pixels dried on last week 's comment ( noting " the Fed is emphatically not taking the default risk of the mortgage market onto itself " with these term facilities ) , details emerged that the Fed had agreed to a very different deal in its attempt to rescue Bear Stearns .
This is a major and ominous departure from historical Fed policy , and from legality .
I 'll cut straight to the chase .
Bear Stearns is trading at $ 6 instead of $ 2 because unelected bureaucrats went beyond their legal mandates , delivered a windfall to a single private company at public expense , entered agreements that violate the the public trust , and created a situation where even if the bureaucratic malfeasance stands , the shareholders of Bear Stearns will either reject the deal or be deprived of their right to determine the fate of the company they own .
Very simply , Bear Stearns is still in play .
Still , when all is said and done , my own impression is that the ultimate value of the stock will not be $ 2 , but exactly zero .
In effect , the Federal Reserve decided last week to overstep its legal boundaries - going beyond providing liquidity to the banking system and attempting to ensure the solvency of a non -bank entity .
Specifically , the Fed agreed to provide a $ 30 billion " non-recourse loan " to J.P. Morgan , secured only by the worst tranche of Bear Stearns ' mortgage debt .
But the bank - J.P. Morgan - was in no financial trouble .
Instead , it was effectively offered a subsidy by the Fed at public expense .
Rick Santelli of CNBC is exactly right .
If this is how the U.S. government is going to operate in a democratic , free - market society , " we might as well put a hammer and sickle on the flag . "
What is a " non-recourse loan " ?
Put simply , if the homeowners underlying that weak tranche of debt go into foreclosure , they will lose their homes , and the public will lose as well .
But J.P. Morgan will not lose , nor will Bear Stearns ' bondholders .
This will be an outrageous outcome if it is allowed to stand .
In my view , the deal would be palatable if J.P. Morgan was to remain fully responsible for any losses on the " collateral " provided to the Federal Reserve , assuming shareholders were to consent to the buyout .
As it stands , Congress should quickly step in to bust the existing deal and demand an alternate resolution , by clearly insisting that the Fed 's action was not legal .
The Fed did not act to save a bank , but to enrich one .
Congress has the power to appropriate resources for such a deal by the representative will of the people - the Fed does not , even under Depression era banking laws .
The " loan " falls outside of Section 13 - 3 of the Federal Reserve Act , because it is not in fact a loan to either Bear Stearns or J.P. Morgan .
Bear Stearns is no longer a business entity under this agreement .
And if the fiction that this is a " loan " to J.P. Morgan was true , J.P. Morgan would be obligated to pay it back , period .
The only point at which the value of the " collateral " would become an issue would be in the event that J.P. Morgan itself was to fail .
No , this is not a loan .
It is a put option granted by the Fed to J.P. Morgan on a basket of toxic securities .
And it is not legal .
The deal was made under duress , to the benefit of a private company , on the basis of financial assurances that the bureaucrats involved had no business making .
The Federal Reserve is going to put up public assets and accept default risk so that Bear Stearns ' own bondholders are effectively immunized ?!
That 's not sound monetary policy - it's a picnic for insiders , bought and paid for through the abuse of public funds by government officials too unprincipled even to recognize the abuse .
The only good thing about this deal is that it buys time while principled ways of busting and restructuring it can be settled .
This is not an issue of letting Bear Stearns " fail " on the claims of its customers and counterparties .
Nobody wants that .
The issue is the method by which it was rescued - who was protected , and who was not ; why a consortium was not used instead of a single firm ; why the claims of Bear 's bondholders should be secure while the public bears the risk of the toxic waste foisted upon us .
This deal should , and I believe will , be restructured .
J.P. Morgan will cry foul , but that will be like a child who found the Easter basket and is now forced to share the chocolate .
Bear Stearns is worth more than zero in acquisition , provided that the bondholders take an appropriate loss .
As of November 's 10 K report , Bear Stearns had $ 9 billion in unsecured short - term debt , and $ 66 billion in long - term debt .
The $ 12 billion in shareholder equity , of course , is gone .
Any portion of the debt that is unsecured should be the first to fall .
If Bear Stearns is worth $ 2 a share to somebody ( provided $ 30 billion of " non-recourse loans " from the Fed ) , and yet Bear 's bondholders and even the unsecured lenders can still expect to be paid off on over $ 75 billion of debt ( J.P. Morgan assumes that obligation as part of the buyout ) , then the public guarantees are n't required in the first place .
What is required is that Bear 's bondholders take a loss , as they should , rather than the public doing so .
In the unlikely event the value of Bear Stearns is negative after entirely zeroing out both shareholder equity and bondholder claims - then and only then is there a problem for Bear 's customers and counterparties .
But in fact , J.P. Morgan is already willing to take on all of Bear 's assets and liabilities , including over $ 75 billion in debt to Bear 's bondholders , for $ 2 a share .
This is an indication that bondholder 's claims would not even be wiped out in a full liquidation .
Surely , whatever loss is required to transfer the ownership of the company should be taken by the bondholders , not by the public .
Again , this is not water under the bridge , and the deal struck last week should not be allowed to stand if we care at all about the integrity of the capital markets .
The Long - Term Capital crisis was resolved by a consortium of financial institutions providing capital in return for ownership .
The panic of 1907 was resolved the same way .
This deal should be busted , and fast .
If there 's not a single buyer that will take on both the assets and liabilities without the government assuming private default risk , Bear 's assets should be put out for bid , Bear 's bonds should go into default , and by the unfortunate reality of how equities work , Bear 's shareholders should n't get $ 2 - they should get nothing .
Bear 's stock is selling at more than $ 2 for two reasons - one is that the market evidently believes there is some chance for the deal to be busted , either by Congress or by shareholder rejection .
And second , because Bear 's bondholders are frantic to own the stock so they can vote for this lousy deal to go through .
After all , buying up a few hundred million in stock to secure $ 75 billion of debt does n't seem like a bad trade .
Even if J.P. Morgan raises the bid for Bear Stearns , the assurances by the Fed and Treasury are not legal .
That will change only when the " non-recourse " provision is withdrawn .
Whatever happens , this is not over , for the simple reason that it is wrong .
The U.S. economy will get through this without the requirement of massive public bailouts .
What is required , however , is that the stock and bondholders of financial companies take due losses .
Customers and counterparties need not , and I expect will not , be harmed .
The value of the shareholder equity and debt issued by most financial institutions is ample buffer .
In general , writedowns against shareholder equity alone will be enough , provided that regulations are revised to allow institutions to continue servicing existing financial commitments on the basis of more flexible capital requirements .
If the market was " certain to crash " in the event that Bear Stearns failed , then the market is certain to crash anyway , because Bear Stearns was n't the last shoe to drop - it was one of the first .
Unfortunately , we 're standing in a shoe store .
Was n't the market " certain to crash " without the Fed 's surprise rate cut in January too ?
At what point will investors figure out that the liquidity problems are nothing but the precursors of insolvency problems ?
At what point will investors stop begging the government to save private companies and recognize that the losses should be taken by the stock and bondholders of the offending financial institutions ?
If the Fed and the Treasury are smart , they will act quickly to figure out how to respond to multiple events like we 've seen in recent days , to expedite turnover in ownership and quickly settle the residual claims of bondholders , without the kind of malfeasance reflected in the Bear Stearns rescue .
As for the future of the free markets , Dylan Thomas comes to mind :
Do not go gentle into that good night
Rage !
Rage against the dying of the light
The Fed overstepped and the Treasury overstepped .
At the point where unelected bureaucrats pick and choose who to subsidize - who prospers and who perishes - in a free capital market , and use public funds to do it , more is at risk than just $ 30 billion .
Instead , we cross a line , and stumble off a very clear edge down an interminably slippery slope .
We speak up now , or forever hold our peace .
On the subject of speaking up , the essays in the special section of the Washington Monthly - No Torture , No Exceptions - are worth reading .
They come from both sides of the political aisle .
I am troubled that as a nation , both in economics and in foreign policy , we have become far too willing to sacrifice principles for what some , I think falsely , perceive to be an increase in security .
But once we begin to violate our principles , we should realize that nothing else is secure .
Market Climate
As of last week , the Market Climate for stocks remained characterized by unfavorable valuations and unfavorable market action .
Much has been made of the low percentage of investment advisors who are bullish - a low 31.1 % according to Investors Intelligence - with some suggesting that stocks may be near a bottom on the basis of " contrary opinion . "
The problem , as I noted years ago ( e.g. Law of Large Numbers ) , is that " before looking at advisory sentiment , we have to factor out the portion that is explained simply by past market movements .
Once we 've done this , we are left with a much more informative indicator . "
All of the forecasting usefulness of those figures is contained in the " excess " bullishness or bearishness - the extent to which sentiment figures are higher or lower than what you would expect , given recent market movements .
Presently , the level of advisory bullishness is not much below where we would expect it to be , given the market decline that we 've observed .
That 's often the case early in bull or bear markets .
High bullishness in early bull markets is typically not a negative , because the initial advance is generally very powerful .
Likewise , high bearishness is typically not a positive early in bear markets , because the initial decline is often fairly deep .
In short , aside from some potential for a " clearing rally " to correct the short - term oversold condition of the market , even the low advisory bullishness figures provide little evidence for a " contrary opinion " call on the market .
For our part , we do n't have enough evidence here to remove hedges , but we are open to the possibility that improved market action could provide at least some basis for a modest speculative exposure to market risk ( most likely by covering a portion of our short call options , while leaving our defensive puts in place ) .
Again however , we do not have enough evidence at present to warrant even a limited amount of speculative exposure .
We wo n't observe " investment merit " until we observe significantly lower valuations , but market action by itself could encourage a somewhat more constructive stance .
For now , the weight of the evidence continues to demand a strong defense .
In bonds , the Market Climate remained characterized last week by unfavorable yield levels and modestly favorable yield trends .
Credit spreads are blowing wider again , so that does put some downward pressure on Treasury yields as " safe havens . "
Still , there is emphatically no investment merit in long - term bonds , in the sense that by definition , a long - term investment in 10 - year Treasury securities will lock in a total return of less than 3.4 % over the coming decade .
In the Strategic Total Return Fund , we continue to carry an unusually defensive position , largely in Treasury bills , and with the Market Climate for precious metals still favorable on our measures , we bumped up slightly to a roughly 17 % exposure in precious metals shares on last week 's swoon in that market .

Higher competition is likely to bring prices down - eventually
The long - awaited " open skies " agreement between the US and European Union is coming into effect , aiming to open up trans -Atlantic air travel .
The deal ends limits on which airlines can fly between the US and EU , and it is expected to lead to a large rise in the number of carriers on the routes .
However , changes at big airports such as Heathrow will be minimised by the limited availability of take - off slots .
New trans -Atlantic services are likely to use smaller airports instead .
Irish low - cost airline Ryanair has already declared an interest in flying to North America .
Lower prices ?
Analysts say the introduction of more competition will bring down prices , but that reductions will be limited unless the current high price of aviation fuel also goes down .
The change may mean low - cost carriers crossing the Atlantic A key component of the new aviation agreement between the EU and the US is that any European airline will be able to fly to the US from anywhere in the EU - not just from its home nation .
British Airways and Air France have already announced their intention to launch flights to the US from outside the UK and France respectively .
But European airlines also want access to domestic airline routes in the US , says the BBC's Europe business reporter Duncan Bartlett - flights , say , between New York and Washington .
Another change is that US airlines can now buy a stake of up to 49 % in their European rivals .
European airlines by contrast will still only be able to buy 25 % in US carriers .
EU Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot has pledged to improve that deal , and says if he does not get parity he will roll back some of the open skies agreements from 2010 .
Our correspondent says European carriers also think they should be allowed to buy airlines from the United States if they want to .
But that 's unlikely to please the Americans who are sensitive about foreign takeovers of their leading companies , especially as their economy is slowing .

Researchers today closed out the inaugural season on an unprecedented , multi- year effort to retrieve the most detailed record of greenhouse gases in Earth ’s atmosphere over the last 100,000 years .
The dust , chemicals , and air trapped in the two - mile - long ice core will provide critical information for scientists working to predict the extent to which human activity will alter Earth ’s climate , according to the chief scientist for the project , Kendrick Taylor of the Desert Research Institute of the Nevada System of Higher Education .
Working as part of the National Science Foundation ’s West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide ( WAIS Divide ) Ice Core Project , a team of scientists , engineers , technicians , and students from multiple U.S. institutions have recovered a 580 - meter ( 1,900 - foot ) ice core – the first section of what is hoped to be a 3,465 - meter ( 11,360 - foot ) column of ice detailing 100,000 years of Earth ’s climate history , including a precise year - by - year record of the last 40,000 years .
WAIS Divide , named for the high - elevation region that is the boundary separating opposing flow directions on the ice sheet , is the best spot on the planet to recover ancient ice containing trapped air bubbles – samples of the Earth ’s atmosphere from the present to as far back as 100,000 years ago .
While other ice cores have been used to develop longer records of Earth ’s atmosphere , the record from WAIS Divide will allow a more detailed study of the interaction of previous increases in greenhouse gases and climate change .
This information will improve computer models that are used to predict how the current unprecedented high levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere caused by human activity will influence future climate .
The WAIS Divide core is also the Southern Hemisphere equivalent of a series of ice cores drilled in Greenland beginning in 1989 , and it will provide the best opportunity for scientists to determine if global - scale climate changes that occurred before human activity started to influence climate were initiated in the Arctic , the tropics , or Antarctica .
The new core will also allow investigations of biological material in deep ice , which will yield information about biogeochemical processes that control and are controlled by climate , as well as lead to fundamental insights about life on Earth .
Says Taylor , “ We are very excited to work with ancient ice that fell as snow as long as 100,000 years ago .
We read the ice like other people might read a stack of old weather reports . ”
The WAIS project took more than 15 years of planning and preparation , including extensive airborne reconnaissance and ground - based geophysical research , to pinpoint the one - square - kilometer ( less than a square mile ) space on the 932,000 - square - kilometer ( 360,000 - square - mile ) ice sheet that scientists believe will provide the clearest climate record for the last 100,000 years .
With only some 40 days a year when the weather is warm enough for drilling – yesterday ’s temperature was a balmy - 15 degrees Celsius ( 5 degrees Fahrenheit ) – it is expected to take until January 2010 to complete the fieldwork .
For the project , Ice Coring and Drilling Services of the University of Wisconsin - Madison built and is operating a state - of - the - art , deep ice - coring drill , which is more like a piece of scientific equipment than a conventional rock drill used in petroleum exploration .
The U.S. Geological Survey National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver designed the core handling system .
Raytheon Polar Services Corporation provides the logistical support .
The NSF Office of Polar Programs - U.S. Antarctic Program funds the project .
The core will be archived at the National Ice Core Laboratory , which is run by the USGS with funding from NSF .
For more information on WAIS Divide , including the project media guide , go to http://www.waisdivide.unh.edu.
The new study finds an inner halo ( orange area ) that is more flattened and dominates the population of stars up to 50,000 light years from the Milky Way 's center .
The outer halo ( blue ) is more spherical , and dominates the population beyond 65,000 light years from the galactic center .
It may extend out to more than 300,000 light years .
The red plus symbols represent stars and the brown burst - like symbols are star clusters .
Our Milky Way Galaxy has two distinct parts in its outer reaches that rotate in opposite directions , astronomers announced today .
The galaxy has a bulbous core where stars are tightly packed and orbiting rather furiously around the central black hole .
Then there 's the big flat disk with its spiral arms , also orbiting the galactic center somewhat in the manner of a hurricane 's spiral bands .
We live on one of those arms .
Around it all is a halo of stars that do n't all behave in such an orderly fashion .
That much researchers knew .
Now they find the halo has two parts .
" By examining the motions and chemical makeup of the stars , we can see that the inner and outer halos are quite different beasts and they probably formed in different ways at different times , " said Daniela Carollo , a researcher at Italy 's Torino Observatory and the Australian National University .
The finding , detailed in the Dec. 12 issue of the journal Nature , is based on 20,000 stars observed as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey .
The main galactic disk , home to our sun , rotates at an average speed of 500,000 mph .
Surrounding the disk is what 's now called the inner halo .
It orbits in the same direction at about 50,000 mph .
The outer halo , a sparsely populated region , spins in the opposite direction at roughly 100,000 mph .
There are chemical differences between the two parts , too .
Stars in the inner halo have three times as many heavy atoms , including iron and calcium .
These heavy elements were produced by massive stars that exploded fantastically and begat subsequent generations of stars .
" The halo is clearly divisible into two , broadly overlapping components , ” said study team member Timothy C. Beers of Michigan State University .
“ The discovery gives us a much clearer picture of the formation of the first objects in our galaxy and in the entire universe . ”
The study adds to other evidence showing the galaxy was not built in a cosmic day .
Rather , it assembled over time , gobbling smaller galaxies in one of nature 's greatest construction projects .
The inner halo probably formed first , from collisions between smaller galaxies that had been captured by the Milky Way 's gravitation .
The outer halo formed later , the thinking goes , as small galaxies ( orbiting opposite our own ) were lured in and torn apart .
" We still have a lot to understand , " said Masashi Chiba of Japan 's Tohoku University .
With regard to the core concepts of Dianetics , a little reading about state - of - the - art psychological research , coupled with a direct look at Dianetic practice , disabuses us of every single precept above .
It ´s simply based on falsehoods , as is any ´recovered memory ´ intervention .
However , it´s not difficult for the untrained to agree with the core concepts of Dianetics , since they don´t seem to be all that far fetched .
Therefore , according to Dianetics , one can recover one´s traumas , recount them , and then one can reclaim the mental processing power one has lost due to ´attention units ´ being wasted on our aberrations .
After all , didn´t Einstein say we only use 10 % of our mental abilities ?
( Yes , but if he was making a scientific proclamation , then where´s the proof ?! )
The first contact with Scientology is usually through the book ´ Dianetics´ , which outlines a very crude quasi-Freudian model of the mind .
The mental model used is very simple , and rests on several fallacious notions , which aren´t difficult to believe if we have any affinity with or respect for Freud , ( which is n´t particularly ´out there ´ if we watch the occasional documentary on psychology , or if we ever consider seeing an analyst ) .
It ´s a basic form of neo -Freudian pop-psychology .
When you get blown out , your critical faculties take a back seat - after all , Hubbard is right to the tune of making you feel like you just freebased a whole gram !
He said you´d get released and feel amazing , and now you do .
The product has been delivered in no uncertain terms .
Why disbelieve now ?
( Needless to say , it´s more expensive than freebasing )
In reality , it seems to be just something the brain does .
Interestingly , you can even reproduce this euphoria in some people by getting them to stare at a wall for two hours .
Perhaps the brain craves stimulus and eventually blows out .
I believe this phenomenon to be hypnotic euphoria .
It is possibly the same as the feeling of being ´born again ´ while listening to David Koresh for five hours , or the feeling of achieving enlightenment after the mind - numbingly repetitive ´intensive´ meditation of the Rajneesh cult : doing nothing except asking yourself ´who am I´ for upwards of two days will probably have psychological effects !
It appears to me that when your mind does odd things , odd things happen to it .
Many cults or new age scam merchants exploit this mental property to prove their scam works .
It ´s even the ´bodhi´ of the Buddhist .
To congeal his mental model into a hard belief , Hubbard primes you to expect a feeling of ´release´ after the bad incident has been ´erased´ .
Oddly enough , you may well feel fantastic after a two - hour session of repetitive badgering .
At some point in the repetitive tedium of a Dianetics session , you´ll more than likely get a tangible sense of euphoria , which is enough to prove that the method works .
Some experience this as a full - on mental blow - out ; their hair stands on end , they go bright red and they can feel euphoric for up to two days .
I felt this incredible euphoria early on in Scientology , and I could surely pinpoint that moment as the point of no return for me .
It ´s the event horizon of the cult .
This was proof , and magnetic proof at that .
Now that it has been proven in the mind of the mark , it ´s really time to up the ante ...
Cults lay down their cosmologies in layers .
Thought reforming organisations use a shallow gradient , introducing the wilder aspects as you proceed to notions of ever - increasing unreality .
Each step you take is believable due to the preceding one .
By degree , Scientologists inculcate their recruits .
The incline gets steeper with concepts such as this one : if you ´re not ´improving ´ in therapy , there must be an ´earlier - similar´ incident .
But there is a problem : what if you ´re at the moment of conception and the incident is n´t erasing ?
Are we expected to believe you can recall a time before your conception ?
Remarkably , this question isn´t even slightly important to the Scientology therapist !
He doesn´t hesitate to take you earlier similar .
With confidence , he asks the patient the question again : ´ Is there an earlier similar incident ? ´
Whatever the patient gives is accepted and treated as if it was a real incident .
The patient will get a picture in his mind , just press him for it , and the therapist takes it for granted that it is an actual incident .
If he protests , the patient is assured that it doesn´t matter whether it´s real or not , it ´s treated as real because it´s beneficial to the patient to do so .
Interestingly , ( and of great benefit to Hubbard´s bank balance ) , very soon after entering ´therapy´ , your idea of what memory actually is begins to get conflated with the notion of imagination .
Gradually , the line between the two gets blurred .
Eventually , you come to accept that if you can see a mental picture of something , then you must have seen it before .
The notion quickly occurs to a person that if he recalls something then it is a memory .
You get a ´mental image picture´ , and the therapist ´runs´ it as an incident .
He is not interested as to its historical veracity , only in running the incident .
In such an uncritical environment , anything you give them is run , and anything is taken as an incident .
As a new recruit , you ´re sometimes told that it doesn´t matter if you ´re recalling ´real ´ memories , only that if you do recall past lives you get better regardless .
So you humour them , you go earlier - similar , you find mental pictures - you´ve discovered past - life incidents to erase - and hey presto , your hair stands on end and it ´works ´ all over again , as evidenced by the mental euphoria .
In the mind of the recruit , past lives are now a reality .
According to Hubbard , quite without regard to whether they believe in past lives or not , and quite without regard to whether such incidents are real , the patient ´always gets better´ .
However , it strikes me that if you ´re in an extremely repetitive session long enough , then you mustn´t be surprised if at some point you´ll be experiencing a spot of euphoria .
Such a strong physiological reaction is enough to convince people that they are ´improving´ , ( or ´making case - gain´ as the Scientologists say ) , and it´s certainly enough to demonstrate subjectively that you lived before .
Unsurprisingly , Scientology is extremely heavy on testimonial ´evidence´ , and feather - light on objective proof .
So people soon find they are ´going whole track´ , which is to say , ´recalling ´ past lives .
Since we´ve already had it ´proven´ to us that these are real memories - otherwise we wouldn´t feel the release - therefore we must have been around before this life , and it´s irresistible to conclude that while bodies die , our souls are continuous .
Indeed , due to this chicanery , mixed with a misunderstanding of what scientific methodology is , Scientologists believe they are the only ones with the scientific proof of spirits and past lives .
This is the ´ Thetan´ concept you asked me about , Loki .
´ Thetan´ is just another word for a spirit or a centre of consciousness .
All religions have the concept of a Thetan , only they don´t call it that .
It ´s really not all that weird .
In the same way every religionist believes we have a soul , so do scientologists .
It ´s less weird than Christianity because with Christianity there´s no ´proof´ .
To the Scientologist , not only is there ´proof´ , but it is duplicable in session after session .
Shored up by such ´proof´ , and insulated by redefinition of the concepts of memory , the beliefs get wackier , but they are ´proved right ´ time and time again in session , because scientologists just don´t spin any another hypotheses as to how come their brains just filled up with serotonin .
As far as they are concerned , it ´works ´ .
I myself ´recalled ´ being shot by the Nazis in Czechoslovakia in 1938 ( I was born in 1965 ) , and I also recalled being a captive on a slave spaceship , landing on earth 150,000 years ago to harvest woolly rhinoceros .
At the time , it was real enough to me .
Now I can think of other hypotheses to explain these ´incidents ´ , such as , well , using my imagination !
But I must stress that after recalling being killed by the Nazis in session , I felt like a million dollars .
That´s all the ´proof´ the scientologist needs .
That this feeling wears off merely keeps you addicted to going into session .
Scientology is ridiculed for its space - opera nonsense .
That ´s fine , ( I´ll even join in the fun ) , but why are , for example , Spiritualists regarded as more respectable in our society ?
Some think that thinking you were someone like Bridey Murphey is more believable than thinking you were Jesus .
It ´s often easier for some to believe they were a peasant in 1153 than being a Zorg from Neptune .
Indeed , I was laughed at by a Spiritualist once for believing we might have inhabited bodies on other planets before Earth became our home .
This amuses me : what´s the difference between being me being killed by the Nazis 27 years before I was born , and thinking I was a pod-beast from the planet Thrak ?
Operationally , there´s no difference .
It doesn´t require any leap of logic , if evidence is the arbiter of truth .
They ´re both as stupid as each other .
Curiously , while this points up the equal absurdity of unevidenced beliefs , this is a rationale which insulates the Scientologist against being sniped at by other religionists .
So anyway softly softly , by degree , the likes of Tom Cruise , John Travolta and Kirstie Alley have been led up a garden path into believing that 75 million years ago , the evil Space Ruler Xenu wiped out this sector of the galaxy and all of us with it , and then implanted us all with the spirits of dead space aliens which we must pay a fortune to exorcise .
Of course this is absurd at first glance , but you don´t find this out until you´ve climbed the shallow slope towards this nonsense .
If the gradient is shallow enough , it is impossible to see the progression towards absurdity while it happens .
If you watch the hour hand of the clock , can you see it move ?
I escaped from the cult when one day I noticed that although I didn´t see the hour hand move from midday , it was now 6 pm !
Simply put , I woke up and compared then with now .
Spontaneously , I separated my learned orthodoxy from observable reality .
It wasn´t difficult to do once I realised that the claims made for what Scientology could do didn´t tally with the abilities of Scientologists .
So one of John McCain ’s claims to fame is that he ’s the champion of campaign finance reform .
But , we ’re seeing the dark side of McCain .
He ’s actually the champion of scamming the campaign finance system :
Still , questions about the legality of the deal have turned the fine print of McCain ’s borrowing into a source of intense scrutiny among leading campaign lawyers .
Several suggested McCain has landed in a legal bind :
If McCain used the promise of public financing to secure the loan — as Democrats suggest — he faces strict spending limits .
If public funds were not involved — as Potter argues — that poses other problems .
And , McCain , who is on the verge of breaking the law , wants to make public financing an issue with Obama .
As if .
I ’ll repeat what we wrote during our debate open thread when Russert asked Obama about public campaign financing for the general election :
Report : Clinton slams Democratic activists at private fundraiser Mike Sheehan
Published : Friday April 18 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Democratic White House hopeful Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) had harsh criticism for the " activist base " of the Democratic Party during a private fundraiser for her campaign , The Huffington Post reports .
" We have been less successful in caucuses because it brings out the activist base of the Democratic Party , " said Clinton , heard on an audio clip at Huffington .
" MoveOn did n't even want us to go into Afghanistan .
I mean , that 's what we 're dealing with .
And you know they turn out in great numbers .
" [ T ] hey are very driven by their view of our positions , " continued Clinton , " and it 's primarily national security and foreign policy that drives them .
I do n't agree with them .
They know I do n't agree with them .
So they flood into these caucuses and dominate them and really intimidate people who actually show up to support me . "
Eli Pariser of MoveOn.org , which officially endorsed Obama 's candidacy this February , released the following statement to Huffington in response to the report : Senator Clinton has her facts wrong again .
MoveOn never opposed the war in Afghanistan , and we set the record straight years ago when Karl Rove made the same claim .
Senator Clinton 's attack on our members is divisive at a time when Democrats will soon need to unify to beat Senator McCain .
MoveOn is 3.2 million reliable voters and volunteers who are an important part of any winning Democratic coalition in November .
They deserve better than to be dismissed using Republican talking points .
Reaction among progressive bloggers has been swift .
Jane Hamsher of Firedoglake writes that she 's " tried to stay out of the [ Clinton - Obama ] pie fights of late , but as a long - term defender of MoveOn and other progressive organizations -- this is completely unacceptable .
' MoveOn opposed military action in Afghanistan ' is a Republican talking point , articulated specifically and purposefully by Karl Rove . "
Quips Markos Moulitsas Zúniga ( a.k.a. Kos ) at Daily Kos , " Well , for a campaign that has morphed into nothing but ' Republican talking points , ' it should n't come as any surprise . "
Jonathan Singer at MyDD says that " even more astounding than Clinton 's specific attacks on MoveOn , a grassroots organization founded to defend her husband against the Republican power - grab that was the 1998 impeachment , an organization that is made up of more than three million activists , most of whom are diehard in their loyalty to the Democratic Party , is the fact that Clinton is maligning the Democratic base , specifically those who have been driven to the polls at least in part in response to the Iraq War . "
Oliver Willis writes , " You do n't become the nominee of the Democratic / progressive movement by undercutting the Democratic / progressive movement . "

First , it was supposed to be video of North Koreans inside of Syria ’s alleged nuke facility .
Then it turned out the “ video ” was really just the intel community ’s own presentation , which contained still photographs .
Now Reuters seems to knock the story back another notch :
A U.S. official , who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to discuss classified matters , said that among the intelligence the United States has was an image of what appeared to be people of Korean descent at the facility .
“ Appeared to be people of Korean descent ” ?

Rasmussen has started running a tracking poll on head - to - heads against McCain , with numbers running back about a month ; I have n’t seen people mentioning it .
All the usual caveats , blah blah .
But for what it ’s worth , I ’ve calculated an Obama electability advantage index ( TM ) — ( Obama minus McCain ) – ( Clinton minus McCain ) .
Here ’s what the Ras numbers say :
Basically , through much of last month this tracking poll showed Obama winning comfortably against McCain , but McCain winning comfortably against Clinton — which is more or less the narrative of many Obama supporters .
But if you believe Rasmussen , Obama has collapsed since then , while Clinton has improved — McCain / Clinton is now an approximate tie , while McCain beats Obama by five points ( hence - 4 % ) .
It ’s a long way to the general .
But this sort of thing should worry Obama supporters : if he is the nominee , he ’ll face much worse in the way of attacks than he ’s facing right now .
Add : A new WaPo poll shows both Dems beating McCain , but Obama by more .
Take both Rasmussen and this poll with a pile of salt .
Actually , take the whole polling enterprise well salted .
As it happens , I spent early Tuesday evening with some major insider types , who had exit polls and believed that Obama had put the thing away .
I took the train home , got in very late , went to bed thinking that the nomination fight was over , and opened the papers to see that it was n’t .
Nobody knows anything .
Star Jones Falls From Grace Again
set out to reinvent herself when The Star Jones Show hit the airwaves in September 2007 .
After a 5 month run , the network has pulled the plug on the lawyer .
The former Brooklyn prosecutor was attempting to provide a link between law and entertainment on her live 3 p .m. show .
According to a TruTV network spokesman , the lawyer will continue to lend her expertise as a legal expert on the weekday IN SESSION trial coverage .
Star Jones nearly 9 year run on The View started well but deteriorated in later years .
She lost a tremendous amount of weight and made waves by being less than candid about the surgical procedure that facilitated her new svelte body .
She angered many with her assertion that she had turned to diet and exercise - refusing to share the medical intervention piece .
She also lost viewer support with her ' all about me ' phase leading up to her marriage .
She monopolized the panel conversation with every detail of her upcoming nuptials .
Jones was fired from her co-hosting gig on morning talk show The View in early 2006 .
She and Barbara Walters reached the point of no return when Jones blindsided Walters on the air , revealing that her contract was not being renewed for the new season .
She was cut loose the same day and never again appeared on the show .
Jan. 28 , 2008 , is a date that will live in congressional infamy .
Congress surrendered the power of the purse over national security affairs to the White House .
President Bush appended a signing statement to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2008 denying the power of Congress to withhold funds for establishing permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq , or to control its oil resources .
The statement tacitly averred that Congress was required to appropriate money to support every presidential national security gambit , for example , launching pre-emptive wars anywhere on the planet or breaking and entering homes to gather foreign intelligence .
A few members of Congress growled , but quickly moved on with their more docile colleagues to preserve earmarks .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat , regularly sermonizes that the Constitution is subservient to advancing the Democratic Party .
The Republican leadership vocally defends the power of the purse for earmarks , but not for any matter of national security consequence .
Congress has taken the Constitution backward more than three centuries to the Stuart monarchs .
King Charles
I then levied a ship tax on maritime areas in times of war to build naval vessels .
The tax provoked popular protest when the king expanded its reach nationwide and during peacetime .
He prevailed in the British courts , but a post - Restoration successor , King James II , was overthrown for asserting an executive power to tax without the consent of Parliament .
The English Bill of Rights of 1688 assailed the last of the Stuart monarchs for subverting the liberties of the Kingdom , “ By levying money for and to the use of the Crown by pretense of prerogative for other time and in other manner than the same were granted by Parliament . ”
Accordingly , the Bill of Rights declared executive taxation or spending unauthorized by Parliament “ illegal . ”
Like the British , the Founding Fathers understood that the power of the purse in Congress was indispensable to checking the president ’s temptation to concoct excuses for war to aggrandize executive power and to achieve popular unity .
Article I , section 9 of the Constitution declares , “ No money shall be drawn from the Treasury , but in consequence of appropriations made by law . ”
James Madison , father of the Constitution , acclaimed the power of the purse as an invincible congressional weapon for redressing grievances against the executive .
The president cannot veto congressional inaction in refusing to appropriate funds ; and , he cannot spend a dime on the military or otherwise unless Congress affirmatively passes an appropriations bill .
The National Defense Authorization
Act ’s restrictions on President Bush in Iraq were no novelty .
Congress has repeatedly legislated to constrain the president ’s projection of the military abroad or has otherwise overridden his national security policies .
Richard Nixon was blocked from expanding the Vietnam War into Laos , Thailand or Cambodia .
Ronald Reagan was prevented by the Boland amendments from employing the Defense Department , the CIA or other intelligence agencies to overthrow the Sandinista government in Nicaragua .
Franklin Roosevelt was forbidden from deploying draftees outside the Western Hemisphere .
William McKinley was prohibited from annexing Cuba .
In Little v. Barreme ( 1804 ) , the Supreme Court sustained Congress ’ power to deny John Adams authority to seize ships sailing from France during a semi-war .
And Mr. Bush has bowed to congressional limits on military personnel in Colombia .
So his signing statement was preposterous in claiming that the Act unconstitutionally handcuffed his ability to protect the national security by ruling out permanent military bases in Iraq or control of its oil fields .
Yet Congress acquiesced .
It did not pass a resolution disputing Mr. Bush .
It did not threaten impeachment .
It meekly surrendered its national security relevance .
Under the precedent it left undisturbed , the president could flout congressional prohibitions on spending funds to bomb Iran ’s nuclear facilities , to invade North Korea , to conduct military offensives in Iraq , to install an anti-missile system in Poland and the Czech Republic , or to assist Taiwan against a Chinese attack .
A combination of congressional inertness and imbecility has crippled the power of the purse to check executive abuses and craving for perpetual war .
Mr. Bush is now crowned with more power than the Stuart kings .

Late Tuesday , the futures were pricing in a 90 % chance of a half - point cut and a 60 % chance of a three - quarter point cut next week .
The Fed cuts overnight rates by three - quarters of a point early Tuesday in a surprise , inter-meeting move , after U.S. recession fears sparked a global sell - off in equity markets .
Stocks fell again Wednesday , helping draw money to the bond market .
The yield on the 10 - year Treasury note was down 16.1 basis points to 3.321 % , the lowest yield seen since June 2003 .
The Fed 's emergency rate cut drew a mixed response on Wall Street .
Some analysts said it was a timely and much - needed effort to shore - up deteriorating confidence in global markets .
Others said it signaled a sense of desperation .
" Plainly the Fed realized that to try to stay ahead of the market they had to act immediately .
That is the positive reading of the action , " said Alan Ruskin , chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich , Connecticut .
" The negative viewpoint is that it smacks of panic . "
" The Fed is very , very , very worried , " said John Tierney , an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York .
The rate cut was the first in between regularly scheduled Fed meetings since Sept. 17 , 2001 , the first day U.S. financial markets reopened after the Sept. 11 terror attacks .
The last time the Fed took actions that reduced the federal funds rate by at least three - quarters of a point was in October 1984 .
However , it only began to set an explicit federal funds rate target as its primary lever to influence the economy around 1990 .
Prior to that , it had used the discount rate to signal its policy stance .
It had cut the discount rate by a full point in December 1991 .
" The committee took this action in view of a weakening of the economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth , " the Fed said , referring to its policy - setting Federal Open Market Committee .
" While strains in short - term funding markets have eased somewhat , broader financial market conditions have continued to deteriorate and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households , " it said .
A four - man science team led by British Antarctic Survey 's ( BAS ) Dr Andy Smith has begun exploring an ancient lake hidden deep beneath Antarctica 's ice sheet .
The lake -- the size of Lake Windermere ( UK ) -- could yield vital clues to life on Earth , climate change and future sea - level rise .
Glaciologist Dr Smith and his colleagues from the Universities of Edinburgh and Northumbria are camped out at one of the most remote places on Earth conducting a series of experiments on the ice .
He says ,
" This is the first phase of what we think is an incredibly exciting project .
We know the lake is 3.2 km beneath the ice ; long and thin and around 18 km2 in area .
First results from our experiments have shown the lake is 105 m deep .
This means Lake Ellsworth is a deep - water body and confirms the lake as an ideal site for future exploration missions to detect microbial life and recover climate records .
" If the survey work goes well , the next phase will be to build a probe , drill down into the lake and explore and sample the lake water .
The UK could do this as soon as 2012 / 13 . "
This ambitious exploration of ' subglacial ' Lake Ellsworth , West Antarctica , involves scientists from 14 UK universities and research institutes , as well as colleagues from Chile , USA , Sweden , Belgium , Germany and New Zealand .
The International Polar Year * project Principal Investigator is Professor Martin Siegert from the University of Edinburgh .
He says ,
" We are particularly interested in Lake Ellsworth because it 's likely to have been isolated from the surface for hundreds of thousands of years .
Radar measurements made previously from aircraft surveys suggest that the lake is connected to others that could drain ice from the West Antarctic Ice sheet to the ocean and contribute to sea- level rise . "
Professor Siegert is already planning the lake 's future exploration .
He continues , " Around 150 lakes have been discovered beneath Antarctica 's vast ice sheet and so far little is known about them .
Getting into the lake is a huge technological challenge but the effort is worth it .
These lakes are important for a number of reasons .
For example , because water acts as a lubricant to the ice above they may influence how the ice sheet flows .
Their potential for unusual life forms could shed new light on evolution of life in harsh conditions ; lake - floor sediments could yield vital clues to past climate .
They can also help us understand the extraterrestrial environment of Europa ( one of the moons of Jupiter ) . "

A poster at Ron Paul Forums got the general story straight , but missed on a minor detail with respect to Ron Paul and ongoing allegations of racism .
The posting below describes a source as being “ disgusting , vile , and repugnant ; ” I ’ll provide additional graphic examples .
Here ’s his take [ I ’m cutting - and - pasting verbatim , formatting translation errors and all ] :
One of Jamie Kirchick ’s sources for the New Republic hit piece has outed himself .
And I ’m not talking about his Reason / Cato collaborators either .
This source is much more disgusting , vile , and repugnant - so repugnant that Kirchick would never dare name him publicly in any of his articles .
Kirchick ’s vile source is Bill White , white supremacist extraordinaire , self - appointed Fuehrer of the U.S. nazi party , and vocal Ron Paul hater .
Justin Raimondo first hinted at this possibility yesterday ( http://www.takimag.com/blogs/article…popular_front/
) so I decided to investigate further .
I ’ll get to the evidence shortly , but first I ’ll comment on another ironic twist to this story .
Bill White hates Ron Paul with a passion .
He hates Ron Paul because - get this - he thinks Ron Paul ’s campaign is infiltrated by “ the Jews ” and he cites none other than the Ludwig von Mises Institute ( named after a Jewish economist and co-founded by another Jewish economist ) as “ proof ” of this .
So much for Kirchick ’s “ Ron Paul is an anti-semite ” theme .
So how do we know that Bill White is Kirchick ’s informant ?
Because Bill
White himself admitted it all over the dark little toilet of the internet he inhabits - a repulsive neo -nazi website called the “ Vanguard News Network ” ( VNN ) More importantly Bill White admitted it before Kirchick ’s story broke .
Along with a couple of “ beltway libertarians ” who have already been discussed , Bill White was the only person who knew this story was coming before it hit presses .
That is because the New Republic called him for background on the newsletters .

White posts on the VNN site under the name “ ANSWP Commander ” ( yes , for those who know their history that means American National Socialist Worker ’s Party - as in Nazi - Commander ) .
The sites this material comes from are hate - filled sewers and are not for the faint of heart , so be warned .
The URLS are there if anyone needs proof , but the links are intentionally broken or redirected to google cache where it exists so we do n’t give this scum any traffic .
It is necessary to give the sources of them though because they reveal that Kirchick has been hanging out with some very shady company and he needs to be called out on it .
Proof # 1 : Bill
White ’s post , made one week before the New Republic hit piece : Quote :
I spoke to the New Republic todayh , briefly .
I do n’t think I quite gave them as much information as they wanted .

White ’s post , made two days before the New Republic hit piece : Quote :
I am told that the New Republic has verified all my claims and is planning a huge front page story on this — they have even asked me not to give other reporters information so they do n’t get “ scooped ” .

White ’s statement yesterday where he admits his earlier communications with the New Republic : Quote :
Even I told the New Republic I did n’t think he was a “ white supremacist ” , just someone who takes money from “ the movement ” .

CONCLUSION : Bill
White knew about the New Republic story a week before it hit the web , and admitted this all over his putrid little neo -nazi website .
He knew about it because the New Republic called him up for material in their coming hit piece against Ron Paul .
Jamie Kirchick would never dare publicly credit somebody as disreputable as Bill White , but Bill White ’s own statements prove beyond a doubt that he was one of the unnamed “ sources ” the New Republic contacted .
How else could he know that this story was about to come out before it broke ?
The only other people who knew about it were Kirchick ’s friends in the Cato / Reason crowd who got tipped off by Kirchick .
But now we have proof that the New Republic smear piece came from a very disreputable source : the head of a neo - nazi party .
People like Kirchick have an agenda to smear Ron Paul .
They will yield to no boundary and stoop to any new low to conduct that smear , even if it means going to the nastiest piece of bigoted anti-semitic racist gutter trash on the web to do it .
Of course Kirchick will never publicly put that in his text , but he did n’t need to because his neo - nazi source also has a big mouth .
I ’ll start with the primary point where I disagree with Suarez ’s posting :
White was n’t the only person who had advance notice .
For example , I knew and I notified the campaign in advance on multiple occasions .
Several others did , too .
It was an open secret in certain echelons of the libertarian movement that the primary TNR article was going to be published , as too many players had either been interviewed or refused to respond to interviews .
I had spoken with friends in the media , campaign staffers , current and / or former congressional staffers , LRC bloggers , and folks in the Reason crowd before much of this stuff was published .
In several of these conversations , White ’s name came up .
This can probably be verified by my state Ron Paul chair , who was at my house one night when I took several calls , in his presence , pertaining to this general issue .
I remember commenting on one call about the irony of names like Don Black and Bill White on an issue with racial implications .
The day before one major article hit , I learned that it was going to be covered a few hours in advance on Tucker from a couple of people .
I knew about the general story weeks ahead of time .
The night before another piece hit , several people called me from the Reason Happy Hour that Kirchick reportedly attended and told me he was blabbing about the pending publication .
I was attending an Alabama GOP gala that night , and quite a few people noticed that I was on my cell phone a lot that night .
Before the Economist story ran , I heard about that one , too .
To be clear , I ’m not going to directly name my sources here .
However , in most cases , I ’ve had multiple credible sources who related the same general story about upcoming negative media pertaining to the Paul campaign .
Two commenters on this particular Ron Paul Forums entry have indicated the same general picture .
A couple of people have asked if I personally know Kirchick .
I do n’t recall having ever met him before .
The rest of the forum entry seems to be fairly accurate from the bits and pieces of which I ’m aware .
I ’ll provide examples of the racist agenda of White & Co. from a personal blog of mine .
After my good friend Aaron Russo ( one of the first prominent supporters of Ron Paul presidential campaign ) died ( Ron Paul went way out of his way to attend the memorial service ) , Vanguard posted the following :
Movies : Jew Russo Dies Jew behind “ America : Freedom to Fascism . ”
Which makes some points about Fed and IRS , altho of course remaining within SC confines .
This led to a new blog entry :
Here ’s my love comment of the day : I heard that Gordon is a well - known homosexual zionist who hates Christians .
That particular comment came because of this posting , where I went after two media sources for depicting the death of a Jewish friend of Ron Paul in a negative light .
One media source was mainstream , the other was from an anti-Jewish organization .
To show how vile some of these people can be , just check out this comment : I wo n’t stand for Alex Linder being libeled in this way .
He absolutely does favor the extermination of the jews !
“ Like I say , jews should be physically exterminated .
That is not an extremist position , that is a moderate position .
The extremist position is that they ought to be shot with silver bullets and have stakes driven through their hearts .
” - Alex Linder Currently , Ron Paul is being accused of pandering to racists on quite a websites .
Perhaps the most bizarre example is here , where the writer insinuates that Dr. Paul is a white nationalist because a racist site has a Ron Paul graphic on it .
The title of the hit piece is “ Ron Paul Watch : Paul Places Campaign Solicitation on Neo-Nazi Hate Site . ”
For the record , I ’m only half - Jewish and it ’s on the paternal side .
My dad is a Brooklyn born - and - bred Jew and my mother grew up in the Church of Christ in small town Alabama .
With respect to the accusation of being homosexual , I ’ll let my wife ( or the women I ’ve been known to ogle ) answer that charge .
Additionally , I personally introduced Russo to a lot of the Mises crowd in 2004 .
I do n’t remember everyone who was there , but some faces which come to mind belong to Lew Rockwell , Mark Thornton , John Sophecleus and Dick Clark .
I never detected a bit of racism from them .
To be equally fair , I know a lot of people at Reason who are Ron Paul supporters and some of the allegations from LRC and this Ron Paul Forums entry above may be a bit overblown .
To be clear , most Vanguard folks are n’t too happy with me .
I received some not so cleverly veiled threats when I helped expose on a now dead website ( HammerOfTruth ) the racist tendencies of a certain Larry Darby , an ally of theirs , who was running locally for a statewide public office .
I ’ve also spoken with Ron Paul many times , paid attention to the media he has generated for years and read most things he has written .
I ’ve never seen or felt a hint of racism from him .
The other side of the coin provides that I ’m not totally happy with all of his answers with respect to “ NewsletterGate . ”
The bottom line is that one should look at the sources and motivations of allegations against Ron Paul .
It becomes important to examine such issues when the general source spouts quotes like : “ Like I say , jews should be physically exterminated .
That is not an extremist position , that is a moderate position .
The extremist position is that they ought to be shot with silver bullets and have stakes driven through their hearts . ”

This little yellow robot does one thing really well .
He likes to play drums .
What ’s funny about the little guy is that he likes to play music on just about any surface other than an actual drum .
The Yellow Drum Machine drives around the room looking for things that might make an interesting sound when tapped on .
If he likes what he hears , he starts going to town with a little riff .
Once he ’s bored , he moves on , looking for something else to make noise with .
As the ‘ bot drives around , he avoids obstacles until it detects an object that looks like it might be a nice musical surface , takes some audio samples , and if he finds the sound to be pleasing , composes a little matching rhythm using the original sound sample and plays a little song .
Created by robot hacker fritsl , the little drummer dude is cobbled together from a variety of odd parts , including a PICAXE 28 microcontroller , this sound sampler , a couple of geared motors , an old wood cheese crate and plenty of hot glue .

Tell me what you see .
On second thought , do n't : A computer will soon be able to do it , simply by analyzing the activity of your brain .
That 's the promise of a decoding system unveiled this week in Nature by neuroscientists from the University of California at Berkeley .
The scientists used a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine – a real - time brain scanner – to record the mental activity of a person looking at thousands of random pictures : people , animals , landscapes , objects , the stuff of everyday visual life .
With those recordings the researchers built a computational model for predicting the mental patterns elicited by looking at any other photograph .
When tested with neurological readouts generated by a different set of pictures , the decoder passed with flying colors , identifying the images seen with unprecedented accuracy .
" No one that I know would ever have guessed our decoder would do this well , " study co-author Jack Gallant said .
As the decoder is refined , it could be used to explore the phenomenon of visual attention – concentration on one part of a complicated scene – and then to illuminate the dimly understood intricacies of the mind 's eyes .
" One day it may even be possible to reconstruct the visual content of dreams , " Gallant said .
After that , the decoding model could be harnessed for more visionary purposes : early warning systems for neurological diseases or interfaces that allow paralyzed people to engage with the world .
Other uses may not be so noble , such as marketing campaigns crafted for maximum mental penetration or invasions of mental privacy mounted in the name of fighting terrorism and crime .
Those technologies remain decades away , but researchers say it 's not too soon to think about them , especially if research progresses at the pace set by this study .
Earlier decoders could only tell whether someone looked at a general type of image – at a dog , for example – but could n't identify more specific photos , such as a small dog eating a bone .
They 've also been incapable of predicting what thought patterns an image would provoke .
The Berkeley model overcame both those limitations .
" It 's quite tedious to measure every possible thought you might encounter , then measure the brain activity for that , " said John - Dylan Haynes , a Max Planck Institute neuroscientist who was not involved in the study .
" This is a big step forward . "
Future steps involve expanding the decoder beyond its current focus on the brain 's primary visual cortex , which represents general forms but does n't handle the more complicated optical information processed in other parts of the brain .
More detail is also required , as the brain scanners used for the study measure blood flow caused by neural activity at a relatively coarse resolution of two cubic millimeters .
A higher - resolution , fully reconstructive decoder could help researchers chart the incredibly complex processes underlying visual perception .
Gallant also hopes it could be used to detect early symptoms of neurological diseases like Alzheimer 's and Parkinson's .
Eventually , Haynes said , the Berkeley model could be harnessed for something akin to mind reading .
" We want not only to decode people 's perceptions , but also high - level mental states : people 's intentions , their plans , " Haynes said .
But Gallant warned of technological malfeasance .
In the courtroom , mental readouts could have the same problems as eyewitness testimony , which is often unreliable and biased even though witnesses believe they 're telling the truth .
The allure of reading minds to prove innocence or guilt , Haynes said , could override concerns about mental privacy – an ethically ambiguous conflict .
More obviously dubious is the possible use of mind - reading machines by marketers .
" There 's some things we can do , and some we can't , " Haynes said .
" Some things are very easy , and others are not .
But it 's vital to think about the ethics now . "
Rice prices ' to keep on rising '
The price of rice has risen by 70 % in the past year Rice prices are set to keep rising as demand for the staple is outstripping production , the International Rice Research Institute ( IRRI ) has said .
The Philippines - based body said in its Rice Today publication that more research was needed in how to increase rice productivity .
The price of rice has risen by as much as 70 % during the past year , with increases accelerating in recent weeks .
Several rice - producing countries have put curbs on exports in recent weeks .
' Research needed ' " Longer term demand - supply imbalance is clearly indicated by depletion of stock that has been going on for several years , " said Sushil Pandey , agricultural economist at the IRRI .
BBC NEWS RICE DAY A BBC
News focus on the impact of steep rises in the price of rice , staple food of 3bn people Coverage on radio , TV and online from Bangladesh , India , Philippines , West Africa and California
Special report : Food price crisis
" We have been consuming more than what we have been producing and research to increase rice productivity is needed to address this imbalance . "
The institute said several factors were behind the rise in rice prices .
Land for producing rice and irrigation water is being lost to industrialisation and urbanisation .
The growing appetite among Asia 's burgeoning urban middle class , especially in India and China , for meat and dairy products is also leading to less land for rice production .
Factors such as the flooding in Indonesia and Bangladesh and recent cold weather in Vietnam and China have also hurt production , it said .
Export restrictions are in place in major rice producing countries such as India , China , Vietnam and Egypt Rice is the staple food for about three billion people worldwide .
The prices of soybeans , corn and wheat are also near historic highs .

The dangers associated with cell phones could far outweigh those tied to asbestos and smoking , an Australian doctor recently warned in a new report .
In his paper , " Mobile Phones and Brain Tumors -- A Public Health Concern , " Vini G. Khurana , a staff specialist neurosurgeon at the Canberra Hospital and associate professor of neurosurgery with Australian National University Medical School , summarizes a 14 - month study in which he reviewed previous reports on the effects of mobile phone usage in medical and scientific publications as well as the popular press .
" There is a significant and increasing body of evidence for a link between mobile phone usage and certain brain tumors , " Khurana writes .
" The link between mobile phones and brain tumors should no longer be regarded as a myth . "
Fourfold Risk Possible
Cell phones can be invaluable in emergency situations and have contributed to the quality of human life , Khurana acknowledges .
However , when used heavily over many years , the electromagnetic radiation they produce can do harm to the brain , which is itself an electrical organ , he notes .
Cell phones can also heat up the contents of the head , he notes .
There is strong evidence suggesting a relationship between the length of cell - phone usage and the delayed occurrence of an acoustic neuroma or astrocytoma brain tumor on the same side of the head as the " preferred side " for phone usage , Khurana adds , amounting to a risk increase of 200 percent to 400 percent .
" Given the widespread use of mobile phones by children and adults alike , the presence of any health risk posed by long - term near - field radiation will inevitably set the stage for the emergence of a global public health problem , " Khurana writes .
Back to Landlines ?
The scientific and medical communities need to reevaluate previous studies that found no link between cell phones and brain cancer , Khurana says , and the telecommunications industry needs to expedite the development and promotion of " safe , practical and ubiquitous EMR / radiofrequency shielding devices for mobile and cordless phones and their Bluetooth and headset accessories . "
It also should further refine hands - free speakerphone options , he says .
Consumers , meanwhile , should use landlines whenever possible , he said , or at least speakerphone options when available .
They should minimize the use of mobile and cordless phones in general as well as Bluetooth devices and unshielded headphone accessories , he says .
Children , Khurana added , should use wireless technologies only in emergency situations .
' One Person 's Opinion '
The cellular industry is yet to be convinced .
" This is just one person 's opinion of existing research , " Joe Ferren , a spokesperson for CTIA - The Wireless Association , told TechNewsWorld .
The link between mobile - phone use and cancer is even listed among the American Cancer Society 's " Top 10 Cancer Myths , " Ferren noted .
" There is a consensus among global health organizations and leading scientists that there is no association between wireless usage and health effects , " Ferren said .
The Next Tobacco Industry ?
Given the widespread nature of cell phones and the divergent results of the many studies that have been done , it will be difficult for consumers to draw any clear - cut conclusions .
" Could this cause people to overreact ?
I see that being inevitable , " David Chamberlain , principal analyst with In - Stat , told TechNewsWorld .
" Someone will want to pass a law somewhere . "
It 's to be expected that the wireless industry would downplay any such fears , Chamberlain added , noting that one day , " they could look like the tobacco companies . "
' Life 's a Risk '
In the meantime , however , " I think everybody should just continue to make their own choices just the way we do when we decide to wear helmets when we ride motorcycles or to wear kneepads when we skateboard , " Chamberlain said .
" It 's all about the same thing . "
For now , " I do n't know what can be done , other than individuals taking steps to ensure their own safety when they perceive a risk , " Chamberlain concluded .
" Life 's a risk , and making our own choices is all we can do . "
John McCain , on the first day of a tour intended to tout his security credentials , admitted yesterday that he was caught off guard by the recent violence in Iraq .
McCain , who plans to devote the week to showcasing his family 's tradition of military service , told reporters in Mississippi that he had not expected the Iraqi leader , Nouri al - Maliki , to launch an offensive against Shia militias in Basra - especially without informing the Americans .
" I just am surprised that he would take it on himself to go down and take charge of a military offensive , " he said .
" I had not anticipated that he would do that . "
It was an unexpected admission for a candidate who has based his campaign around his military credentials .
McCain , now the presumptive Republican nominee , was from the start one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the US invasion of Iraq .
However , he broke with George Bush in the early days of the war , arguing forcefully for a larger American troop presence .
The visit to Mississippi was the first leg of a week - long tour , meant to remind Americans of the McCain family 's four generations of service in the military and his commitment to values of " honour , courage , duty , perseverance and leadership " .
It also helps to bring McCain positive attention at a time when Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are in a bruising campaign for the Democratic nomination .
McCain 's campaign has started to broadcast television ads dwelling on his years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi .
From Meridien , Mississippi , where there is an airfield named after McCain 's grandfather , a former US navy admiral , he heads today for his former high school in Alexandria , Virginia .
Tomorrow , McCain will revisit the US naval academy in Annapolis , Maryland , where he graduated fifth from the bottom of his class .
Now 71 , McCain claimed yesterday that the period of his life was one of youthful rebellion .
" As a boy , my family legacy , as fascinating as it was to me , often felt like an imposition , " he said .
But he said he came in the end to recognise the importance of service .
On one side is the Church of Scientology , freshly boosted by a $ 10 m donation from the actor Nancy Cartwright , the voice of Bart Simpson .
On the other is what the self - styled church has dismissed as a " pathetic " collection of " computer geeks " : a maverick band of hackers who have launched an online war against the organisation .
The hackers were infuriated by the removal from YouTube last month of a Scientologists ' video clip featuring Tom Cruise .
They have alleged that Scientologists forced YouTube to remove the embarrassing footage , in which the actor hailed the religion as " a blast " .
Cruise claimed : " We are the authorities on getting people off drugs , we are the authorities on the mind , we are the authorities on improving conditions ... we can rehabilitate criminals ... we can bring peace and unite communities . "
Yet the church has appeared powerless to stop the online sabotage .
Guerrilla action has so far included the temporary disabling of its international website and " Google bombing " , a manipulation of the search engine which has resulted in the website being the first result returned by Google when users type " dangerous cult " .
Scientology 's UK website has been unavailable and in the US the FBI were investigating what they said was the hoax dispatch of white powder in envelopes to 19 churches in the Los Angeles area .
Meanwhile , the intensity of the battle shows no signs of easing .
A day of free speech protests have been planned outside Scientology centres around the world next Sunday , with campaigners mobilising on Facebook and YouTube .
Protesters are vowing to picket buildings in London , Birmingham , Manchester , Edinburgh and York on the British leg of the day of direct action , three weeks after a group of internet activists called Anonymous vowed to destroy the movement .
They said they were opposed to Scientologists ' " speech - suppression tactics " , which they claim include " frivolous " lawsuits and the use of copyright and trademark laws to silence free speech .
An Anonymous video posted on YouTube about the anti-Scientology campaign - called " Project Chanology " - has been watched more than 1.7 m times .
Protest sites against Scientology have also proliferated .
Two Facebook groups have more than 3,500 members .
A British organiser claims more than 1,000 people will join the UK demonstrations on February 10 , with protests also planned in dozens of American cities and around the world , including Toronto , Vancouver , Oslo , Sydney , Melbourne and Dublin .
" I do n't want them to get a foothold in the UK the same way as they have in other countries , " said one demonstration organiser , a 21 - year - old student who asked to remain anonymous in keeping with the protesters ' aims .
" They claim to be a church and a religion but they charge people to attend their sessions and they are a registered trademark - that does n't strike anyone as a religion . "
The organiser described the protesters as mainly a " youth movement " drawn from all walks of life .
" At the start this was a hacker operation but it is more than that now .
Scientologists say it 's just a bunch of hacker geeks but that 's going to be proved wrong on February 10 . "
In a series of warm - up rallies on Saturday , 100 people gathered outside a Scientology centre in Orlando carrying signs saying " Knowledge is Free " .
In the UK , half - a- dozen protesters leafleted shoppers and brandished a banner reading " Scientology Sucks " in Manchester .
Scientologists have fought back by hiring a specialist internet company to help defend its website .
In the US , a Scientology spokesperson dismissed the campaigners as a " pathetic " group of " geeks " .
But they played down the conflict yesterday .
" We do n't get into responding to such threats on the internet , particularly anonymous ones , " said Janet Laveau , a spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology in Britain .
Laveau said the online publication by hackers of the Cruise video had caused a surge of interest in the movement .
Presenting " these selective and out - of - context excerpts with the intent of creating both controversy and ridicule nevertheless resulted in people searching for and visiting Church of Scientology websites , " she said .
" Those wishing to find out the Church of Scientology 's views and to gain context of the video have the right to search official Church websites . "
In a US statement , the organisation said it did not threaten websites for posting the Cruise video .
But Scientologists have previously mounted legal challenges against other internet publishers .
A 10 - year legal campaign against a Dutch writer , Karin Spaink , and a number of internet service providers ended in defeat for the Scientologists in court in the Netherlands in 2005 .
Spaink and others had posted documents from a disaffected former Scientologist that were claimed to be the secretive official teachings .
According to Andreas Heldal - Lund , a free - speech campaigner from Norway and critic of Scientology , the " war " has been won by internet activists - with the wide dispersal of negative publicity about Scientology .
Heldal - Lund welcomed the demonstrations but condemned the sabotage of Scientology websites .
" One of the biggest arguments against Scientology is they are a threat to free speech and here they can say people are hitting back at their free speech .
It ruins our argument . "
Ian Hickson released his Acid 3 test a little while ago , and though there have been a couple of changes recently , it ’s pretty much settled down in its final form .
There ’s been a lot of discussion of how different browsers do on the test , and it ’s clear that some projects are really buckling down to get to 100 and the pixel - perfect rendering .
You might ask why Mozilla ’s not racking up daily gains , especially if you ’re following the relevant bugs and seeing that people have produced patches for some issues that are covered by Acid 3 .
The most obvious reason is Firefox 3 .
We ’re in the end - game of building what I really do believe is the best browser the web has ever known , and we expect to be putting it in the hands of more than 170 million users in a pretty short period of time .
We ’re still taking fixes for important issues , but virtually none of the issues on the Acid 3 list are important enough for us to take at this stage .
We do n’t want to be rushing fixes in , or rushing out a release , only to find that we ’ve broken important sites or regressed previous standards support , or worse introduced a security problem .
Every API that ’s exposed to content needs to be tested for compliance and security and reliability , and we already have some tough rows to hoe with respect to conflicts with existing content as it is .
We think these remaining late - stage patches are worth the test burden , often because they help make the web platform much more powerful , and reflect real - web compatibility and capability issues .
Acid 3 ’s contents , sadly , are not as often of that nature .
Ian ’s Acid 3 , unlike its predecessors , is not about establishing a baseline of useful web capabilities .
It ’s quite explicitly about making browser developers jump —
Ian specifically sought out tests that were broken in WebKit , Opera , and Gecko , perhaps out of a twisted attempt at fairness .
But the Acid tests should n’t be fair to browsers , they should be fair to the web ; they should be based on how good the web will be as a platform if all browsers conform , not about how far any given browser has to stretch to get there .
The selection of specifications is also troubling .
First , there is a limitation that the specification had to be suitably finished by 2004 , meaning that only standards that were finalized during the darkest period of web stagnation were eligible : standards that predate people actively reviving the web platform , through work like the WHATWG ’s < canvas > specification .
While this did protect us from tests requiring the worst of SVG ’s excesses ( 1.2 , with support for such key graphical capabilities as file upload and sockets , was promoted to CR in 2007 ) , it also means that it includes @font - face , a specification which was so poorly thought of that it was removed in 2.1 .
I can think of no reason to place such time - based restrictions on specification selection other than perhaps to ensure that there has been time for errata to surface — but in the case of CSS , those errata are directly excluded !
Similarly , the WHATWG ’s work to finally develop an interoperable specification for such widely - used things as .innerHtml were excluded .
( If the test is about “ fairness ” , I could see not wanting to target specifications that were so new that people just had n’t had time to catch up to them , but again I think that such a test should be built on more long - term criteria than lining up the starting blocks for a developer sprint .
We could be using Acid tests as an “ experience index ” for the web , if you will . )
I also believe that the tests should focus on areas where the missing features ca n’t be easily worked around ; SMIL ’s capabilities are available to interested authors via an easy - to - use library , and if Hixie could stomach digging around in the SVG specification I wish he ’d spent his time on things like filters or even colour profiles , which lacks are much harder to work around .
People who misread my disappointment or our lack of last minute Acid - boosting patches as a lack of commitment to standards would do well to study our history as a project .
For more than a decade , we ’ve been dedicated to support of standards , and improvement of those standards , even though it has often been painful to do so .
In 1998 we threw away our entire layout engine in order to rebuild on one that provided , we believed , a better basis for the new standards of the day : DOM , CSS , etc .
We ’ve changed our implementations of < canvas > , of global localStorage , of JavaScript — all to track changes in standards , and to avoid conflicting with them .
Last night , we disabled cross - site XHR because we are n’t certain what way the spec was going to go , and if , e.g. , we ship something that does n’t send cookies , we would constrain where the spec could go by building developer expectations about that behaviour .
( These developer expectations about what sorts of requests can be triggered from cross - domain content are basically the entire reason that we need special work for cross - site XHR mashup technology . )
We will fix standards compliance bugs ; it ’s what we do .
But we wo n’t fix them all with the same priority , and I hope that we wo n’t prioritize Acid 3 fixes artificially highly , because I think that would be a disservice to web developers and users .
Where Acid 3 happens to test something that we believe is important to fix , we will of course pursue it : surrogate pair handling or some of the selector bugs seem like good candidates .
Acid 3 could have had a tremendous positive effect on the web , representing the next target for the web platform , and helping developers prioritize work in such a way as to maximize the aggregate capabilities of the web .
Instead , it feels like a puzzle game , and I can easily imagine the developers of the web ’s proprietary competitors chuckling about the hundreds of developer - hours that have gone into adding another way to iterate over nodes , or twiddling internal APIs to special case a testing font .
I do n’t think it ’s worthless , but I think it could have been a lot more , especially with someone as talented and terrifyingly detail - oriented as Ian at the helm .
Maybe next time .
[ Update : the WebKit checkin to special - case Ahem was n't one that used a private OS X API , it was one that used an internal CoreGraphics API on Windows ; I should have been reading more closely , apologies to the WebKit folks . ]
In a world crawling with merciless terrorists , corrupt politicians and sociopath hedge - fund managers , we need a fictional hero to save us .
Or are we so unsure of ourselves , so morally conflicted , that we ca n’t even win in fantasy ?
Back in 1941 , Captain America , a purely political creation , was charged with a single task : to kick Nazi butt .
The Captain , in fact , confronted the Germans before the United States did , in one issue punching Adolf Hitler ’s lights out .
One of Captain America ’s creators claimed that during the late ’30s and early ’ 40s , “ the opponents to the war were all quite well organized .
We wanted to have our say , too . ”
And soon enough , Wonder Woman and scores of other fictional champions of the American Way employed guile and fists — unilaterally — to confront the depraved Axis powers .
And Captain America went about his business without permission from Congress .
Comic book heroism was n’t exclusively about warfare , of course .
Superman , the über - superhero , was defined by another distinct notion of patriotism .
Comic - book scholar Roger Sabin contends that the Great Depression and “ the liberal idealism of Franklin Roosevelt ’s New Deal ” formed Superman ’s left - leaning ethos .
As the “ savior of the helpless and oppressed , ” Clark Kent ’s alter - ego rarely concerned himself with international threats .
Instead , he pursued shady cigar - chewing corporate magnates , devious politicians and even went toe - to - toe with the Ku Klux Klan in one famous radio broadcast .
In his spare time , naturally , he was a journalist .
Later , American kids had GI Joe .
There were at one point four GI Joe figures , each representing a different branch of the armed forces .
GI Joe , though , was n’t completely fictional .
The Marine figure for a time actually celebrated wartime heroism .
The doll was based on Mitchell Paige , a recipient of the Medal of Honor during World War II , who single - handedly stopped an entire Japanese regiment by himself .
For my generation , superheroes morphed from comic books to larger - than - life cinematic action heroes .
These pugilists fought crime without being hampered by annoyances like Miranda rights or double jeopardy .
John Rambo , after fighting the war at home in his first movie , assisted Afghans in taking down the entire Soviet invasion force by his third .
Former karate champ Chuck Norris traveled to Vietnam to avenge the lost war and rescue prisoners left behind by a nation too weak to care .
All of it was cathartic .
Revenge and justice , in fact , could be unearthed everywhere in pop culture .
When the detective duo of “ Lethal Weapon 2 ” shot a South African diplomat — who was not only a racist , but also a drug dealer — in the head , all those who oppose apartheid could feel just a little better about the world .
This brand of moral absolutism is frowned upon these days .
Our nation seems unable to serve up fictional characters without weighing them down with moral ambiguity and layers of complex emotional baggage .
Our cinematic heroes are most often tortured , imperfect souls , even when they do good .
We ’ve become so cynical , in fact , that we ca n’t even imagine ourselves as unconditionally in the right .
Sure , we still have Rambo , but at 60 and with a questionable grasp of his mental facilities , no one is overly confident .
Nowadays , movies are more likely to offer portents of destruction and a disturbing future .
We are faced with environmental disasters in “ The Day After Tomorrow . ”
Or “ Cloverfield , ” wherein a monster tears the head off the Statue of Liberty , then terrorizes a gaggle of hipsters in Manhattan .
Ultra-sadistic horror and disaster flicks — a staple of another decade of unease , the ’ 70s — are the flavor of the day .
The only mainstream politically escapist entertainment we can find today is the television show “ 24 , ” which follows the adventures of counterterrorist agent Jack Bauer , played by Kiefer Sutherland .
Each season , Bauer untangles terrorist schemes jeopardizing the lives of thousands .
Incredibly , in a 24 - hour span — over and over again — Bauer rescues the unsuspecting public from colossal catastrophe .
Bauer , to be kind , is n’t tethered to the tenets of the Geneva Conventions or overly concerned about the FISA court .
Bauer has an imaginary job to do , after all .
And to extract valuable information from suspects , he tortures them .
Occasionally , he tortures them emotionally , but mostly he tortures them physically .
He almost always gets what he needs .
The problem is that the show ’s sixth season saw ratings fall .
Producers claimed they had difficulty recruiting actors , many of whom , according to The Wall Street Journal , “ disapproved of the show ’s depiction of torture . ”
Head writer Howard Gordon told the paper that , “ The fear and wish - fulfillment the show represented after 9/11 ended up boomeranging against us .
We were suddenly facing a blowback from current events . ”
Now , I oppose torture .
And by torture , I mean listening to moralizing actors who ca n’t differentiate between an escapist action show and reality .
Playing a role on “ 24 ” is no more an endorsement of torture than playing a run-of - the - mill , misogynistic murderer is an endorsement of serial killers .
At least in this sort of fiction , the public can forget we have an incompetent CIA and for 24 hours pretend that someone somewhere is actually on top of global terrorism .
In any event , “ 24 ” producers were told to “ re-imagine ” the show , so we can look forward to a kinder , gentler Jack Bauer .
And GI Joe ?
He reportedly no longer takes orders from the U.S. government .
In a movie due out next year , Joe is commanded by a “ European - based military unit known as Global Integrated Joint Operating Entity ( GIJOE ) . ”
Perhaps he ’ll track down global warming deniers and copyright infringers .
Last we heard from the real Captain America , he was protesting a new federally mandated law requiring all “ super - powered ” individuals to register with the government .
Such laws , he believed , were an assault on civil rights of the “ superhero community . ”
He was killed by an assassin ’s bullet soon after .
I kid you not .
Some say that popular culture is typically a reflection of our national psyche .
If that ’s true , we ’re a nation completely unsure of itself .

The Hydra Project is a new script for private BitTorrent trackers designed to resist any attack or raid , and to guarantee the privacy and anonymity of its users .
It 's truly hydra compatible , which is much needed quality in these turbulent times .
The Hydra Project , THP for short , is developed with privacy , anonymity and survivability in mind .
One of innovative features of the project is to make an OpenID for users of private BitTorrent sites so their login information and upload / download ratios can be shared across different websites .
The torrents can also be shared among different trackers .
This ensures that user ratios and uploaded torrents will not be lost if for some reason one of the BitTorrent trackers ceases to exist .
Shanti Braford , the developer of the project explained to TorrentFreak : “ The idea is that a group of admins can get together and form a sort of distributed set of private BitTorrent trackers .
bacon.org , eggs.com , ham .net and sausage .fm can all get together , share user databases , torrents , upload / download ratios , etcetera .
If eggs.com gets raided , the rest of the sites are still alive and the torrents people have downloaded will still work because they ’ll be associated with multiple tracker URLs . ”
THP will be one of the most private and anonymous BitTorrent trackers , something that most users will absolutely appreciate .
For example , no email addresses will be collected , the IPs will not be stored ( only memcached ) and . torrent files will not be connected to users .
There is even an option for the administrator to delete all data via a memcached shutdown in case the server loses its connection to the network , which will happen if there ’s a raid .
The tracker script is developed in Ruby on Rails .
“ The code is about 90 % there , ” Shanti told us “ I ’ve kept it very simple and rudimentary , but functional .
If any PHP coders are interested perhaps it could be ported over . ”
I would encourage all developers who are interested in the project to take at the project page and THP ’s Sync API wiki .
If THP lives up to its expectations the Hydra will be more flexible and stronger than ever .
Yet another of my pens has just disappeared from where I swear I just left it and is probably already with my smug doppelganger in a parallel universe .
We all have our favourite take on the existence of parallel worlds ; it 's a subject that has been fodder for science - fiction writers for quite a while now .
The question is whether the idea has a place in serious scientific discourse .
Well , it seems the only known recordings of a physicist who predicted the existence of parallel universes have been found in his rockstar son's basement .
The tapes document how quantum physicist , Hugh Everett III , developed a remarkable idea at the age of 24 while a graduate student at Princeton in 1957 .
The recordings are believed to have been made at a conference 20 years later , and were discovered during the making of a documentary in which Mark Everett , the physicist 's son and singer of the band Eels , attempts to understand the work that consumed his father .
Those more astute followers of science news may have also become understandably excited at the recent news that , finally , there might be a way of proving the existence of Everett 's universes and reclaiming all those lost pens .
One online headline read : " Parallel universes really do exist , according to a mathematical discovery by Oxford scientists . "
Another quoted a respected US physicist as saying : " This work will go down as one of the most important in the history of science . "
Good grief .
So is this for real ?
Or is it just sensationalising journalism ?
What we should first ask is what place the theory of parallel universes has in real physics ?
So allow me to lead you through gently .
Many cosmologists are quite keen on an idea that requires the existence of other realities as an anthropic argument .
That is , in order to explain why our universe seems to be just right for humans we need simply appeal to the obvious : that our universe is not unique .
There must be an infinite number of universes in a much larger multiverse and we happen to be in the one that by definition had to be just right .
While this is a very attractive idea , I find it rather lazy .
In fact , I would argue that it is no more satisfying than creationism .
But the notion of parallel universes has a more serious raison d'etre ; one that was introduced to science exactly half a century ago .
Quantum mechanics - the theory that describes the workings of the subatomic world - is based on many counterintuitive ideas .
This is not news .
Most physicists learn to live with the notion of a subatomic particle being in two places at once .
We put up with this because quantum mechanics , as a mathematical framework for describing how atoms behave , is so successful .
Indeed , I would argue that it is the most important theory in the whole of science - beating Darwin with one hand behind its back , since it explains why our universe is the way it is .
Indeed , this year 's Nobel prize was awarded for the discovery of something called giant magneto - resistance , a neat quantum effect that has led directly to the technology that allows for more than one song to be stored on your iPod .
But there is this frustrating weirdness at the heart of quantum mechanics that wo n't go away .
It is difficult to translate what is essentially advanced mathematics into words that make sense .
Another way of putting it is that while the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics is not in doubt , nobody has yet found a satisfactory explanation of what it means that is agreeable to everyone .
Should this not be a cause for concern ?
Many physicists feel strongly that there is no problem .
They would argue that drawing attention to the conflicts between different interpretations is unnecessary .
But there are ways of explaining quantum weirdness , albeit with yet more weirdness .
One such interpretation as to how subatomic particles can do more than one thing at once is for there to be more than one universe .
After first being introduced by Everett , this idea has had a steadily growing minority of supporters .
Everett proposed what became known as the " many worlds " interpretation of quantum mechanics , which has since come to be regarded as both the most extravagant explanation of reality , and yet the most simple , depending on which side you are on .
The basic idea is as follows : whenever a quantum particle is faced with a choice of alternatives ( as happens everywhere all the time ) , it does n't choose one but rather all .
It is only when we look that we force the little blighter to make up its mind .
This is not even the controversial bit ; we know this happens .
But in the many - worlds version the particle never makes up its mind .
Instead , it , and the universe along with it , splits into multiple versions of itself equal to the number of options available .
When we look at the particle , the universes separate into non-interacting independent realities .
We see one version , but our identical counterparts see another .
There was little initial support for Everett 's idea .
He became disillusioned and left physics to work for the US defence industry - where he made a fortune working out how to maximise kill rates during a nuclear war .
I should point out that this is not the natural career progression of quantum physicists .
Oxford physicist David Deutsch , one of the founding fathers of the exciting field of quantum computing , later proposed a variation on Everett 's idea in which all possible universes already exist within a quantum multiverse .
What we perceive as our reality is just a weaving through this vast shadowy multiple reality , creating our own version of events .
While supporters of the multiverse interpretation argue that it is the most sensible explanation , the majority of physicists are sceptical , mainly since it is essentially unprovable .
This brings me finally to the recent headlines .
It turns out that there is no proof that the multiverse exists , but rather that one of the main objections to it has been removed by an argument in logic and algebra that has yet to appear in any peer - reviewed scientific journal .
Of course I understand scientists being keen to publicise their research , and that sometimes journalists see a story too juicy to ignore .
But for now , let 's take parallel universes with a pinch of salt .
And if we are going to explain science , let us at least ensure we use the scientific method , with its reliance on peer review and reproducibility .
And give up hope of ever getting those pens back .

The raging eruption of dust and water from the south pole of Enceladus , Saturn 's sixth - largest moon , has intrigued scientists ever since the Cassini spacecraft provided dramatic images of the phenomenon .
Physicist Nikolai Brilliantov from the University of Leicester and colleagues in Germany , have revealed why the dust particles in the plume emerge more slowly than the water vapour escaping from the moon 's icy crust .
Enceladus orbits in Saturn 's outermost " E " ring .
It is one of only three outer solar system bodies that produce active eruptions of dust and water vapour .
Moreover , aside from the Earth , Mars , and Jupiter 's moon Europa , it is one of the only places in the solar system for which astronomers have direct evidence of the presence of water .
Geyser on Enceladus .

The erupting plume on Enceladus is ejected by geyser - like volcanic eruptions from deep , " tiger - stripe " cracks within the moon 's south pole .
Some astronomers have suggested that the myriad tiny grains of dust from these eruptions could be the actual source of Saturn 's E-ring .
However , the dynamics and the origin of the plume itself have remained a mystery .
Now , Brilliantov , who is also on the faculty at the University of Potsdam , Germany and Moscow State University , working with Juergen Schmidt and Frank Spahn of Potsdam and Sascha Kempf of the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg , and the Technical University of Braunschweig , Germany have developed a new theory to explain the formation of these dust particles and to explain why they are ejected into space .
The researchers point out that once ejected the dust particles , which are in fact icy grains , and water vapour are too dilute to interact with each other and so the water vapour cannot be the cause of the dusty slowdown .
Instead , the team suggests that the shift in speed must occur below the moon 's surface before ejection .
The numerous cracks through which the plume material escapes from the moon 's icy surface , and which can be hundreds of metres deep , are narrower at some points along their length .
At these points temperature and pressure of vapour drop drastically down , causing condensation of vapour into icy grains and hence to formation of the dust - vapour mixture .
The required vapour density to accelerate the grains to the observed speeds implies temperatures where liquid water can exist in equilibrium with solid ice and water vapour within the moon 's frozen crust .
These peculiar conditions allow the water vapour to erupt rapidly carrying with it the dust particles .
However , these particles undergo countless frequent collisions with the inside of the channel walls which causes friction that slows them down before final ejection .
The larger the particle the slower the ejection speed .
This effect , quantified by the new theory , explains the structure of the plume and eventually the particle size distribution of the E-ring of Saturn .
The existence of liquid water is a prerequisite for life and , while not suggesting there is life on Enceladus , offers another extraterrestrial place that might be searched .

Stereotype stuffs up women 's driving
Calling women lousy drivers may be a self - fulfilling prophecy because it disrupts their focus and makes them more likely to run over pedestrians , new research suggests .
An Australian study found that women who are told that men are better drivers are more than twice as likely to collide with jaywalking pedestrians as other women in a similar test .
Dr Courtney von Hippel from the School of Psychology at the University of Queensland and team publish their study in the journal Accident Analysis and Prevention .
" When people are confronted with negative stereotypes about themselves they seem to experience an additional cognitive load , which can decrease their performance on a task , " says von Hippel .
" There can be subtle things happening in the environment while a woman is driving , like a male driver shaking his head when she tries to reverse park a car . "
There have been hundreds of studies about the ' stereotype threat ' effect since the idea was first discussed in psychology in the mid 1990s .
But most have focused on verbal and written tests rather than an applied task .
This one shows how stereotyping can undermine women 's performance during a driving simulation study .
The researchers recruited 168 female university students .
Half the participants in one experiment heard that the study would investigate why men are better drivers than women and were told that the simulation would test the gender difference in driving abilities .
The control group heard no mention of gender differences but were told that the driving task would investigate the mental processes involved in driving .
Nearly half of the drivers in the ' stereotype threat ' group hit a jaywalking pedestrian who unexpectedly appeared in the simulation .
Another experiment used the same driving simulation to show that participants who were distracted by a grammatical test were also twice as likely to hit the jaywalker .
" For safety reasons , our stereotype threat manipulation had to be quite contrived , " says von Hippel .
" But it shows that it would be worth doing a more thorough investigation , perhaps an observational study , to discover what is going on here . "

In what will perhaps become Chris Wallace ’s proudest moment , yesterday ’s interview of Barack Obama offers a glimpse into the subtle efforts FOX makes to frame the debate .
In the first 9 minutes all of Wallace ’s questions and comments were about race .
9:03 A.M EST : WALLACE : But some observers , and some liberal observers say is that part of your problem is you come off as a former law professor who talks about transforming politics when the lunch bucket crowd really wants to know what youre going to do for them .
Bob Herbert , columnist for the New York Times , happens to be a black man , says that Hillary Clinton seems tougher than you do .
9:06:32 Senator , for all your efforts to run a post - racial campaign , is n’t there still a racial divide in this country that is going to make it very hard for you to get elected president ?
Which created a perfect transition into … the real issue at hand .
9:09 WALLACE : I was n’t sure whether I was even going to ask you about your former pastor , Jeremiah Wright , but he made it easy for me because he ’s now begun this …
Which continued through 6 questions and 6 minutes , to lead into this .
WALLACE : Senator , you say a lot of good stuff .
Reverend Wright ( INAUDIBLE ) are distractions from the real issues .
But especially for someone like you , who ’s a newcomer to the national scene , people do n’t know a lot about , do n’t voters have a legitimate interest in who you are and what your values are ?
Obama swung back at this one fairly hard , forcing Wallace to pivot his line of questioning to William Ayres , which continue for the final three minutes before first television break .
20 minutes in , no questions related to policy .
First question after the break :
Over the years , John McCain has broken with his party and risked his career on a number of issues , campaign finance , immigration reform , banning torture .
As a president , can you name a hot button issue where you would be willing to cross ( ph ) Democratic party line and say you know what , Republicans have a better idea here .
Shorter Chris Wallace : John McCain is a maverick , are you ?
You want Republican votes ?
Prove it .
Everyone on the Internet seems to have gotten the message that John McCain is not a maverick anymore .
As Arianna said on Real Time last week , he has been reduced to a “ pandering pawn ” of the “ agents of intolerance ” he once repudiated .
Obama was then allowed two minutes to talk policy , in order to talk about situations where Republicans have better ideas than Democrats .
Having his victim exactly where he wants him , Wallace completes the trap .
9:24:46 WALLACE : But , Senator , if I may , I think one of the concerns that some people have is that you talk a good game about , let ’s be post - partisan , let ’s all come together — just a couple of quick things , and I do n’t really want you to defend each one , I just want to speak to the larger issue .
The larger issue , excellent !
On some issues where Democrats have moved to the center , partial - birth abortion , Defense of Marriage Act , you stay on the left and you are against both .
9:25:22
And so people say , do you really want a partnership with Republicans or do you really want unconditional surrender from them ?
Shorter Chris Wallace :
If you really wanted to be post partisan , you ’d chip away at a woman ’s right to choose and discriminate against homosexuals .
Obama was then given another two minutes to bend over backwards to appeal to conservative voters .
With all of the fluff out of the way , Wallace has one more thing to get off his chest .
Opposition research .
9:28 WALLACE : I want to ask you about more area during this segment .
Tax and spending , the Republicans are keeping a running total of all of your plans .
They say it ’s $ 662 billion over four years .
And onto the question .
Question , John McCain is going to go after you as another classic liberal tax and spender .
That is a Republican talking point , not a question .
Obama was then given about three minutes ( almost ) uninterrupted to talk about taxes and the economy ( # 1 issue for voters ) before the final commercial break .
Wallace sets the next trap :
9:35 WALLACE : Senator , this week President Bush named David Petraeus , the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq , to be the head of Central Command , which controls overseas military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia .
Will you vote to confirm his nomination ?
If he says no , he hates America ( Go Wallace ! ) .
If he says yes …
9:36 WALLACE : Petraeus , I do n’t have to tell you , is the architect of the troop surge , a strong advocate of our continued engagement in Iraq .
If you become commander - in - chief and he says your plan to get out of Iraq is a mistake , will you replace him ?
But Petraeus wants war forever , and you do n’t .
Gotcha !
One more follow up on Petraeus , where Obama sneaks in one minute about Iraq ( # 3 issue for voters )
That ’s enough substance for now ( a total of 5 minutes ) .
It ’s time for the lightning round !
Lets clear out this campaign business .
Why are you ducking another debate with Hillary Clinton ?
Clinton talking point .
9:38:48 WALLACE :
You say its premature to discuss running mates .
Are you at least open to the possibility of running with Hillary Clinton with places on the ticket to be determined ?
You answered your own unoriginal question right before you asked it .
9:39 WALLACE : If the voting ends in June and you ’re still leading in the popular votes and delegates and the superdelegates hand the nomination to Hillary Clinton , do you think the young people , the African American people , the young first time voters you brought into this campaign , are n’t they going to be awful angry ?
Translation :
Any chance the primary process will tear the Democratic party apart ?
Wallace spends the next 90 seconds trying to determine what it would take for Obama to give up his massive fundraising advantage against John McCain .
Obama raised more in March than McCain did in the first quarter .
Wallace , apparently out of ammo , goes fishing with his final question .
9:41:13 WALLACE : Finally , and we have about a minute left , what have you learned in this campaign ?
And I do n’t mean , gee , what a great country this is answer .
What mistakes have you made ?
Here is the breakdown of the questions , with issue rating determined via Yahoo and AP :
Jeremiah Wright : 8 questions
: 8 questions Race : 6 questions
: 6 questions Reaching Across the Aisle to Republicans : 3 questions
: 3 questions The Economy ( # 1 issue for voters ) : 2 questions
( #1 issue for voters ) : 2 questions Gas Prices ( # 2 issue for voters ) : 0 questions
( # 2 issue for voters ) : 0 questions Health Care ( # 3 issue for voters ) : 0 questions
( #3 issue for voters ) : 0 questions Iraq ( # 4 issue for voters ) : 0 direct questions , 3 through the lens of Petraeus

Bush : Americans should agree that Iraq burden is worth bearing David Edwards and Nick Juliano

The war in Iraq has been more expensive than every other US military conflict except World War II , but President Bush says we have n't spent enough there yet , nor does he think the war is all that costly in relative terms .
The defense budget , Bush stressed in a speech Thursday , is only 4 percent of the total US economy , compared to military spending that approached 13 percent of Gross Domestic Product during the Cold War and was 6 percent of GDP under President Reagan .
" Our citizens recognized that the imperative of stopping Soviet expansion , justified this expense , " Bush said .
Today 's spending , he said , " pales when compared to the cost of another terrorist attack on our people .
We should be able to agree that this is a burden worth bearing . "
In addition to announcing a plan to halt a drawdown of US troops from Iraq this summer and reduce the length of deployment from 15 to 12 months , Bush also called on Congress to approve another $ 108 billion " emergency war funding request " that will continue paying for the conflict in Iraq that is stretching into its sixth year .
Despite the fact that we have been in Iraq for more than half a decade , and that the president has made clear his refusal to extricate US troops from the conflict , Bush continues to fund the conflict through these " emergency " requests , instead of including war funding in his annual Pentagon budget requests .
In a recent article in the libertarian Reason magazine , Veronique de Rugy outlines the ramifications of this " opaque and politicized shell game " that has resulted in a war that will cost well more than $ 1 trillion .
How much money is $ 1 trillion ?
Enough to pay for the entire 1976 federal budget , adjusted for inflation .
Enough to write a check for $ 37,500 to every Iraqi man , woman , and child .
Enough to buy 169,492 Black Hawk helicopters , or 455 stealth bombers .
Enough , in nominal terms , to pay for the entire federal government from 1789 to 1957 .
And its 10 times more than what specialists predict it would take to eradicate malaria once and for all .
The burden in Iraq has been little noticed in the average American 's pocketbook because of its low cost relative to GDP , but it also has been financed mostly by borrowed money , and that bill will eventually come due .
As the Reason article notes , Bush 's method of funding this war is starkly at odds with historical practice .
In 1951 , for instance , 72 percent of the kick - off cost for the Korean War $ 33 billion in todays dollars went through supplemental appropriations , while $ 13 billion came from regular appropriations .
But by year two , Congress appropriated 98 percent of the wars funding through the regular defense budget .
By 1953 the president no longer requested any funding outside of the regular defense budget .
The decade - long Vietnam War followed a similar pattern .
In the first year of the war , Congress provided all of the funding in emergency supplemental bills .
The second year , the administration requested a little less than 50 percent of the war funding within regular defense appropriations .
By the fourth year , all of the war funding went through the regular defense budget process .
This despite the fact that troop levels were in flux , military strategies were changing regularly , and the duration of the conflict could not be foreseen .
In the 1990s , the Republican - led Congress showed a kind of discipline it would completely forget during the Bush presidency , directing President Bill Clinton in fiscal year 1996 to fund all ongoing military operations , including the enforcement of no - fly zones over Iraq , from the regular defense budget rather than supplementals .
From then on , Clinton sought funding for Bosnia and other conflicts entirely through the regular appropriations process .
In the 1980s , throughout President Ronald Reagans military buildup , no Cold War spending was allocated through supplementals ( see Figure 2 ) .
And once you account for the offsetting contributions from American allies during and after the first Gulf War ( $ 35 billion out of the total $ 42 billion price tag ) , it is clear that until recently very little U.S. military spending was treated as an emergency .
What a difference with todays wars .
Five years into the Iraq conflict and seven years into Afghanistan , the administration and Congress have buried all of the explicit funding totaling more than the spending on either the Korea or Vietnam wars when adjusted for inflation in emergency supplementals .
In his speech Thursday , Bush justified the cost of the Iraq war by invoking the usual suspects : al Qaeda and Iran .
Al Qaeda , which was not in Iraq before the US invaded , " would claim a propaganda victory of colossal proportions and ... gain safe haven " if troops left the country .
And Iran " would work to fill the vacuum in Iraq " if the Americans left .

Stones were thrown and buildings burnt in Lhasa
An emergency official said that many people had been hurt and an unspecified number had died .
The US - based Radio Free Asia quoted witnesses who said they had seen at least two bodies on Lhasa 's streets .
Tibet 's government would " deal harshly " with the protesters , its Chairman Qiangba Puncog warned .
" We will deal harshly with these criminals who are carrying out activities to split the nation , " he told the Associated Press news agency , denying that police had opened fire .
China 's state - run Xinhua news agency earlier said police had fired warning shots and used tear gas to disperse protesters .
Rallies have continued all week in what are said to be the largest protests against Beijing 's rule in 20 years .
' Totally crazy '
A Western tourist in the city told the BBC : " [ The rioters ] seemed to go for all the Chinese shops and the Chinese people as well .
I saw quite a few Chinese people beaten up ... it turned totally crazy . "
Another eyewitness said there were tanks on the street and he had seen people being carried away on stretchers .
British journalist James Miles , in Lhasa , told the BBC rioters took control of the city centre on Friday .
He some were looting shops and " taking out the contents and throwing them on huge fires which they 've lit in the street " .
China 's government is braced for any further unrest on Saturday , with reports that a curfew is in place .
TIBET DIVIDE China says Tibet always part of its territory Tibet enjoyed long periods of autonomy before 20th century 1950 : China launched a military assault Opposition to Chinese rule led to bloody uprising in 1959 Tibet 's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama fled to India
In pictures : Tibet protests Quick guide : Tibet Media remains silent
Beijing accused the Dalai Lama 's followers of " masterminding " the unrest , an allegation the Tibetan spiritual leader 's spokesman labelled as " absolutely baseless " .
From exile in India , the Dalai Lama expressed deep concern and called for an end to the violence .
He called on China to " address the long - simmering resentment of the Tibetan people through dialogue " .
The rallies began earlier this week when a number of Buddhist monks were reportedly arrested after a march marking the 49th anniversary of a Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule .
In other developments on Friday :
Hundreds of monks led a rally at Xiahe , in China 's north - western Gansu province , the site of one of Tibetan Buddhism 's most important monasteries
More then 100 Tibetans in New York staged a protest outside the UN headquarters
Police in New Delhi , India , clashed with protesters trying to reach the Chinese Embassy
In Kathmandu , Nepal , police reportedly scuffled with some 1,000 demonstrators at a rally
BBC China editor Shirong Chen in Beijing says the Chinese government certainly does not want bloodshed - echoing that last September in Burma - five months before staging the Olympic Games .
On the other hand , they cannot allow the monks and other Tibetans to vent their anger in case this is seen as a sign of weakness , he says .
' Marginalised '
The US urged China to " respect Tibetan culture " and the American ambassador to China urged officials in Beijing to show restraint .
PROTEST TIMELINE 10 March : Monks arrested while marking 49th anniversary of failed uprising 11 March : Police use tear gas to disperse monks staging peaceful rallies 13 March : Police seal off key Lhasa monasteries 14 March : Rioting in Lhasa
A White House spokesman said : " The president has said consistently Beijing needs to have a dialogue with the Dalai Lama . "
The European Union issued a statement urging China to address the concerns of Tibetans .
" We would like to see some kind of reconciliation between the Chinese authorities and the Tibetan representatives , " said Dimitrij Rupel , foreign minister of Slovenia , which currently holds the EU 's rotating presidency .
Hollywood actor Richard Gere - a supporter of Tibet - told the BBC he would back a boycott of the Beijing Olympics unless China adopted a new approach .
" The Tibetans have been marginalised in recent years , much more than before , and that 's why you see this pressure cooker effect , " he said .

Tibet has always been part of its territory - although Tibet enjoyed long periods of autonomy before the 20th Century and many Tibetans remain loyal to the Dalai Lama , who fled in 1959 .
Are you in Tibet or do you know anyone currently in Tibet ?

Evolution And The Hive Mind
By Rusty Rockets
Chat to any god - botherer about evolution and they 'll tell you that it does n't exist , that there 's no such thing .
They 'll pay lip - service to the scientific elbow - grease that has gone into evolutionary research , but they 'll argue that the end product is only ever a " theory . "
Overlooking the obvious confusion over the term " theory , " what these folks are really saying is that there is no physical evidence for natural selection .
" Where are the transitional fossils , " they point out ; " where are the intermediate creatures ? "
It 's no wonder that so many ( mostly American ) people still doubt evolution ; they just do n't know what it means .
Their eyes start to glaze over when biologists use terms like alleles , macro / microevolution , genetic drift , and speciation .
What the evolutionary naysayers want is some definitive bit of evidence that would prove evolution once and for all - a smoking gun .
Unfortunately , evolutionary timescales do n't easily work in science 's favor ; we can't see a limb turn into a wing overnight .
But thanks to new analysis techniques , we can actually document natural selection in its slow - and - steady progress .
Biologists at Cornell University , who have been studying genetic changes occurring in the human genome over the last 15,000 to 100,000 years , have found that over this relatively short period of time the human genome has changed by a staggering 10 percent .
" We undertook a very careful study of genetic differences within and among major human groups , and aimed to explain why certain parts of the genome differed , " says lead author Scott Williamson , an assistant professor of computational biology .
" We aimed to eliminate as many possible confounding variables as possible , and when all is said and done , we find that as much as 10 percent of the genome may have been affected by one of these bouts of recent selection . "
These changes amount to natural selection at work ; the adaptations needed for survival .
The Cornell study goes a long way in identifying the small , gradual changes ( microevolution ) that demonstrate species divergence from a common ancestor millions of years ago ( macroevolution ) .
It makes many human - to - human comparisons throughout the complete human genome ; rather than comparing a human to mice or chimpanzees .
In this way , it can show how we humans have been changing over time , due to our ancestors being exposed to - among other selective pressures - different climates as they spread across the globe .
One example of the type of change humans have undergone is our tolerance to lactose ; or lack thereof , in the case of our dairy challenged ancestors .
Lactose is an enzyme found in milk , and prior to the domestication of animals humans did not have the capacity to digest milk after infancy .
Some time after humans began migrating and domesticating animals , we developed a gene that allowed us to tolerate consuming milk into adulthood .
" As humans have populated the world , there has been strong selective pressure at the genetic level for fortuitous mutations that allow digestion of a new food source or tolerate infection by a pathogen that the population may not have faced in a previous environment , " explains Williamson .
Now that scientists are readily identifying genomic changes due to selective pressures , what 's next ?
Would it be too far fetched to suggest that social pressures could affect brain function at a genetic level ?
At least one study has identified collective behavioral differences between Western cultures like the United States and China , possibly suggesting the beginning of brain divergence among humans .
The study , from the University of Chicago , makes the claim that people living in the United States have difficulties with accepting another person 's point of view , which they put down to US culture prizing individualism .
They say that in China , where a collectivist attitude is encouraged , quite the opposite is true , with Chinese citizens being much more in tune with how others are thinking .
As a result , the researchers argue that there may be more scope for communication confusion among Western citizens relative to citizens of China .
" Members of these two cultures seem to have a fundamentally different focus in social situations .
Members of collectivist cultures tend to be interdependent and to have self - concepts defined in terms of relationships and social obligations , " says Boaz Keysar , a Professor in Psychology at the University of Chicago .
" In contrast , members of individualist cultures tend to strive for independence and have self - concepts defined in terms of their own aspirations and achievements . "
The team 's conclusions may seem a little wayward - perhaps verging on cultural propaganda - but they are based on a very straightforward group cooperation experiment .
Teams of Americans and Chinese were pitted against each other whilst manipulating objects on a grid , with one person from each team being the " director , " and another acting as the worker , or " subject . "
Time and again it was shown that the Chinese had a clear advantage ; the subject understanding the director 's perspective , or vision , as though it were second nature .
" Despite the obvious simplicity of the task , the majority of American subjects ( 65 percent ) failed to consider the director 's perspective at least once during the experiment , by asking the director which object he or she meant or by moving an object the director could not see , " explained Keysar .
Comparatively , only one of the Chinese appeared to flounder during the course of the experiment .
" Apparently , the interdependence that pervades Chinese culture has its effect on members of the culture over time , taking advantage of the human ability to distinguish between the mind of the self and that of the other , and developing this ability to allow Chinese to unreflectively interpret the actions of another person from his or her perspective , " the study 's authors concluded .
While studies with children have shown that the ability to appreciate another 's point of view is universal , could cultural pressures evidenced by the University of Chicago study actually manifest as selective pressures ?
It was the brain that was to eventually separate us from our chimp cousins , so could yet more divergence emerge from the mysterious grey goop between our ears ?

Boffin Ponders Cultural Manipulation By Cat Parasite
Cat Parasite Aiming For Global Male Domination
When donors met in Paris last month and awarded $ 7.4 billion in aid to the Palestinians , a larger - than - expected package to be distributed over the next three years , many in the international community showed a new readiness to support the new Israeli - Palestinian peace push and provide a safety net for it in the form of economic stability .
Now Palestinian and foreign observers alike are keen to see how and where the money is spent , putting senior officials on the spot with questions of how they intend to avoid the corruption and mismanagement that characterized the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) in the past .
But unlike international relief in the past , this aid package – the biggest since the establishment of PA in 1994 – comes with meticulous oversight mechanisms that make it much more difficult for money to be siphoned off or embezzled , a senior Palestinian official says .
Moreover , various unions representing public employees have gained muscle and stature and are determined to see an appropriate portion of the money go to civil servants , some of whom have gone unpaid for months at a time in the past two years .
Cairo Arafat , the director general of Aid Management and Coordination in the Palestinian Ministry of Planning , says that it 's no longer useful to speak of corruption as a blanket term .
" With any kind of program , you get the normal type of corruption .
But there 's so much competition now and so much talk of corruption that people are more aware of it and more likely to speak out about it than they were before , " says Ms. Arafat , who is not a relative of the late Palestinian leader , Yasser Arafat .
" There have been few programs in Palestine that have not been exposed to internal and external audits .
We had some projects that were being audited three times , audited , and reaudited , " she says , to such an extent that the parties most profiting from the aid were Palestinian auditing firms .
Still , the battle for a fair slice of the pie is on .
Several sectors – including teachers and medical workers – have recently been on strike against low pay and long hours .
Union leaders say hundreds of other workers face being laid off or forced into early retirement , which some here argue would thin out inflated payrolls .
The PA remains the largest employer in the Palestinian territories , with at least 165,000 workers ; some officials say that the PA could probably function with a third of that .
But on the other hand , the Palestinian private sector has been so stymied by political problems – particularly since the election victory of Hamas two years ago this month – that enough private sector jobs do n't exist .
Union leader Bassem Hadaydeh says in this period of crisis since early 2006 , PA officials dipped into and spent worker pensions .
" The PA has already spent the retirement funds of all employees in order to keep itself going , " says Mr. Hadaydeh , the spokesman of the Palestinian civil servants ' union .
" They 're trying to retire large numbers of workers , but have no retirement funds to give them .
How can they talk about that and not have the amount to pay us ?
This will be one of the points of conflict between the union and the government , " he explains .
Meanwhile , the prices of everyday goods and transportation have gone up , specifically in the past few months , due to the drop in the dollar ( on which most Palestinian salaries are based ) and the rise in gasoline prices .
" All our demands are meant to make the performance more satisfactory .
It is all connected to the degree to which the PA does n't have integrity in the eyes of the people , " adds Hadaydeh .
But now , he admits , Palestinians have a new sense that the PA has become more fiscally responsible , particularly since Salam Fayyad , now prime minister , became the Minister of Finance in 2003 .
" The abuse of public money has decreased since Salam Fayyad [ took office ] .
The monitoring of money to the PA has increased drastically , " he says .
" The modalities used in the transfer of money are complicated and transparent and have a technically oriented approach , which makes corruption difficult to come in . "
Samir Barghouthi , an economist who runs a Ramallah investment firm , says that of the amount of aid pledged , approximately 70 percent of the amount will go to public salaries and 30 percent will go to development projects , food relief , and assistance – especially to Gazans .
The biggest problem , he says , is indeed the bloated PA payroll .
" There are many thousands of public sector employees who are not working .
Some are living in Jordan or Egypt , some work from home , some work in the private sector but still take a salary from the government .
There are people who are not even showing up in work because there is n't something to do , " says Mr. Barghouthi .
He suggests the PA needs to push ahead with offering a retirement program , perhaps giving incentives by offering highly subsidized loans for people to start businesses .
" The Paris aid is just a mechanism to help people survive , which means after three years , when those monies are spent , we have to face the problem again , and in another three years , " he says .
" We should use this commitment to push for deep restructuring . "
Nokia 's Mobira Talkman
They 're probably best known for their tires , but lately Finnish industrial conglomerate Nokia 's been making a big push into the wireless biz with its Mobira subsidiary ( best of luck with that , Nokia ! ) .
Mobira just introduced its latest ultraportable cellphone , the Talkman ( positively no relation to the Walkman , so do n't sue , ok , Sony ? ) ; clocking in at a mere 11 pounds , this bad boy will have you walking and talking in no time .
Too heavy ?
Just have a junior exec carry it around for you !
NTT's " Shoulder Phone " lets you step out of the car
Someday we 'll all have phones as portable as the 11 - pound Mobira Talkman .
Until then , NTT is making things a little easier with the " Shoulder Phone , " which includes a transmitter that communicates with your car phone ( you do have a car phone , right ? ) , letting you set up base in a corner cafe around the corner from your parked car , and wow ( or annoy , depending on your perspective ) the other diners as you chat casually on your phone .
Apple ditches the Lisa Macintosh XL
We really do n't know what 's going on at Apple these days .
It was bad enough when they renamed the Lisa " Macintosh XL " ( for what , Extra Large ? Ex - Lisa ? ) back in January and started shipping it with that Macintosh emulation software .
But now they 've officially discontinued it and have shifted most development resources to the Macintosh .
We 'd like to think that this has something to do with Woz 's recent departure , but it kind of seems like he 's been out of the loop for a while to begin with .
We still think this Macintosh thing is an overrated , underpowered poor stepchild to the Lisa , and that Jobs and Sculley will eventually come to their senses and scrap it .
At least they 've stuck with the Apple II line - without the Lisa , it looks like that 's the only real hope for the future of this company .
Windows 1.0 !
You loved PC - DOS ( or maybe you did n't ) , you live with MS - DOS , but it 's too early to sit around and for Micro - soft 's IBM parnership on OS / 2 to yield fruit .
So after years of delays in finishing this damned thing , we 've finally got their big new program , Windows 1.0 !
It actually lets you run more than one DOS application at a time , and even has a shell they call MS - DOS Executive , and a terminal , cardfile , and calculator program .
We do n't really know how they think they can take on the Macintosh user interface , though , so do n't be surprised if the little Arizona startup that could , well , can't .
By the way , have you guys seen that freaking commercial on TV ?
The Amiga 1000
Originally designed to be a killer game machine , the Amiga 1000 ended up being so righteous that it has morphed into a full - fledged computing machine in its own right .
This baby totally owns with a 32 - bit pre-emptive multi-tasking GUI , 4 - channel stereo sound , 880 k 3.5 - inch floppy disks , and video modes up to 4096 colors - at once !
That means animators and graphic artists are going to totally eat this system up - who knows , maybe the next episode of Voltron will be made on one of these .

The good people at Fotomat are n't gonna dig this , but if you 're tired of running down to the shop to get your photos developed you should check out this new " still video camera " that Fuji developed .
The ES - 1 can snap 640 x 480 pixel pics with its 2/3 - inch digital sensor and then save the images to 3.5 - inch floppy disks ( if only those things did n't cost so damn much , anyone have a hook up on cheap floppies ? ) in a new file format called JPEG , or Joint Photographers Experts Group , that was created last year .
Jim Leftwich 's Flatpanel Computer
One day in the future we 'll all work at 200MHz tower desktops with 9600 baud modems , but until then we 'll just have to keep dreaming .
So while we 're just making crap up , how 's about the Flatpanel Computer mockup , by crackpot " unconventional " designer Jim Leftwich .
One little doozy of a pipe dream the computer actually has a flat screen .
Whatever , Jim , it 'll happen one day , we so believe you .
Commodore 128
The Commodore 128 is an upgrade to the much - loved Commodore 64 , featuring a whopping 128KB RAM ( expandable to 640K ) with an 80 - column RGB monitor output .
It features a two CPU design in which the primary 8502 CPU speeds along at a 2 MHz clock rate .
The second CPU is the Zilog Z80 , allowing the unit to run CP / M -- albeit more slowly than most dedicated CP / M systems .
Still and all , this baby may just end up winning a place in the hearts and homes of many a hobbyist programmer , especially with those rugged good looks .
Nintendo's Famicom comes to the US as NES
We 've been telling it to you for years ( they just would n't listen ) , but at CES Japanese upstart Nintendo 's finally announced they 're importing their Nintendo Family Computer ( Famicom , as they call it over in Japan ) to the US .
They even gave their box a slick redesign !
The new Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) is n't top - loading anymore , but features a totally crazy spring - loaded insertion mechanism ( you 'll have to try it to believe it ) and even non hardwired controllers .
Unfortunately they made it so you can't play those bootleg games on the NES anymore , but this hot 8 - bit piece of machinery might just compete against the Amiga and Commodore ... if it 's lucky .
The Texas Instruments TI4100
Damn , dude , GPS ( that stands for global position system ) receivers are shrinking like crazy .
We thought things were getting out of hand when we saw those $ 140,000 four - channel receivers that only weigh 80 pounds and need two car batteries to run , but the Texas Instruments TI4100 gets away with reducing that size by halving the channels , yet it still plots longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates ... simultaneously , no less .
Welcome to the future , friends .
The Texas Instruments TI - 74
The Texas Instruments TI - 74 programmable calculator replaces the CC40 and adds mass storage in the form of an optional cassette interface .
It 's a workhorse as a scientific calculator and as a portable BASIC programming environment at a size of about 4 x 8 - inches .
Its 4 AAA batteries can power its 31 character LCD well into the double digits of " on " time , which means plenty of juice for those long into the night calculation parties ( we know you 're out there ) .
Plenty of horsepower here at 8 K RAM and 32 4 K ROM , so do n't be shy -- get calculatin ' !
NHK 's Hi-Vision kicks it into high gear
So NHK has been working for years on this new technology called Hi-Vision , another name for MUSE ( multiple sub - nyquist sampling encoding ) , which is basically a way of making your TV picture look a lot sharper ( let 's call it " sharp definition TV , " or SDTV for short ) .
Current sets have a 4:3 aspect ratio and as many as 480 lines , where these new Japanese " SDTVs " will be 5:3 ultra widescreen , and have 1125 lines ( they could even one day look as good as the picture above , taken of a Hi-Vision test unit ) .
Really , is there anything the Japanese can't do ?
Mitsubishi's 35 - inch direct view color TV
Sure , you could sacrifice picture quality and pick up one of those newfangled projection TVs that are popping up , but you 're probably above that , right ?
Right , which is why we 're all over Mitsubishi 's latest salvo , which includes a 35 - inch color TV that ranks as the world 's largest direct view screen .
You so can't even mess with this .
The Tandy 600
The Tandy 600 sports a flip - up 80x16 LCD , built - in 300 baud modem , parallel port , reset button , display control , floppy disk expansion port and an RS - 232 serial port .
Its onboard 32 K RAM 160K ROM is maybe a bit cramped , but you can add up to two additional 96 K RAM modules for plenty of leg room to stretch out .
Its internal nickel - cadmium battery pack takes 14 hours to charge , but gets you between 6 and 11 hours of computing time on a single run .
It 's pretty light to at only 9.5 pounds ( 11 with the AC adapter ) , but maybe a little ungainly ( 13 x 12 x 2.75 - inches ) .
At least it 's not too unreasonably priced at $ 1599 to $ 2528.85 depending on configuration .
It 's not like we can predict the future or anything , but this is where we 're going , people .
Kaypro 2000 lap - top marks new era of affordable portability
We really like portable computers ; we 've broken our backs with Osbornes , Compaqs and others without complaint , glad that we can work on the road .
But we 're really impressed with the recent lap - tops from companies like Toshiba , and the Kaypro 2000 looks like it 's destined to be a major step forward .
Weighing in at just 13 pounds ( our trusty Compaq weighs 28 pounds ) - including its tiny 3 1/2 - inch floppy drive - the IBM PC - compatible computer has a solid 256 K of RAM ( expandable to a massive 768K ) , a sharp 80x25 liquid - crystal - display screen and options that include an adaptor to add a second floppy drive and a " base unit " that has slots for floppy drives , expansion cards or hard - disk drives .
While the lack of a standard 5.25 - inch floppy drive is a frustrating oversight , you can pony up the $ 295 for the option and use it to load WordPerfect and VisiCalc , since we 're not huge fans of the bundled software , WordStar and CalcStar .
Kaypro's added some nice touches though , including a detachable keyboard and a battery that can run for up to four hours after charging for a day .
At just $ 1,995 , the Kaypro 2000 looks like a computer that will keep the Kaypro name alive well beyond the year 2000 .
Apple LaserWriter
The Apple LaserWriter breaks ground by bringing cheap quality printing to the consumer for the first time .
It 's hard to imagine true laser printing could ever come in as low - cost as $ 6,995 , but the LaserWriter delivers near - typeset quality prints to small businesses and offices .
It uses the AppleTalk networking protocol to make the printer available across the network , so listen up , worker drones - your printouts are n't going to your trusty desktop dot matrix anymore .
Just do n't slip up and print out that letter from your new " special friend , " because the rest of your office knows you 're married , dig ?
The first CD - ROM : Grolier Encyclopedia available on compact - disc
As much as we love new gadgets , we have n't exactly rushed out to buy compact - discs ( though we did pick up a player last year ) .
After all , the music we want comes out first on records , so why wait longer and pay more for a CD - other than the fact that the record industry says they 're scratch - proof and will last forever ?
However , now that compact - discs for computers have arrived , we may just change our tune .
The first compact - disc read - only - memory ( CD - ROM ) disc to hit the market is the Grolier Electronic Encyclopedia .
Yeah , we 'd much rather have Britannica , too .
But the fact that all 9 million words in the encyclopedia fit on one disk with room to spare , may just make this thing worth buying .
And we really can't wait for other software to start showing up on these things , so we can finally stop having to swap floppies a hundred times when we install new programs .
The only downside of these new disks seems to be that they 're not recordable .
Imagine that : storing over 500 MB of space on a single disk .
We 're not quite sure how we 'd actually fill all that space , but we 'd still take it over a box of floppies in a heartbeat .
GammaFax lets you send and receive faxes without the slime
We still get a kick out of fax machines , especially since we upgraded from our old drum - based acoustic - coupler model to a standalone unit .
But we still can't stand that slimy paper that always seems to curl up and discolor before we 've even finished reading the message we 've received .
But now that GammaLink has put out the GammaFax card for IBM - compatible PCs , it looks like the fax machine 's days are numbered .
We can't wait to try this out and start sending and receiving faxes using our computer .
Of course , we dread configuring this thing ; somehow , we 're sure we 'll be up for two nights just getting all the IRQ settings right .
But it 'll be worth it , if we can actually send a fax straight from WordPerfect .
CES this year was a blast ( too bad they would n't let us in to any of the casinos ) , but we 've been laying low because of midterms .
Next year is really gonna suck , though , CATs !
Anyway , we have a new tape out , so send in for it , will you ?
Get the tapecast
We 'll trade for a copy of your tapecast .
Or send us $ 1 ( or a blank cassette ) with a SASE with your name and address , and we 'll shoot it to ya first class hand - delivered by a uniformed Federal employee .

Panasonic 's SG - J500 lets you take your records on the road
We 've wanted a boombox with a turntable ever since we caught sight of the gold - tone Marantz PMS 6000 a couple of years ago .
But it looks like we 'll just have to settle for Panasonic 's SG - J500 .
Powered by 4 D's ( are n't they all ? ) , this is the rock box for us - after all , if we 're going to blast the latest from Run - DMC , do we really want to have to copy it to a cassette first ?
We just worry a little about skipping when we hoist this baby onto our shoulders .
Then again , some scratching may just give us a whole new jam .
Sony Discman D -50 MK2
Hold on a second , you 're still walking around with a Walkman ?
Dude , that 's so over , Sony 's just introduced a new version the D - 50 , the first Discman which they introduced late last year .
That 's right , Discman , as in compact - discs , as in perfect sound forever in your pocket ( just make sure you do n't bop too hard or you 'll make the player skip ) .
Taking that first step into the future should only set you back about ¥ 49,800 .
The RB5X
Is it really so hard for someone to build a robot that can grab us a friggin ' RC Cola out of the fridge while we 're MUDing ?
Apparently not , since General Robotics just busted out the RB5X , a programmable household bot which comes complete with a robotic arm ( for grabbing said RC Cola ) , a speech synthesizer ( finally , someone to chat with ! ) , and a whopping 18 K expansion RAM module .
Petster
Petster is a remote - controlled and sound - operated feline so powerful it takes six D batteries to operate .
When turned on , its green LED eyes glow with a haunting charisma unmatched by any actual pet you could acquire .
Your robotic friend can be controlled by specific clap formations that prompt Petster to do unusual tricks , and when left alone she 'll eventually fall asleep and start to purr .
Petster is a bit on the pricy side - we ain't gonna lie .
But really , as compared to the cost and hassle of actual live - blooded pets , we think our choice is clear .
We 've ordered a fleet of feline robotic overlords to keep us company here at Engadget HQ .
Gibson Light Pen System
Did you ever have dreams where you could just draw on your home computer screen like you can with your Atari or Commodore ?
Not with a pen or anything - you know what we mean , like , with a device - and it would act like a mouse or the like .
Well step back , because for a mere $ 100 you can get the same kind of Koala Light Pen device you know and love , but by Gibson , and now it works on your Apple IIe .
We are so doing all our art on our Apple machines from now on .
Seiko Datagraph UC - 2001
Listen slackers , pull yourself together with the Seiko Datagraph UC - 2001 .
It syncs up with your Apple II via the Time Trax II scheduling software , so your appointments are available as plain scrollable text , right there on your wrist !
It 's chock full of 2 K worth of memory , which should be plenty overkill for storing the social life of any geek for the next several decades .
But that 's not all - oh no !
Beyond scheduling , you can also store notes on the Datagraph via the Memo Pad function .
And as long as the contents of your brain do n't total more than 2 K , you 're totally good to go .
FCC releases ISM bands
The Federal Communications Commission has opened up the so - called Industrial , Scientific and Medical bands for use by low - power transmitters .
We 're not really sure what kind of devices can make use of these frequencies , though we 're sort of hoping someone can come up with a cordless phone that works better than the one we 've got .
If you 've ever used one of these , you know what we mean ; at 27 MHz , the thing is nearly useless , and we 're tired of having every cab driver in New York interrupt our calls .
Kevin Rudd has flown in to a diplomatic row in China , with the country 's communist Government lodging an official complaint about his comments on Tibet .
China is angry over Mr Rudd 's comments during a press conference with US President George W Bush earlier in his world tour , when he said it was clear that human rights abuses were being committed in Tibet .
He encouraged the Chinese Government to discuss the future of Tibet with the Dalai Lama , and promised to raise the matter in Beijing .
The Chinese Government has responded by making a verbal complaint to Australian diplomats in Canberra and in Beijing , where Mr Rudd arrived today on the final leg of his world tour .
A spokesman from the Department of Foreign Affairs says the Australian Government holds strong views on Tibet and stands by its comments .
Mr Rudd is due to meet Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao tommorrow .
The Australia - Tibet Council says it wants Mr Rudd to use his visit to China to push for the cancellation of the Olympic torch relay through Tibet .
The council 's executive officer , Paul Bourke , says taking the torch through Tibetan areas would be highly provocative and could result in further violence .
" They 're preparing with massive influx of police , clearing a path through Tibet , " he said .
" The only way the torch can proceed through Tibet is under virtual martial law , or it will result in uprisings which will further endanger the Tibetans in Tibetan areas . "

Congressman Barney Frank introduced legislation to federally decriminalize marijuana .
The bill , HR5843 , is co-sponsored by Rep. Ron Paul .
According to Congressman Frank 's office ( " FRANK INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO REMOVE FEDERAL PENALTIES ON PERSONAL MARIJUANA USE , " April 17 , 2008 ) , " Congressman Barney Frank today introduced bi-partisan legislation aimed at removing federal restrictions on the individual use of marijuana ( HR 5843 ) .
One bill would remove federal penalties for the personal use of marijuana , and the other ( HR 5842 ) – versions of which Frank has filed in several preceding sessions of Congress – would allow the medical use of marijuana in states that have chosen to make its use for medical purposes legal with a doctor ’s recommendation .
Representative Ron Paul ( R - TX ) joined Frank as a cosponsor of the federal penalties bill .
The cosponsors of the medical marijuana bill are Rep. Paul , along with Reps. Maurice Hinchey ( D - NY ) , Dana Rohrabacher ( R - CA ) , and Sam Farr ( D - CA ) . "
The Congressman is quoted as saying : " To those who say that the government should not be encouraging the smoking of marijuana , my response is that I completely agree .
But it is a great mistake to divide all human activity into two categories : those that are criminally prohibited , and those that are encouraged .
In a free society , there must be a very considerable zone of activity between those two poles in which people are allowed to make their own choices as long as they are not impinging on the rights , freedom , or property of others .
I believe it is important with regard to tobacco , marijuana and alcohol , among other things , that we strictly regulate the age at which people may use these substances .
And , enforcement of age restrictions should be firm .
But , criminalizing choices that adults make because we think they are unwise ones , when the choices involved have no negative effect on the rights of others , is not appropriate in a free society .
If the laws I am proposing pass , states will still be free to treat marijuana as they wish .
But I do not believe that the federal government should treat adults who choose to smoke marijuana as criminals . "
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- President Bush addressed Americans ' anxiety about the effects that the U.S. economic downturn has taken on their wallets Tuesday , calling on Congress to pass legislation that will help reduce energy and food costs , keep people in their homes , and make student loans more available .
Speaking at a White House Rose Garden news conference , Bush said Congress has not passed legislation that he proposed to help ease the effects of the economic slump .
" I 've repeatedly submitted proposals to help address these problems , yet time after time Congress chose to block them , " said Bush .
Bush said Congress failed to pass bills that expand safe oil exploration and build new refineries that would help to reduce energy prices .
The president said his proposal to expand oil production at home would result in about a 20 % increase of crude oil production and it would likely mean lower gas prices .
He added that the farm bill that Congress is considering is " bloated , " and would do little to reduce the cost of food .
" The bill Congress is now considering would fail to eliminate subsidy payments to multimillionaire farmers , " said Bush .
" America 's farm economy is thriving ... and this is the right time to reform our nation 's farm policies . "
The president also called out Congress for failing to pass his proposed legislation to help modernize the home loan industry through Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) and Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) reforms , and by allowing state housing agencies to issue tax - free bonds to refinance subprime loans .
Lastly , the president said lawmakers need to pass a bill that would temporarily give the federal government greater authority to buy federal student loans .
" This authority will safeguard student loans without permanently expanding the government 's role in their financing , " Bush said .
Bush said Americans are looking for politicians to come together to work on these issues in a bipartisan manner .
" I do n't think it 's just too much to ask even in an election year , " he added .
Democrats shift blame to President : But Democratic leaders said the blame instead lies with the president .
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , said in a press conference the president is out of touch with the pains that Americans feel from the economic downturn .
" The president does n't understand the struggles of American families , " said Schumer .
" Everyone is having a tough time to make ends meet . "
Schumer also said that Bush has failed to address the most important factors that continue to drag down the economy .
" The president has lost control of the economy , " said Schumer .
" " He has ignored repeated shots across the bow : Record oil prices , the housing crisis ... none of these things are being addressed . "
Schumer also scoffed at the president 's claim that Congress supports legislation that would make energy even more expensive , saying the president continues to support the tax breaks on big oil companies .
" This administration has no energy policy , " added Schumer .
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif , called on the President to drop his veto threat from House legislation that would give tax credits for renewable energy .
" [ The bill would ] save 116,000 green jobs and create hundreds of thousands more , " Pelosi said in a statement .
Bush says economy not in a recession :
Though the president maintained that the economy is not in a recession , he said that does not affect the pain some Americans are feeling from the recent downturn .
" Words that define the economy do n't reflect the anxiety that Americans feel , " said Bush .

It was the mother of all non-events .
On a day when the Olympic flame was on Indian soil , the key task was to celebrate the human spirit behind the Games .
But , the human element was missing , thanks to the devil called fear .
Fear of an attack on the Olympic flame by angry Tibetan refugees loomed large on Chinese minds .
So the Indian government stage - managed the event in such a manner that the common man could neither see the torch nor cheer the torchbearers , which included the likes of athlete P T Usha , tennis ace Leander Paes and actor Saif Ali Khan .
Coverage : Tibet Revolts
Senseless security measures ensured that the event was devoid of laughter and cheer .
The 300 - odd crowd at India Gate was all carefully selected by Coca - Cola , Lenovo , Samsung and the Indian Olympic Association .
The people who were sponsored to join in were not even smiling broadly .
They felt awkward in the vast stretch of land around them where media - persons were exchanging stares with cops .
Commander G Nandy Singh , winner of two Olympic gold medals ( 1948 and 1952 ) and the Dhyan Chand award , told rediff.com after the torch relay : " Everything was quite strange .
We were running and securitymen were watching us .
There was nobody else to watch us due to a three - rung security arrangement .
It was not a good function where the general public was cut - off . "
Deep fear in the minds of the Chinese establishment took Indian security to a ridiculous level .
India pledged to Beijing that it would provide the best possible security to the Olympic flame , which had come under attack from pro-Tibetan activists in London , Paris and San Francisco .
Thus India tried to be ' holier - than - thou ' .
It tried to stop unarmed Tibetans , who have no terrorism record , with a massive show of police power .
A senior Malayali scribe , who subscribes to Left ideology and is highly sympathetic to China , wondered why the Indian government agreed to arrange such a function in the first place .
Obviously , the Tibetans were upset by democratic India 's muscle power .
Tenzin Tsundue , Tibetan poet and activist , told rediff.com : " We did n't do anything to the torch , but the torch has left with more dirt on it .
The event proves that China is capable of using anybody and everybody .
At the end of the day we know China can be as brutal as those in other countries . "
While echoing Tibetans ' feelings , he said : " Thursday 's security arrangement around the venue indicates China 's desire to control the people 's expectations for freedom .
If you put India and China together you are talking about more than two billion people .
Tibetans in India are just 1.20 lakh .
We can only make protests . "
Naturally , the show of excessive security in New Delhi needs to be condemned .
" We lost an opportunity to showcase the balance , " said Kiran Bedi , who returned the invitation to join the torch relay when she came to know about the enhanced security arrangements .
Thursday 's relay justified her stance , she feels .
She said , " Yes , we made it .
Yes , in India , Tibetans or their sympathisers could not touch the torch .
But , we have done it at a heavy cost .
Each one of us paid a price . "
She says , " Indian police officers are well - trained in handling crowds .
They face much bigger numbers than any Western police officers .
Instead of such a show , we should have allowed children , sports lovers and other public to join in .
Democracy is all about balancing .
India lost the opportunity to show to the world that it allowed Tibetans to express their anger and at the same time allowed the spread of the Olympic spirit among its people .
We have lost . "
When asked about the message India gave by providing a quiet and safe passage -- with help of excessive security measures -- to the Olympic flame , former ambassador M K Bhadrakumar said , " The government acted appropriately in providing fool - proof security for the Olympic torch -- in consonance with India 's responsibility as a member of the international Olympic movement and keeping in view our obligations as a friendly neighbour of China .
Security measures are never ' excessive ' when threat perceptions are real , which seems to be the case here . "
Former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal disagreed with him .
Sibal said , " On one hand , we have to bear in mind that the government of India had certain difficulties in carrying out the commitment to provide safety around the torch .
At the same time , we can't go beyond our limits because we are a democratic country and cannot suppress the Tibetans ' political right of expression .
" India is not positioned in the same way on the issue of Tibet as other countries .
China has a claim on Indian territory .
On the issue of Tibet , China and India have a clash because Tibetans are in India and protesting against the control of Tibet .
India can't deny giving legitimate room as much as possible to vent the Tibetans ' anger . "
Talking about security , Sibal said India should not have positioned itself in such a way that it looked as if it was done under Chinese pressure .
The former foreign secretary was also upset with the sportsmen who ran with the torch .
He argues , " I would have wished that the torchbearers in India had made a point to the Chinese on behalf of India .
They should have told the Chinese that Tibetans are an aggrieved people .
By giving a quiet and safe passage , the larger Indian interest was not served . "
However , Sibal 's arguments are debatable .
Bhadrakumar disagreed , saying : " There is no need to front - load an already complex relationship .
Besides , theatrics cannot substitute for diplomacy .
Again , the West would not orchestrate this campaign beyond a point .
Why should we want to be used as a doormat ?
" The temptation to score a transient point on a sunny Thursday afternoon on a Delhi street may seem irresistible , but our interests are best served by working consistently to improve relations with China for what is obviously a long haul .
Like in our relationship with Pakistan , it is only in a climate of mutual trust and confidence that intractable differences can be addressed .
I can't see any short cuts here , " he added .
The fundamental issue to note is that the Indian government 's stand reflects the consistency .
There is no basic change in India 's Tibet policy .
The government has taken a clear stand of not upsetting China in its weaker moment .
There is no doubt that the Tibetans ' protests is all about timing .
China feels embarrassed every time there is a protest against the torch .
The Tibetans ' agenda is being served with their non-violent protests , which it seems will continue for some time .
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has not changed India 's ongoing policy of India over the issue of Tibet .
Since the last five decades , India has not changed its basic stand , said a highly senior officer in the ministry of external affairs .
In an informal conversation last week , the MEA official said : " Over and over and over again India has said that Tibet is an autonomous region of China .
India 's policy of 1959 , 1962 and of subsequent years has not changed .
The rest is just matter of details . "
Dr Singh termed the Dalai Lama as the greatest living Gandhian just when Beijing accused him of plotting riots in Tibet .
At the same time , his government , behaving responsibly , assured China that it will give safe passage to the Olympic torch .
" It is India 's responsibility , " assured Indian officials to the Chinese government .
And India showed off clumsily that it can maintain law and order .
As was visible , it did provide security in excess .
India is sending the message , notwithstanding the overkill by security , that India 's position is unique on the issue of Tibet .
It has done more for Tibetans than any other country .
Democratic India will not ban anti-China demonstrations , but neither is it likely to change its official position on Tibet in the near future nor its support to the ' one - China policy ' .
At the end of the day , one sees with awe a remarkable political achievement by the Tibetans -- the two great emerging powers were stopping them in their march towards the Olympic torch .
It was a psychological victory for the Tibetans that they could scare the Chinese even if for a moment .
The Olympic torch relay is being debated more for the show of strength than the spirit it represents .
With regard to the complex issue of Tibet , Sino - India civilisational links run so deep that when the timeline and today 's realities are given a closer look , such victories seem an illusion .

A boyish , inquisitive face with an innocent look peered out from the Washington Post ’s lead story yesterday on torture .
It was well groomed , pink - shirted John Kiriakou , a CIA interrogator who could just as easily pass for the local youth minister
The report by the Post ’s Joby Warrick and Dan Eggen , which describes Kiriakou ’s experience in interrogating suspected terrorists , raises in an unusually direct way an abiding question : Should the United States of America be using forms of torture dating back to the Spanish Inquisition ?
Nowhere is the mood of that infamous period better portrayed than in the famous Grand Inquisitor chapter of Dostoyevsky ’s Brothers Karamazov .
Dostoevsky was unusually gifted at plumbing the human heart .
While it has been 127 years since he wrote Brothers Karamazov , he nonetheless captures the trap into which so many Americans have fallen in forfeiting freedom through fear .
His portrayal of Inquisition reality brings us to the brink of the moral precipice on which our country teeters today .
It is as though he knew what would be in store for us as fear was artificially stoked after the attacks of 9/11 .
In the story , Dostoevsky ’s Grand Inquisitor ( the Cardinal of Seville ) ridicules Christ for imposing on humans the heavy burden of freedom of conscience , and explains how it is far better , for all concerned , to dull that conscience and to rule by deceit , violence , and fear :
“ Didst thou forget that man prefers peace , and even death , to freedom of choice in the knowledge of good and evil ?... We teach them that it ’s not the free judgment of their hearts , but mystery which they must follow blindly , even against their conscience ....
In the end they will lay their freedom at our feet [ and ] become obedient ... We shall tell them that we are Thy servants and rule them in Thy name .... we shall be forced to lie ....
We shall tell them that every sin will be expiated if it is done with our permission . ”
The Grand Inquisitor , in Brothers Karamazov
Kiriakou was one of the first interrogators to interview suspected terrorist Abu Zubayda in a Pakistani military hospital , where Zubayda was recovering from wounds suffered during his capture in early 2002 .
When he refused to provide information about al - Qaeda ’s infrastructure , he was flown to a secret CIA prison where , according to Kiriakou , the interrogation team strapped Abu Zubayda to a board , wrapped his nose and mouth in cellophane , and forced water into his throat .
In just 35 seconds , viola !
Abu Zubayda starting talking .
That is called waterboarding .
The 15 & 16 Century Spanish inquisitors were not squeamish , and had little need for circumlocutions or euphemisms like “ alternative set of procedures ” that are part of President George W. Bush ’s lexicon .
The Spanish called this procedure , quite plainly , “ tortura del agua . ”
Lacking cellophane , they inserted a cloth into the victim ’s mouth , forcing the victim to ingest water spilled from a jar starting the drowning process .
Four centuries later , the Gestapo put out several technically improved releases of this operating system of torture , so to speak .
Abu Zubayda : Poster Child
The information from John Kiriakou confirms what has long been a no - brainer but not definitively established before ; namely , that President George W. Bush ’s “ alternative set of procedures ” for interrogation by C.I.A. includes waterboarding .
Zubayda was given pride of place in George W. Bush ’s remarkable speech of Sept. 6 , 2006 , in which he bragged about the effectiveness of such procedures and appealed successfully for passage of the Military Commissions Act .
That law allows a president to define what set of interrogation procedures can be used by the C.I.A .
This is Bush on Sept. 6 , 2006 :
We believe that Zubayda was a senior terrorist leader and a trusted associate of Osama bin Laden ...[ and that ] he had run a terrorist camp in Afghanistan where some of the 9/11 hijackers trained ... We knew that Zubayda had more information that could save innocent lives , but he stopped talking ... And so the CIA used an alternative set of procedures ... The Department of Justice reviewed the authorized methods extensively and determined them to be lawful ....
But I can say the procedures were tough , and they were safe , and lawful , and necessary .
Zubayda was questioned using these procedures , and soon he began to provide information on key al - Qaeda operatives , including information that helped us find and capture more of those responsible for the attacks on September the 11th .
For example , Zubayda identified one of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ’s accomplices in the 9/11 attacks -- a terrorist named Ramzi bin al Shibh .
The information Zubayda provided helped lead to the capture of bin al Shibh .
And together these two terrorists provided information that helped in the planning and execution of the operation that captured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
Bush claimed that his interrogation program had saved lives , and Kiriakou says the use of waterboarding “ probably saved lives . ”
We cannot know for sure if this is true .
Off - the - record interviews with intelligence officials strongly suggest that there is much prevarication and exaggeration in president ’s claims about lives saved and operations disrupted , and that the his assertions merit no more credulity than other claims — for example , that Iran ’s nuclear weapons program poses a threat to the U.S. , even though it has been stopped for four years .
Other U.S. intelligence officials take issue with the C.I.A. ’s version of the questioning of Zubayda .
Some say that initially he was cooperating with F.B.I. interrogators using a nonconfrontational approach , when C.I.A. assumed control and opted for more aggressive tactics .
After that experience , the F.B.I. reportedly warned its agents to avoid interrogation sessions at which harsh methods were used .
As for credibility , never has a U.S. president ’s word been so cheapened as it is today .
In late July 2007 , we Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity joined with Justin Frank , MD , psychiatrist , professor at George Washington University Hospital , and author of “ Bush on the Couch , ” to search for insight on how President Bush thinks .
See “ Dangers of a Cornered Bush , ” http://www.consortiumnews.com/Print/2007/072707a.html , from which we excerpt the following :
His pathology is a patchwork of false beliefs and incomplete information woven into what he asserts is the whole truth ... He lies — not just to us , but to himself as well ... What makes lying so easy for Bush is his contempt — for language , for law , and for anybody who dares question him ....
So his words mean nothing .
That is very important for people to understand .

HUBBLE TRIVIA 2008
In its 18 years of viewing the heavens , NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope has made more than 840,000 observations and snapped more than 540,000 images of 27,000 celestial objects .
Hubble does not travel to stars , planets , and galaxies .
It takes pictures of them as it whirls around Earth at 17,500 miles an hour .
In its 18 - year lifetime , the telescope has made 100,000 trips around our planet .
With those trips , Hubble has racked up plenty of frequent - flier miles , about 2.5 billion , which is the equivalent of a round trip to Saturn .
The 18 years ' worth of observations has produced about 32 terabytes of data , equaling the content of about 9,600 digital feature - length films .
Each month the orbiting observatory generates more than 70 gigabytes of data , enough information to fill 70 complete sets of encyclopedias .
The Hubble archive sends about 2 terabytes of data each month to astronomers throughout the world .
Astronomers using Hubble data have published more than 7,500 scientific papers , making it one of the most productive scientific instruments ever built .
In 2007 scientists published more than 700 journal articles on Hubble telescope data .
HUBBLE AND THE GOALS SURVEY
The Great Observatory All - sky LIRG Survey ( GOALS ) combines imaging and spectroscopic data from NASA 's Hubble , Spitzer , Chandra , and GALEX space observatories in a comprehensive study of over 200 of the most luminous infrared - selected galaxies in the local universe .
The sample consists of approximately 180 Luminous Infrared Galaxies ( LIRGs ) , as well as over 20 Ultra - Luminous Infrared Galaxies ( ULIRGs ) .
The LIRGs and ULIRGs targeted in GOALS span the full range of nuclear spectral types and interaction stages .
They provide an unbiased picture of the processes responsible for enhanced infrared emission in the local universe .
Hubble 's role in the project is to use its high optical resolution to study star formation and active galactic nuclei ( AGN ) processes and the possible connection between these two phenomena .
In addition , the detailed structural properties of the underlying galaxy , which may provide clues to the observed energetics , are also part of the Hubble Space Telescope portion of GOALS .
Star formation in the centers of luminous infrared galaxies seen in visible light
One of the primary science drivers for the Hubble part of the Great Observatory All - sky LIRG Survey ( GOALS ) is to make use of the high resolution possible with Hubble and the wide field - of - view of Hubble 's Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS ) to study star formation at visual wavelengths in a large and statistically complete sample of luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies .
These galaxies are primarily mergers and interactions of gas - rich spiral galaxies like the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy , and as the galaxies interact , the large reservoir of gas in their disks is compressed into stars .
Some fraction of the gas also feeds giant black holes ( i.e. , with masses a million to a billion times the mass of our Sun ) in the centers of the merging galaxies , sometimes making their nuclei outshine all of the stars in the merging galaxies .
The color and location of the star formation within each galaxy , and the small - scale structures associated with the regions of star formation , provide clues as to when and how the star formation began .
Further , because the GOALS sample covers the full evolutionary range of merging galaxies , from the first encounter of the progenitor galaxies to the final coalescence , star formation in the visible can be studied as a function of evolutionary stage .
There was a worry that a study of star formation in visible light in these luminous infrared galaxies would not be very fruitful — why use a visible - light telescope to study an infrared - selected sample of galaxies ?
Indeed , these galaxies become " infrared " luminous by producing new stars and feeding their giant black holes in dust - enshrouded regions of the galaxy , i.e. , regions opaque to visible light .
This dust is then heated by the stars and black holes to temperatures of approximately - 400 to - 346 degrees Fahrenheit ( - 240 to - 210 degrees Celsius ) — at such temperatures , the dust radiates strongly in the infrared .
As it turns out , this portion of the survey has been a major success - the Hubble data have revealed evidence of star formation in most of the infrared galaxies , and not only in the extended disks and tails , but also in the central regions of the galaxies where one would expect the star formation to be completely enshrouded by dust ( based on the Spitzer Space Telescope imaging survey ) .
These star clusters in the central regions that are bright in visible light are essentially tracers of the more embedded star formation that accounts for the bulk of the energy generated in these galaxies .
The detection of visible - light signatures of star formation means that standard visible - light techniques used to study star formation in nearby normal galaxies can be applied to the study of these galaxies .
Ultraviolet data is currently being collected to establish the age of the clusters properly .
Hubble and the wide - field of view of the ACS are indispensable tools for this kind of project as they have the high resolution necessary to establish the existence of super star clusters in very active star - forming regions .
These compact clusters are rich in young stars and resemble theoretical models for early precursors of globular clusters .
Although these clusters can be resolved in the infrared , it is the visible - light studies with Hubble that allow scientists to make inferences about the stellar populations .
This is an important result with implications for theories of galaxy evolution that aim to explain how the galaxies we know today formed .
Bright infrared radiation from " minor mergers "
The Hubble images can also be used to examine other paths to the generation of bright infrared radiation .
The standard picture is that interactions and mergers of gas - rich spiral galaxies ( we can call these " major mergers " ) are the trigger for the emergence of high infrared brightness .
However , in about ten percent of the sample there is no clear evidence that a major merger is the cause of the observed activity .
The galaxies in this ten percent are observed to be face - on or edge - on spiral galaxies - in about half of these infrared galaxies , the high - resolution Hubble images reveal no structural features that would distinguish them from normal spiral galaxies observed locally .
Half of them are accompanied by small companion galaxies , suggesting that an interaction between disk galaxies and much less massive galaxies ( " minor mergers " ) may also be sufficient to push a galaxy to produce copious amounts of infrared radiation , possibly by channelling gas into the central supermassive black hole of the larger galaxy and fuelling the burst of high activity revealed in the infrared .
Summary
As a visible - light telescope Hubble has filled the gap between Spitzer imaging in the infrared and GALEX ultraviolet images .
But Hubble has been much more than a stopgap : the superb sensitivity , resolution and field of view of the ACS Wide Field Camera have revealed the detailed structure of galaxies captured at all stages of the interaction process and have been an essential part of the success of the GOALS project in the study of the link between star formation , ultra- luminous infrared galaxies and the evolution of the galaxies we know today .
April 9 , 2008  -- Retired Gen. Colin Powell insists he has n't yet decided who he 'll back in the 2008 presidential election .
" I 'm looking at all three candidates , " Powell said in an exclusive interview with Diane Sawyer for Thursday 's " Good Morning America " on ABC .
" I know them all very , very well .
I consider myself a friend of each and every one of them .
And I have not decided who I will vote for yet . "
Powell , who served as President Bush 's first secretary of state , is a Republican , but that apparently is not enough to sway him toward Sen.
John McCain , R - Ariz. , the GOP 's presumptive nominee .
McCain has staked much of his presidential prospects on the success of the surge strategy in Iraq , a subject of great debate in Washington this week as Gen. David Petraeus took his case to Capitol Hill .
" The United States Armed Forces are very , very stretched .
It appears that after the surge is over , we 're going to go down to 140,000 troops in Iraq .
That 's 10,000 more than we had before the surge , " Powell observed , reacting to the testimony Petraeus delivered over two days .
" There is something of a continued surge there with that extra 10,000 .
And based on what Gen. Petraeus has said , he wants to let the surge troops go by July and then take 45 days to see what it looks like , and then begin a process of assessment .
Well , that tells me that we know what the administration strategy is going to be through the end of the term of the administration .
And that is , we 're going to maintain a very significant presence , " Powell said .
Extended Presence in Iraq , Trouble in Afghanistan Concern Powell
Powell , who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the administration of President George H.W. Bush and the first Gulf War , expressed concern over the burden an extended stay in Iraq would put on the troops and the country 's military forces .
" It 's going to be far more than the 100,000 that Secretary [ of Defense Robert ]
Gates was hoping for .
It 's going to be like 130,000 or 140,000 .
That is an extremely difficult burden for the United States Army , the United States Marine Corps , to keep up , " Powell told " Good Morning America . "
Powell also expressed reservations about the two - front combat in which the United States finds itself : surging in Iraq while trying to maintain control in Afghanistan .
" We have responsibilities in Afghanistan .
And in some ways , Afghanistan is more difficult than Iraq .
You have the tribal problems .
You had drug lords running around ... and al Qaeda and the Taliban are making a resurgence , " Powell said .
Next President 's Challenge
Sawyer pressed Powell on the differences between the presidential contenders on the critical issue of Iraq .
" I 'll tell you what they 're all going to face — whichever one of them becomes president on Jan. 21 of 2009 — they will face a military force , a United States military force , that cannot sustain , continue to sustain , 140,000 people deployed in Iraq , and the 20 ( to ) 25,000 people we have deployed in Afghanistan , and our other deployments , " Powell said .
In a recent speech , McCain cast America 's commitment to Iraq as a " moral responsibility , " arguing that a genocidal civil war could ensue if U.S. troops are withdrawn too soon .
" It would be an unconscionable act of betrayal , a stain on our character as a great nation , if we were to walk away from the Iraqi people and consign them to the horrendous violence , ethnic cleansing and possibly genocide that would follow a reckless , irresponsible and premature withdrawal , " McCain told the Los Angeles World Affairs Council in California .
Sens. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , and Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , have a starkly different take .
" I think it 's time to begin an orderly process of withdrawing our troops , start rebuilding our military and focusing on the challenges posed by Afghanistan , " Clinton said during a Senate Armed Services hearing on Tuesday .
At that same hearing , Obama insisted , " The time to end the surge and to start bringing our troops home is now , not six months from now . "
But Powell told Sawyer a withdrawal might not be that simple , no matter who is president next year .
" ( The president ) will have to continue to draw down at some pace .
None of them are going to have the flexibility of just saying , ' We 're out of here , turn off the switch , turn off the lights , we 're leaving , ' " he said .
" They will have a situation before them . "
Powell Rejects Olympic Boycott
On another hot topic , Powell rejected the idea of boycotting the opening ceremonies of the Olympics in China this summer .
" That 's a judgment the president will have to make .
I would not boycott the opening ceremony , " Powell told Sawyer .
First reported on the Drudge Report , Sen. Clinton has called for a boycott of the opening ceremonies but not the Olympics overall , specifically citing China 's reaction to recent protests in Tibet and inaction in Darfur .
" The violent clashes in Tibet and the failure of the Chinese government to use its full leverage with Sudan to stop the genocide in Darfur are opportunities for presidential leadership , " Clinton said in a written statement .
" These events underscore why I believe the Bush administration has been wrong to downplay human rights in its policy toward China .
At this time , and in light of recent events , I believe President Bush should not plan on attending the opening ceremonies in Beijing , absent major changes by the Chinese government . "
After initially resisting making a direct call for a boycott , Obama , in a written statement , said , " If the Chinese do not take steps to help stop the genocide in Darfur and to respect the dignity , security , and human rights of the Tibetan people , then the president should boycott the opening ceremonies . "
Set to begin on Aug. 8 , 2008 , the Beijing Olympics have been surrounded by controversy ever since the International Olympic Committee awarded China the Games .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , in an exclusive interview with " Good Morning America " co-anchor Robin Roberts , urged Bush to consider a boycott .
" I think boycotting the opening ceremony , which really gives respect to the Chinese government , is something that should be kept on the table , " Pelosi , D - Calif . , said .
" I think the president might want to rethink this later , depending on what other heads of state do . "
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced she will not attend the Olympic Games .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said today that he will not attend the opening ceremonies in August .
Powell : Boycotts Don't Work
Despite increasing calls for a boycott of the Olympic opening ceremony , Powell insists that such a move will not accomplish its objective .
" We always are aware and have been aware of Chinese human rights problems .
And I think if you start to take this kind of action , it does n't really serve the purpose of human rights , " Powell told " Good Morning America . "
" What is accomplished by boycotting the opening ceremony ? "
Powell asked rhetorically .
" I do n't think that makes the situation any better .
It probably makes the situation a little more difficult for the Chinese because they will pull back even more . "
Powell encouraged China to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama , the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet .
" I think we ought ( to ) recognize that these protests are legitimate , recognize that the Chinese ought to move forward and start having a dialogue with the Dalai Lama , and not just say , ' We 're not going to talk to you . '
( The ) Dalai Lama has indicated flexibility .
And I think that 's what the Chinese should do , " he said .
" But I do n't think that these kinds of actions , such as boycotting an opening ceremony , or even perhaps thinking twice about sending your team to the Olympics , has the desired effect .
" I very much supported in 2001 , when I was secretary of state , that we give the Olympics to the Chinese because I thought it would put them under a spotlight .
And they have responded to that spotlight , " he said .
" But they have n't with respect to Tibet .
And these demonstrations show the Chinese leadership that the world is watching this . "
Race and the Race
Returning to presidential politics , Powell condemned controversial remarks by Rev. Jeremiah Wright , Obama 's pastor of 20 years , as " deplorable " but complimented the Democratic candidate for his speech on race that followed in the aftermath .
" Rev . Wright is also somebody who has made enormous contributions in his community and has turned a lot of lives around , " Powell said , " And so , I have to put that in context with these very offensive comments that he made , which I reject out of hand . "
Powell added that he does not know Wright , and praised Obama 's response .
" I think that Sen . Obama handled the issue well . . . he did n't look the other way .
He did n't wait for the , for the , you know , for the storm to go over .
He went on television , and I thought , gave a very , very thoughtful , direct speech .
And he did n't abandon the minister who brought him closer to his faith , " Powell told Sawyer .
Powell , who has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate in almost every election since he retired from military service and public life , expressed admiration for Obama .
" It was a good ( speech ) , " Powell said .
" I admired him for giving it .
And I agreed with much of what he said . "
When the market climate is uncertain , investors often become nervous and lose sight of their long - term investment goals .
They are often tempted to postpone new investment , and even to sell their current holding swith the aim of reinvesting when the stock market stabilises .
However , if investors are able to take a long term view , it is often best to holdd onto investments through periods of volatility .
The pitfalls of market timing :
Of course all investors would like to be able to predict the movements of the market , buying at the bottom and selling at the top .
This is called market timing .
Unfortunately , it is very difficult to time movements in and out of the market , particularly in a period of extreme volatility .
And getting it wrong can significantly affect the performance of investments .
Selling at the first signof a downturn can prove particularly bad .
Sharp falls in the maket are followed by sharp gains .
While it may be tempting for for investors fearing further losses to sell their investments , they risk locking in losses and missing out on gains .
In for the long haul :
The long term performance of equities demonstrates that there is no need to time the markets ; its good enough just to be in the markets .
Research shows that investments made when the markets had already begun to recover , and those made when it is falling , have still paid dividends .
Read
In contrast waiting for a better time to invest can cost investors dearly .
Take a look at any stock market graph and you will notice that investors who remained invested over the last five years would have recieved returns around 60 % .
Many of the stock markets best days have come immediately after sharp falls .
Bottom line , trying to time the markets , invariably goes wrong .
The Wall Street Journal is reporting Fed Weighs Its Options in Easing Crunch .
The Federal Reserve is considering contingency plans for expanding its lending power in the event its recent steps to unfreeze credit markets fail .
Among the options : Having the Treasury borrow more money than it needs to fund the government and leave the proceeds on deposit at the Fed ; issuing debt under the Fed 's name rather than the Treasury 's ; and asking Congress for immediate authority for the Fed to pay interest on commercial - bank reserves instead of waiting until a previously enacted law permits it in 2011 .
The Fed holds assets to manage the nation 's money supply and influence the federal - funds rate , which banks charge each other on overnight loans .
When the Fed buys Treasurys or makes loans directly to banks , it supplies financial institutions with cash ; in effect , it prints money .
The cash ends up as currency in circulation or in banks ' reserve accounts at the Fed .
Since reserves earn no interest , banks lend cash that exceeds their required minimum .
That puts downward pressure on the federal funds rate , currently targeted by the Fed at 2.25 % .
The Fed could purchase securities and make loans almost without limit , expanding its balance sheet .
That would cause excess reserves to skyrocket and the federal funds rate to fall to zero .
The Fed would contemplate such " quantitative easing " only in dire circumstances .
The Bank of Japan took this step this decade after years of economic stagnation .
Weighing the Possibilities
So the Fed is seeking ways to expand its balance sheet without causing the federal funds rate to drop .
The likeliest option , one the Fed and Treasury have discussed , is for the Treasury to issue more debt than it needs to fund government operations .
The extra cash would be left on deposit at the Fed , where it would be separate from bank reserves on deposit and thus would have no impact on interest rates .
The Fed would use the cash to purchase an offsetting amount of Treasurys in the open market ; for legal reasons , it generally cannot buy them directly from Treasury .
Treasury 's principal constraint is the statutory limit debt .
Treasury debt was $ 453 billion below the limit Monday .
In the past , Congress always has responded to administration requests to raise the limit , sometimes only after political theatrics .
Fed officials also are investigating the feasibility of the Fed issuing its own debt and using the proceeds to purchase other assets or make loans .
It has never done so ; the legality is unclear .
Some foreign central banks , such as the Bank of Japan , do so .
....
The Fed is Terrified
Recap Of Fed Sponsored Facilities
The TAF ( Term Auction Facility ) failed to restore liquidity .
The TSLF ( Term Securities Lending Facility ) failed to restore liquidity .
See The Fed 's Swap Meet for more on the TSLF .
The PDCF ( Primary Dealer Credit Facility ) will be the next " facility " to fail .
See Fed Fails To Halt Debt Meltdown for more on the PDCF .
" The Federal Reserve has judged it necessary to take actions that extend to the very edge of its lawful and implied powers , transcending in the process certain long - embedded central banking principles and practices , " Volcker said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York .
Corollary Number Two :
The government / quasi - government body most responsible for creating this mess ( the Fed ) , will attempt a big power grab , purportedly to fix whatever problems it creates .
The bigger the mess it creates , the more power it will attempt to grab .
Over time this leads to dangerously concentrated power into the hands of those who have already proven they do not know what they are doing .
Corollary Number Four :
The Fed simply does not care whether its actions are illegal or not .
The Fed is operating under the principle that it 's easier to get forgiveness than permission .
And forgiveness is just another means to the desired power grab it is seeking .

Hey - you know that part about " If you do n't have either , you might be able to apply to the state to get a copy of your birth certificate , if you happened to have been born there , for just $ 12 ? "
Yeah , funny thing .
To get a copy of your birth certificate in Indiana you need - yup - a photo id ( http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/howto/w2w/indiana.htm)

The big issue is having people go out and travel to some place to register and to vote , and possibly go to a courthouse .
There may or not be any fees involved .
But apparently , some think all this travel is onerous , especially for people who do n't have a car , access to public transportation , or endure living in rural areas far from where all these activities occur .
Yet , these people somehow are able to get food to eat or they die .
Obviously , some kind of arrangements are being made ; these people do n't live in a bubble .
Plus , those who truly do have trouble getting around do have the option of using an absentee ballot , so they do n't have to go to a polling station to vote .
But the Indiana law has to do with people who do vote at polling stations , not absentee ballots .
My question is , what is the problem with the Supreme Court ruling or the Indiana law ?

SteveIL said : those who truly do have trouble getting around do have the option of using an absentee ballot , so they do n't have to go to a polling station to vote .
As mentioned in the SCOTUS opinions , Absentee ballots are not counted by the same means as in - person , polling place votes , thus giving a different weight to the votes of those who would be forced to vote absentee due to the law .
My question is , what is the problem with the Supreme Court ruling or the Indiana law ?
It seems you are wholly unfamiliar with both the law , the Constitution , and the concerns at hand here .
So , to be best answer your question , I 'll strongly recommend that you read the extremely well - written and sourced dissent from Justice Souter , with which I 'll happily associate myself .
His dissent , in which he eviscerates every one of defendant 's positions can be read here [ PDF ] , beginning on p. 31 .
If , after reading that , you have any further , specific questions about " the problem with the Supreme Court ruling or the Indiana law , " I 'll be happy to speak to them .
Familiarizing yourself with the actual facts , of the actual case , and our actual Constitutionally - based rule of law will likely be of use to you here .

BRAD , AGENT 99 - LISTEN UP !
Please try to get on NPR's Diane Rehm show tomorrow morning --- THAT'S WEDNESDAY --( 1-800-433-8850 or drshow@wamu.org ) at 10:00 am EDT .
She 's doing an hour on the VoterID decision and will have the notorious John Fund on , as well as Doug Chapin and Wendy Weiser .
I called the station as soon as I heard the announcement , especially since NPR 's Nina Totenberg this morning had Thor Hearne as a source , and I was directed to leave a message on the voice mail of the producer of the segment .
Diane 's ripe for a deeper understanding .
This week she did a show on the documentary " Rape in the Congo " , the failure of the FDA to properly inform us of the dangers of plastic bottles , veterans committing suicide , and a sympathetic hour with Jimmy Carter .
Perhaps if you call the main number of WAMU : 201-855-1200 BEFORE
the show , you can make your point to be heard .
PLEASE .
AND THANKS .

If this decision disenfranchises one American voter ( and it will on election day for sure ) it fails .
It just shows the partisanship of the SCROTUS .
( the " R " stands for you know what ) .
It is nothing other than another Bush v Gore decision .
I tried to watch the 60 minutes interview with Scumelia , I could n't finish it .

I read Souter 's opinion .
He 's nuts .
He 's also wrong , and his dissent does n't eviscerate anything .
Living in Indiana , those citizens with valid photo IDs are covered ; those citizens without valid photo IDs are covered ; those citizens who can vote through an absentee ballot are covered .
I read the following from BooMan :
Let me just give you a real life example .
In 2004 , when I was managing voter registration teams , almost no one I hired in North Philadelphia had a photo ID .
Likewise , almost no one they went out and registered in their neighborhoods had a photo ID .
Yet , we got tens of thousands of people registered to vote and then we got them to the polls .
If I had faced a requirement that everyone of those voters provide an official piece of photo identification , almost none of them would have voted .
Why ?
First of all , because they did n't have $ 60 - $ 80 to spend on acquiring the identification .
Second of all , even if they did , they would have had to make a special trip to the DMV , which is another part of the city .
So here is a group of people who are willing to get people without photo IDs to get registered and to get them to vote .
So , why not just have these " voter registration teams " follow through on the whole process regarding provisional ballots ?
Besides , what BooMan says regarding the cost of a photo ID is immaterial in Indiana since voting can be done without costing anything ( provisional ) .
Allow me to repeat myself :
Yet , these people somehow are able to get food to eat or they die .
Obviously , some kind of arrangements are being made ; these people do n't live in a bubble .
In light of what I put in from BooMan , this is more than true .
So my original question stands :
My question is , what is the problem with the Supreme Court ruling or the Indiana law ?

This decision was writen by PARTISANS who have no comprehension of JUSTICE but a clear political goal in mind and are willing to subvert the US CONSTITION and everything GOOD to get their goals .
It is a DISGUSTING decision that shows the shallowness and fear of the Republicans in the court , just as Bush v. Gore did .

If you 're unfamiliar with the U.S. Constitution and its laws , and thus , are going to argue that voter registration groups should find voters who were denied their legal right to vote , simply because they do n't have a state - issued ID , and arrange times to drive them to the county seat to have them sign an affidavit , even though they 've already signed it on Election Day .... well , suffice to say you 've already made clear to all that you are not a serious person .
If you wish to offer a serious argument , or have a serious discussion , let me know .
Until then , you seem little more than a partisan operative , with no weapons in your holsters , other than to offer disinformation .
If you continue to post unsubstantiated nonsense , with knowing disinformation , as I 've warned you already , your time here will be short .

Spot on !
I am in a wheelchair 24/7 and also blind in one eye along with other problems .
So even where I live it seems you have to have a picture ID just to take a poop !
It now costs me $ 30.00 for a DMV ID card .
It has to be renewed every two years and each time it goes up another $ 10.00 .
Now most folks would say so what that is nothing but when you have to pay the electric bill or buy food and you cant even get food at a food bank wothout a ID well it means doing without something that you have to have .
So you are right this is a major wrong doing to the poor .
It is a shame that to me it seems that voting is not even worth the time to find a ride or pay for a stamp for a absente ballot .
This country has screwed all of us .
I do not think it makes one differance if they are democraps or rethugs .
They all are not working for the people .
The real shame is that most people do not even care they only want to blame one side when it is all of them .
Why vote with all the fraud ?

FYI , my email to Diane Rehm for her NPR show this morning , and my email to Nina Totenberg ( regarding her Morning Edition report on Tuesday that featured Thor Hearne : April 30 , 2008 Diane , In April 2005 , five months after Congressman John Conyers , Jr. and the House Judiciary Committee Democratic Staff held hearings in Ohio which provided evidence of the deliberate " disenfranchisement of tens , if not hundreds , of thousands of voters , predominantly minority and Democratic voters " in the state that finally gave Mr. Bush the Presidency .
. .
Congressman Conyers reported on the new voter ID requirements proposed at the first meeting of the Baker Carter election commission : " At the outset , Mr. Fund laid bare the nasty , racial underbelly of these proposals .
The right - wing has been long engaged in tactics to suppress minority votes , but rarely lets slip about such tactics , as Fund did today .
In a discussion about provisional ballots , Mr. Fund said that Congress should allow precinct workers to determine whether a provisional ballot should count because they would know who 'looks as if they belong in the neighborhood . '
Wonder what he meant by that ?. . .
" The pattern of the hearing was clear : Republican political operatives , with little or no track record of involvement in voting rights issues , facing non-partisan advocates for civil rights .
Predictably , this hardly was a fair fight .
The deck was stacked from the beginning . "
And now , Diane , there you sit with this same John Fund .
When we need to hear from such people as Brad Friedman from Bradblog , NYU professor and author Mark Crispin Miller , and Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. Please dig further for guests and continue on this subject .
************
For Nina Totenberg , in response to yesterday ’s Morning Edition story : Thor Hearne should be understood in context .
Mr. Hearne is the former General Counsel for Bush / Cheney2004 who appeared out of nowwhere as the spokesman for the brand new American Center for Voting Rights just in time to testify for now - jailed Congressman Bob Ney in March 2005 about problems with the November 2004 election and then to turn around and be an invited panelist at the Baker Carter Election Commission .
It has been his job , as an RNC operative , to promote fear of " voter fraud " to distract from the real issues found by Congressman John Conyers , Jr. in his late 2004 hearings in Ohio that found evidence of the " disenfranchisement of tens , if not hundreds , of thousands of voters , predominantly minority and Democratic voters " in the state that finally gave Mr. Bush the Presidency .
See this coverage of Mr. Hearne by Brad Friedman at Bradblog.com .

But if you 're going to continue wasting my time by simply making things up , and pulling things out of your ass , you wo n't be long for this blog .
As I said , I did read Souter 's dissent .
It is obvious I got something different out of his opinion than you .
For example , Souter states that it is a problem that there are 900 voting precincts in Marion County , but only 12 BMV offices .
Here 's my problem with his thinking ; those BMV offices are open just about every week of the year , while the need for providing voting services at those precincts are needed during only select times ( an election ) .
Voting registration is open whenever the BMV offices are open , regardless of whether or not an election is coming up ; one can pick and choose when to get registered .
Yet , Souter attempts ( II A ) to use Burdick to apply a strict scrutiny standard that , in my opinion , does n't exist here since voter registration can occur throughout any year and the BMVs are open and available throughout any year for that purpose ( the majority opinion in Burdick itself , which ruled in favor of the state , and in which Souter joined , was n't based on a strict scrutiny standard ) .
It could be argued that maybe the standard could be applied in regards to traveling to a courthouse within 10 days after filing a provisional ballot ( II B in Souter 's dissent ) .
As noted by the majority opinion offered by Stevens , however , this case ( Crawford ) was a facial challenge , attempting to invalidate the entire law , and what was provided by the petitioners was n't enough to do so , citing the recent Washington State Grange v. Washington Republican Party ( which went against the respondents , with both Stevens and Souter joining in the majority opinion ) .
Based on my reading of things here , Souter 's dissent in this case is opposite to what he has ruled on even a month ago .
Hopefully , this helps .

SteveIL ( #18 ) - Thank you for a substantive ( if selective ) reply for a change .
It 's much appreciated over what you 've offered in your previous comments .
As even you admit , the burden of getting to the county seat 10 days later is an enormous failure in the law ( whether or not petitioners made a good case ) .
You also ignore Souter 's point " that the State has not come across a single instance of in - person voter impersonation fraud in all of Indiana ’s history . "
So , I 'm curious , if Indiana ( or , in your case , Illinois ) passed a law that said anyone named Steve had to go take steps above and beyond everyone else by going to the BMV before every Presidential election , and then had to make a trip to the county seat within 10 days after voting in order to have their vote counted ( unlike anyone else ) , you 'd be okay with that , right ?
As of now , you 've offered no reason why such a law , if passed by , say , the " Democrat Machine " in Chicago , would be objectionable to you in any way .
If you 'd object to such a law , please let me know on what basis you would do so .
Otherwise , I 'll presume such a law would be just fine for ya .
Nancy ( # 19 ) said foolishly : I do n't know a single American citizen who does n't have SOME form of ID .
Whether you know any such American citizens has nothing to do with it .
But the larger point is that Indiana 's law does n't allow for " SOME form of ID " , it requires , very specifically , a state - issued Photo ID .
Under the new law , even military ID wo n't do .
So why do you hate the troops ?
Beyond that , I thank Dr. Toxic ( # 21 ) for his / her brilliant reply to the rest of your garbage .
Yourkidding ( # 25 ) equally foolishly said :
The Democrats have disenfranchised 2 entire states of voters , Florida and Michigan .
Millions of people lost their constitutional right and you could care less .
I am not aware of a " constitutional right " to vote in a private political party 's nominating process , if that party chooses to keep it's own members from participating in the process .
But make someone prove they are who they say they are and thats an outrage ?
LOL ok .
Nope , that 's not what the law does .
But thanks for demonstrating that you have n't a clue about what you 're writing about .

Brad , it was selective because I ran out of time to go further .
It happens .
Now , let me discuss this rationally .
So , I 'm curious , if Indiana ( or , in your case , Illinois ) passed a law that said anyone named Steve had to go take steps above and beyond everyone else by going to the BMV before every Presidential election , and then had to make a trip to the county seat withing 10 days after voting in order to have their vote counted ( unlike anyone else ) , you 'd be okay with that , right ?
Somehow , I do n't think this passes any sort of constitutional muster .
Just as you provided an example that probably would n't happen , making a voting law for people named Steve .
I could provide a similar example based on your quote here :
You also ignore Souter 's point " that the State has not come across a single instance of in - person voter impersonation fraud in all of Indiana ’s history . "
" The State " could , in theory , not come across a single instance of robbery in its history .
That does n't invalidate a law that calls robbery illegal .
OK , I know it 's a stretch ; but , is your example any more of a stretch ?
And in retrospect , there was a case of potential fraud with that woman who attempted to vote in Indiana even though she was registered to vote in Florida and did n't have an Indiana driver 's license ( she had a Florida one ) .
Turns out , she was registered in both states , something that is clearly illegal .
The only reason it is n't called fraud is because she was n't prosecuted for fraud .
And no , I do n't agree with those who say she did n't break the law ; I believe she did .
As even you admit , the burden of getting to the county seat 10 days later is an enormous failure in the law ( whether or not petitioners made a good case ) .
I did n't say there was any kind of enormous failure at all .
I said I could understand the scrutiny in regards to having to go to the courthouse within 10 days .
But as Stevens points out , it does n't invalidate the whole law , nor do I think it should .
With the right to vote comes responsibility ; a person attempting to vote with a provisional ballot has to follow the rules that were just affirmed by the court .
In my opinion , I believe Souter is trying to say that before Indiana can pass this voter ID law , curbside service must be provided .
No state legislature , nor the rest of the voting public , would let that one fly .
What I 'm seeing based on the other cases I 've cited , Souter 's dissent here goes against those rulings he went with the majority on that did not impose the strict scrutiny standard he is using now .
As I 've mentioned , BMVs are opened year - round , registering to vote are available year - round , and those who do so have to take the time to do so , and figure out how to get this done .
The state of Indiana gives people the ability to vote provisionally , and in order for the vote to count , people have to take a trip to the circuit court .
And if they can't take a trip , they can vote absentee .

The reason you think its different is because you arent concerned over the peoples right to vote , when its democrats that are stoping them .
In that instance NO ONE HERE cares about the millions who VOTED LEGALLY .
The hypocracy is so thick in here Im running out of air .

I hear this charge that the Democrats are stopping people from voting , yet there is never any fire under this smoke .
( And do n't come back at me about the MI and FL and the primaries : I went to my caucus and I personally think everyone should go to caucuses and not primary elections .
You get to agree and disagree with real live people ; the parties have to deal with real live people ; and everyone in the family can attend --- at least they do in my neighborhood . )
Brad and most of the people who comment here do care about the " millions who VOTED LEGALLY . "
That 's what this whole Brad Blog is about : making sure that every one who has a right to vote can vote , and that their vote is counted .
I know a lot of elderly people , and probably half of them voted a straight Republican ticket their whole lives .
They are disenfranchised by these voting encumbrances .
When I was a child long long ago , one of the distinctions often made between the USSR and the USA was that citizens of the USA did not have to carry personal ID cards .
Now we are just like those commies .
If I put on my 1962 hat , the Republicans look like a bunch of commie pink -o sympathizers .
Barry Goldwater must be spinning in his grave ! ---
I 've been wanting to say that for a long time .

SteveIL # 31 said : ... in regard to my question whether he'd mind a law requiring all people named Steve to take several extra steps ( like going to the county seat within 10 days after voting , to sign an affidavit , attesting to the fact that his name was really Steve ) ...
Somehow , I do n't think this passes any sort of constitutional muster .
Why not ?
If people who just are n't lucky enough to have an Indiana drivers license --- say , they are military and stationed in Indiana , but have a drivers license from Florida instead --- have to go through extra steps to have their vote counted , why should all Steve's ?
It would be one thing if there were reason to believe that such folks like 80 year olds who do n't drive , urban folks who do n't have a car , or military members stationed in Indiana have a history of committing fraud , but by the state 's own admission , there is no such history .
Ever .
So why does it " pass constitutional muster " to make them take extra steps to cast a vote , in violation of the 14th Amendments equal protection clause , any more than banning all Steves from voting like anyone else would ?
ANSWER : Nobody has * yet * picked on people named Steve and denied them their CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT to vote like everyone else .
So you do n't care .
" The State " could , in theory , not come across a single instance of robbery in its history .
That does n't invalidate a law that calls robbery illegal .
OK , I know it 's a stretch ; but , is your example any more of a stretch ?
Would making " robbery illegal " deny anybody of a Constitutional RIGHT ?
Btw , Constitutional Rights are not judged by how many are denied them .
EVERY citizen is allowed every one of them , and if even one of them has such a right denied by a law , it is supposed to be Unconstitutional .
Until the Supreme Court decided to change that 200 + year tradition last Monday , anyway .
But you 're cool with that , apparently .
Not sure why you hate the U.S. Constitution and American Values so much .
there was a case of potential fraud with that woman who attempted to vote in Indiana even though she was registered to vote in Florida and did n't have an Indiana driver 's license ( she had a Florida one ) .
Turns out , she was registered in both states , something that is clearly illegal .
" Potential fraud " ?
Okay .
Now presuming she had voted ( which you say she did n't ) , how would the IN law have stopped that case of fraud from happening ?
When she went to the BMV to get her state - issued ID , she 'd just have gone and voted with it .
So what fraud , " potential " though it is , in your stretch to find any reason for this sort of law , would be stopped by this law ?
In the meantime , of course , thousands will be unable to have their vote counted , as they are Constitutionally - allowed ( until now ) .
With the right to vote comes responsibility ; a person attempting to vote with a provisional ballot has to follow the rules that were just affirmed by the court .
That 's right .
Just as all people named Steve would have to take extra steps above and beyond all other citizens if the legislature arbitrarily decided to pass such a " rule " .
After we take out all the Steve 's , what say we require extra steps of the Jews too ?
They look to me like they are good " potentials " for " fraud " as well , eh ?
After that , since we KNOW that Republicans have committed an extraordinary amount of Election Fraud , what say we make " rules " that require ONLY Republicans to take extra steps to try and have their vote counted .
You 're cool with that , I 'm guessing .
As I 've mentioned , BMVs are opened year - round , registering to vote are available year - round , and those who do so have to take the time to do so , and figure out how to get this done Cool .
And when ONLY Steves , Jews and Republicans are required to " take the time to do so " , I expect you 'll support that " rule " wholeheartedly .
The state of Indiana gives people the ability to vote provisionally , and in order for the vote to count , people have to take a trip to the circuit court .
Actually , a higher authority , the Constitution of the United States of America , gives people the RIGHT to vote equally , under the equal protection clause .
No exceptions .
So again , why do you hate the Constitution , the troops , the Steves , the Jews and the Republicans , Steve ?

" these people somehow are able to get food to eat or they die " Another great argument : eating & voting are the same thing !
The " relational " argument : " There 's more people killed on our highways than our troops in Iraq ... THEREFORE ... the Iraq War is " ok " !
How about this : these people can't mow their lawns themselves , so therefore they can't vote !
Everyone knows if you can eat , you should be able to get photo id !

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - More than 200 people were arrested across the United States on Wednesday as protesters marking the fifth anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq obstructed downtown traffic and tried to block access to government offices .
There were 32 arrests in Washington after demonstrators attempted to block entrances to the Internal Revenue Service , while 30 others were arrested outside a congressional office building , police said .
Protesters had hoped to shut down the IRS , the U.S. tax collection agency , to highlight the cost of the war .
Police cleared the building ’s entrances within an hour .
In San Francisco , long a center of anti-Iraq war sentiment , police arrested more than 100 people who protested through the day along Market Street in the central business district , a spokesman said .
Sgt. Steve Maninna said officers had arrested 143 people on charges including trespassing , resisting arrest and obstructing traffic .
Four women were also detained for hanging a large banner off the city ’s famous Golden Gate Bridge and then released , said bridge spokeswoman Mary Currie .
On Washington ’s National Mall , about 100 protesters carried signs that read : “ The Endlessness Justifies the Meaninglessness ” and waved upside - down U.S. flags , a traditional sign of distress .

“ Bush and Cheney , leaders failed , Bush and Cheney belong in jail , ” they chanted , referring to U.S. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
One hour after the IRS standoff , several dozen protesters waved signs that read : “ Stop Paying to Kill ” and “ How Much Longer ? ” as a ragtag brass band played .
IRS employees were easily able to enter the building .
“ We wanted to put our bodies between the money and what that money goes to fund -- the war , the occupation , the bombs , ” said Frida Berrigan , an organizer with the War Resisters League .
The war has cost the United States $ 500 billion since the invasion to topple Saddam Hussein began in March 2003 and is a major issue in November ’s U.S. presidential election .
Tens of thousands of Iraqis have been killed and millions more displaced , with almost 4,000 U.S. soldiers killed .
BLOCKING TRAFFIC
Later , scores of noisy protesters blocked a busy intersection in Washington ’s business district .
They picketed in front of the offices of The Washington Post and threw red paint on the building that houses the Examiner newspaper and Bechtel National Inc , which has handled major reconstruction projects in Iraq .

In New York , about 30 members of the “ Granny Peace Brigade ” gathered in Times Square , knitting in hand , to demand troops be brought home now .
“ We ’re out here to show people that this war is madness .
We never should have gotten into this war in the first place , ” said Shirley Weiner , 80 .
Police in Boston arrested five people who blocked access to a military recruitment center by lying on a sidewalk dressed as slain Iraqi civilians , an Iraqi mourner , a slain U.S. soldier and an American citizen in mourning .
“ We went to this military recruiting station today because we want to see the war end immediately , ” said activist Joe Previtera in a statement .
“ Silently waiting for Congress to act on this war in 2009 will condemn thousands more people to injury and senseless death .
Enough is enough . ”
------------------------------Posted by Bev Harris on Wednesday , March 19 , 2008 - 2:02 pm:Jim March , John Brakey and Michael Shelby have pulled a coup inArizona .
They have studied and reported on the presidential primary election inthe largest county in that state , Maricopa , with 56 % of the AZ vote .
The report they 've published sets new ground in how to monitor thesecurity and sanity of an election .
THERE ARE THREE REASONS TO READ THIS REPORT:1 ) Appendix A is a scathing indictment of the security and legality ofthe Sequoia product line .
Taking advantage of material that wasn' tavailable to California Secretary of State Debra Bowen 's top - to - bottomreview team , they 've shown that Sequoia must now be considered theleast secure and most illegal black box voting system in America - " dethroning " Diebold .
Appendix A is a standalone section that can beread independently of the full report .
2 ) Also of national interest : this report forms a blueprint on how todo central tabulator observation missions , whether as a citizen orpartisan representative .
By carefully observing the hardware beingused and asking pointed questions and public records digging , they 'veshown that it 's possible to pierce the veil of secrecy over election ( mis ? ) conduct .
Findings include the outsourcing of the entire mail - in vote processincluding the use of a private company to print , mail out , - =receive= - and scan the ballot signatures ... all by a private company outside ofthe scope of public records access and proper accountability .
3 ) For any Arizona voter , the report is a must - read to see just howbadly an election can be run in the 4th largest county in America !
It 's also a message of hope - they can't get away with running asystem this sloppy without getting caught .
The barriers these three faced in producing this document wereunbelievable .
Arizona is one of the states where the rights of thecitizenry to observe and control their own elections are notrecognized by the government .
Instead , you must be a political partyelection observer in order to observe .
Turned down as observers by the Maricopa Republican and Democratic parties after a slander campaign bythe county elections department to both of those party chairs , Marchand Shelby were credentialed as observers by the MaricopaLibertarians ... who by statute have observer rights .
But since the Libertarian Party was n't on the ballot , the county attempted to denythem credentials , which was reversed by a judge on election day in anemergency hearing called by attorney Michael Kielsky - the LP STATEparty chair .
Based on what 's come out in this report , the nation owes a debt to the Arizona Libertarian Party .
FULL REPORT :( 5,769 KB ) Maricopa County Elections : A Security Report for the MaricopaLibertarian , Republican and Democratic Partiesby Jim March , John Brakey and Michael ShelbyOVERVIEW AND EXECUTIVE BRIEFING
That is pretty neat .
It reminds me of a comic this guy in one of my classes did last year about a Japanese boy who falls asleep while studying English and wakes up in Grammarland ( or something ) and he meets a group of punctuation mark - styled characters named " The Punktuations " .
There 's Perry , who only speaks in sentences ending in periods ;
Mark , who only speaks in short statements ending in exclamation marks ( " I'M MARK ! LOL ! " ) ;
Colin , whose statements always include a semicolon at some point ; and Quincy , who only asks questions .
It was a really entertaining read .
There are no road signs to the village , just a dirt track off the highway to the north of the Israeli city of Beer Sheva .
Officially Twayil Abu Jarwal , a village on the land where the Talalqah clan has lived for generations , does not exist .
It is " unrecognised " in the terminology that shapes the bitter land dispute between Israel 's 160,000 indigenous bedouin in the Negev desert and the Israeli state .
Last year the authorities mounted eight separate operations in Twayil to demolish the homes of those living there , but the villagers stayed on .
Now they live in poor quality tents surrounded by the remains of destroyed homes : corrugated iron , bricks and heaps of dirt piled on torn - down tents .
" The government used force against us , they detained people , demolished houses , fined us and nothing helped , " said Aqil al - Talalqah , 66 , a retired headmaster who now lives in a tent in Twayil , only a few hundred yards from the demolished two - room building where he once went to school as a child .
" They say we are invading state land .
How are we invading state land ?
This is our land . "
A leading international human rights group yesterday accused the Israeli government of discrimination against the bedouin , citing a sharp increase in housing demolitions and a " systematic violation " of their land and housing rights .
The detailed 126 - page report from Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) comes as a new government - appointed commission begins a study on the long - running land ownership dispute .
The Goldberg Commission , appointed by the housing ministry but without any representatives from the unrecognised villages , is due to report later this year .
Tens of thousands of bedouin - Arabs who have lived a semi-nomadic life on the land for many generations and who all carry full Israeli citizenship - live in 39 " unrecognised villages " in southern Israel where their homes are subject to frequent demolition .
" Discriminatory land and planning policies have made it virtually impossible for bedouin to build legally where they live and also exclude them from the state 's development plans for the region , " HRW said in the report .
It described " discriminatory , exclusionary and punitive policies " and noted that new farms and towns for Jewish Israelis were being built in the area .
" The state appears intent on maximising its control over Negev land and increasing the Jewish population in the area for strategic , economic and demographic reasons , " it said .
In 2005 , the Israeli government adopted a $ 3.6bn ( about £ 1.8 bn ) plan to bring another 200,000 Israelis to the Negev to ease housing pressure elsewhere .
HRW called for an immediate halt to house demolitions and the creation of an independent commission to investigate the dispute .
Twayil is one of the villages worst hit by the recent increase in demolitions .
The Talalqah clan was moved from the area in the 1950s , a time when Israel 's Arab population was subject to military rule .
In 1978 , clan members bought plots of land in Lakiya , one of seven townships established for the bedouin on the advice of a government committee , thinking they could restart their lives .
But they have not received their land and soon discovered Lakiya was built on land claimed by another bedouin tribe .
Eventually , they returned to Twayil , where they now live surrounded by the signs of demolitions and without even basic services like water or electricity .
Talalqah , who was one of those who bought land in Lakiya , acknowledges that bedouin traditions of grazing are largely gone and irreplaceable .
Now he wants the village of Twayil to be formally recognised and provided with basic public services .
" They put so much pressure on us , " he said .
" But we will not evacuate unless we have a real solution . "
Six bedouin villages have received limited recognition from the state .
The bedouin case is complicated by disputes between the different groups representing them and the fact that few have the mid-19th century Ottoman land ownership document , known as a Tabu .
There is also a broad Israeli perception that the community is responsible for most of the crime in the area and is making unrealistic claims to the land .
In December 2000 , Ariel Sharon , who was then head of the Likud opposition party and later became prime minister , said : " The bedouin are grabbing new territory .
They are gnawing away at the country 's land reserves and no one is doing anything significant about it . "
A spokesman for Israel 's housing ministry said that it wanted to encourage all bedouin to move into the seven townships built for them .
A bedouin administration is recruiting bedouin staff to deal with the community 's issues and the Goldberg Commission , which will report later this year , will advise on how to resolve the land ownership dispute .
" Our goal is to stop them from spreading out and to bring them into these towns , " the spokesman said .
" The land they are sitting on today is not their land .
This is Israeli land . "
The Israel Land Administration , which manages the 93 % of Israeli land that is publicly owned , said it is " doing everything in its power to resolve the problems of the landless bedouin in the Negev . "
" Instead of prosecution , Israel proposes to settle the conflict by offering extremely generous settlements in return for the withdrawal of the bedouins ' ownership claims , " it says .
However , the seven townships to which it wants the bedouin to move are already overcrowded and have poor living conditions - in stark contrast to the new communities being built nearby for Israelis relocating to the Negev .
According to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics , in 2003 all the townships ranked among the eight poorest areas of Israel .
But of the newly built communities around Beer Sheva , with their predominantly Jewish populations , two were in the top five wealthiest areas of the country .
S.F. landlords charged with tenant terror SAN FRANCISCO Couple allegedly had support beams cut and burgled a unit
A landlord couple have been charged in San Francisco with waging a campaign of terror against their renters in a South of Market building , including cutting out the floor supports at one apartment after the tenant went to court to keep from being evicted , authorities said Wednesday .
Software engineer Kip Macy , 33 , and real estate agent Nicole Macy , 32 , who have addresses in Sausalito and Incline Village , Nev. , were arrested Tuesday and charged with felony stalking , felony residential burglary , conspiracy and other counts in the bizarre case of apparent landlord rage .
They posted bail after their arrest and could not be reached for comment Wednesday .
The charges stem from tactics the Macys allegedly used after they bought a six - unit , three - story apartment building on Clementina Street for $ 995,000 in 2005 and started eviction proceedings against the five tenants living there .
When one of the tenants , Scott Morrow , successfully fought eviction , the couple allegedly told workers in September 2006 to cut the beams that supported his apartment 's floor .
They also shut off Morrow 's electricity , cut his phone line and had workers saw a hole in his living room floor from below , prosecutors said .
Morrow has since sued the Macys .
The couple were also charged with terrorizing two other tenants in the building who began paying the Macys reduced rent after concluding that they were being overcharged under the city 's rent control law .
Prosecutors said the Macys broke into the tenants ' apartment last June and stole $ 2,000 in cash , a Gucci watch and a cell phone .
The tenants , Erik Hernandez and Jason Lopez , later filed a lawsuit accusing the Macys of first changing the locks on the apartment , then illegally entering their unit and dismantling some of their furniture .
When Hernandez came home and confronted Kip Macy as the landlord was ransacking his apartment , Macy kicked him in the chest , the suit says .
Threatening notes then started appearing at the tenants ' door , and the water was shut off after the Macys stopped paying the bill , the suit says .
In October , Nicole Macy broke into the apartment and poured ammonia on clothes , bedding and home electronics , prosecutors said .
" I would say this is horrendous , a total abuse of tenants and human beings so they could have their way and totally ignore the law , " said Steve Collier , the attorney for Hernandez and Lopez .
" Lawless landlords is what I 'd call them . "
Kip Macy is accused of three felony conspiracy charges , three burglary charges , two stalking charges , two grand theft charges and one felony count of shutting off service , related to cutting Morrow 's power .
He also faces one misdemeanor vandalism charge .
Nicole Macy faces three conspiracy charges , three burglary charges , two stalking charges , two grand theft charges , one charge of cutting phone service and one count of misdemeanor vandalism .
Deputy City Attorney Jennifer Choi said that in February , the city sued the Macys and the now - defunct Nevada corporation that owned the building at 744-746 Clementina St. , saying they were " managing their business in an unfair way . "
Among other things , the Macys ' attempted evictions under the state Ellis Act violated the law , the city says .
The law allows landlords to quit the rental business , evict all tenants and move into the vacant units themselves or sell them to a group of individuals who would occupy them .
But if any units are re-rented within five years , the rents have to be the same as those the evicted tenants were paying .
The Macys , said Choi , simply rented to new tenants at higher rates .
But Morrow fought his eviction and won in the summer of 2006 .
That was when the trouble started .
A fire in the apartment below his had exposed the floor joists , and after he won his court case , the Macys had the joists cut , Choi said .
" That is one of the most egregious things I 've seen , of cases of landlords really going to extremes , " Choi said .
One day , Morrow noticed the blade of a saw come through his living room floor , his attorney said .
He and a friend managed to bend the blade , which had cut a 2 - by - 4 - foot hole in the floor .
Choi said building inspectors repeatedly visited the building and issued multiple citations , including one ordering that the cut joists be repaired immediately .
In the end , the city did the work and sent the Macys a bill for $ 8,000 , which the couple have not yet paid , Choi said .
" This is a very bizarre case , " Choi said .
" It seemed like these landlords went from zero to extremely angry very quickly . "
Morrow declined to comment Wednesday .
" The poor guy , " Choi said .
" This has been very traumatic for him .
He literally never leaves his apartment because he thinks the Macys will change the locks . "
J. Scott Weaver , Morrow 's attorney , said the Macys ' attitude appears to be , " ' It 's my property - I can do whatever I want . '
" From that , all the other stuff follows , " Weaver said .
" It 's their property , they can cut holes in the floor , if they want to .
" It makes you question your own sanity , " he said .
" You think , why would a landlord do that ?
Why would a landlord cut open his floor ?
It was a big hole .
...
After a few incidents like that , you come to the conclusion that anything can happen . "

EIGHT recent events make action to end water fluoridation urgent .
1 . The publication in 2006 of a 500 - page review of fluoride ’s toxicology by a distinguished panel appointed by the National Research Council of the National Academies ( NRC , 2006 ) .
The NRC report concluded that the US Environmental Protection Agency ’s ( EPA ) safe drinking water standard for fluoride ( i.e. maximum contaminant level goal or MCLG ) of 4 parts per million ( ppm ) is unsafe and should be lowered .
Despite over 60 years of fluoridation , the report listed many basic research questions that have not been addressed .
Still , the panel reviewed a large body of literature in which fluoride has a statistically significant association with a wide range of adverse effects .
These include an increased risk of bone fractures , decreased thyroid function , lowered IQ , arthritic - like conditions , dental fluorosis and , possibly , osteosarcoma .
The average fluoride daily intakes ( * ) associated with many of these adverse effects are reached by some people consuming water at the concentration levels now used for fluoridation — especially small children , above average water drinkers , diabetics , people with poor kidney function and other vulnerable sub -groups .
For example , the average fluoride daily intake associated with impaired thyroid function in people with iodine deficiency ( about 12 % of the US population ) is reached by small children with average consumption of fluoridated water at 1 ppm and by people of any age or weight with moderate to high fluoridated water consumption .
Of special note among the animal studies is one in which rats fed water containing 1 ppm fluoride had an increased uptake of aluminum into the brain , with formation of beta - amyloid plaques , which is a classic marker of Alzheimer ’s disease pathology in humans .
Considering the substantial variation in individual water intake , exposure to fluoride from many other sources , its accumulation in the bone and other calcifying tissues and the wide range of human sensitivity to any toxic substance , fluoridation provides NO margin of safety for many adverse effects , especially lowered thyroid function .
* Note : “ Daily intake ” takes into account the exposed individual ’s bodyweight and is measured in mg. of fluoride per kilogram bodyweight .
2 . The evidence provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) in 2005 that 32 % of American children have dental fluorosis – an abnormal discoloration and mottling of the enamel .
This irreversible and sometimes disfiguring condition is caused by fluoride .
Children are now being overdosed with fluoride , even in non-fluoridated areas , from water , swallowed toothpaste , foods and beverages processed with fluoridated water , and other sources .
Fluoridated water is the easiest source to eliminate .
3 . The American Dental Association ’s policy change , in November 2006 , recommending that only the following types of water be used for preparing infant formula during the first 12 months of life : “ purified , distilled , deionized , demineralized , or produced through reverse osmosis . ”
This new policy , which was implemented to prevent the ingestion of too much fluoride by babies and to lower the risk of dental fluorosis , clearly excludes the use of fluoridated tap water .
The burden of following this recommendation , especially for low income families , is reason alone for fluoridation to be halted immediately .
Formula made with fluoridated water contains 250 times more fluoride than the average 0.004 ppm concentration found in human breast milk in non-fluoridated areas ( Table 2 - 6 , NRC , 2006 ) .
4 . The CDC ’s concession , in 1999 and 2001 , that the predominant benefit of fluoride in reducing tooth decay is TOPICAL and not SYSTEMIC .
To the extent fluoride works to reduce tooth decay , it works from the outside of the tooth , not from inside the body .
It makes no sense to drink it and expose the rest of the body to the long term risks of fluoride ingestion when fluoridated toothpaste is readily available .
Fluoride ’s topical mechanism probably explains the fact that , since the 1980s , there have been many research reports indicating little difference in tooth decay between fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities ( Leverett , 1982 ; Colquhoun , 1984 ; 1985 and 1987 ; Diesendorf , 1986 ; Gray , 1987 ; Brunelle and Carlos , 1990 ; Spencer , 1996 ; deLiefde , 1998 ; Locker , 1999 ; Armfield and Spencer , 2004 ; and Pizzo 2007 – see citations ) .
Poverty is the clearest factor associated with tooth decay , not lack of ingested fluoride .
According to the World Health Organization , dental health in 12 - year olds in non-fluoridated industrialized countries is as good , if not better , than those in fluoridated countries ( Neurath , 2005 ) .
5 . In 2000 , the publication of the UK government sponsored “ York Review , ” the first systematic scientific review of fluoridation , found that NONE of the studies purporting to demonstrate the effectiveness of fluoridation to reduce tooth decay were of grade A status , i.e. “ high quality , bias unlikely ” ( McDonagh et al. , 2000 ) .
6 . The publication in May 2006 of a peer - reviewed , case - controlled study from Harvard University which found a 5 - 7 fold increase in osteosarcoma ( a frequently fatal bone cancer ) in young men associated with exposure to fluoridated water during their 6th , 7th and 8th years ( Bassin et al. , 2006 ) .
This study was surrounded by scandal as Elise Bassin ’s PhD thesis adviser , Professor Chester Douglass , was accused by the watchdog Environmental Working Group of attempting to suppress these findings for several years ( see video ) .
While this study does not prove a relationship between fluoridation and osteosarcoma beyond any doubt , the weight of evidence and the importance of the risk call for serious consideration .
7 . The admission by federal agencies , in response to questions from a Congressional subcommittee in 1999 - 2000 , that the industrial grade waste products used to fluoridate over 90 % of America ’s drinking water supplies ( fluorosilicate compounds ) have never been subjected to toxicological testing nor received FDA approval for human ingestion ( Fox , 1999 ; Hazan , 2000 ; Plaisier , 2000 ; Thurnau , 2000 ) .
8 . The publication in 2004 of “ The Fluoride Deception ” by Christopher Bryson .
This meticulously researched book showed that industrial interests , concerned about liabilities from fluoride pollution and health effects on workers , played a significant role in the early promotion of fluoridation .
Bryson also details the harassment of scientists who expressed concerns about the safety and / or efficacy of fluoridation ( see Bryson interview ) .
We call upon Members of Congress ( and legislators in other fluoridating countries ) to sponsor a new Congressional ( or Parliamentary )
Hearing on Fluoridation so that those in government agencies who continue to support the procedure , particularly the Oral Health Division of the CDC , be compelled to provide the scientific basis for their ongoing promotion of fluoridation .
They must be cross -examined under oath if the public is ever to fully learn the truth about this outdated and harmful practice .
We call upon all medical and dental professionals , members of water departments , local officials , public health organizations , environmental groups and the media to examine for themselves the new documentation that fluoridated water is ineffective and poses serious health risks .
It is no longer acceptable to simply rely on endorsements from agencies that continue to ignore the large body of scientific evidence on this matter — especially the extensive citations in the NRC ( 2006 ) report discussed above .
The untold millions of dollars that are now spent on equipment , chemicals , monitoring , and promotion of fluoridation could be much better invested in nutrition education and targeted dental care for children from low income families .
The vast majority of enlightened nations have done this ( see statements ) .
It is time for the US , and the few remaining fluoridating countries , to recognize that fluoridation is outdated , has serious risks that far outweigh any minor benefits , violates sound medical ethics and denies freedom of choice .
Fluoridation must be ended now .

The head of the World Bank has said that soaring food prices are causing hardship and starvation for poor people worldwide , and implied that at least some of the blame lay with Western governments ' efforts to encourage biofuel use .
" While many worry about filling their gas tanks , many others around the world are struggling to fill their stomachs , " said Bank supremo Robert Zoellick , quoted in today 's Guardian .
" This is not just about meals forgone today , or about increasing social unrest , it is about lost learning potential for children and adults in the future , stunted intellectual and physical growth , " he added .
" We estimate that the effect of this food crisis on poverty reduction worldwide is in the order of seven lost years . "
Zoellick appeared primarily to be calling for greater agricultural and food aid from the rich nations to the developing world .
However , he made it clear that he considered the push toward biofuels part of the problem , saying that this tended to push up food prices .
A majority of transport biofuel schemes involve the use of varying proportions of ethyl alcohol - ethanol - in adapted internal - combustion petrol engines .
Ethanol must be made from food crops at present , though its advocates hope to see it produced from non -food biomass or other sources in future .
Zoellick would have been referring to ethanol biofuels .
Less mainstream types of biofuel include methanol - wood alcohol - which can be made from inedible plant matter , and biodiesel .
These technologies are less controversial than food ethanol , but are usually seen as being harder to implement and have gained comparatively little traction .
Government measures thus far have tended to focus on ethanol techniques , in large part due to pressure from Western farmers seeking lucrative markets for their crops .
The UK , for instance , intends to require first 5 and then 10 per cent ethanol content in motor fuel in coming years - a plan which has already drawn widespread criticism .
The Guardian also quoted Oxfam 's Liz Stuart , who said :
" Europe and the US must stop adding fuel to fire by increasing crop production for biofuels .
These have dubious environment benefits , and by driving up prices , are crippling the lives of the poor . " ®
High school seniors nationwide are anxiously awaiting the verdicts from the colleges of their choice later this month .
But though it may not be of much solace to them , in just a few years the admissions frenzy is likely to ease .
It ’s simply a matter of demographics .
Projections show that by next year or the year after , the annual number of high school graduates in the United States will peak at about 2.9 million after a 15 - year climb .
The number is then expected to decline until about 2015 .
Most universities expect this to translate into fewer applications and less selectivity , with most students probably finding it easier to get into college .
“ For the high school graduate , this becomes a buyers ’ market , ” said Daniel M. Fogel , president of the University of Vermont .
That wo n’t help Charlie Cotton , a senior at Madison High School in New Jersey .
He has the grades and scores to aim for the nation ’s elite universities , yet in the hyper - competitive world of college admissions , his chances of winning a spot at his top picks  like Middlebury , Dartmouth and Oberlin  are highly uncertain .
When his sister , Emma , who is in eighth grade , applies to college , she is expected to face a less frantic landscape with fewer rivals .
Germany has no organisation to keep track of war veterans
Erich Kaestner , who at 18 was sent to the Western Front but served only four months in the army , died in a Cologne nursing home , his son said .
The death on Sunday of Louis de Cazenave , France 's second - last World War I veteran , made global headlines .
But in a country that keeps no record of its veterans , Kaestner 's death on 1 January went largely unnoticed .
" That is the way history has developed , " said Peter Kaestner , the soldier 's son .
" In Germany , in this respect , things are kept quiet - they 're not a big deal . "
Erich Kaestner was unrelated to the writer and poet of the same name .
End of an era
Reports in Die Welt daily and Der Spiegel magazine identified Kaestner as Germany 's last World War I veteran , but verification of the claim was difficult as the country keeps no record of its war veterans .
The German public was within a hair 's breadth of never learning of the end of an era
Der Spiegel
In a country where the shame of the Nazi genocide and memories of two world war defeats still cast long shadows , both publications focused more on the German national psyche than the death itself .
" The German public was within a hair 's breadth of never learning of the end of an era , " wrote Der Spiegel , until someone updated his death notice on the internet encyclopaedia site , Wikipedia .
In its obituary for Kaestner , Die Welt noted : " The losers hide themselves in a state of self - pity and self denial that they happily try to mitigate by forgetting . "
Officer , judge , husband
Born in 1900 , Kaestner had joined the army when he left school in 1918 .
He rejoined the military as a Luftwaffe first lieutenant in 1939 , where he served mainly as a ground support officer in France .
After the war , he became a judge in Hanover , where his work earned him Lower Saxony 's Merit Cross .
His 75 - year marriage was recognised by Germany 's president in 2003 shortly before his wife , Maria , died aged 102 .
Her letters to Kelly functioned in the same way .
“ Maybe writing home was a release , to help me forget about what was happening , ” she said .
Then , moments later , she said , “ I put everything down on paper that I was thinking .
And if it were n’t for those letters , I do n’t think I could even tell you anything that went on .
That ’s the only way I can remember things , is letters and photos . ”
The remarks sound contradictory , but Harman seemed to conceive of memory as an external storage device .
By downloading her impressions to a document , she could clear them from her mind and transform reality into an artifact .
After all , she said , that was how she experienced the things she did and saw done to prisoners on Tier 1A : “ It seems like stuff like this only happened on TV .
It ’s not something you really thought was going on .
At least I did n’t think it was going on .
It ’s just something that you watch and that is not real . ”
Real or unreal , participant or bystander , degrader or degraded , overstimulated or numbed out —
Harman may have meant no harm but she seemed to understand that in the malignant circumstances of the M.I. block she could not be entirely harmless .
Unable or unwilling to reconcile her most disturbing and her most appealing actions and reactions , she equivocated .
When she wrote of “ both sides of me , ” she said , “ It was military and civilian — the tough side and the non - tough side .
You battle out which one is more stronger , I guess .
. . .
You ’re trained to be tough .
I was right out of basic , and you ’re just trained to do what you ’re told , and to not let things affect you .
You ’re supposed to set all emotions aside , because this is war .
I think it ’s almost impossible .
It is emotional . ”
Megan Ambuhl , who was Harman ’s roommate at Abu Ghraib , regarded her as a little sister , in need of protection .
“ She is just so naïve , but awesome , ” she said .
“ A good person , but not always aware of the situation . ”
Harman called Ambuhl “ Mommy , ” and accepted the verdict of naïveté with equal measures of solace and regret .
Harman wanted to be tough and she wanted to be nice , and she said , “ I should n’t have been there .
I mean obviously I did n’t do what I was supposed to .
I could n’t hit somebody .
I ca n’t stomach that ever .
I do n’t like to watch people get hit .
I get sick .
I know it ’s kind of weird that I can see a dead person , but I do n’t like actual violence .
I did n’t like taking away their blankets when it was really cold .
Because if I ’m freezing and I ’m wearing a jacket and a hat and gloves , and these people do n’t have anything on and no blanket , no mattress , that ’s kind of hard to see and do to somebody — even if they are a terrorist . ”
In fact , she said , “ I really did n’t see them as prisoners there .
I just saw them as people that were pretty much in the same situation I was , just trapped in Abu Ghraib . ”
And she said , “ I told them that we were prisoners also .
So we felt how they were feeling . ”
It was easier to be nice to the women and children on Tier 1B , but , Harman said , “ It was kind of sad that they even had to be there . ”
The youngest prisoner on the tier was just ten years old — “ a little kid , ” she said .
“ He could have fit through the bars , he was so little . ”
Like a number of the other kids and of the women there , he was being held as a pawn in the military ’s effort to capture or break his father .
Harman enjoyed spending time with the kids .
She let them out to run around the tier in a pack , kicking a soccer ball , and she enlisted them to help sweep the tier and distribute meals — special privileges , reserved only for the most favored prisoners on the M.I. block .
“ They were fun , ” she said .
“ They made the time go by faster . ”
She did n’t like seeing children in prison “ for no reason , just because of who your father was , ” but she did n’t dwell on that .
What was the point ?
“ You ca n’t feel because you ’ll just go crazy , so you just kind of blow it off , ” Harman said .
“ You can only make their stay a little bit acceptable , I guess .
You give them all the candy from the M.R.E.s to make their time go by better .
But there ’s only so much you can do or so much you can feel . ”
On Tier 1A , Harman liked to sneak cigarettes and doses of Tylenol or ibuprofen to prisoners who were being given a hard time .
These small gestures gave her comfort , too , and it pleased her that prisoners sometimes turned to her for help .
But Harman was generally as forgiving of her buddies as she was of herself .
When toughness failed her , and niceness was not an option , Harman took refuge in denial .
“ That ’s the only way to get through each day , is to start blocking things out , ” she said .
“ Just forget what happened .
You go to bed , and then you have the next day to worry about .
It ’s another day closer to home .
Then that day ’s over , and you just block that one out . ”
At the same time , she faulted herself for not being a more enthusiastic soldier when prisoners on Tier 1A were being given the business .
When she was asked how other M.P.s could go at it without apparent inhibition , all she could say was “ They ’re more patriotic . ”
One night in the first week of November , 2003 , an agent of the Army ’s Criminal Investigative Division — an agency sometimes described as the military ’s F.B.I. — came to the M.I. block to interrogate a new prisoner , an Iraqi suspected of involvement in the deaths of American soldiers .
The story , as the M.P.s understood it , was that the prisoner kept giving a false name and insisting that he was not who the C.I.D. said he was .
He was given the nickname Gilligan and subjected to the standard treatment : the yelling , the P.T. , the sleep deprivation .
Graner , who took charge of Gilligan ’s harassment , gave him a cardboard box — an M.R.E. carton — which he was ordered to carry around or to stand on for long stretches .
Gilligan was hooded , and normally he would have been naked , too , but , because of the cold , Graner had cut a hole in a prison blanket and draped it over him like a poncho .
Staff Sergeant Chip Frederick later told Army investigators that he asked the C.I.D. man — whom he identified as Agent Romero — about Gilligan , and that Romero said , “ I do n’t give a fuck what you do to him , just do n’t kill them . ”
Frederick said that he took Romero ’s words “ like an order , but not a specific order , ” and he explained , “ To me , Agent Romero was like an authority figure , and when he said he needed the detainee stressed out I wanted to make sure the detainee was stressed out . ”
Frederick found Gilligan where Graner had left him , perched on his box in the shower room of Tier 1A .
“ There were a lot of detainees that were forced to stand on boxes , ” he said .
Behind Gilligan , he noticed some loose electrical wires hanging from the wall .
“ I grabbed them and touched them together to make sure they were n’t live wires , ” he said .
“ When I did that and got nothing , I tied a loop knot on the end , put it on , I believe , his index finger , and left it there . ”
Frederick said that somebody then tied a wire to Gilligan ’s other hand and Harman said , “ I told him not to fall off , that he would be electrocuted if he did . ”
Harman had been busy for much of the night , keeping awake the prisoner they called the Claw , and attending to another one they called Shitboy , a maniac on Tier 1B who had the habit of smearing himself with his feces and hurling it at passing guards .
She was taking a break when she joined the others in the shower room , and although Gilligan understood English , she was n’t sure if he believed her threat .
Besides , the whole mock - electrocution business had not lasted more than ten or fifteen minutes — just long enough for a photo session .
“ I knew he would n’t be electrocuted , ” she said .
“ So it really did n’t bother me .
I mean , it was just words .
There was really no action in it .
It would have been meaner if there really was electricity coming out , and he really could be electrocuted .
No physical harm was ever done to him . ”
In fact , she said , “ He was laughing at us towards the end of the night , maybe because he knew we could n’t break him . ”
Once the wires were attached to Gilligan , Frederick had stepped back , instructed Gilligan to hold his arms out straight from his sides , like wings , and taken a picture .
Then he took another , identical to the first : the hooded man , in his blanket poncho , barefoot atop his box , arms outstretched , wires trailing from his fingers .
Snap , snap — two seconds — and three minutes later Harman took a similar shot , but from a few steps back , so that Frederick appears in the foreground at the edge of the frame , studying on the display screen of his camera the picture he ’s just taken .
These were not the first photographs taken on the block that night , or the last .
That afternoon , when the night shift M.P.s reported for duty at the hard site , their platoon commander had called them to a meeting .
“ He said there was a prisoner who had died in the shower , and he died of a heart attack , ” Harman said .
The body had been left in the shower on Tier 1B , packed in ice , and shortly after the session with Gilligan somebody noticed water trickling out from under the shower door .
As Harman entered the shower room , she snapped a picture of a black rubber body bag lying along the far wall .
Then she and Graner , their hands sheathed in turquoise latex surgical gloves , unzipped the bag .
“ We just checked him out and took photos of him — kind of realized right away that there was no way he died of a heart attack because of all the cuts and blood coming out of his nose , ” she said , and she added , “ You do n’t think your commander ’s going to lie to you about something .
It made my trust go down , that ’s for sure .
Well , you ca n’t trust your commander now . ”
Translucent plastic ice bags covered the dead prisoner from the neck down , but his battered , bandaged face was exposed — mouth agape as if in mid-speech .
Harman , the aspiring forensic photographer , shot him from a variety of angles , zooming in and out , while Charles Graner swabbed the floor .
When he was done , he took a photograph of Harman posing with the corpse , bending low into the frame , flashing her Kodak smile , and giving the thumbs - up with one gloved hand ; and she used his camera to take a similar shot of him .
After about seven minutes in the shower room , she zipped the body bag shut , and they left .
“ I guess we were n’t really thinking , Hey , this guy has family , or , Hey , this guy was just murdered , ” Harman said .
“ It was just — Hey , it ’s a dead guy , it ’d be cool to get a photo next to a dead person .
I know it looks bad .
I mean , even when I look at them , I go , ‘ Oh Jesus , that does look pretty bad . ’
But when we were in that situation it was n’t as bad as it looks coming out on the media , I guess , because people have photos of all kinds of things .
Like , if a soldier sees somebody dead , normally they ’ll take photos of it . ”
Harman might more accurately have said that it ’s not unusual to take such pictures .
Soldiers have always swapped crazy war stories — whether to boast or confess , to moralize or titillate — and the uncritical response of other soldiers at Abu Ghraib to the photographs from the night shift on the M.I. block suggests that they were seen as belonging to this comradely tradition .
Javal Davis took no photographs there and he appeared in none , but he said , “ Everyone in theatre had a digital camera .
Everyone was taking pictures of everything , from detainees to death . ”
He said , “ That was nothing , like in Vietnam where guys were taking pictures of the dead guy with a cigarette in his mouth .
Like ,
Hey , Mom , look .
It sounds sick , but over there that was commonplace , it was nothing .
I mean , when you ’re surrounded by death and carnage and violence twenty - four hours a day , seven days a week , it absorbs you .
You walk down the street and you see a dead body on the road , whereas a couple months ago , you would have been like , ‘ Oh , my God , a dead body , ’ today you ’re like , ‘ Damn , he got messed up , let ’s go get something to eat . ’
You could watch someone running down the street burning on fire , as long as it ’s not an American soldier , it ’s ‘ Somebody needs to go put that guy out . ’ ”
The pictures of Harman and Graner with the corpse may have been taken as a gag — “ for personal use , ” as Frederick said of his photos of Gilligan — but they are starkly at odds with Harman ’s claim of a larger documentary purpose .
By contrast , her grisly , intimate portraits of the corpse convey her shock at discovering its wreckage ; and later that evening Harman returned to the shower with Frederick to examine the body more carefully .
This time , she looked beneath the ice bags and peeled back the bandages , and she stayed out of the pictures .
“ I just started taking photos of everything I saw that was wrong , every little bruise and cut , ” Harman said .
“ His knees were bruised , his thighs were bruised by his genitals .
He had restraint marks on his wrists .
You had to look close .
I mean , they did a really good job cleaning him up . ”
She said , “ The gauze on his eye was put there after he died to make it look like he had medical treatment , because he did n’t when he came into the prison . ”
She said , “ There were so many things around the bandage , like the blood coming out of his nose and his ears .
And his tooth was chipped — I did n’t know if that happened there or before — his lip was split open , and it looked like somebody had either butt - stocked him or really got him good or hit him against the wall .
It was a pretty good - sized gash .
I took a photo of that as well . ”
She said , “ I just wanted to document everything I saw .
That was the reason I took photos . ”
She said , “ It was to prove to pretty much anybody who looked at this guy , Hey , I was just lied to .
This guy did not die of a heart attack .
Look at all these other existing injuries that they tried to cover up . ”
ONE OF the perks of spending many years studying a quantitative subject : I have enough confidence with my intellect to admit , without embarrassment , I enjoy bad reality television .
I recently watched the reunion special of The Real Housewives of New York City .
This show chronicled the lives and exuberant consumption habits of five self - proclaimed New York socialites .
A high point of the reunion special featured four of the women chiding the fifth for keeping her home unfinished , and potentially dangerous to her young children , while spending thousands of dollars on designer clothes to fuel her social aspirations .
Economic theory predicts we consume for our own benefit rather than to impress others , so why would otherwise rational people make such a choice ?
Erik Hurst , Kerwin Charles , and Nick Roussanov found many people view their consumption as a signal to others .
Further , black and Hispanic Americans are more likely , after controlling for permanent income , to spend a greater share of their wealth on conspicuous forms of consumption such as automobiles , clothes , and jewellery .
To fund this spending , they often forgo more beneficial goods such as health care , education , and future consumption , i.e. saving .
They found the conspicuous consumption motive can explain as much as 50 % of the Black / white wealth gap , after controlling for income .
Why does this behaviour seem to be more common for racial and ethnic minorities ?
The authors believe it can be explained by income and social networks .
Ethnic and racial groups tend to socialise and live together in the US .
Humans compete with their peers for wealth and social status .
Wealth is unobservable so visible expensive goods acts as a signal you have achieved status to your peers .
White Americans , on average , have more income and Messrs Hurst , Charles , and Roussanov found visible spending is less common in richer communities .
That may be because , perversely , at a certain point conspicuous consumption becomes associated with being poor .
Or , Ray Fisman suggests , it may be because communities with higher levels of income may also experience greater income disparity .
The authors define a community as people of the same race living in the same state .
A poorer white person is more likely to find himself in richer community .
If he can not compete economically he may simply opt out of the game .
Some of the New York Housewives ( all are white ) have more money than the others , but they all have much more than I do .
So while they go to benefits in designer gowns to one up each other , I sit at home and watch them on television in Target sweatpants .
Minorities often live clustered together with similar socio-economic backgrounds ; this gives them a greater incentive to compete for wealth and status .
They become more likely to signal their success with visible consumption .
The impact of income on the level of visible consumption appears to persist across minority groups .
For example , richer Hispanic groups are less likely to use consumption as a signal than poor ones .
It seems because minority communities tend to be poorer , they end up devoting more of their resources to conspicuous consumption .
The richer your peers are , no matter your background , the less you spend on visible consumption .
Someone should tell the New York Housewives .

America came out of the Great Depression with a pretty effective financial safety net , based on a fundamental quid pro quo : the government stood ready to rescue banks if they got in trouble , but only on the condition that those banks accept regulation of the risks they were allowed to take .
Image Paul Krugman Credit ...
Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
Over time , however , many of the roles traditionally filled by regulated banks were taken over by unregulated institutions  the “ shadow banking system , ” which relied on complex financial arrangements to bypass those safety regulations .
Now , the shadow banking system is facing the 21st - century equivalent of the wave of bank runs that swept America in the early 1930s .
And the government is rushing in to help , with hundreds of billions from the Federal Reserve , and hundreds of billions more from government - sponsored institutions like Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks .
Given the risks to the economy if the financial system melts down , this rescue mission is justified .
But you do n’t have to be an economic radical , or even a vocal reformer like Representative Barney Frank , the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , to see that what ’s happening now is the quid without the quo .
Last week Robert Rubin , the former Treasury secretary , declared that Mr. Frank is right about the need for expanded regulation .
Mr. Rubin put it clearly :
If Wall Street companies can count on being rescued like banks , then they need to be regulated like banks .
But will that logic prevail politically ?
Not if Mr. McCain makes it to the White House .
His chief economic adviser is former Senator Phil Gramm , a fervent advocate of financial deregulation .
In fact , I ’d argue that aside from Alan Greenspan , nobody did as much as Mr. Gramm to make this crisis possible .
Both Democrats , by contrast , are running more or less populist campaigns .
But at least so far , neither Democrat has made a clear commitment to financial reform .

DIGG THIS
On Friday , Bear Stearns blew up .
It was the worst possible news at the worst possible time .
A day earlier , the politically - connected Carlyle Capital hedge fund defaulted on $ 16.6 billion of its debt .
Carlyle boasted a $ 21.7 billion portfolio of AAA - rated residential mortgage - backed securities , but was unable to make a margin call of just $ 400 million .
( Where did the $ 21.7 billion go ? )
The news on Bear was the last straw .
The stock market started reeling immediately ; shedding 300 points in less than an hour .
Then , miraculously , the tide shifted and the market began to rebound .
If there was ever a time for Paulson ’s Plunge Protection Team to come to the rescue ; this was it .
For weeks , the markets have been battered with bad news .
Retail sales are down , unemployment is up , consumer confidence is in the tank , inflation is rising , the dollar is on the ropes , and the credit crunch has spread to even the safest corners of the market .
Facing these fierce headwinds , Washington mandarins and financial heavyweights had to decide whether to sit back and let one small investment bank take down the whole equities market in an afternoon or stealthily buy a few futures and live to fight another day ?
Tough choice , eh ?
We ’ll never know for sure , but that ’s probably what happened .
We ’ll also never know if Bernanke ’s real purpose in setting up his new $ 200 billion auction facility was to provide the cash - strapped banks with a place where they could off - load the mortgage - backed junk that Carlyle dumped on the market when they went belly - up .
That worked out well , did n’t it ?
Now the banks can trade these worthless MBS bonds with the Fed for US Treasuries at nearly full value .
What a deal !
That must have been the plan from the get - go .
The Bear Stearns bailout has ignited a firestorm of controversy about moral hazard and whether the Fed should be in the business of spreading its largess to profligate investment banks .
But the Fed had no choice .
This is n’t about one bank caving in from its bad bets .
The entire financial system is teetering and a failure at Bear would have taken a wrecking ball to the equities market and sent stocks around the world into a violent death - spiral .
The New York Times summed it up like this in Saturday ’s edition :
" If the Fed had n’t acted this morning and Bear did default on its obligations , then that could have triggered a widespread panic and potentially a collapse of the financial system . "
Bingo .
So , what makes Bear so special ?
How is it that one of the smallest investment banks can pose such a threat to the whole system ?
That ’s the question that will be addressed in the next couple weeks and people are not going to like the answer .
For the last decade or so the markets have been reconfigured according to a new " structured finance " model which has transformed the interactions between institutions and investors .
The focus has been on maximizing profit by creating a vast galaxy of exotic debt - instruments which increase overall risk and volatility in slumping market conditions .
Derivatives trading which , according to the Bank of International Settlements , now exceeds $ 500 trillion , has sewn together the various lending and investment institutions in a way that one failure can set the derivatives dominoes in motion and bring down the entire financial scaffolding in a heap .
That ’s why the Fed got involved and ( I believe ) approached Congress in a closed - door session ( which was supposed to be about FISA legislation ) to inform lawmakers about the growing possibly of a major economic meltdown if conditions in the credit markets were not stabilized quickly .
The troubles at Bear and the danger they pose to the overall system were articulated in an article by Counterpunch co-editor , Alexander Cockburn in a November , 2006 article " Lame Duck : The Downside of Capitalism " :
" In a briefing paper under the chaste title , ‘ Private Equity : A discussion of Risk and Regulatory Engagement , ’ the FSA raises the alarm .
" Excessive leverage :
The amount of credit that lenders are willing to extend on private equity transactions has risen substantially .
This lending may not , in some circumstances , be entirely prudent .
Given current leverage levels and recent developments in the economic / credit cycle , the default of a large private equity backed company or a cluster of smaller private equity backed companies seems inevitable .
This has negative implications for lenders , purchasers of the debt , orderly markets and conceivably , in extreme circumstances , financial stability and elements of the UK economy . "
Translation :
It ’s about to blow !
" The duration and potential impact of any credit event may be exacerbated by operational issues which make it difficult to identify who ultimately owns the economic risk associated with a leveraged buy out and how these owners will react in a crisis .
These operational issues arise out of the extensive use of opaque , complex and time consuming risk transfer practices such as assignment and sub-participation , together with the increased use of credit derivatives .
These credit derivatives may not be confirmed in a timely manner and the amount traded may substantially exceed the amount of the underlying assets . "
Translation : " The world ’s credit system is a vast recycling bin of untraceable transactions of wildly inflated value . "
The problem is that the oversight and stability of the world credit system is no longer within the purview of familiar international institutions like the International Monetary Fund or the Bank of International Settlements .
Private traders are now installed at all the strategic nodes , gambling with stratospheric sums in such speculative pyramids as the credit derivative market which was almost nonexistent in 2001 , yet which reached $ 17.3 trillion by the end of 2005 .
Warren Buffett , America ’s most famous investor , has called credit derivatives " financial weapons of mass destruction . "
Cockburn ’s article anticipates the current problems at Bear and shows why the Fed cannot allow them to fester and spread throughout the system .
The investment banks and brokerages all do business with each other , taking sides in trades as counterparties .
If one player goes down it increases the likelihood of more failures .
So the problem has to be contained .
The volume of derivatives contracts , that are not traded publicly on any of the major exchanges , has exploded in the last few years .
These unregulated transactions , what Pimco ’s Bill Gross calls the shadow banking system , have taken center - stage as market conditions continue to deteriorate and the downward - cycle of deleveraging begins to accelerate .
The ongoing massacre in real estate has left the structured investment market frozen , which means that the foundation blocks ( i.e. , mortgage - backed securities ) upon which all this excessive leveraging rests ; is starting to crumble .
It ’s a real mess .
Derivatives trading , particularly in credit default swaps , is oftentimes exceeds the value of the underlying asset many times over .
Credit Default Swaps are financial instruments that are based on loans and bonds that speculate on a company ’s ability to repay debt ( a type of unregulated insurance ) .
The CDS market is roughly $ 45 trillion , whereas , the aggregate value of the US mortgage market is only $ 11 trillion ; four times smaller .
That ’s a lot of leverage and it can have a snowball effect when the CDS trades begin to unwind .
In truth , the biggest risk to the financial system is counterparty risk ; the possibility that some large investment bank , like Bear , goes under and sucks the rest of the market with it from the magnitude of its losses .
Last year , Bear was the 12th largest counterparty to CDS trades according to Fitch ratings .
If they were to suddenly disappear , the effects to the rest of the system would be catastrophic .
Fed Chairman
Bernanke sat on the board of the FOMC when the investment gurus and brokerage sharpies customized the markets in a way that enhanced their own personal fortunes while increasing the risks of systemic failure .
The SIVs , the conduits , the opaque derivatives , the off - balance sheets operations , the dark pools , the massive leverage , and the reckless expansion of credit ; all emerged during his ( and Greenspan ’s ) tenure .
The Federal Reserve has its own large share of responsibility for the brushfire it is presently trying to put out .
Now , in capitalism ’s extreme crisis Bernanke , acting beyond his mandate , invokes a law that has n’t been used since the 1960s so the Fed can become the creditor for an institution that attempted to enrich itself through wild speculative bets on dubious toxic investments which are now utterly worthless .

The Best of Mike Whitney
Atlanta bar owner Rufus Terrill has built an armor plated remote control robot to video tape and chase away drug dealers and other unsavory characters who are causing problems in the neighborhood .
Late at night several times a week , Terrill powers up the 4 - foot - tall , 300 pound device and reaches for a remote control packed with two joysticks and various knobs and switches .
Standing on a nearby corner , he maneuvers the machine down the block , often to a daycare center where it accosts what Terrill says are drug dealers , vagrants and others who should n't be there .
He flashes the robot's spotlight and grabs a walkie - talkie , which he uses to boom his disembodied voice over the robot 's sound system .
" I tell them they are trespassing , it 's private property , and they have to leave , " he said .
" They throw bottles and cans at it .
That 's when I shoot the water cannon .
They just scatter like roaches . "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Navy succeeded in its effort to shoot down an inoperable spy satellite before it could crash to Earth and potentially release a cloud of toxic gas , the Department of Defense said Wednesday .
A Delta II rocket lifts off , carrying a reconnaissance satellite that failed hours later .
The first opportunity for the Navy to shoot down the satellite came about 10:30 p.m. ET Wednesday .
The plan included firing a missile from the USS Lake Erie in the Pacific Ocean west of Hawaii to destroy the satellite .
" A network of land - , air - , sea- and space - based sensors confirms that the U.S. military intercepted a non-functioning National Reconnaissance Office satellite which was in its final orbits before entering the Earth 's atmosphere , " a Department of Defense statement said .
" At approximately 10:26 p.m. EST today , a U.S. Navy AEGIS warship , the USS Lake Erie , fired a single modified tactical Standard Missile - 3 , hitting the satellite approximately 247 kilometers ( 133 nautical miles ) over the Pacific Ocean as it traveled in space at more than 17,000 mph . "
It was unknown whether the missile hit its precise target -- the satellite 's full fuel tank .
The Department of Defense said it would n't know for certain for 24 hours whether the fuel tank had been hit .
However , several defense officials told The Associated Press the missile did apparently destroy the fuel tank .

" Debris will begin to re-enter the Earth 's atmosphere immediately , " the department said .
" Nearly all of the debris will burn up on re-entry within 24 - 48 hours and the remaining debris should re-enter within 40 days . "
However , even if the missile did n't score a direct hit , " any kind of hit provides a much better outcome than doing nothing at all , " Adm .
Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told reporters at Pearl Harbor , Hawaii .
The missile did n't carry a warhead , with authorities saying the impact was expected to be sufficient to destroy the fuel tank .
Navy gunners had just a 10 - second window to fire , and officials had said they might not be able to take their shot on the first opportunity .
Earlier Wednesday , officials had expressed concern about weather conditions , saying the launch could be delayed .
However , the 10 - second window would have occurred on each of the next nine or 10 days .
Watch Pentagon spokesman Jeff Morrell describe the launch window »
Officials had said the missile would not be fired until the space shuttle Atlantis landed , which it did Wednesday morning , to ensure the shuttle would not be struck by any debris from the destroyed satellite .
The attempt cost up to $ 60 million , according to estimates .
Without intervention , officials say , the satellite would have fallen to Earth on its own in early March .
However , since it malfunctioned immediately after it was launched in December 2006 , it had a full tank -- about 1,000 pounds -- of frozen , toxic hydrazine propellant .
Watch how the failing satellite failed to spark fears »
The fuel tank probably would have survived re-entry if the satellite had fallen to Earth on its own .
That could have dispersed harmful or even potentially deadly fumes over an area the size of two football fields .
Hydrazine is similar to chlorine or ammonia in that it affects the lungs and breathing tissue .
The Chinese military destroyed an aging weather satellite last year , prompting questions about whether the United States is merely flexing its muscle to show an economic and military rival that it can destroy satellites , too .
James Jeffrey , deputy national security adviser , denied that this week , saying , " This is all about trying to reduce the danger to human beings . "
But Beijing appears to have doubts .
" China is continuing to closely follow the possible harm caused by the U.S. action to outer space security and relevant countries , " Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said Thursday .
" China further requests that the United States ... promptly provide to the international community the necessary information ... so that relevant countries can take precautions . "
In 1989 , a U.S. fighter jet destroyed a U.S. satellite by firing a modified air - to - air missile into space from an altitude of 80,000 feet .
That adds to evidence that the U.S. acted Wednesday strictly to guard against the prospect of a potential disaster , said Gen. James Cartwright , vice chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff .
The military timed its shootdown attempt so that resulting debris would tumble into the atmosphere and not interfere with other satellites , said Christina Rocca , a U.S. diplomat and expert on disarmament .
Her comments were included in an online United Nations report on this month 's Conference on Disarmament in Geneva , Switzerland .
See dangers and possible solutions to satellite problem »
The military also timed its efforts to minimize the chances that debris would hit populated areas .
But the United States is " prepared to offer assistance to governments to mitigate the consequences of any satellite debris impacts on their territory , " according to a report of Rocca 's remarks on the Web site of the Geneva office of the U.N .
One Pentagon official said that since early January , a team including 200 industry experts and scientists had worked furiously to modify the Aegis air - defense missile system so it could shoot down the satellite .
Among the team 's challenges was modifying the sensors designed to detect the heat from an incoming warhead , as the satellite will be much cooler .
The missile was to release a " kinetic kill vehicle , " enabling it to " see " the satellite and adjust its course toward it if necessary , officials said .
In January 2007 , China used a land - based missile to destroy a 2,200 - pound satellite that was orbiting 528 miles above the Earth .
The impact left more than 100,000 pieces of debris orbiting the planet , NASA estimated -- 2,600 of them more than 4 inches across .
The U.S. agency called the breakup of the Fengyun - C satellite the worst in history .

All About U.S. Navy
You can be anything you want .
All you have to do is go out and write about it .
A man walking through Tom Lee Park pauses to snap a photo of the iconic Hernando DeSoto Bridge .
Another man shoots pictures of numerous downtown buildings .
Many would assume the men are tourists taking in the city 's sights , but law enforcement officials say they could be terrorists staking out possible targets .
The scenarios were described at an anti-terrorism town hall meeting last week hosted by the Shelby County Sheriff 's Office .
The meeting , held at Cordova 's First Assembly of God Church , was one of four public meetings that occurred in conjunction with Operation Sudden Impact , a new local anti-terrorism initiative .
" You may think a guy is just shooting pictures , but if you report it to us , we 'll send it on to the FBI and they may have four or five other reports of the same thing , " said Richard Pillsbury with the Tennessee Fusion Center , a collaboration between the Department of Safety and the Department of Homeland Security .
Shelby County sergeant Larry Allen warned attendees at the meeting to look for people who appear to be doing surveillance outside public buildings , such as shopping malls .
" One of the things discussed in the al - Qaeda manual is conducting surveillance of your target , " added Eric Jackson with the FBI 's Joint Terrorism Task Force .
" That could mean looking at a building to see how security is established . "
Allen also warned that possible terror suspects often set off business alarms to test security systems .
Sheriff Mark Luttrell said citizens should report suspicious vehicles spotted in their neighborhoods .
" We 're not talking about snooping or profiling , " Luttrell said .
" The best thing the average citizen can do is to be on the lookout .
Report situations to us and let us sift through them . "
Allen said environmental groups and animal rights groups may harbor terrorists , but Jackson said the FBI will not infringe on those groups '
First Amendment right to free speech .
" We will never do anything to interfere with anyone 's First Amendment rights , " Jackson said .
" But we do ask people to be on the lookout for that individual who comes into the group and talks a little bit radical . "
Operation Sudden Impact is an alliance between the sheriff 's office and 54 regional law enforcement agencies to fight terrorism .
Public affairs officer Steve Shular said the collaboration will allow better information sharing between agencies in case of a major emergency or terrorist attack .
In the next few weeks , Operation Sudden Impact will bring representatives from all 54 agencies to Memphis for a one - day saturation exercise .
Officers will perform traffic stops and gang interdictions and serve arrest warrants .
" Every arrest ticket written in 24 hours by each of those agencies will be reviewed to see if any of those people , even those with minor traffic charges , might have any connection to any possible terrorist activity lurking in the region , " Shular said .
In the meantime , officials are asking the public to report any suspicious activity to the sheriff 's office .
" We may get information that does n't pan out to be true at all , " Shular said .
" But that one bit of information that someone calls in could make all the difference . "
Intelligent design ( ID ) , according to the Discovery Institute , is defined as follows :
“ Intelligent design holds that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause , not an undirected process such as natural selection . ”
The primary scientific criticism of ID is that it is not a legitimate scientific theory , but rather a transparent attempt at recasting religious faith ( creationism ) in scientific - sounding jargon .
But ID lacks the minimal criteria to be considered science .
ID proponents , of course , reject this argument because the entire purpose of ID is to masquerade creationism as a scientific theory .
Much of the discussion on this question focuses on the specific point of whether or not ID can be falsified – can it theoretically be proven false by scientific evidence .
ID proponents say yes , scientists generally say no .
While I agree that the answer is mostly no , the more precise answer is that it depends – it depends on exactly how ID is being formulated and practiced .
I contend that in practice , ID proponents have rendered ID unfalsifiable while playing with semantics in order to pretend that it can be falsified .
In the most recent blog entry of the Discovery Institute , Jonathan Wells responds to Francis Collins on this very issue .
Wells writes :
More surprising is the fact that Collins is here citing experimental evidence against a theory he maintains is unscientific because it is not open to experimental testing .
In claiming that evidence from gene duplication disproves ID , Collins is demonstrating that ID can be tested with scientific evidence .
Either ID is unscientific , in which case evidence is irrelevant ; or evidence can be cited against it , in which case ID is scientific .
Collins can’t have it both ways .
It is actually Wells who is trying to have it both ways – citing evidence against ID to demonstrate that it is falsifiable without acknowledging that it has been falsified .
This is the game that they play .
Pretending ID can be falsified , but then always keeping just out of reach of scientific evidence so that in practice it can never be falsified .
There are actually several problems with ID that render it unscientific .
Asking the Wrong Question
As the definition given above indicates , ID is based upon a false dichotomy – that design in nature is necessarily intelligent and that evolution is an “ undirected process ” incapable of producing design .
ID proponents have carefully crafted their premise – design = intelligence , evolution = random .
Then all they have to do is show the appearance of design in nature and claim that ID is verified .
The fatal flaw in this strategy is that evolution is capable or producing design also , and it is not a random process .
Natural selection is the non-random survival of organisms based upon their inherited traits .
Mutation and variation is random , and the long - term path of evolutionary change is best described as chaos , but natural selection allows for the non-random accumulation of favorable changes .
So the ID proponents are asking the wrong question – always a fatal problem in science .
The question is not whether or not there is design in nature , but what is the nature of that design .
Evolution is a bottom - up process whereby design and complexity emerge out of blind but non-random processes .
“ Intelligent ” design , by contrast , is a top down process where the final result is known ahead of time by the designer and is achieved with purpose .
There are many analogies we can draw to illuminate this difference .
For example , a city that grew over decades without any central planning , but based upon the decisions and actions of individuals acting in their own interest is like an evolved city .
An ID city , however , is one planned and mapped out ahead of time , by a committee , corporation , or some other body .
In the evolved city there will still be design – streets and utilities will follow residences and business , for example .
Shops will tend to pop up and survive to meet the demand .
But it will be messy , with lots of redundancy , with abandoned buildings where neighborhoods collapsed or business failed .
Streets would likely not be optimally arranged .
A planned city , however , would look vastly different – more clean , purposeful , and direct .
The streets would be laid out in a deliberate way – one that could not have emerged spontaneously with use .
The difference between evolved and top - down designed life would be even more stark .
Buildings and entire city sections can be torn down and rebuilt – so some top - down design can always be imposed later .
But biological systems are far more constrained .
Bottom - up evolutionary systems can only work with the raw material at hand .
They cannot start from scratch , develop new organs or limbs wholesale from nothing , or completely eliminate unneeded bits of anatomy .
If we ask the correct question – does life display bottom - up or top - down design , the answer is obvious to anyone with sufficient knowledge of biology and an unbiased mind .
Life is overwhelmed by bottom - up design , from the vestigial eyes of cave salamanders to the bits of viral DNA junking up our genome .
But none of this can falsify ID because they are asking the wrong question .
Common Descent
It is important to recognize in any such discussion that evolutionary theory actually has multiple components – the fact that life ’s diversity arose through evolutionary branching descent over time , the specific mechanism (s ) of evolution , and the particular pathway of evolution taken by specific branches of the tree of life .
One important line of evidence for the first claim of evolution – that life arose through branching descent – are the many biological similarities among various species that not only demonstrate common descent , but a branching pattern of descent predicted by evolution .
In the quote above Collins is referring to evidence from gene duplication – that over time one gene can become duplicated as a mistake of replication .
Descendants will therefore have two copies of a gene instead of one .
The duplicate copy is therefore free to change over time through mutations , essentially free to experiment with variations of function , because the original gene copy is able to carry out the original function of the gene .
The duplicate gene may therefore hit upon a new function that helps the original gene carry out its purpose , or perhaps it may become co-opted for an entirely different purpose .
Biologists can examine the sequence of base pairs in genes to map our their relationships with other genes , and in that way can build a detailed map of which genes evolved from which other genes .
What we find when we compare such maps among species is that they fit into a nice pattern of branching common descent .
There are multiple other independent lines of evidence that also demonstrate not only branching descent , but a reasonable overlap – the different lines of evidence generally agree about which species evolved into what when .
These lines of evidence could have completely falsified evolution .
It is possible , for example , that we could have found patterns of gene variation that were incompatible with the theory of common descent .
If we bring this back to the question of whether or not ID is falsifiable we have to ask – is there a pattern of gene variation we could have found that could potentially falsify ID ?
The answer , apparently , is no .
At least I am not aware of any ID proponent making such a prediction that was open to falsification .
But this is also where we get into the “ it depends ” answer .
As I stated above , evolution have various components , only one of which is common descent .
Some ID proponents , like Michael Behe , actually accept the fact of common descent .
They think that life did change over time through branching descent .
They just do n’t think this process was due to natural selection acting on variation .
They think it was guided top - down by an intelligent designer .
So evidence of common descent is not evidence against this form of ID .
What about those who do not accept common descent ?
Those who , like young earth creationists , think that life was created more complete , that the “ designer ” did not spend millions of years making slow changes over time , but poofed life into existence pretty - much as it is .
Evidence for common descent does falsify such claims .
Or does it ?
In theory , yes it does .
And those like Wells are now using this to argue that ID is science because it can be falsified .
But in practice , it does not , because ID proponents and creationists who reject common descent make the argument that the intelligent designer could have chosen , for their own unfathomable reasons , to make life so that it has the appearance of branching descent .
The “ God can make life to look like whatever he wants ” defense renders the beliefs of anyone who makes it unfalsifiable .
So either way this line of argument does not make ID falsifiable science .
Irreducible Complexity
This is the primary line of argument for the falsifiability of ID – that we can look for design in biological nature by looking for structures and biochemical pathways that are irreducibly complex , meaning that they could not function if they were any simpler .
This argument also has many flaws .
The biggest problem is that , once again , this argument is based upon a false premise – but one that was chose to achieve the desired result .
The premise is that if a structure could not function for its current purpose if it were any simpler – if any complexity were removed – then such a structure could not have evolved because it could not have passed through simpler forms to get to its irreducibly complex state , because evolution requires that in order to be selected for a structure would have to provide an adaptive advantage every step of the way .
This superficially sounds reasonable , but it has been shown to be a false premise and yet the ID crowd will not abandon it .
Specifically , the premise ignores the possibility that an irreducibly complex structure could have evolved from a simpler structure that served a different purpose .
So , for example , the bacterial flagellum could have evolved from a simpler tube that could not move but was used to inject substances into another cell .
This simple syringe could have been an evolutionary stepping stone to the more complex flagellum – and in fact evidence now supports this hypothesis .
In practice the notion of irreducible complexity contains two strategies – the first is to argue that a biological entity could not be simpler even in theory .
But as discussed above this strategy is based upon a false premise and is therefore not valid .
So ID proponents fall back to their second strategy – arguing that evolutionists have not fleshed out the actual evolutionary history of an apparently irreducibly complex structure or pathway .
But this second strategy is nothing more than an argument from ignorance .
It relies upon our current knowledge and assume that currently unknown equals unknowable , and further than unknowable means impossible – impossible for evolution , therefore we need to invoke an intelligent designer .
An argument from ignorance – basing a conclusion on what is not known – is always a weak argument , because it does not require any positive evidence for a theory , it ’s just knocking down a competing theory .
Also , what has happened since Behe made his initial claims for irreducible complexity is that scientific progress has continued , and many of the holes in current knowledge that Behe relied upon have been filled in , like the bacterial flagellum example above .
What implications does this have for the question of whether or not ID is falsifiable ?
Well , it establishes that specific claims used to support ID are falsifiable .
We have now falsified the claim that the bacterial flagellum has no simpler evolutionary antecedents .
Wells and others use this to say that ID is therefore falsifiable .
But once again , in practice it is n’t , as is evidenced by the very fact that Wells , Behe and others have not abandoned ID because the flagellum argument was proven wrong .
This is because when one argument falls , they simply migrate to another .
They even state that in order to falsify ID evolutionary scientists would have to flesh out the complete evolutionary history of every biological component .
This , of course , is an impossible and absurd standard .
What they are admitting , without meaning to , is that ID is ultimately a “ god of the gaps ” belief , and the only way to falsify it is to close every single last gap .
The False Dichotomy
The notion of ID falsifiability also has a deeper logical problem – that ID is defined entirely but what it is n’t – namely evolution .
ID is based upon the claim that evolution cannot explain life .
This is a false claim , as I have pointed out above , but even if true it would not be evidence for ID .
So ID proponents spend their time trying unsuccessfully to poke holes in evolutionary theory , or pointing out the current gaps in our knowledge ( while ignoring the fact that this is a rapidly moving target ) , all the time pretending that is somehow evidence for ID , when it is n’t .
I already discussed that their strategy is to equate all design with intelligent design , ignoring the fact that natural selection acting upon random mutation is a cumulative process capable of generating bottom - up design .
The real question is whether or not the design we see in biology looks top - down intelligently designed or bottom - up evolutionarily designed .
If ID proponents had an actual theory they should be able to say something about the features of intelligently designed life ( predict what we should find ) – and these features can be looked for to see if their design predictions pan out .
So far they have not been able to do this .
Their answer to this is irreducible complexity , but as I explained this does n’t cut it .
What they will not do is make any statements about the intelligent designer .
What marks would such an intelligence leave upon creation ?
No one appears to know .
When pressed they often play the “ it ’s a mystery ” card .
How can we possibly fathom the intelligence necessary to design and create life ?
Evolution does make many specific predictions about what evolved life should look like – predictions that have been validated .
Evolution ’s successful positive predictions are a problem for ID , but they deal with them the same way , by essentially arguing that the designer could have arbitrarily and inexplicably decided to make life look as if it evolved .
Conclusion
While there are many complexities to the question , complexities exploited by ID proponents to create confusion , the answer to the question asked in the title of this entry is that ID is not falsifiable – at least not how it is promoted by ID proponents .
The challenge that remains open for the ID community is to state a specific prediction about what positive evidence should be present if life were top - down intelligently designed .
They can not do this .
Their predictions are all negative – what evolutionary theory wo n’t be able to do .
And worse their negative predictions are all constantly changing in order to keep one step ahead of the advance of evolutionary science ( making ID functionally a god - of - the - gaps argument ) .
Perhaps the Discovery Institute ( if they were overcome by an uncharacteristic spasm of intellectual honesty ) should change the definition of ID to :
Do you know how to find all the hidden fees in your 401 ( k ) plan ?
Did you know your boss might be getting a kickback from those fees ?
This is how it works :
More than half of all 401 ( k ) plans offered through employers are charging participants excessive fees , which are sometimes as high as ten to twenty times the actual cost of administrating the plans .
90 % of the time , these 401 ( k ) plans will return a portion of these fees through a scheme called " revenue sharing " -- which is basically a " kickback " to your 401 ( k ) plan administrator .
While many times these kickbacks are pocketed by the 401 ( k ) administrators , at other times , these kickbacks are so large that they actually get credited back to each employee 's 401 ( k ) accounts .
So , you 're getting a refund from the excessive fees you were paying .
Good news right ?
Not quite .
According to David Loeper , author of Stop the 401(k ) Rip - off :
The problem here is they are not usually credited back in proportion to what you paid , normally they are credited back to participant accounts based on account balance .
The net result here is if your CEO with a large balance uses an index fund with no kickbacks for his 401k , and other participants use expensive funds , they are in essence making a contribution to their CEO 's 401 k because his higher account balance gets the brunt of the revenue share " kickback . " read more
Is this happening to me ?
According to Loeper , if the company you work for has less than 1,000 employees , the odds are high that you are paying excessive fees on your 401 ( k ) plan .
Why should I care ?
Because increasing 401 ( k ) fees by just 1 % can result in you having 17 % less money when you retire .
As the Consumerist explains :
Put $ 20,000 in a 401 ( k ) for 20 years and you end up with $ 58,000 if the fees are 1.5 % .
But if they were .5 % , you would have $ 70,500 .
That 's a lot of money .
Increase the time to 35 years and what would be $ 220,000 drops to $ 163,000 ....
How is this possible ?
Well we all know how great compounding interest is , right ?
This is the same thing in reverse , the costs are compounding .
Quietly .
Rapaciously .
If your boss is getting a kickback from those fees , do you think he will work diligently to help you find a 401 ( k ) with reasonable fees ?
What can I do ?
For the next two weeks , author David B. Loeper will be answering your 401 ( k ) questions in our forum .
He is an expert at identifying hidden fees in 401 ( k ) accounts .
If you have any questions about your 401 ( k ) , here 's a great time to get some free expert advice from a top expert .
Just days after settling a lawsuit in which it was charged with misrepresenting the quality of its notebook screens , Apple Inc. has been hit with a second class - action suit rife with similar allegations over one of its iMac displays .
According to the new suit , filed in a San Jose court Monday by Kabateck Brown Kellner , LLP , Apple is deceiving consumers by concealing that its new 20 - inch iMac monitors are inferior to the previous generationâs and those of the new 24 - inch iMac .
Specifically , the firm takes issue with a marketing claim from the Mac maker that both the 20 - inch and 24 - inch iMac are capable of displaying âmillions of colors at all resolutions . "
While this claim holds true for the current 24 - inch model and previous generation 20 - inch model — both of which display 16,777,216 colors on 8 - bit , in - plane switching ( IPS ) screens — the new 20 - inch iMac display is said to be capable of 98 percent fewer colors ( 262,144 ) .
" Apple is duping its customers into thinking theyâre buying ' new and improved ' when in fact theyâre getting stuck with ' new and inferior , ' " Brian Kabateck , Managing Partner of KBK , said in a statement .
Â " Beneath Appleâs ' good guy ' image is a corporation that takes advantage of its customers .
Our goal is to help those customers who were deceived and make sure Apple tells the truth in the future . "
While Apple describes the display of both the 24 - inch and 20 - inch iMacs as though they were interchangeable , KBK asserts that the monitors in each of the desktop systems are of radically different technology .
The new 20 - inch iMac features a 6 - bit twisted nematic film ( TN ) LCD screen , which the firm claims is the " least expensive of its type , " sporting a narrower viewing angle than the display of the 24 - inch model , less color depth , less color accuracy and greater susceptibility to washout .
Apple on its website says : " No matter what you like to do on your computer â watch movies , edit photos , play games , even just view a screen saver â itâs going to look stunning on an iMac . "
However , KBK argues that the inferior technology in the 20 - inch iMac is " particularly ill - suited [ for ] editing photographs " due to its limited color potential and the distorting effect of its color simulation processes .
" Apple is squeezing more profits for itself by using cheap screens and its customers are unwittingly paying the price , " Kabateck said .
Apple last week agreed to a settlement in a similar class - action lawsuit brought on by two professional photographers , which charged that the company 's Intel - based notebooks were only suited to display the " illusion of millions of colors through the use of a software technique referred to as ' dithering , ' which causes nearby pixels on the display to use slightly varying shades of colors that trick the human eye into perceiving the desired color even though it is not truly that color .

An Iranian lesbian who fled to Britain after her girlfriend was arrested and sentenced to death faces being forcibly returned after losing the latest round in her battle to be granted asylum .
The case of Pegah Emambakhsh , 40 , comes a day after The Independent reported on the growing public outcry over the plight of a gay Iranian teenager who fears he will be executed if he is deported to Iran .
Both cases have provoked international protests against Britain and led to calls for an immediate moratorium on the deportation of gay and lesbian asylum - seekers who fear they will be persecuted in Iran .

More than 60 MEPs have signed a petition asking Gordon Brown to reverse the decision on Mehdi Kazemi , 19 , who escaped to the Netherlands after the Home Office refused him asylum last year .
His case is still before Dutch judges who will decide this month whether he should return to Britain where he faces deportation to a country which has already executed his boyfriend .
Gay rights group claim there are dozens more cases of gay and lesbian asylum - seekers living in Britain in fear of persecution and facing harsh punishments if forced to return to Iran .
Ms Emambakhsh came to the UK in 2005 fearing for her life after her partner had been arrested by Tehran police .
Iranian gay rights groups have reported that that partner is in custody under sentence of death by stoning .
Speaking through her asylum representative in Sheffield yesterday , Ms Emambakhsh said : " I will never , never go back .
If I do I know I will die . "
Under the Iranian Islamic Punishment Act , lesbians found guilty of sexual relations can be sentenced to 100 lashes .
But , for a third offence , the punishment is execution .
Ms Emambakhsh narrowly avoided deportation in August last year but only after her local MP , Richard Caborn , and other parliamentarians persuaded the Government to allow her to stay while further legal avenues of appeal were explored .
She says she was already on the way to Heathrow when she learnt of her last - minute reprieve .
But last month the Court of Appeal turned down her application for permission for a full hearing .
Ms Emambakhsh said yesterday that she was " very disappointed " by the ruling but planned to apply for a judicialreview at the High Court .
The Home Office has also agreed to consider fresh legal representations on her behalf .
The Liberal Democrat MEP Baroness Ludford has written to the Home Secretary to request her urgently to review the case of Mehdi Kazemi .
Lady Ludford , the party 's European justice spokesperson and a member of the European Parliament 's Gay and Lesbian Rights Intergroup , said : " Jacqui Smith must recognise and act on the real threat of persecution and even execution which Mr Kazemi would face if he was to be deported to Iran . "
Mehdi Kazemi , 19 , came to London to study English in 2004 but later discovered that his boyfriend had been arrested by the Iranian police , charged with sodomy and hanged .
In a phone conversation with his father in Tehran , Mr Kazemi was told that , before the execution in April 2006 , his boyfriend had been questioned about sexual relations he had with other men and under interrogation had named Mr Kazemi .
Fearing for his own life if he returned to Iran , Mr Kazemi claimed asylum in Britain .
Late last year , his claim was refused .
Terror - stricken at the prospect of being deported , he made a desperate attempt to evade deportation by fleeing to the Netherlands where he is being detained amid a growing outcry from campaigners .
In turning down Ms Emambakhsh and Mr Kazemi 's asylum applications , the Home Office has said that , provided Iranians are discreet about their homosexuality , they will not be persecuted .
But Omar Kuddus , of Gay Asylum UK , demanded that Britain follow the example of the Netherlands and Germany in imposing a moratorium on all deportations involving gay and lesbian Iranians .
He asked : " How many more young Iranians have to die before the British Government takes action ? "
The chief executive of the Border and Immigration Agency , Lin Homer , said : " Our country guidance for such cases is published and is considered as amongst the best in the world .
We have expert case workers who make decisions on such cases and there are further avenues through the courts .
When and if a court decides that we should look at a case again we will do that . "
As climate change warms the nation , giant Burmese pythons could colonize one - third of the USA , from San Francisco across the Southwest , Texas and the South and up north along the Virginia coast , according to U.S. Geological Survey maps released Wednesday .
The pythons can be 20 feet long and 250 pounds .
They are highly adaptable to new environments .
Two federal agencies — the USGS and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service — are investigating the range of nine invasive snakes in Florida , concerned about the danger they now pose to endangered species .
The agencies are collecting data to aid in the control of these populations .
They examined Burmese pythons first and , based on where they live in Asia , estimated where they might live here .
One map shows where the pythons could live today , an area that expands when scientists use global warming models for 2100 .
" We were surprised by the map .
It was bigger than we thought it was going to be , " says Gordon Rodda , zoologist and lead project researcher .
" They are moving northward , there 's no question . "
Burmese pythons were introduced to the USA as part of the pet trade .
The first specimens in the wild were discovered in the mid-1990s in the Florida Everglades , released by owners who no longer wanted them , says Skip Snow , a wildlife biologist with the National Parks Service in the Everglades .
By 2003 , there was evidence the snakes had established breeding colonies in the wild .
Florida began regulating their sale and ownership Jan. 1 .
If federal officials had to worry only about Florida , it would be " decades " before the pythons move into other states , Rodda says .
But people keep dumping pythons they do n't want into the wild .
" We just learned about some that had been released in Arkansas , " he says .
The Burmese python is not poisonous and not considered a danger to humans .
Attacks on humans have involved pet owners who mishandle and misfeed the snakes , Snow says .
In Florida , they eat bobcats , deer , alligators , raccoons , cats , rats , rabbits , muskrats , possum , mice , ducks , egrets , herons and song birds .
They grab with their mouth to anchor the prey , then coil around the animal and crush it to death before eating it whole .
If you see one , do n't attempt to engage it .
Leave the area , note the location and notify the authorities .

Lies , Damn Lies , and CPI Adam Hamilton June 16 , 2000 3013 Words Benjamin Disraeli , the prime minister of the British Empire from 1874 - 1880 , was reported by Mark Twain to have uttered this brilliant quote on statistical analysis :
“ There are three kinds of lies : lies , damn lies , and statistics . ”
Anyone who has worked with numbers knows they will confess to anything if one tortures them long enough .
Outside of the furious action in the gold market this week , the release of the Consumer Price Index on Wednesday was a notable event .
The numbers reported were benign , and the eternal equity bulls heralded the report as an excuse to genuflect before the alter of 100 +
P/ Es and perpetual prosperity and wealth for all .
Although the market appears to believe the CPI is an acceptable indicator of inflation , it is becoming increasingly clear that more and more economists are questioning the veracity of the numbers reported by the BLS .
For May , the Bureau of Labor Statistics , a group of not so covert operatives buried deep within the bowels of the Department of Labor , reported that US consumer prices rose a mere 1/10th of a percent after flatlining in April .
The “ core ” CPI rate rose only 2/10th of a percent .
The core CPI rate is defined as the CPI less food and energy costs .
Each time some news organization mentions the core rate , I have to shake my head slowly back and forth in awe .
Now what good is a CONSUMER inflation indicator without food and energy ?
I guess I am a prima donna , as I have always lived under the assumption that without food and energy , I am dead .
As someone who eats several times a day , needs to drive , and enjoys sleeping in a climate controlled environment , I find it odd that increases in food and energy prices are not relevant enough to inflation to be considered “ core ” .
It is great to know the BLS feels non-essentials like food and energy can be divorced from the core inflation rate , as maybe one wo n’t starve to death without food , and wo n’t freeze to death without energy .
( Interestingly enough , Alan Greenspan in a Tuesday speech accused those who question the Labor Departments statistics as being “ cynics ” . )
Enough of the cynical “ core CPI ” rant , and back to the CPI …
Enter cognitive dissonance , which results from hearing information about reality that directly conflicts with our observations of the same reality .
Here is a quote from a newswire about the May CPI on Wednesday , “ US consumer prices rose less than expected in May as cheaper gasoline and clothing limited the effect of the biggest rise in food costs in more than 18 months … ”
Cheaper gasoline in May ?
Hmmm …
This assertion is easy enough to test .
On May 1 , the wholesale price for unleaded gasoline was 81 cents per gallon .
On May 31 , a gallon of wholesale unleaded cost 98 cents , yielding a blistering 21 % monthly increase !
( Annualized , this is over 250 % ! )
This week , unleaded gasoline traded at record levels of $ 1.08 per gallon .
Granted , the CPI is a backward looking report and is not focused on wholesale numbers , but if “ lower gasoline prices ” fueled the benign number , should the stock market look at the data as anti-inflationary given the HUGE rise in the wholesale gasoline price in May ?
In addition to the rise in gas prices in May , the Journal of Commerce price index increased 4 % , the CRB commodity index rose 5 % , the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index ( GSCI ) jumped 11 % , and crude oil surged 14 % .
Benign inflation ?
The increase in the price of oil is particularly important .
Oil is the most important everyday commodity in the industrialized world .
Every good we consume is transported via vehicles powered by various oil distillates .
Some of the electricity we use is generated by oil powered burners .
Oil , in a very real sense , is the lifeblood of our geographically dispersed and highly specialized economy .
How has oil affected the CPI historically ?
Oil has had a rather dramatic impact on the CPI in the past .
In the 1970 ’s the slope of the CPI line increased dramatically .
Unfortunately , when the oil price restabilized , the CPI continued its uptrend in steep annual increases .
The BLS even fragmented the CPI , and created two new measures , the CPI sans energy and an energy - only component CPI .
The blue line in the graph above represents the plain vanilla CPI .
The yellow line represents the CPI with energy excluded , and the green line represents the CPI energy components .
The CPI Energy closely tracks the price of oil , as seen above , but oscillates at a lesser magnitude than raw crude .
Since the mid 1980s , amazingly enough , the “ no energy ” line has been climbing faster than the general CPI , indicating energy has had a net NEGATIVE influence on inflation recently .
With oil not explaining the incredible upward trend in the CPI since the 1970s , where else can we turn for an explanation of the CPI ?
First , a look at the methodology of the calculations is in order .
The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses a funky statistical technique coined “ hedonic regression . ”
Daniel Webster ’s namesake dictionary defines hedonic as “ characterizing or pertaining to pleasure . ”
“ Hedonic Calculus ” is described as the “ appraisal of possible alternative choices in terms of the amount of pleasure to be gained and pain to be avoided in each . ”
Basically , the BLS uses hedonic regression to try and quantify gains of quality in a particular good in order to offset gains in price .
For instance , if a computer operated at 50 mhz seven years ago , and 1000 mhz today , the BLS would claim the price of the computer today reflects much higher quality , so the price must be adjusted downwards dramatically to account for quality .
And how is quality measured ?
The BLS website ( http://www.bls.gov/) has many essays that are dozens of pages in length on hedonic theory as applied to different items .
A quick keyword search of “ hedonic ” on the site yielded over seventy documents .
I chained myself to a chair , sat on my hands , taped my eyelids up , and forced myself to read several of these lengthy and detailed studies on quality adjustments of the critical US consumer staples of VCRs and camcorders .
The studies were carefully documented and explained why actual prices of VCRs and camcorders should not be used in CPI calculations , but downward “ quality - adjusted ” prices should be used instead .
The net result of all the hedonic information I looked at was to understate prices , sometimes dramatically .
By using the mathematical equivalent of tea leaves and goat bones , the BLS statisticians have created a surreal new reality where the “ true quality adjusted ” price of different goods may be “ computed . ”
This practice creates a huge disconnect with reality .
The only real place to get good price information is in a free , unmanipulated market , which provides a price based on the current best expectations of millions of independent participants .
By taking free market test data and obscuring it with arcane mathematics , the real price increases are filtered out .
The BLS has also reported having a practice of weighting CPI components that are dropping in price more heavily than components that are rising in price .
They justify this practice by claiming consumers will substitute lower priced goods for higher priced goods when the prices of the more expensive goods are rising .
The hedonics mumbo- jumbo coupled with calculations designed to overweight items dropping in price yields highly suspect understated inflation numbers .
If unleaded gasoline goes up in price , what does the American consumer substitute for the gas their automobiles need to function ?
Hydrogen ?
Hamsters under the hood ?
If general food prices increase , what does one eat instead of food ?
The increased weighting of negative price movements of critical consumer items is indefensible logically .
On the hedonic quality adjustments , does surfing the web and sending e-mail give one more pleasure on a liquid cooled fire - breathing 1000 mhz Pentium 3 then on a dusty , decrepit 486 ?
For the vast majority of consumers , increases in “ quality ” of luxury items like computers and camcorders is not very relevant .
For them , the critical issues are inflation in the prices of essential items they must purchase every week for their family , including fuel , food , utilities , and other indispensable staples for living .
Speaking of indispensable staples , it is easy to test the government inflation numbers .
All you have to do is go back and look at all of your family ’s bills , including food , fuel , rent or mortgage , entertainment , etc. for May 1999 .
The year over year CPI claimed an increase of general price levels of only 3.1 % .
Were your expenses this year 3.1 % greater than last year ’s ?
Take a look at your financial reality and see if you believe the BS ( er , BLS I mean , Freudian slip ) …
So why is the BLS playing games with the numbers ?
The best case scenario is they are simply so deep in their research of analyzing tree bark thickness that they are missing the macro changes in the forest that surrounds them .
Worst case , they are willingly helping or else being intimidated into complying with a scheme to keep the American people and the stock market ignorant of the devastating effects of inflation in our economy .
The particularly cynical should note that this is an election year , and a large increase in inflation or a large drop in the overpriced US equity markets could have profound implications for the contest in November .
There are many massive financial incentives for the US government to attempt to under report inflation in the economy .
High inflation causes payments to millions of government pensioners , social security recipients , and veterans to automatically increase due to cost of living adjustments .
Each incremental 1/10 % of reported inflation results in very large increases in the costs of the many social safety nets the government has woven since the days of Franklin Roosevelt .
Increases in the costs of social programs will wipe out the claims of a “ budget surplus ” we have heard so much about .
In addition , high inflation makes the US dollar less attractive as an investment opportunity for foreigners .
Running a trade deficit requiring over $ 1b a day in foreign financing , the US desperately needs to ensure inflation does n’t repel these foreign financiers .
If inflation trends upwards , the Fed will be forced to raise interest rates to keep the real return of the dollar at acceptable levels .
But , in a perverse flight of irony , if interest rates are raised further the vastly overvalued US equity markets could collapse .
Further inflation leading to interest rate hikes terrifies US policymakers .
Finally , increases in inflation will lead to a higher price of gold , the arch - nemesis and mortal enemy of the dollar .
The Austrian school of thought on economics , maintaining a laissez faire pro-free market and pro-capitalism perspective , defines inflation as simply an increase in the money supply .
When the money supply increases faster than the supply of goods and services money purchases , inflation is the result .
The reason prices rise ultimately is because relatively more money is chasing relatively fewer goods and services , resulting in general price levels rising .
Even anti-free market and pro-socialism economist John Maynard Keynes recognized the true causes of inflation .
He said , “ Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the Capitalistic System was to debauch the currency .
. .
Lenin was certainly right .
There is no subtler , no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency .
The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction , and does it in a manner which not one man in a million can diagnose . "
In historic times , before the reign of fiat currencies buttressed only by confidence and assigned value only by faith , gold and silver reigned as supreme monetary assets .
Since the gold and silver supply grow very little annually , they make good monetary instruments that can’t easily be inflated .
Without paper to inflate , currencies were debased by shaving coins ( lowering the weight ) , mixing precious metals with base metals ( base metals are n’t rare ) , and forcing the populace to accept these coins by regulatory fiat .
Unfortunately for the greedy debasing governments , the populations usually perceived the evil and hoarded all their pure coins and used the debased coins in everyday commerce .
This practice is known as Gresham ’s Law , “ Bad money drives good money out of circulation . ”
In modern times , debasing a currency has become much easier for a government to execute and much more difficult for a population to detect until it is too late .
With the introduction of true fiat currencies , the last 300 years has probably seen more instances of high inflation and hyperinflation than all the rest of human history combined .
With debasement as simple as making a phone call and firing up a printing press , and so many valuable projects vying for so little real money , the temptation has been irresistible for virtually every government .
Irresponsible growth of the money supply , resulting in inflation , is in effect a massive hidden tax on a population .
The governments can print money today for nothing , spend it today at its full value , and the population pays the price later as more dollars in circulation chase fewer goods and price levels rise .
Inflation creates disincentives for saving which cause major societal debt problems , as inflation rewards debtors ( can pay back debts in cheaper dollars ) and punishes savers ( as a hidden tax that annually vaporizes a portion of one ’s wealth ) .
Maintaining our perspective on monetary supply growth and resultant inflation , let ’s take a look at the historical CPI vs. M1 . M1 is the narrowest measure of money supply , and includes “ types ” of money that consumers are most likely to have and spend , including coins and currency held by the public , bank checking and savings accounts , and credit union balances .
As we can see , the correlation between cash available to consumers and inflation as measured by the CPI is astounding .
The lines have risen in lockstep for over 41 years .
The CPI rose at a compound annual rate of 2.7 % from 1959 - 1971 , and jumped to 5.2 % from 1972 - 2000 .
The most notable feature of the graph besides the correlation is the discontinuity in the slopes of M1 and CPI that occurs in late 1971 .
Prior to 1972 , M1 and CPI were relatively tame and growing slowly .
After 1971 , the slopes of both lines begin ramping steeply upward .
What changed in 1971 ?
On August 15 , 1971 , President Richard Nixon presided over one of the three most significant financial events in the history of our nation .
( The other two were the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 and the outlawing and confiscation of gold in 1933 . )
On that fateful day , for the first time in the history of America , the last remaining link between the US dollar and gold was severed .
Various western governments had conspired to keep gold , the ultimate inflation barometer , suppressed in the years leading up to 1971 .
If gold ’s veto on fiat currencies could not be cast in the market , fewer people would realize the depth of the fiat currency inflation problems .
With artificially cheap gold , however , global demand was so high that the efforts of the governments trying to maintain faith in fiat currencies were overwhelmed .
Although US citizens had long lost this privilege , until that fateful day in 1971 , foreign holders of dollars could still redeem their currency for gold if they desired .
With cheap gold flying away from the US at unsustainable velocities , Nixon had no choice but to amputate the last vestige of the official link between gold and the dollar .
A direct consequence of this action removed the incentives for the Federal Reserve to maintain discipline in the growth of fiat paper US dollars .
Without the international threat of redemptions of inflated paper for gold , the growth in the money supply measures ( M1 , M2 , M3 , MZM ) and resulting inflation rates leapt upwards , and they have never looked back .
Eventually , as with every other government in history that has debased its currency , the problems of inflation will come home to roost in an unbelievable way .
So what is real rate of inflation in the US ?
It probably approximates growth in total money supply , or M3 .
Since 1959 , M3 has grown at a frightening compound annual rate of 7.9 % , while the CPI has “ only ” indicated 4.4 % compound annual inflation .
The real per capita GDP , in the same period , grew at a compound annual rate of only 1.4 % , indicating the annual growth in the broad money supply exceeded per capita GDP growth by an incredible 6.5 % annually .
More money chasing fewer goods equals inflation .
With money supply growth far exceeding per capita GDP growth for over 40 years , inflation will get much , much worse before it gets better in the United States .
As this month ’s BLS results made crystal clear , the CPI is not a valid measure of inflation , but has devolved into a mathematical Frankenstein ’s monster .
Real inflation , by any measure , is much higher than official Labor Department statistics indicate .
Sooner or later , general price levels will rise high enough so everyone will be able to see through the statistical smoke and mirrors the BLS has deployed .
When that day comes , international faith in the US dollar will plummet like a meteor , and hundreds of billions of dollars will be dumped in the international currency markets in nanoseconds .
The only investment that has always thrived in highly inflationary environments in the past is gold .
Gold always retains its inherent , intrinsic value through all financial turbulence , and shines its brightest when the demons released from the Pandora ’s Box of inflation are wreaking the most havoc .
As we began with a quote about misleading statistics from a great statesman , we will end with lucid quotes on money from two great thinkers …
“ Paper money eventually returns to its intrinsic value ---- zero . ” – Voltaire “ You have to choose between trusting to the natural stability of gold and the natural stability of the honesty and intelligence of the members of the Government .
And , with due respect for these gentlemen , I advise you , as long as the Capitalist system lasts , to vote for gold . ” – George Bernard Shaw Adam Hamilton , CPA June 16 , 2000
“ Swallow ’s Nest ” is a castle , built in the late XIX century near Yalta , in the South of Crimea .
Situated on the steep cliff right over the sea , it has become the symbol of the South coast of Crimea and one the of the most exciting point of interests of the whole resort .
At the end of my Basketball Blog two weeks ago , I wrote about the chain of events that led to Kevin Garnett being traded to Boston .
What if the T - Wolves had n't betrayed KG by quietly shopping him before the 2007 draft ?
Would Garnett still be stuck in Minnesota ?
Would he have become the biggest target during the trading frenzy this winter ?
Did the KG deal create a domino effect that ended up changing the destiny of five 2008 contenders ?
THE B.S. REPORT
Want to hear nearly a solid hour of hard - core NBA talk ?
Want to hear nearly a solid hour of hard - core NBA talk ?
Listen to this week 's B.S. Report as Ric Bucher and Bill Simmons break down the NBA 's stretch run .
Certainly , it 's one of the NBA 's great " What ifs ? " of this decade ?
So where does it rank in the top 15 ?
I 'm glad I asked .
Here 's one man 's list in reverse order :
This saga becomes more astounding over time : Inexplicably ( the version in which you believe Cleveland would just walk away from an option year worth $ 700,000 and allow Boozer to become a restricted free agent for no good reason ) or explicably ( the version in which you believe the Cavs made an illegal handshake deal to " forgo " Boozer 's option year , allow him to become a restricted free agent , then sign him to a $ 41 million deal ) , the one thing we know is Boozer used his newfound leverage to sign a six - year deal with Utah for $ 68 million and screw over Cleveland 's benevolent , blind owner in the process .
Look what 's happened since :
A. Boozer blossomed into an All - Star power forward and one of the best 20 players in the league , someone who would have been the perfect sidekick for LeBron James .
B. Because Boozer bolted Cleveland , that eventually left the Cavs with a ton of cap space ... and , um ... ( take a deep breath , Cavs fans ) ... the Larry Hughes , Damon Jones and Donyell Marshall signings .
Ouch .
C. Had they kept Boozer and signed Jones as well , the Cavs could have been the first NBA team to start two players with visible chest hair since the 1953 Fort Wayne Pistons .
SONICS UPDATE
After all the After all the doom and gloom in Seattle , we finally got some good news on the Sonics situation late last week .
A group of local investors , headed by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer , announced a renovation proposal for KeyArena and a bid to buy the team from Clay Bennett .
Our friends at Save Our Sonics are encouraging any readers who live in Washington state to call the legislature at 1-800 - 562-6000 and offer their support for the arena plan .
With the current legislative session ending Thursday , it 's imperative to get some sort of deal done in the next week .
It has been so long , I feel like I have to add this disclaimer :
We 're talking about the Jason Williams from Duke ( who later shortened his name to Jay Williams ) -- not Jason " White Chocolate " Williams or Jayson " The Guy Accused of Killing A Chauffeur " Williams .
Anyway , not a week goes by without some troublemaking reader sending us a " bad " prediction from my archives to make me feel stupid -- at least , I think that 's the goal -- and one of the leading " somethings " comes from 2003 , when I predicted Williams ( the No. 2 pick in 2003 ) would be a better pro than Yao Ming ( the No. 1 pick ) .
Well , you know what ?
I was right .
I was DEAD right .
A lightning - quick , physical 6 - footer who would have been unstoppable after they changed the hand - check rules in 2004 , Williams had his moments as a rookie , including the 26 - 14 - 13 he slapped on J - Kidd and the Nets .
He would have been a stud .
There 's no doubt in my mind .
But Williams stupidly crashed his motorcycle that summer -- I say " stupidly " because there 's no acceptable scenario when a professional athlete with a chance to sign a $ 70 million contract some day should ever own a motorcycle -- and that was that .
How did Jay 's injury change what transpired with Chicago over the next five years ?
Imagine Utah only getting one season out of Deron Williams and you have some idea .
( And while we 're here , I was n't sold on Yao for the same reason I 'm not sold on any guy taller than 7 - foot - 2 -- other than Kareem , there 's no track record of super - tall guys being able to stay healthy and effective while playing between 82-100 games per season at the NBA level .
Bill Walton , Rik Smits , Shawn Bradley Zydrunas Ilgauskas , Tom Burleson , Gheorghe Muresan ... all of those guys had major problems staying on the court , right ?
It 's not a game designed for freakishly tall guys who weigh 300 - plus pounds .
That 's what worried me about Yao , along with the whole " everyone will be going out of their way to dunk on him " thing and all the requisite cultural adjustments .
If Williams had n't bought that freaking motorcycle , I would have been right on this one .
So there . )
Here was the offer : Tyson Chandler Luol Deng and the No. 4 overall pick for Garnett .
Now ...
[+]
Enlarge Timothy A. Clary / AFP / Getty Images Imagine Kevin Garnett , right , in Chicago , Jason Kidd , left , in San Antonio and Paul Pierce in L.A .
It all could 've happened .
Let 's say McHale does the deal .
And let 's say he takes LaMarcus Aldridge with that No. 4 pick .
And let 's say he takes Brandon Roy at No. 6 and does n't foolishly swap Roy for Randy Foye ( a swap that never made sense , by the way ) .
Suddenly , the T - Wolves have a nucleus of Chandler , Aldridge , Deng and Roy .
Wow .
And that 's not even a stretch .
This could havehappened .
Meanwhile , Chicago would have ended up with Garnett , Kirk Hinrich Andres Nocioni and the typical flood of discount free agents and February buyout guys who follow a guy like KG , and on top of that Garnett would have ignited Chicago as a basketball city just like he ignited Boston ( and potentially pushed the Bulls into the NBA Finals in a weak conference last spring ) .
Instead , they gave away Chandler , turned Aldridge into Ty Thomas and wasted all their cap space on Ben Wallace .
So , um ... that kind of sucked .
Here was the offer : Monta Ellis Andris Biedrins and the No. 8 pick ( Brandan Wright ) for Garnett .
Now ...
As much as I love Al Jefferson , the T - Wolves would have gotten four starters out of that deal , including a franchise guard ( Ellis , suddenly the next Dwyane Wade ) , an up - and - comer ( Wright , suddenly being compared by everyone to Chris Bosh ) , an athletic rebounder / shot - blocker ( Biedrins ) and a quality veteran ( Harrington ) .
I thought they were crazy for passing up that deal last summer ... but now , with the way Ellis has been lighting it up lately ?
My God .
Do you think Chris Mullin just spends 24 hours a day sighing in relief that the deal never happened ?
I would .
By the way , I 'm starting to think McHale might not be a very good GM .
I defended Dallas for passing on Nash because ( A ) he had n't looked good in the previous two playoffs and ( B ) $ 60 million seemed like an obscene amount of money for a 31 - year - old point guard with serious back problems .
What I did n't defend was Dallas subsequently using that money ( and even a little more ) to spend $ 73 million on Erick Dampier .
If you 're throwing money around , throw it at Nash over a dog like Dampier , right ?
MORE WHAT IF 'S
Here are five more " What If's " that would 've made the cut if they were n't so improbable :
Here are five more " What If's " that would 've made the cut if they were n't so improbable : 1 . What if Shaq and Kobe had been able to juggle their egos and get along in L.A. ?
2 . What if Darko Milicic had turned out to be a stud for Detroit ?
3 . What if Grant Hill could have somehow stayed healthy in Orlando ?
4 . What if Chicago had fired Scott Skiles in 2006 instead of giving Tyson Chandler away and blowing its cap space on Ben Wallace ?
5 . What if Tim Donaghy had officiated Games 3 and 6 of the 2006 Finals ?
To make matters worse , the Mavs made a fatal mistake by underestimating the aforementioned rule changes that transformed Nash into the two - time MVP .
Had they kept Nash and Antawn Jamison ( sent to Washington for Jerry Stackhouse and the rights to Devin Harris ) and still made the semi- brilliant Jason Terry trade , that 's suddenly a monster roster : Nash , Nowitzki , Jamison , Terry , Josh Howard DeSagana Diop , Veteran Free Agent X and February Buyout Guy X year after year after year -- as well as the league 's single - most entertaining team .
( One other note : Looking back , it 's fascinating Mark Cuban played the " fiscal responsibility " card as his reason for not re-signing Nash , then quickly overpaid for Dampier and started spending more recklessly than ever .
Did you know , for the 2007 - 08 season , Dallas is the only team to spend more than $ 100 million on its payroll ?
Incredibly , the Mavs are checking in at $ 105 million this season , a good $ 17 million more than the second - place Knicks .
I have a great deal of respect for Cuban as a businessman and a thinker , but other than passing on Nash , he has spent the decade making it rain like Pacman Jones -- only coming close to a title in 2006 , when the Mavericks were robbed by some incredibly poor officiating -- and now he 's stuck with a nine - figure payroll and a static roster that might be quitting on its coach as we speak .
We 're at the point when the Mavs might need to be reinvented .
And soon . )
Again , if things had n't fallen apart with KG and Minnesota last summer , he would have stayed put for a few months ( maybe more ) , opening the door for the following two outcomes :
A. Using many of the assets originally earmarked for the KG deal , Boston could have trumped Los Angeles for Pau Gasol .
B. Without the Lakers stealing Gasol , the Western Conference would have shifted into " No Balls Association " mode .
Phoenix would n't have rolled the dice with the dangerous Shaq trade , and Dallas would n't have rolled the dice by dealing for an aging J - Kidd .
Now , you could argue the Celtics could have just made the KG trade in January or February using the same players .
But would the deal have been as effective ?
Remember , the Celtics signed James Posey and Eddie House at discounts once KG was aboard -- that 's not happening without the trade -- and they would have had a near - impossible time pulling off a 6 - for - 1 deal during the season with the rosters of both teams already filled .
Throw in KG 's trade kicker , and I just do n't see that deal happening until the summer , and by that time the Celtics would have moved on Gasol .
Then , throw in this wrinkle :
When Kobe flipped out before the season , there was a stretch when the Lakers were actively shopping him around , only nobody was willing to offer them a package that included an All - Star + cap space + picks .
Well , if they had n't made the Garnett trade , the Celtics could have offered them Paul Pierce Theo Ratliff 's Expiring Contract ( so excited I get to write that again ! ) , their 2008 and 2010 No. 1s and the future rights to Minnesota 's No. 1 ( probably coming to fruition in 2011 or 2012 ) for Kobe and two relatively unfriendly contracts ( Brian Cook and Vlad Radmanovic ) .
The Celtics could have kept a foundation of Kobe , Ray Allen , Jefferson , Kendrick Perkins and Rajon Rondo ; the Lakers would have replaced Kobe with another All - Star , gotten three No. 1s ( including Minnesota 's future pick , which could be valuable ) and $ 20 million of expiring contract with Ratliff and Kwame Brown ( already on their roster ) to make a run at Garnett , Gasol , Jason Kidd or whomever .
Everybody wins .
Did it work out better for everyone the other way ?
Absolutely .
Garnett revived the NBA in Boston ; Kobe calmed down and eventually played his best all - around basketball in seven years ; the Lakers stole Gasol from Memphis partly because the Grizzlies did n't have any other serious suitors ; Phoenix and Dallas panicked and made two of the most controversial trades of the decade ; Miami dumped Shaq 's contract and kicked off Tankapalooza 2008 ; Shawn Marion became the first professional athlete in history to seem happy going from a team with a .700 winning percentage to a team with a .200 winning percentage ; the new - look Suns struggled as John Hollinger turned into the Bill Maher to Steve Kerr 's George W. Bush ; and the Lakers and Celtics have a chance to make ABC $ 325 billion if they end up meeting in the Finals .
Just know none of that would have happened if the T - Wolves did n't tick off KG last summer .
Imagine life without Theo Ratliff 's Expiring Contract ?
I 'm shuddering .
AP Photo / Mark J. Terrill Kobe Bryant might get the trophy for most " What If 's " involving one player .
By all accounts , the best deal out there was Phoenix 's offer of Shawn Marion , Leandro Barbosa and the rights to Atlanta 's 2008 pick for Kobe .
The Lakers did n't want to trade Kobe to a division rival , so they crossed their fingers and hoped he would calm down long enough for the team to gell .
You could say they were showing faith in Phil Jackson 's ability to bring Kobe back to the fold , as well as faith in their youngsters ( Andrew Bynum Ronny Turiaf and Sasha Vujacic ) to develop into prime - time supporting guys .
You could say they had the resolve to keep one of the best three players in the league even though he was n't happy .
Or , you could say they just did n't have the balls to trade him .
Whatever the case , their plan worked , Gasol fell into their laps and now ( A ) they 're one of the leading contenders for the '08 title , ( B ) Kobe is going to win the '08 MVP because everyone has collectively decided he 's winning the award even though we 're only at the 60 - game mark and Chris Paul is just as valuable ( if not more ) to an equally good Hornets team , and ( C ) Mitch Kupchak became the first GM from " The Atrocious GM Summit " to work his way off the panel for " The Atrocious GM Summit II , " tentatively scheduled for Isiah Thomas ' house in Michigan this summer .
With that said ...
That Phoenix deal would have been a good one for the Lakers .
Not as good as keeping Kobe , obviously , but a nice way to salvage a situation that was heading south fast .
Could the Lakers have contended with Marion , Odom , Barbosa , Bynum , Derek Fisher and their young guys ?
What if you added Gasol and Atlanta 's pick to that mix ?
Suddenly the post - Kobe era is in pretty good shape , right ?
And would the Suns really have been that great with Kobe , Nash ( noticeably breaking down this month , although it 's unclear if he 's banged up or just getting old ) , Raja Bell ( ditto ) , Amare Stoudemire ( and his scary - bad defense ) , Grant Hill ( and his creaky ankles ) , Boris Diaw ( and his creaky ovaries ) and that 's it ?
Is that even a top - six team right now ?
Anyway , I 've written this a million times , but few things drive me crazier than a team refusing to make the best trade possible simply because they'd be sending their star to a rival team .
Who cares ?
Hey , Philly fans , you realize your team could have ended up with Al Jefferson , Rajon Rondo and Boston 's 2007 No. 1 pick for Allen Iverson , right ?
So stupid .
( Note : When I 'm running the Bucks starting this summer , I 'll be making the best deal possible at all times , even if it means I 'm sending Michael Redd to Cleveland to dump the Gadzuric / Simmons / Bell contracts for expiring contracts .
You have my word on that , people of Milwaukee !
I will never be afraid to deal our best player to a rival .
Ever .
And by the way , YES WE CAN ! )
So Kupchak deserves to be commended for sticking to his guns and keeping Kobe , but not if he was simply afraid to trade him to a divisional rival ... if that makes sense .
Was n't this the biggest NBA moment of the decade ?
For anyone who watched it live , it was a surreal TV night right up there with Princess Di's death and Buckwheat 's assassination .
The clip has been watched and rewatched almost as many times as the Zapruder film ; it probably has been removed from YouTube for violating copyright restrictions more than any other NBA - related clip .
I wrote two columns about it in one week ( here and here ) ; I can't remember another event prompting me to write two takes in 36 hours .
Along with the Tim Donaghy scandal and the time Darius Miles gave him a full - body hug during the 2000 draft , it 's one of the three most traumatic events of David Stern 's reign as commissioner , and it certainly has changed the rules with player - fan interactions over the past three years .
From a comedy standpoint , it catapulted both Artest and Stephen Jackson into the Tyson Zone , gave us the phrase " pulling an Artest " for eternity and even gave us a chance to imagine what life would be like if Jermaine O'Neal could punch out Turtle from " Entourage . "
If this had n't happened , the Pacers might 've won the 2005 NBA championship .
And then we have these two outcomes :
A . It 's quite possible the best team did n't win the 2005 title .
When the Artest Melee happened , the Pacers had just finished throttling the Pistons in Detroit and were staking their claim as " The Team To Beat In 2005 . "
In the span of five minutes , everything went down the drain .
And if you remember the shoddy '05 Finals when the Spurs beat the Pistons in seven , it 's right up there with the ' 94 Finals on the " Wait , Are We Sure These Were the Best Two Teams ? "
Scale .
There 's no way to prove this , obviously , but I 'll always believe Indiana had the best team that season .
Although maybe the Pacers were destined to eventually self - combust in some way .
Who knows ?
B. From that moment on , professional basketball was effectively murdered in Indiana .
The Pacers have never recovered .
Now they have the worst cap situation in the league -- three brutal contracts ( Jermaine O'Neal , Troy Murphy and Jamaal Tinsley ) , one semi-brutal contract ( Mike Dunleavy Jr. ) and no hope of getting cap space until 2010 at the earliest .
Even worse , the fans hated the post - melee team so much the Pacers were forced to give away Harrington and Jackson to Golden State for the Dunleavy / Murphy pu-pu contract platter , putting them in an even worse financial hole .
In retrospect , Larry Bird probably feels like Artest and Jackson charged into the stands and started beating the hell out of him .
Because that 's basically what happened .
See ?
Even when you 're as savvy as Gregg Popovich and R.C. Buford , you still need a little luck .
The Spurs won titles in 2005 and 2007 without Kidd , and you could argue they were one miracle play ( Fisher 's 3 - pointer in 2004 ) and one stupid play ( Manu Ginobili 's foul on Dirk Nowitzki ) from winning four straight .
Assuming they landed Kidd , the Spurs definitely would have dealt Tony Parker that summer or down the road ( not a good thing ) , and they would n't have had enough money to pay Ginobili without going over the luxury tax , which they refuse to do ( and that 's definitely not a good thing ) .
Kidd 's personal life also could have screwed up their chemistry to some degree -- remember , his ex-wife was a legendary prima donna in Jersey -- and going from Parker ( a congenial guy , by all accounts ) to Kidd ( moody , by all accounts ) could have jeopardized the fragile balance of talent and personality that made San Antonio so great in the first place .
Do the Spurs win more than two titles with Kidd ?
Do they win less than two ?
Impossible to say .
But here 's what we know : I 'd rather be spending $ 30 million on Tony Parker from 2007 - 2009 than $ 60 million on a declining Jason Kidd .
I 'm gonna say Popovich and Buford dodged a bazooka bullet on this one .
Since we 're here ...
And to think , it almost happened .
This could have been a humongous " What if ? " for three reasons :
A. If Duncan signs with Orlando , that swings the title in three seasons ( 2003 , 2005 and 2007 ) .
We have n't had a " What if ? " that definitively swung a title yet .
Now we do .
B. Once Hill 's body breaks down , Duncan finds himself emulating KG 's career in Minnesota and squandering his prime on a series of undermanned teams .
Those two would have been mirror images of each other -- Duncan wasting away in the East , Garnett wasting away in the West -- and we would have spent those years wondering who was more screwed and who was doing more with less .
Bad times all around .
C. With Duncan stealing his spot in Orlando , where would T - Mac have ended up ?
What if he landed in San Antonio to replace Duncan ?
And what if they still drafted Ginobili and Parker ?
Could they have won a title with those three guys and Robinson in 2003 ?
Could they have won one without a big guy ?
Hmmmmmm .
( Note : I would have ranked this one higher , but it 's unclear if Duncan was ever THAT close to signing with Orlando , and after learning more about him these past seven years , it would have been extremely out of character for him to ditch everyone from that ' 99 title team and chase the money to Florida .
I do n't see it happening . )
Just like the Duncan / Orlando thing , this would have been ranked higher if anyone believed Kobe actually wanted to switch L.A. teams .
The Clippers organization fervently believed Kobe was coming because he needed a fresh start with a new franchise -- do n't forget , this was the same summer when Kobe was getting blamed by everyone for pushing out Shaq and Phil Jackson -- until he broke their hearts by changing course at the last possible minute .
Other than the Lakers offering an extra year ( and slightly more money ) , was anything else offered to help stop Kobe from joining a younger and more talented Clippers team ?
Are the rumors true that they illegally promised Kobe a piece of the Lakers after he retired ?
Should we read anything into Kobe being represented by Rob Pelinka , the same guy who represented Boozer during another notorious " wink - wink " arrangement that could never be proven ( the Utah / Cleveland debacle ) ?
Were the Lakers afraid to seriously shop Kobe before the '08 season because of something promised during those ' 04 negotiations ?
It 's all hypothetical , and we 'll never know for sure until Kobe retires , and we learn if he earned the Magic Johnson " Ownership Discount " from Dr. Buss .
But everyone working for the Clippers feels likehappened to trump their offer beyond the dollar figures .
They just do n't know what .
Regardless , this was the single biggest moment in Clippers history -- the time they came within a hair of stealing Kobe and completely changing the face of professional basketball in Los Angeles as we know it .
The second biggest moment was when they signed Bill Walton away from the Blazers , and he immediately broke his foot 47 different times .
The third biggest moment happened in the second round of the 2006 playoffs , when Mike Dunleavy stuck an ice - cold Daniel Ewing on Raja Bell and blew the Clips ' one chance at an extended playoff run .
The fourth biggest moment was when they lost a deciding Game 5 in 1990 and ESPN Classic showed the game one day .
And the fifth biggest moment was when I nearly made my halfcourt shot on " E:60 . "
Not a fun three decades for the Clips in California .
( So , why am I thinking about renewing my season tickets again ?
Oh , wait , I know ...
AL THORNTON !
Did you see him take over the double - OT game against Sacramento last week ?
Oh , wait , you had 530 better things to do on a Wednesday night ?
My bad . )
4 . What if Suns owner Robert Sarver said , " Screw it , I 'll pay the luxury tax every year ? "
Well , the following three things would have definitely and unquestionably happened : The Suns would have used the No. 7 pick on either Luol Deng or Andre Igoudala in 2004 ( instead of unloading that pick to Chicago for $ 3 million and the No. 21 pick in 2005 ) ; they would have used the No. 21 pick on Rajon Rondo in 2006 ( instead of selling it to Boston for cash and the No. 27 pick in 2007 ) ; and they would n't have traded Kurt Thomas to Seattle along with their No. 1s in 2008 and 2010 .
Some people would throw in the Joe Johnson deal here ( Johnson to Atlanta for Boris Diaw and two No. 1s ) , but that was n't a luxury tax move ; they made an effort to re-sign Johnson and he wanted to leave .
Just for the hell of it , let 's give them Igoudala in that ' 04 draft because he 's better than Deng , and they might have taken him anyway .
And let 's say they do n't make the Shaq / Marion trade because they would n't have needed to dump Marcus Banks in the deal ( they would n't have signed him if they had Rondo for one - fourth the price ) , and besides , they already have Kurt Thomas .
Here 's your 2008
Suns roster right now : Nash , Barbosa and Rondo as the guards ; Igoudala , Hill and Bell at the swing spots ; and Stoudemire , Marion , Diaw and Thomas up front ... as well as the rights to their No. 1 and Atlanta 's No. 1 in this year 's draft .
That 's not even a pipe dream or an imagine - if - this - scenario - had - played - out roster .
Lemme put this in caps for you , S.A.S.- style : PEOPLE , THAT WOULD BE PHOENIX'S ROSTER IF SARVER PAID THE LUXURY TAX ALL ALONG !!!!!
Can you imagine ?
Is that the greatest 10 - man rotation of all - time ?
Would they have won 75 games ?
We 'll never know .
What 's tragic about the Suns ' current situation is how close they came to beingfor the short term and long term better than any franchise since the ' 86 Celtics :
They would have been the runaway favorites this season , and they would have been set for an abnormally long time because of their young guys .

There are no if's , and 's or but 's about this : Chris Paul will be haunting the teams that passed on him for years .
We 've made more than enough out of this one , although the better Paul plays -- he 's going to replace Isiah as the best pure point guard ever at this pace -- it 's slowly becoming the poor man 's version of Bowie - over - MJ for this generation of basketball fans , a decision that was relatively inexplicable at the time and became between 10 - 20 times more inexplicable as the years passed .
It 's safe to say CP3 will be haunting Atlanta fans .
All 527 of them .
With the supporting talent the Hawks have in place , you could n't pick a better team for him .
You really could n't .
But here 's what we have n't made enough of ...
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh ... you forgot about this one , huh ?
On the day of the draft , Portland traded that pick to Utah for the following package : The No. 6 pick ( Martell Webster ) ; the No. 27 pick ( Linus Kleiza , eventually traded to Denver ) ; and a 2006 No. 1 ( which turned out to be the No. 30 pick , Joel Freeland ) .
I 'm going out on a limb and saying Portland would love a do - over on this one .
Just for the hell of it , let 's say the Blazers took Paul .
They 're still a lottery team the following season , although probably not as bad , so maybe they end up with Rudy Gay at No. 8 instead of Aldridge at No. 4 .
They 're definitely better in ' 07 , maybe a fringe playoff team , so let 's take Oden away from them and give them the No. 12 pick ( Thaddeus Young ) that year .
Which foundation would you rather have if you 're a Portland fan ?
Scenario A : Oden , Aldridge , Webster , Roy , Travis Outlaw Joel Przybilla , the rights to Rudy Fernandez .
Scenario B : Paul , Roy , Gay , Outlaw , Przybilla , Jack , Young , the rights to Rudy Fernandez .
Hmmmmmm .
Paul and Roy as your backcourt for the next 12 years ?
Would that have even worked when both guys need the ball in their hands ?
( Possibly . )
Would they have had enough size ?
( From the looks of it , no . )
Would they have played more like a Golden State - type style , and would it have worked ?
( With the talent on hand , I say yes . )
Anyway , if Portland takes Paul , that sets off a crazy chain reaction : New Orleans ends up with Deron Williams instead of Paul ; Utah never gets its franchise point guard ; Oden and Aldridge land in other cities ; maybe Roy does n't turn into a franchise guard playing second fiddle to Paul ; and maybe Paul is n't quite as driven because he's not as ticked off for the next few years after three teams passed on him .
I have to say , I like the way it worked out .
Take a trip back to the 2003 lottery with me .
Imagine if LeBron James had ended up in Memphis .
We 're sure Jerry West can .
We 're down to the final two teams .
If Memphis draws the No. 2 pick , it goes to Detroit because of the stupid Otis Thorpe trade the Grizzlies made five years before .
If the Griz draw No. 1 , they get LeBron .
Arguably , it 's the greatest hit - or - miss moment in the history of professional sports -- like going on " Deal or No Deal , " getting down to two suitcases and having a 50/50 chance of winning $ 500 million .
For a few seconds , the cameras show Jerry West , who has the same look on his face Forrest Gump had when he was hooking up with Jenny for the first time .
If he had dropped dead right then , nobody would have been surprised .
Well , we know how it turned out : Cleveland got the pick , Memphis got nothing , and eventually , a heartbroken West retired and disappeared off the face of the earth , presumably to spend the next few years playing Russian roulette in Southeast Asia like Chris Walken in " The Deer Hunter . "
( Sorry to throw consecutive movie references at you , but the situation demanded two of them and that 's that . )
Now look at this domino effect over the next five years if Memphis gets that pick :
A. Bron-Bron joins a deep Grizzlies team good enough to win 50 games that season without him .
Better than starting out on a lottery team with Ricky Davis and Darius Miles , right ?
B. Picking second , Cleveland takes Carmelo and builds around him and Boozer .
Since Denver 's Kiki Vandweghe took Nikoloz Tskitishvili over Amare Stoudemire in 2002 , it goes without saying Kiki would have been dumb enough to take Darko at No. 3 over Chris Bosh .
The rest of the draft probably unfolds the same way , although Chad Ford still has Macij Lampe going No. 9 to the Knicks .
C. What are the odds LeBron stays in Memphis after his rookie contract ends ?
I 'm going with between 0.000001 and 0.009 percent .
And that might be high .
That means he would have become a free agent following the 2007 season , leading to the following sub- headings : C - 1 .
At least eight to 10 teams would have spent the '06 and '07 seasons carving out enough cap space to make a serious run at LeBron .
C - 2 . You would have read roughly 200 billion words and heard nearly 200 billion words uttered about the previous paragraph .
And that 's a conservative estimate .
C - 3 . There 's a good chance Marc Stein 's head would have exploded at some point from following 35 hot LeBron rumors at once .
If it happened on the " Coast To Coast " show on ESPN2 in HD , even better .
C - 4 . There 's no way Isiah would have planned ahead to LeBron being available in ' 07 , inadvertently knocking New York out of the LeBron Sweepstakes and leading to a summer of rioting in the streets of Manhattan the likes of which we have n't seen since the ' 77 blackout and the Son of Sam murders .
C - 5 . Jersey would have cut ties with Vince Carter , dealt J - Kidd for cap space and carved out enough room to reunite Bron -Bron with his buddy Jay - Z as the star of the Soon - to - Be Brooklyn Nets .
Meanwhile , Orlando would have been throwing Rashard Lewis ' money at him and offering him the chance to play with Dwight Howard for the next 10 seasons .
Soon - to - Be-Brooklyn and Jay - Z ... or Orlando and D - Ho? Hmmmmm .
C - 6 . LeBron 's departure swiftly kills basketball in Memphis , leading to the Grizzlies eventually moving to England and becoming the London Hooligans .
Actually , that could happen anyway .
Final note :
In two years , the Soon - To - Be Brooklyn piece of Scenario C - 5 could end up being realized .
( Sorry , Cleveland .
You know it might be coming . )
As for everything else in the LeBron / Memphis scenario , it remains the greatest NBA " What If ? " of the decade .
The good news ?
We still have 20 months to top it .
LOS ANGELES 
After months of informal talks , Hollywood ’s movie and television directors agreed Thursday afternoon to a new contract with production companies .
The accord would appear to send a none - too - subtle message to striking screenwriters :
This is not the time to get hung up on new media .
The deal could also lead to a resolution of the writers ’ dispute that has crippled the entertainment business for almost 11 weeks , shutting down production of television comedies and dramas , forcing movie studios to postpone big - budget movies like “ The Da Vinci Code ” prequel , “ Angels and Demons , ” and throwing tens of thousands of people out of work .
But a quick end to the strike will most likely occur only if the writers , who walked out on Nov. 5 , are willing to lower their own more aggressive demands , especially concerning compensation for the distribution of their work over the Internet , cellphones and other new - media devices .
Patric M. Verrone , president of the West Coast writers guild , said he planned to thoroughly review the directors ’ contract .
Bugs above and below ground use the mustard plant to chat .
" Hello ?
Yes , this is my plant .
Thanks .
Bye - bye . "
That 's the underground half of a conversation between bugs on a mustard plant .
Scientists have discovered the insects below and above use the plant like a chemical telephone .
A team of researchers led by Roxina Soler , an ecologist at the Netherlands Institute for Ecology , are not sure how widespread the phenomenon is .
The organic chat is a friendly one : Leaf - munching insects above ground prefer plants unoccupied by root - eaters .
When a subterranean insect takes up residence below a plant , it settles in to feast on the plant 's roots .
In order to alert leaf - eating insects of the " no vacancy , " the underground insect sends a chemical warning signal through the plant leaves , so the leafeaters are alerted that the plant is occupied .
Recent studies have revealed different types of aboveground insects develop slowly if they feed on plants that harbor subterranean residents and vice versa .
So the green phone lines keep insects from unintentionally competing for the same plant .
Turns out , the subterranean insects can also communicate with a third party via the biophone , namely the natural enemy of caterpillars — parasitic wasps .
The chemicals emitted by the leaves give the wasps information about the occupancy of different plants .
Since the parasitic wasps lay their eggs inside aboveground insects , they would do well to stop by plants unoccupied by the underground root - eaters .
The research , announced today , was funded by the Free Competition of NWO Earth and Life Sciences .

“ My daughter told me this morning that she needed $ 9 for something at school , and I was like , ‘ But I have to pay the rent , ’ ” Ms. Hart said .
“ I gave it to her , and now I have to find that money someplace else . ”
Barry A. Miller , the chief of the North Carolina child support office , said North Carolina , like about half of all states , passed no support money on to families .
“ We were seriously considering a change , but it ’s doubtful we could do that now , ” said Mr. Miller , who is also the president of the National Council of Child Support Directors .
In North Carolina and elsewhere , lost federal aid may instead force cuts in personnel and enforcement .
On Nov. 15 , 24 governors from both parties sent a letter to Congress asking it to repeal the cuts , arguing that they would hurt one of the government ’s most cost - effective programs , which raises more than $ 4 in child support for every $ 1 spent on enforcement .
The intensified national effort over the last decade to establish paternity for babies born out of wedlock and to collect more support money , mainly from fathers , is often described as a great success .
And indeed , collections have increased significantly , to some $ 24 billion in 2006 from $ 12 billion in 1996 , helping many families avoid penury .
But for the poorest men and women , the story is mixed .
Young fathers with little education or job prospects find themselves in arrears and facing jail time or the loss of their driver ’s licenses as a result , making it all the harder to start earning and paying , said David J. Pate Jr. , an assistant professor of social work at the University of Wisconsin , Milwaukee .
One startling indicator of how pervasively the poor are affected is highlighted by Daniel L. Hatcher , a legal expert on welfare issues at the University of Baltimore School of Law , in a forthcoming law review article .
Of the nation ’s total uncollected child - support arrears of $ 105 billion in 2006 , Professor Hatcher writes , fully half was owed to the federal and state governments to recover welfare costs , rather than to families .
When Congress set up the current child support system in the 1970s , recovering welfare costs was an explicit goal , with some experts arguing that it was only fair for fathers to repay the government for sustaining their offspring and that giving families the money was a form of “ double dipping . ”
But experience and research have suggested to most experts and state and federal officials from both parties that the policy is counterproductive — driving fathers into the underground economy and leaving families more dependent on aid .
A British spy who helped lead the French Resistance during World War II outfoxed the Nazis by concealing secret messages in the hem of her skirt , according to records unsealed March 31 .
Britain's National Archives opened its records on Pearl Cornioley , who parachuted into France posing as a cosmetics saleswoman to deliver coded messages to Resistance members .
The release follows her death on Feb. 24 .
The records shed light on a woman who quickly adapted to life as an agent but never forgot about her family back home , requesting in handwritten notes that officials in London send her mother and sisters birthday and Christmas presents .
The National Archives released two packets of information , detailing Cornioley 's training as a special agent , her activities in the war and her struggle to have her service recognized .
Ms. Cornioley , whose nom de guerre was Genevieve Touzalin while in France , had been educated in Paris .
She escaped France ahead of the Nazi invasion and returned to Britain via Spain .
Upon returning to Britain , she worked briefly at the Air Ministry but used her French to gain a slot as a Special Operations Executive agent – one of about 40 women to serve .
The Special Operations Executive evolved into today 's Secret Intelligence Service , the MI6 .
Early in her training with the Special Operations Executive , supervisors said she lacked the natural moxie to excel as an agent , but she compensated with her social nature , innate skill , and memory .
" She is of average intelligence and fairly practical , but rather slow in picking up new ideas .
She has , however , a good memory and does not forget what she had learnt , " a review of her training says .
" Outstanding shot with pistol and other weapons .
Probably the best shot ( male or female ) we have had yet . "
After parachuting into France , Cornioley passed on secret messages to her first handler in France that she had carried in the hem of her skirt .
The documents did not detail the contents of the messages contained .
Following the capture of her leader , she assumed control of the cell in the Loire River valley , about 240 miles southeast of the Normandy beaches .
She interrupted the Paris - Bordeaux railway line more than 800 times and attacked convoys in June 1944 .
All told , she led 3,000 French Resistance fighters in a host of guerrilla warfare missions .
She proved so crucial that the Nazis issued a 1 million franc award for her capture , hoping to quash her pivotal role in the Resistance .
" She 's obviously a very brave woman .
She goes through Gestapo lines , helps airmen escape to safety and baffles the Nazis in the field , " said Mark Dunton , a historian specializing in World War II .

In the wake of Sen. Barack Obama 's remarkable 8 - 0 record of Democratic contest victories in the past week , Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton 's presidential bid is threatened by an important reality in politics : her opponent 's momentum .
While Clinton 's strategists say she is a strong contender , veteran California campaign consultants who have been up against the " big mo " say the Illinois senator 's wave of support is looking more likely to swamp Clinton 's hopes to be the party 's nominee with key votes in Ohio , Texas and Pennsylvania in the coming weeks .
Bob Gardner , a veteran political ad man and Republican who has worked with candidates including Gerald Ford and Dick Cheney , said the shifting momentum has turned the race between Clinton , once considered the indomitable leader , and Obama , the former upstart , into an entirely new kind of competition .
" It 's Mac versus PC , Starbucks versus Dunkin ' Donuts , Leno versus Letterman , " said Gardner , who heads San Francisco - based The Advocacy Group , a crisis communications , corporate and political ad shop .
" Hillary is a candidate ; Obama is a movement . "
Obama took possession of the front - runner flag this week with a clean sweep Tuesday of the Potomac Primaries - the District of Columbia , Virginia and Maryland - on the heels of wins in Sunday 's Maine caucuses and Saturday 's wins in Louisiana , Nebraska , Washington and the Virgin Islands .
The projected delegate count by the Associated Press puts Obama ahead of Clinton , 1275 to 1220 - with 2,025 delegates needed to win the Democratic presidential nomination .
Clinton has not only been on a losing streak on the big election board - the New York senator has been hit by a campaign staff shakeup and the perception that her fundraising , though formidable , can't match Obama 's record - breaking take on the Internet , which reached $ 32 million in one recent month .
" I just do n't see how the numbers work for her , " longtime Democratic consultant Garry South said .
" She would have to win 65 percent victories " in most of the big remaining states to surpass Obama in delegates " and get to where she needs to be to win . "
" The momentum is n't with her , " said South , the former senior adviser to California Gov. Gray Davis .
" It 's an indefinable factor in a political campaign - but an important one . "
Adam Mendelsohn , a longtime adviser to California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , said being on the downside of political momentum is " like flying a plane .
When you go into a tailspin like this , the question is :
Do you have enough time to pull yourself out ? "
" Barack Obama controls it now , " Mendelsohn said of the presidential campaign field .
" He has the strength , the money and he has the front - runner status .
He controls his fate .
It may not be up to her to change it . "
With two weeks until the big March 4 primaries in Ohio and Texas - widely considered Clinton 's last best hope for delegates to get her closer to the nomination - her campaign this week has sought to counter the growing notion that she is on the ropes after what may have been her campaign 's worst week .
Mark Penn , the Clinton campaign 's chief strategist , downplayed the drama , telling reporters Wednesday in a conference call that " this is a competitive nomination race ; it is not unusual historically for these races to seesaw back and forth . "
" This is a tie ballgame , roughly , " argues Howard Wolfson , the Clinton campaign 's communications director .
" Roughly , over 2,000 delegates have been selected .
A handful of delegates separate the two candidates .
Sen .
Obama has had a good last couple of days and we believe we will have good days in March - and the nomination will remain extremely close throughout the process . "
The losing streak has prompted the Clinton camp to get more aggressive on Obama - underscoring her ability to deliver on campaign promises , initiatives and ideas while pointing out his dreamy idealism and lack of details .
" Sen. Clinton is in the 21st century solutions business , as compared to the promise business , " said Penn , who added that Clinton will connect with voters on that theme in the three delegate - rich states in March and April that constitute 61 percent of the remaining delegates she needs to win the nomination .
Some key Clinton supporters agree , insisting their candidate has been counted out before .
" I think everyone 's trying to keep a cool head , as Hillary is , recognizing that this run-up is momentum for him , " said Eleni Tsakopoulos - Kounalakis , president AKT Development Corp. of Sacramento and a longtime Clinton supporter and fundraiser .
Among Clinton supporters , she said , " the confidence is there , " although she acknowledges there have been particular challenges this month .
" There 's no question that if someone is talking about the details of health care and the economy and how to fix it , it does n't make you feel as good as ( when someone talks about ) about hope and the future , " she said .
" It 's very different .
But I think it's who she is , the kind of person who tackles problems and solves them .
He 's the kind of person who inspires people with uplifting speeches . "
Clinton 's ability to provide a roadmap to change , she said , will resonate particularly with " working people , who are solidly for her . "
But Obama insiders , like former California state controller and key Obama fundraiser Steve Westly , the Illinois senator 's current success and momentum " did n't happen overnight . "
" It 's been building .
He 's hitting his full stride at just the right time , " Westly said .
" In sports , they talk about being a ' game - day ' player , " someone who can rise to the challenge of pressure and high stakes .
...
He 's a game - day player .
" He 's not only a better campaigner than anyone in American politics today , " Westly said .
" But in two weeks on the ground in those upcoming states , he will impress a lot of people .
You add money to that and it makes him very hard to beat . "
South , who has not endorsed in the race , said those two camps will keep up the battle - so it 's not over yet .
But unless there 's a shift in the " big mo , " it may be that the best scenario for a Clinton nomination may come down to " you hope the other side screws up , " he said .
" That 's a pretty thin reed on which to base a prospect of success . "
Vice President Dick Cheney opposed the signing ratification of a treaty banning the use chemical weapons , a recently unearthed letter shows .
183 countries pledged never to " develop , produce , otherwise acquire , stockpile or retain chemical weapons , or transfer , directly or indirectly , chemical weapons to anyone " under the Chemical Weapons Convention , put into effect in 1997 .
But in a letter dated April 8 , 1997 , then Halliburton - CEO Cheney told Sen.
Jesse Helms , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , that it would be a mistake for America to join the Convention .
" Those nations most likely to comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention are not likely to ever constitute a military threat to the United States .
The governments we should be concerned about are likely to cheat on the CWC , even if they do participate , " reads the letter , published by the Federation of American Scientists .
The CWC was ratified by the Senate that same month .
And since then , Albania , Libya , Russia , the United States , and India have declared over 71,000 metric tons of chemical weapon stockpiles , and destroyed about a third of them .
Under the terms of the agreement , the United States and Russia are supposed to eliminate the rest of their supplies of chemical weapons by 2012 .
But that looks unlikely – the U.S. government figures it will get the job done by 2017 .
Later this month , the 183 countries that have signed onto the CWC will meet in the Hague , to discuss how the Conference can be adapted for the future .
An Iranian diplomat told Arms Control Today that Iran would like this so - called " review conference " to describe any violation of the 2012 deadline “ as a clear case of serious noncompliance , ” which could eventually lead to punitive measures .
In Cheney 's 1997 letter , the future Vice President voiced concerns that " the technology to manufacture chemical weapons is simply too ubiquitous , covert chemical warfare programs too easily concealed , and the international community 's record of responding effectively to violations of arms control treaties too unsatisfactory , to permit confidence that such a regime would actually reduce the chemical threat . "
But in a recent interview with Arms Control Today , Ambassador Donald Mahley , acting deputy assistant secretary of state for threat reduction , said the* * convention has been helpful in " preventing [ the ] spread of chemical terrorism . "
The CWC " continues to work in as efficient and effective manner , " he added ; the implementing it is " lean and mean . "
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Chinese dissident Yang Chunlin , who called for human rights to take precedence over the Olympic Games , has been sentenced to five years in jail on charges of inciting subversion , his family and lawyer said on Monday .

The unemployed factory worker from the northeastern city of Jiamusi in Heilongjiang province went on trial in February after he helped nearby villagers issue a petition about disputed land last year that declared : “ We do n’t want the Olympics , we want human rights . ”
Yang ’s sister , Yang Chunping , said on Monday the reason he was jailed was because of essays he posted online that were critical of China ’s parliament , the ruling Communist Party and Communism in general .
“ He said he ’s not guilty , and he was just exercising his freedom of speech and publication .
But because courts lack legitimacy he said there was no use in appealing , ” she said .
Lawyer Li Fangping confirmed the sentence but said Yang Chunlin maintained his innocence .
“ He believes that he ’s innocent , ” Li said .
“ After the official verdict is given to us , he ’ll have 10 days to decide what to do .
So , we hope we can sit down with him so he can make a serious decision whether to appeal or not . ”
The petition touched a nerve in the Communist - run country that has been going all out to prepare for the Games .
China ’s leadership is hoping the Games , which start in Beijing on August 8 will showcase the country ’s economic prosperity and social unity .
Prosecutors had said the petition stained China ’s international image and amounted to subversion .
During a visit to Beijing by British Foreign Secretary David Milibank in late February , China ’s Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi defended China ’s rights record .
“ People in China enjoy extensive freedom of speech , ” Yang told reporters .
“ No one will get arrested because he said that human rights are more important than the Olympics .
This is impossible .
“ Ask 10 people from the street to face public security officers and ask them to say ‘ human rights are more important than the Olympics ’ 10 times or even 100 times , and I will see which security officer would put him in jail . ”
Today ’s Wall Street Journal includes a piece by Siobhan Gorman that reports that Bush is pushing Congressional Dems to come to the negotiating table on FISA and that he ’s willing to make some concessions from his previous hard - line of retroactive immunity and expanded executive powers .
Over the two - week spring recess , administration officials contacted Democratic leaders to suggest they were open to compromise on updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
“ We definitely want to get it done , ” said White House spokesman Tony Fratto .
“ We ’ve had some initial conversations with Congress about the need to get FISA reform done quickly . ”
He added that Mr. Bush still prefers the Senate measure , which the White House negotiated with Senate Democrats .
In addition to rejecting immunity for companies , House Democrats want tougher judicial oversight of any eavesdropping effort .
People familiar with the matter said the White House has floated ideas to find common ground but has n’t offered a formal compromise proposal .
Officials in both parties said judicial oversight might be an easier area for the administration to make concessions .
The White House ’s more conciliatory posture reflects a recognition that the Bush administration ’s leverage on national - security matters has slipped since this past summer , a top Republican congressional aide said .
“ There ’s a recognition that if they ’re actually going to get a product they can support , there ’s going to have to be some new level of engagement , ” the aide said .
It would be a profound mistake with repercussions lasting long , long past the expiration of President Bush ’s term in office if congressional Democrats took this olive branch and negotiated FISA legislation that was acceptable to the Bush administration .
The Bush administration want to negotiate now because they know that unless they get Democrats to deal with them now , they wo n’t get anything from Congress .
This is a recognition that Democrats have been able to stall their push for retroactive immunity since last October and there is no resolution satisfactory to the Bush administration in sight .
For once , Democrats have power .
Negotiating a “ compromise ” with Bush now would undercut the little power we have accrued in our efforts to defend the rule of law .
There can be no compromise when it comes to expanding executive powers under this President , nor can their be a compromise when it comes to actions that strike against the rule of law .
Democrats must sit on their hands now and not extend them to President Bush .
They should wait out the end of his term , then flex muscle in January 2009 under a Democratic president .
If McCain is elected , that ’s when we should be forced to consider negotiations .
But to do it now just because Bush is asking nicely would be pure folly .

PARIS ( Reuters ) - President Nicholas
Sarkozy might have just got re-married , but his love affair with the French electorate appears well and truly over .
France 's first lady Carla Sarkozy ( R ) rests her head on the shoulder of President Nicolas Sarkozy while at a cafe terrace in the gardens of the Versailles Chateau near Paris , February 3 , 2008 , the day after they were married at the Elysee Palace .
REUTERS / Antoine Gyori
An opinion poll published on Monday said Sarkozy ’s popularity rating plunged 13 points in January to 41 percent on the back of widespread voter discontent over the president ’s handling of the economy and the rising cost of living .
“ It is a slump of rare proportions , ” independent pollsters LH2 said in a commentary on their survey .
The poll was published just two days after Sarkozy married his girlfriend Carla Bruni , a supermodel - turned - popstar who had been dating the president for three months .
“ The French and Sarkozy ... Divorce , ” left - wing daily Liberation said in a front page headline , commenting on the monthly poll , carried out on February 1 and 2 among 1,300 people .
LH2 said Sarkozy ’s high - profile romance with Bruni , which was played out across the French press , was poorly perceived by voters who thought his celebrity - drenched private life had dented the dignity of his office .
“ He is vulgar , rude and not in the right role as president of the republic , ” a leftist sympathiser was quoted as saying in the LH2 survey .
A rightist voter said : “ He is seen as a popstar when that is n’t at all his job . ”
In all , 76 percent of those questioned disapproved of the way his private life had been put on display for all to see .
Perhaps responding to such criticism , Saturday ’s unannounced wedding at the Elysee Palace was extremely low key , with not even the official presidential photographer present to record the event -- let alone the paparazzi .
MIRRORING CHIRAC
Monday ’s poll followed another survey released last week that showed Sarkozy ’s confidence rating down eight percentage points in January to 41 percent , the lowest level since he took office last May and down from a high of 65 registered in July .
LH2 ’s chief pollster Francois Miquet - Marty said the only precedent for such a dive in support came in 1996 , when backing for Sarkozy ’s predecessor Jacques Chirac fell off a cliff following strikes over his doomed bid to reform pensions .
The economy also lay at the heart of Sarkozy ’s problems , with 84 percent of people saying the president had not done enough to tackle higher prices and boost the standard of living .
During last year ’s election campaign Sarkozy promised to be the “ president of purchasing power ” .
Since taking office he has introduced tax cuts that critics say helped primarily the rich and offered fiscal benefits to encourage overtime .
In a news conference last month he said he could n’t do any more for workers , arguing that state coffers were empty .
Some 75 percent of people also said he was n’t doing enough to fuel the general economy , which is expected to have grown just under 2.0 percent in 2007 .
The slump in support for Sarkozy has come at a bad time for his ruling Union for a Popular Movement ( UMP ) party , which is gearing up for nationwide municipal elections in March .
In a foretaste of possible trouble ahead , the UMP lost a parliamentary by -election on Sunday to the Socialist party by 55 percent to 45 percent .
It had won the same seat last year .

Over the past three days , Yahoo has been exposing visitors to banner ads that try to trick them into installing malware , and there 's no indication anyone at the company is even aware of the problem .
According to Microsoft MVP Sandi Hardmeier 's " Spyware Sucks " blog , the ads are displayed across a wide swath of the web portal 's sprawling empire , including Yahoo Mail , Yahoo Groups and Yahoo Astrology .
Hardmeier first sounded the alarm on Saturday , and yet on Monday , Yahoo continued to run the rogue ads , she reported .
El Reg emailed three different Yahoo PR reps but never did get a response .
" I wonder how many hits Yahoo gets per day , and how many people are being exposed to fraudware , while these advertisements are allowed to remain online , " Hardmeier wrote .
The ads pitch women 's deodorant , but behind the scenes , they contact servers that have been used by previous rogue ads targeting high - traffic websites .
Typically , the ads produce a pop up that looks strikingly similar to official Windows dialog pop-ups that urge the end user to download software to fix problems .
Expedia , Rhapsody , MySpace , Excite , Blick , and CNN.com have all served up similar malicious ads in the past .
Attackers who shoe horn their banners onto reputable sites usually take advantage of the highly decentralized way that online advertisements are sold .
It 's not unusual for there to be a succession of affiliates , making it possible for an attacker to pose as an authorized agent of a name - brand product or service .
In this case , Yahoo has gotten hoodwinked into running ads that point to adtds2. promoplexer.com , which has been implicated in previous rogue banner attacks .
Remember , folks , that the NoScript extension for Firefox is your friend here .
Even if you 've whitelisted Yahoo , it will block Adobe Flash being sent from the attacker 's website .

I was one of about five people in the Beverly C.C. prooshp / caddy shack when it was leveled by the tornado .
I was 13 , a caddy , filling in for my older brother as a club cleaner .
I never saw it coming , only heard a terrible thunderstorm that turned the afternoon pitch black .
Another pro shop worker named Eddie Staffan tackled me just before it hit , throwing both of us behind tall metal racks that were anchored in concrete and held members ' golf bags .
They were about the only things left standing .
I can still remember the cold , dusty gusts as they tore through the roof and walls .
Yes , it sounded like a freight train .
I still have a scar on my knuckle from where flying glass from the front window hit my right hand .
We had to dig three ( I think ) people out from under a card table in the front office , where they had hidden themselves at the last minute .
No one was seriously injured , although everyone was in total shock .
My knuckle did n't start bleeding for five or 10 minutes .
I had no idea what had hit us .
Standing in the club parking lot , another stunned survivor asked , What the hell was that ?
It was only then that I heard the word tornado .
Ms Plame said Mr McClellan 's excerpt was " shocking "
In an excerpt from his book , Scott McClellan says George W Bush helped mislead the public over the role in the affair of two White House aides .
The CIA agent , Valerie Plame , says her identity was leaked because her diplomat husband opposed the Iraq war .
The White House said Mr Bush would not ask anyone to pass false information .
Lawsuit
Mr McClellan 's book is not scheduled for publication until April and the excerpt released was brief .
It refers to a White House press conference he attended in 2003 .
WHAT IS CIA LEAK CASE ABOUT ?
Libby was found guilty of lying to the FBI and a grand jury over revelations about CIA agent Valerie Plame 's identity Critics said the White House leaked Ms Plame 's identity to undermine her husband , ex-ambassador Joseph Wilson
He had publicly cast doubt on the Bush administration 's case for war in Iraq
The alleged cover - up , rather than the leak itself , was the subject of the Libby trial
Q&A : CIA leak case
At the conference , Mr McClellan told journalists that the two aides Karl Rove and Lewis " Scooter " Libby were " not involved " in leaking Ms Plame 's identity .
The excerpt reads : " There was one problem .
It was not true .
" I had unknowingly passed along false information .
And five of the highest ranking officials in the administration were involved in my doing so : Rove , Libby , the vice - president , the president 's chief of staff , and the president himself . "
Mr McClellan , who served as press secretary from 2003 to 2006 , and his publisher later clarified the excerpt .
Peter Osnos of Public Affairs Books said Mr McClellan was not suggesting Mr Bush deliberately lied .
" He told him something that was n't true , but the president did n't know it was n't true , " Mr Osnos said .
" The president told him what he thought to be the case . "
Libby , Vice - President Dick Cheney 's former chief of staff , is the only person charged over the affair .
He was sentenced to 30 months in jail for obstructing an inquiry into the leaking of the identity .
Lewis Libby is the only person to have been charged
However , Mr Bush intervened in July to prevent Libby from serving a prison term .
Ms Plame said Mr McClellan 's excerpt was " shocking " and that she believed Mr McClellan had been " sent out to lie to the press corps " .
Current White House press secretary Dana Perino said : " The president has not and would not ask his spokespeople to pass on false information . "
In July a judge dismissed a civil lawsuit brought by Ms Plame against Mr Cheney and other Bush administration officials .
She maintained her cover had been blown after her husband , Joseph Wilson , a former ambassador , said the Bush administration had manipulated intelligence on Iraq to back its case for war .

The government described the move as a " precautionary measure " to ease parents ' fears .
Almost 200 people had been affected , officials said .
At one school , some 30 students showed flu - like symptoms .
Experts are working to identify the virus and assess whether it poses a broader threat .
But health officials played down fears of a return of the Sars ( Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ) virus .
World Health Organisation spokesman Peter Cordingley said it appeared to be " regular seasonal flu " , the Associated Press news agency said .
' Precautionary measure '
The kindergartens and junior schools will be closed for two weeks , affecting more than half a million children .
Hong Kong 's health chief , York Chow , said the decision was made as the high rate of flu - like infections was expected to continue for weeks .
" We hope such precautionary measures will help reduce the cross-infection of the flu virus in schools and the community , " he said .
The closure would allow schools to be disinfected , he said .
The move came after seven - year - old Law Ho-ming was admitted to hospital in a semi-conscious state , suffering from fever and flu .
He died on Tuesday from encephalitis - swelling of the brain .
Five of his fellow students from the Ho Yat Tung Primary School remain in hospital , and more than 30 others are displaying flu - like symptoms .
Concerns have also been raised about two other recent child deaths attributed to flu variants .
Official records show that people in 25 other schools , a hospital ward and a disabled residential home are suffering from outbreaks of flu .
The school closure is the first caused by illness since 2003 , when almost 300 people died in the territory from Sars .
The government has set up an expert team led by a University of Hong Kong microbiologist to identify the illnesses in question and assess the risk .
One scientist said it was too soon to tell if the current outbreak of flu was dangerous or not , reports the BBC's Vaudine England from Hong Kong .
Hong Kong 's recent history of dangerous disease outbreaks is feeding fears now , but the scientists insist evidence to support those fears does not yet exist , our correspondent adds .
Your comments :
This is potentially very worrying indeed .
I am due to travel to HK on Friday with 2 young children , not sure what the implications for the welfare of my family and travel arrangements might be .
Richard , North Yorkshire
There not only happen in Hong Kong , I think it happen in world wide .
Many people including me got virus infection over a month , it not over yet .
U.K .
Yan
This is very worrying .
Looking from another country , not actually seeing what is happening in front of your face just causes fear to swell up within you .
Clems , Singapore
School has also been closed down , and it appears the most students are partying and happier then ever .
Primary school is scheduled to return in 2 weeks .
Quinton S. , Hong Kong
I applaud the HK public health department .
They seem to have moved relatively quickly to prevent more deaths .
Perhaps an alert system should be set up at every school , a liaison between parent , family doctor and the health department that closely monitors any child who gets sick regardless of the circumstances .
This might be one way to avoid a major pandemic .
Joan , USA
I have a family in Shenzhen and my kid travels to HK for school everyday .
I just called them and heard they do not have to attend school for two weeks .
He was told to wear mask outside and not to play with other kids .
Pat Yuen ,
It 's clear and silent as the children do not need to wait for the school bus downstaire
Simon Tsang , Hong Kong
I live in Hong Kong with my wife and two children ( 4 & 2 ) , and they are now both off school .
This seems an excessive reaction by the government , and my kids will surely play and be in contact with other children over the next few weeks , just not in a school environment .
My wife is livid as she works from !

Cars were still driving along Gaza City 's darkened streets
Gaza City was plunged into darkness after the plant 's turbines stopped .
Israel 's closure of border crossings amid continued rocket fire from Gaza has brought the delivery of almost all supplies , including fuel , to a halt .
But Israel , which provides 60 % of Gaza 's power , says the territory still has sufficient fuel stocks .
The UN believes Gaza 's 1.5 m inhabitants face serious hardship and one of its officials said unheated hospitals were having to rely on generators for operations .
Mahmoud Abbas , the West Bank - based Palestinian Authority president who lost control of Gaza to Hamas last year , called on Israel to " end its blockade of Gaza immediately and allow the entry of fuel to facilitate the lives of the innocent " .
' Very , very cold '
" We have just shut down the entire power plant , " Derar Abu Sissi , a senior official at the Gaza plant , said on Sunday night .
" At least 800,000 people are now in darkness .
The catastrophe will affect hospitals , medical clinics , water wells , houses , factories , all aspects of life . "
GAZA'S ELECTRICITY SOURCES
Gaza uses 200 megawatts of electricity Israel supplies 60 % of this , and Egypt 8 % The remaining 32 % is produced by Gaza 's power station Israel supplies the fuel oil for the Gaza power station
The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in Gaza , John Ging , told the BBC it was a desperate situation .
" The hospitals are operating on generator power , " he said .
" What it means is that the vital medical equipment is functioning , but there 's no power for heating , so it 's very , very cold in all the hospitals tonight . "
He warned that when diesel supplies ran out , there would be no fuel to power the generators .
A local health official , Dr Moaiya Hassanain , said hospitals faced a catastrophic choice between cutting " electricity on babies in the maternity ward or heart surgery patients " or stopping operating theatres .
Several thousand residents staged a candle - lit march through Gaza City after the blackout .
' No shortage '
Shlomo Dror , a spokesman for Israel 's defence ministry , insisted the power station had enough fuel to continue functioning .
Israel says border closures will stop if the rocket attacks end
" If they shut it down , it 's not because of a fuel shortage , but because they want to create the impression of a crisis , " he said .
He described the closure of the power station as " not comfortable but not a humanitarian crisis " .
Israel , which shut the borders on Thursday , has reduced the flow of petrol used in cars and diesel to the strip but says fuel oil and cooking gas are not affected .
Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Arye Mekel said the border closures were intended to apply pressure to the Palestinian authorities to stop militants in Gaza firing rockets at Israel .
" If they stop the rockets today , everything would go back to normal , " he said .
More than 200 rockets and mortars have hit Israel from Gaza since an Israeli operation against militants on Tuesday which left 18 Palestinians dead , the military says .
Israeli ministers meeting on Sunday decided to maintain the border closure for the time being , an unnamed source told AFP news agency .
Hamas said its attacks on Israel would not cease because of the sanctions .
" We will not raise the white flag and we will not surrender , " spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri told the London - based independent Quds Press web news agency .

A mind is a terrible thing to waste , but humans may have even less to work with than previously thought .
University of Missouri researchers found that the average person can keep just three or four things in their " working memory " or conscious mind at one time .
This finding may lead to better ways to assess and help people with attention - deficit and focus difficulties , improve classroom performance and enhance test scores .
" Most people believe the human mind is incredibly complex , " said Jeff Rouder , associate professor of psychology in the MU College of Arts and Science .
" We were able to use a relatively simple experiment and look at how many objects can be in maintained in the human conscious mind at any one time .
We found that every person has the capacity to hold a certain number of objects in his or her mind .
Working memory is like the number of memory registers in a computer .
Every object takes one register and each individual has a fixed number of registers .
Limits in working memory are important because working memory is the mental process of holding information in a short - term , readily accessible , easily manipulated form where it can be combined , rearranged and stored more productively . "
" We know that this kind of memory is really important in daily life , " said co-author Nelson Cowan , psychology professor at Mizzou and an expert in working memory theory .
" If a person is trying to do a math problem , there are partial results to keep in mind as that person solves the problem .
When people are going to do any tasks in the house -- like remembering the location of keys , turning off the stove , combining ingredients for a cake or recalling a phone number -- they use working memory to keep in mind all the different aspects of the tasks . "
Rouder said that to remember a series of items , people will use " chunking , " or grouping , to put together different items .
It can be difficult for someone to remember nine random letters .
But if that same person is asked to remember nine letters organized in acronyms , IBM - CIA - FBI , for example , the person only has to use three slots in working memory .
The difficulty in measuring working memory capacity is assuring that each item presented cannot be grouped together with others to form a larger chunk .
The researchers conducted a simple experiment involving an array of small , scattered , different - colored squares , to test their theory of working memory .
The participant saw two , five or eight squares in the array , depending on the trial .
The array was then " wiped out " by another display consisting of the same squares , minus the colors .
Finally , the participant was shown a single color in one location and was asked to indicate whether the color in that spot had changed from the original array .
" How an individual does this test depends on working memory , " Cowan said .
" The results indicating that people have a fixed capacity provide evidence of simplicity in the mind .
Many other theorists have suggested that the amount of working memory is circumstance - dependent , depends on a particular test , that there is nothing general we can get out of it , and that it 's complex .
We found the mind to be less complex in this case and that should be of great use in the future . "
Working memory is closely related to attention because it requires attention to hold a number of items in mind at once .
People with high working memory capacity have more focus .
Those with a lower attention span are more easily distracted .
This fact may help researchers help people with attention deficit disorders .
The researchers emphasized that the unique result of their study was that " the data were explained to surprising accuracy by a very simple mental model in which participants either used a register of working memory or , if all registers were full , guessed randomly . "

Rouder and Cowan 's study , " An assessment of fixed - capacity models of visual working memory , " was published this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

When most people go on vacation , they take pictures of their friends and family .
Beautiful vistas .
Old buildings .
I like all that stuff as much as the next guy , but for some reason when I get out my camera , I take pictures of strangers .
Strangers do n't pose .
They do funny things without realizing they 're being watched .
And when you get the pictures back , they 're never around to complain about how they look .
During a semester abroad in Ireland , I began spending free afternoons on the streets , camera in hand , taking pictures of people I did n't know .
( I tried to be as discreet as possible , eventually developing a from - the - hip technique where I could shoot without looking through the viewfinder ; since I was never beaten or chased , I have to assume it worked . )
Eventually I realized that there was a whole movement devoted to doing what I was doing , called street photography , and that I probably was n't some voyeuristic maniac after all ( or at least , not the socially unacceptable kind ) .
Below : kid in a piazza , Florence .
Since then , I 've stopped hitting the streets with my camera ( L.A. is n't a walking town , they keep telling me ) but have fallen in love with the great street photographers : Diane Arbus , Garry Winogrand , Elliot Erwitt , and many more .
In this series of blogs , I want to post and talk about my favorites , but I figured the best way to start was to post some of my own first ( may as well put 'em to use ; they 're just moldering away in my Flickr account ) , which also saves me the embarrassment of trying to follow Arbus or Winogrand !
So here goes .

BEYOND the town of Cordova , on Prince William Sound in south - eastern Alaska , the Copper River delta branches out in silt and swamp into the gulf .
Marie Smith , growing up there , knew there was a particular word in Eyak , her language , for the silky , gummy mud that squished between her toes .
It was c'a .
The driftwood she found on the shore , 'u'l , acquired a different name if it had a proper shape and was not a broken , tangled mass .
If she got lost among the flat , winding creeks her panicky thoughts were not of north , south , east or west , but of “ upriver ” , “ downstream ” , and the tribes , Eskimo and Tlingit , who lived on either side .
And if they asked her name it was not Marie but Udachkuqax * a ' a'ch , “ a sound that calls people from afar ” .
Upriver out of town stretched the taiga , rising steadily to the Chugach mountains and covered with black spruce .
The spruce was an Eyak dictionary in itself , from lis , the neat , conical tree , to Ge.c , its wiry root , useful for baskets ; from Gahdg , its blue - green , flattened needles , which could be brewed up for beer or tea , to sihx , its resin , from which came pitch to make canoes watertight .
The Eyak were fishermen who , thousands of years before , were thought to have crossed the Bering Strait in their boats .
Marie 's father still fished for a living , as did most of the men in Cordova .
Where the neighbouring Athapaskan tribes , who had crossed the strait on snowshoes , had dozens of terms for the condition of ice and snow , Eyak vocabulary was rich with particular words for black abalone , red abalone , ribbon weed and tubular kelp , drag nets and dipping nets and different sizes of rope .
One word , demexch , meant a soft and treacherous spot in the ice over a body of water : a bad place to walk on , but possibly a good one to squat beside with a fishing line or a spear .
This universe of words and observations was already fading when Marie was young .
In 1933 there were 38 Eyak - speakers left , and white people with their grim faces and intrusive microphones , as they always appeared to her , were already coming to sweep up the remnants of the language .
At home her mother donned a kushsl , or apron , to make cakes in an 'isxah , or round mixing bowl ; but at school “ barbarous ” Eyak was forbidden .
It went unheard , too , in the salmon factory where Marie worked after fourth grade , canning in industrial quantities the noble fish her people had hunted with respect , naming not only every part of it but the separate stems and shoots of the red salmonberries they ate with the dried roe .
As the spoken language died , so did the stories of tricky Creator - Raven and the magical loon , of giant animals and tiny homunculi with fish - spears no bigger than a matchstick .
People forgot why “ hat ” was the same word as “ hammer ” , or why the word for a leaf , kultahl , was also the word for a feather , as though deciduous trees and birds shared one organic life .
They lost the sense that lumped apples , beads and pills together as round , foreign , possibly deceiving things .
They neglected the taboo that kept fish and animals separate , and would not let fish - skin and animal hide be sewn in the same coat ; and they could not remember exactly why they built little wooden huts over gravestones , as if to give more comfortable shelter to the dead .
The end of the world
Mrs Smith herself seemed cavalier about the language for a time .
She married a white Oregonian , William Smith , and brought up nine children , telling them odd Eyak words but finding they were not interested .
Eyak became a language for talking to herself , or to God .
Only when her last surviving older sister died , in the 1990s , did she realise that she was the last of the line .
From that moment she became an activist , a tiny figure with a determined jaw and a colourful beaded hat , campaigning to stop clear - cutting in the forest ( where Eyak split - log lodges decayed among the blueberries ) and to get Eyak bones decently buried .
She was the chief of her nation , as well as its only full - blooded member .
She drank too much , but gave it up ; she smoked too much , coughing her way through interviews in a room full of statuettes of the Pillsbury Doughboy , in which she said her spirit would live when she was dead .
Most outsiders were told to buzz off .
But one scholar , Michael Krauss of the University of Alaska at Fairbanks , showed such love for Eyak , painstakingly recording its every suffix and prefix and glottal stop and nasalisation , that she worked happily with him to compile a grammar and a dictionary ; and Elizabeth Kolbert of the New Yorker was allowed to talk when she brought fresh halibut as a tribute .
Without those two visitors , almost nothing would have been known of her .
As a child she had longed to be a pilot , flying boat - planes between the islands of the Sound .
An impossible dream , she was told , because she was a girl .
As an old woman , she said she believed that Eyak might be resurrected in future .
Just as impossible , scoffed the experts : in an age where perhaps half the planet 's languages will disappear over the next century , killed by urban migration or the internet or the triumphal march of English , Eyak has no chance .
For Mrs Smith , however , the death of Eyak meant the not - to - be- imagined disappearance of the world .
JERUSALEM ( CNN ) --
At least three Israeli missiles hit the Palestinian Interior Ministry in Gaza early Thursday , hours after Palestinian militants fired more than 40 Qassam rockets into southern Israel .
One of those rockets struck near a college , killing one person , according to the Israeli military and emergency medical services .
The Palestinian rockets are a near daily occurrence but have only occasionally injured or killed people .
The strike at the ministry injured several people , according to Palestinian sources .
Another rocket hit the building several minutes later , the sources said .
A six - month - old child was struck by shrapnel and killed , the sources said .
The ministry strike was part of a series of Israeli airstrikes on Gaza in retaliation for the rocket attack .
They included one outside Gaza City that killed two children , Palestinian medical sources said .
The Israeli military confirmed eight airstrikes in Gaza .
The targets were rocket manufacturing and launching sites and a headquarters building , the Israelis said .
Palestinian sources said two militants were killed .
The continuing violence came as an opinion poll in a leading Israeli paper suggested most Israelis think their government should negotiate with Hamas -- the militants in control of Gaza -- for a cease - fire and the release of a captured soldier .
The poll , conducted by the newspaper Haaretz and the polling company Dialog , found 64 percent of Israelis in favor of talks .
" It now appears that this opinion is gaining traction in the wider public , which until recently vehemently rejected such negotiations , " according to the newspaper .
" According to the findings , Israelis are fed up with seven years of Qassam rockets falling on Sderot and the communities near Gaza , as well as the fact that [ Gilad ]
Shalit has been held captive for more than a year and a half , " the newspaper said .
Shalit was 19 when he was captured June 25 , 2006 , by Palestinian militants who tunneled into Israel and attacked an army outpost near the Gaza - Israel - Egypt border .
Apart from the one death and one injury Wednesday by Palestinian rockets that hit Sapir College , near Sderot , no other injuries were reported from the rockets .
Another Israeli airstrike -- targeting a rocket cell in northern Gaza -- killed one civilian and injured three others just outside Jebalya , Palestinian medical and security sources said .
Five Hamas members were killed in an earlier airstrike in Gaza , the sources said .
The Israeli military confirmed it carried out the airstrikes in northern Gaza , but offered no details .
Earlier this month , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert resisted pressure to launch a broader military operation against Palestinian militants in Gaza after a rocket attack seriously wounded an 8 - year - old boy in Sderot .
The boy 's leg was amputated .
Instead , Israel retaliated with troops carrying out airstrikes in Gaza against Hamas targets .
Olmert has vowed not to " slacken " against the ongoing attacks on Israel , which he described as an " almost daily war . "
" We will continue to struggle in order to reduce to nil the threat that is upsetting the quality of life of residents of the south , " he said .
As part of that struggle , Olmert said , Israel will continue its military operations and its blockade of " materials that could serve the terrorist organizations , including energy . "
Israel has allowed some fuel and medical supplies into Gaza , but has kept the border crossings closed except to meet emergency humanitarian needs .
The block on food , fuel and medicine has led to long lines at stores and left hospitals without heat .
Human rights groups have protested against the blockade , accusing Israel of collectively punishing civilians along with the territory 's Hamas leadership .
On Monday , thousands of people formed a human chain along Gaza 's roads in a Hamas - led protest over the blockade .
Hamas does not recognize Israel 's right to exist , and Israel and the United States consider it a terrorist organization .
" This may not always be loved but it is an important part of counterterrorist activity , " Olmert said .
He also said the Israeli government is building 13 new schools in Sderot and surrounding areas that will be reinforced to protect them from the salvo of rockets .
It is part of a $ 14 million plan approved by the Knesset in January .
The poll figures were obtained in a Haaretz - Dialog poll conducted Tuesday under the supervision of Professor Camil Fuchs of Tel Aviv University .

Attorney General Michael Mukasey defended the Bush administration 's wiretapping program Thursday to a San Francisco audience and suggested the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks could have been prevented if the government had been able to monitor an overseas phone call to the United States .
The government " should n't need a warrant when somebody picks up a phone in Iraq and calls the United States , " Mukasey said in a question - and - answer session after a speech to the Commonwealth Club .
Before the 2001 terrorist attacks , he said , " we knew that there had been a call from someplace that was known to be a safe house in Afghanistan and we knew that it came to the United States .
We did n't know precisely where it went .
You 've got 3,000 people who went to work that day , and did n't come home , to show for that . "
Mukasey did not specify the call to which he referred .
He also did not explain why the government , if it knew of telephone calls from suspected foreign terrorists , had n't sought a wiretapping warrant from a court established by Congress to authorize terrorist surveillance , or had n't monitored all such calls without a warrant for 72 hours as allowed by law .
The Justice Department did not respond to a request for more information .
A congressional investigation found in 2003 that the National Security Agency had intercepted messages between one of the Sept. 11 hijackers and an al Qaeda safe house in the Middle East as early as 1999 , but had not shared the information with other agencies .
Mukasey also defended President Bush 's insistence on retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies that have cooperated with the administration 's surveillance program , in which phone calls and e-mails between U.S. citizens and foreign terrorist suspects were intercepted without warrants .
Customers are suing AT&T and other companies for allegedly violating their privacy , in a series of cases that have been consolidated before a federal judge in San Francisco .
A federal law authorizing the surveillance program expired in February , and Bush says he will not sign an extension unless it retroactively shields companies that have participated in the program from liability .
The Senate has passed such a bill but the House has rejected it .
" They have cooperated , " Mukasey said of the companies , without naming them .
" It just ai n't fair to ask somebody to cooperate with the government " and face a lawsuit for substantial damages , he said .
If Congress denies the companies retroactive immunity , he said , the firms will withdraw their voluntary participation and the government will have to seek court orders , losing time and potentially valuable intelligence and risking exposure of secret information .
" We face the prospect of disclosure in open court of what they ( the companies ) did , which is to say the means and methods with which we collect foreign intelligence against foreign targets , " Mukasey said .
His Commonwealth Club speech focused on the Justice Department 's prosecutions of federal and state officials for political corruption , an effort that Mukasey said is carried out " without regard to political affiliation . "
He was asked about the Justice Department 's refusal to prosecute two administration officials , presidential Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten and former White House counsel Harriet Miers , for contempt of Congress after they refused to testify about whether politics was behind the firings of U.S. attorneys in 2006 - 07 .
The House Judiciary Committee filed its own lawsuit over the issue after the department balked .
Mukasey reiterated what he had told House Democratic leaders , that executive privilege - a president 's authority to keep certain documents and conversations confidential - covers top presidential aides even in discussions that do not directly involve the president .
" The president has to have a circle around him of people who can give him advice in confidence and understand that they are not going to be called to account , " the attorney general said .
Otherwise , he said , " he will not get candid advice . "
BillBoard Liberation Front Makes AT&T Ads Truthful Posted by Pile ( 10355 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
A rogue activist group that adds creative touches to advertising campaigns has announced their new target : AT&T
From the BLF web site :
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 27 , 2008
San Francisco , CA
The Billboard Liberation Front today announced a major new advertising improvement campaign executed on behalf of clients AT&T and the National Security Agency .
Focusing on billboards in the San Francisco area , this improvement action is designed to promote and celebrate the innovative collaboration of these two global communications giants .
“ This campaign is an extraordinary rendition of a public - private partnership , ” observed BLF spokesperson Blank DeCoverly .
“ These two titans of telecom have a long and intimate relationship , dating back to the age of the telegraph .
In these dark days of Terrorism , that should be a comfort to every law - abiding citizen with nothing to hide . ”
AT&T initially downplayed its heroic efforts in the War on Terror , preferring to serve in silence behind the scenes .
“ But then we realized we had a PR win on our hands , ” noted AT&T V.P. of Homeland Security James Croppy .
“ Not only were we helping NSA cut through the cumbersome red tape of the FISA system , we were also helping our customers by handing over their e-mails and phone records to the government .
Modern life is so hectic – who has time to cc the feds on every message ?
It ’s a great example of how we anticipate our customers ’ needs and act on them .
And , it should be pointed out , we offered this service free of charge . ”
Commenting on the action , and responding to questions about pending privacy litigation and the stalled Congressional effort to shield the telecoms from these lawsuits , NSA spokesperson [ REDACTED ] remarked : “ [ REDACTED ] we [ REDACTED ] condone [ REDACTED ] warrantless [ REDACTED ] , [ REDACTED ] SIGINT intercepts , [ REDACTED ] torture [ REDACTED ] information retrieval by [ REDACTED ] means necessary . ”
“ It ’s a win - win - win situation , ” noted the BLF ’s DeCoverly .
“ NSA gets the data it needs to keep America safe , telecom customers get free services , and AT&T makes a fortune .
That kind of cooperation between the public and private sectors should serve as a model to all of us , and a harbinger of things to come . ”
Come see the improvement at 14th St. and Valencia St. in San Francisco
The BLF ( www.billboardliberation.com) has been improving outdoor advertising since 1977 .
Prior campaigns have included work for Exxon , R.J. Reynolds , and Apple Computers .
AT&T ( www.att.com) is America ’s favorite telecommunications trust .
Based in San Antonio , Texas , it has over 300,000 employees and annual revenues of $ 117 Billion .
NSA ( www.nsa.gov) is the largest intelligence organization in the world .
Headquartered at Fort Meade , Maryland , its budget , personnel , products , and services are all classified .

Michigan From the Heart
To all friends of Michigan From the Heart ,
We hope you are all safe and well during this trying time .
In a normal year , we would be looking forward to having the student athletes back and resuming visits to the kids at Mott .
We would be excitedly preparing to host families at the tailgate and football games , but these are not normal times .
We continue to lend our support to patients and families in need and , for many , that need is greater than ever .
We are also working with the U of M athletic department and the staff at Mott to find a way of bringing athletes and kids together for virtual visits .
When we postponed the June golf outing , we were hopeful that we would be able to hold it in September , but that is no longer practical .
We are looking forward to holding it on June 21st of next year at Travis Pointe Country Club and hope to see all of you there .
On behalf of the kids and families , we want to thank those of you who have so generously given financial support despite the cancellation of this year ’s golf outing .
While many of our activities have been put on hold , we are still in need of your support .
Donations can be made online or sent to :

For nearly 30 years , Michigan From The Heart has served as an inspiration to both University of Michigan student - athletes and the pediatric patients and families of C.S. Mott Children ’s Hospital .
On Thursday evenings , Michigan From
The Heart arranges visits to the hospital by student - athletes who offer a welcome distraction by spending time with patients and families .
Patients are then given the opportunity to watch the athletes in action by attending University of Michigan sporting events as special guests of the team .
Michigan From
The Heart also hosts football tailgates and Disney trips in hopes of putting smiles on children ’s faces and some joy into their hearts .
The organization provides further support to these children through contributions to the hospital ’s Child and Family Life department and by spearheading smaller , yet much needed initiatives that otherwise go unfunded such as the new , “ Connecting Mom and Baby iPad Program . ”
The funding to support this program is raised primarily through our annual golf outing , in which 144 golfers participate .
In addition to supporting activities that provide patients and their families with memorable experiences that might seem out of reach during a difficult time , the money raised from this year ’s outing will continue to be used to fund Michigan From the Heart ’s participation in NorthStar Reach .
NorthStar Reach is a camp that provides children with serious health challenges a chance to get away and just be kids .
With your participation , we can continue efforts towards providing these experiences for children that are going through challenging times .
Michigan From the Heart is a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) charitable organization operated entirely by unpaid volunteers .
The program has been extremely successful in helping children in need because of the generous support of people like you .
We appreciate your support of the Michigan From The Heart at the upcoming 24th Annual Golf Classic on June 21 , 2021 .
Go Blue !
Sincerely ,
Michigan From The Heart Golf Classic Committee

A place at high table : Norway 's energy ministers are often women
From 1 January 2008 it became compulsory for Norwegian companies to appoint a substantial number of women to their management boards , but is government intervention on gender issues the best way to create real change in the corporate world ?
Norway now leads the globe in gender equality at board level , with a higher percentage of women at the uppermost echelons of its firms than any other country .
The change was achieved by introducing tough legislation threatening to close publicly listed firms that failed to comply with the 40 % female quota for board members .
It has always been difficult to change the power structure in any country
Marit Hoel , Norwegian Centre for Corporate Diversity
The government can now proclaim its policies a success - and they have provoked a vital debate about women and work .
" As of today , all major publicly listed companies do comply with the law , " says Marit Hoel , head of Norway 's Centre for Corporate Diversity .
" The number has quadrupled in less than five years . "
Tough love
The legislation , which was initially introduced in 2003 but gave companies five years to comply , means that the country has almost double the percentage of female board members even compared with its Nordic neighbours .
" Norway now has close to 38 % of women on the board of publicly listed companies , " Ms Hoel says .
" The next country is Sweden with close to 20 % of board membership female within companies listed on the Stockholm stock exchange . "
This is well above a European average , which the European Professional Women 's Network puts at around 8 % and far more than in Italy , for example , where the figure dips to below 2 % .
Can government legislation help get rid of the ' glass ceiling ' ?
Tough government - enforced measures work far better than softer initiatives from within companies , says Dianne Perrons of the London School of Economics ' Gender Institute .
" In general , quotas backed by legislation seem to be one of the most significant ways of effecting change .
" The gender balance strategies of companies alone through flexible working and mentoring and so on seem to have very limited success . "
But Dinah Worman , of the Chartered Institute for Personnel Development , argues that playing the numbers game with gender in business will not succeed in altering entrenched corporate culture .
" There are those who argue that if you interfere with the top team , you 'll bring more gender perspective - that would be nice if it actually worked but there are issues about the kind of culture that exists , " she says .
" Fixing the numbers is fine but if you think that 's going to deliver everything , that 's naive .
We 've got to keep being curious about what goes on in what top team . "
Competence not chromosomes
Even in Norway not everyone has been delighted by the manner of change .
Many of the country 's small , non-listed companies have been rapidly altering their status to avoid complying with the new rules , according to the Oslo Stock Exchange .
" We have said from day one that we are against this law , " says Sigrun Vageng , an executive director within Norway 's Confederation of Enterprise , a grouping of Norwegian firms .
Now four out of 10 Norwegian board members are women
" We recognise that we need more women at boardroom level but we do not think that this was the way to go about it .
I feel if you own a company you should be the one to decide who sits on the board .
" We need more women because they offer competence , not because they are women per se . "
But far from diluting the quality of leadership and skills by valuing the sex of candidates above the contents of their CV , the calibre of board members has improved , Ms Hoel insists .
Public to private
The number of younger , better educated women with specific experiences gained in the public sector has actually improved the professional status of many boards , she says .
" Norway now has a lot of corporate women and , from a first analysis of their kind of skills , the data shows that the new board members have a higher level of education .
So the professional level of many boards has risen significantly . "
The scramble for talent has led to the best qualified women taking up multiple directorships , in turn creating a small cadre of very powerful and influential women in Norway 's corporate sector .
Yet this hunger for female talent in the private sector is now causing problems for the public sector as women jump ship .
The Norwegian oil and gas giant Aker Kvaerner , for example , has recruited no fewer than four former ministers on to the various boards of its firms .
" In Norway they have tended to go for public sector positions as they believe these will be easier to combine with a family life , " Ms Vageng says .
" But now women are moving across to the private sector and it is now a growing problem for the public sector , which is losing women . "
Diving for pearls
The search for female executives has led to cross - border recruitment drives - especially in neighbouring Nordic states - as well as company - led initiatives to cherry - pick and promote the best existing female talent .
The Female Future initiative , run by the firms who make up the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise , is a one - and - a - half year training programme of management and networking seminars .
According to research carried out by the London School of Economics ' Gender Institute , some 40 % of women who took part in the programme were later invited to join a board .
Such initiatives are changing the culture of the boardroom , Ms Vageng says .
" Being on the board used to depend on being a member of the " old boys ' network " , a club from your university of high - school peers . "
Bente Landsnes , the female president of the Oslo Stock Exchange , can see the same pattern of concentration of power being repeated by female board members .
Many are already part of Norway 's elite , educated in a small number of top - ranking institutions .
" A few women are taking a number of boards , just like the men have done so before them , " she says .
Ms Perrons , of the LSE , says that while the quota level is symbolically important and may actually influence strategic thinking , other gender issues remain .
" It is also important to tackle gender imbalance throughout the organisational hierarchy , in particular the gender - differentiated pay gap or the highly gendered , uneven monetary rewards for different kinds of work , " she says .
Final frontier
Ms Landsnes believes that the group of people who put forward board members also needs to change .
" It is important to look at the nomination committees - they propose new board members .
They are mainly men and they will appoint men . "
Ms Hoel admits that despite Norway being a global pioneer on achieving gender balance at the distant board level the country has too few women actually running companies from the top .
" It has always been difficult to change the power structure in any country and the government can't get involved [ in this ] .
" This is a part of the company that can not be regulated by law .
A [ chief executive ] has to have the power to recruit whoever into their executive team , you can't legislate for that . "

A selection of your comments :
I work in a small publicly listed company , but I doubt I will ever advance any higher in the company than I am now - the entire managerial level above me is female , and the level above them too .
There is no legislation which says there has to be a certain percentage of men present in the board room !

If not for deep - rooted cultural attitudes , these women probably would have made it to the top of their companies on their own merit .
Anti-discrimination legislation is necessary to reverse disparities .
Positive discrimination restores the balance and should also be used , in my opinion , in sexual orientation and race equality .

Curiously I saw this news item and I was totally surprised .
There is a highly contentious , volatile debate in my home country , India .
It is about reservation , which is same as the quota mentioned in this article .
The quota is for some underpriveliged castes in education and jobs ( public and private ) .
Reservation in education is perfectly valid as there is a history of deprivation for many of them .
They have also had quotas in the public sector too .
But I thought enforcing it in private sector is unfair as the private sector survives on individual abilities and not on quotas directed by the government .
Giri Velamur , NJ , US ( Indian citizen in US )
Laws like this only serve to reinforce the notion that women are incapable of achieving leadership positions in large companies on their own merits .
As a woman in the business world , I want to be judged on my abilies and I want to be promoted because I am the best person for the job , not because there is a female quota that needs to be filled .
Give me the same opportunity as anyone else -- no more and no less !
Maria , Washington , DC
Great idea !
Of course we need to force companies to employ more women .
This is a good way to rapidly change business culture , and it can only be good for businesses in the long run .
Mariken Schipper , Cambridge , UK
I think to inshrine this in legislation for an indefinite period is wrong .
There should be a sunset clause on this of say 10 years or so to tackle the ' old boys ' culture but to have it there forever is just plain discrimination .
Sean Gaughan , Bergen , Norway
There are now several women in board positions without the experience and competancy neccessary for those positions .
Legislation is not the way .
Ability should be the reason one is appointed , not one 's gender .
DT , Stavanger Norway
Legislation should not be used to improve gender equality in the corporate world .
This type of affirmative action always backfires .
The women appointed will not be taken seriously because it will be always be wispered that she was given the job ... which is true .
Kara Tyson , Mobile , Alabama
So we 're expected to believe that giving someone a job based on whether or not they can pee standing up will make companies more successful ?
What about talent ?
Who 's better in the boardroom ; a talented man or a useless woman ?
In Norway you now have no choice but to take the useless one .
Mind you , anything that hurts foreign companies is likely to help ours in the long run , so carry on , Norway .
Alam , Aberdeen , Scotland
Absolutely .
Men employ men that they know , or men that they think they know , or have some familiarity or common interest or mindset with - it's the easiest and least risky option when recruiting .
Women are an alien species and very difficult to feel in tune with for many men .
Something needs to be done to push these recruiting men into riskier options , such as an unknown woman applicant .
Once the number of women in higher positions reaches a certain number , the problem will most likely disappear .
Nick Pettefar , Swindon , England
I still feel that all that has really been done here is to put a few female players into a male game .
The business world has been dominated by men for so long that only after a few generations of equal gender representation in top jobs will people begin to think differently about business , and accept different ways of ' being a board member ' .
Rebecca , Leicester
Mad !
This is bad for the makeup of corporate boards and bad for the women who get appointed - they wont be taken seriously no matter how suitable they are for the role - and if they were suitable they would already have been appointed - perhaps if they had given some significant lead time ( 5 years ? ) then women could be groomed for these positions , but not overnight !
Bob , Ireland
The reasons for more men being in director positions is a generational thing .
The male directors of today perhaps had more opportunities than female 20 years ago when they were in education .
This is not the same today and as todays young generation grows into these positions in a few years the gender gap will close .
Graham Montgomerie , Dundee , Scotland
Positive discrimination is still discrimination , and any form of discrimination , however well intentioned , is wrong .

While there is no doubt that the ' Old Boys ' network seriousely limits the inclusion of women in high corpotate positions , it must be remembered that it also excludes 99.99 % of men to , based largely on aggresive male competitiveness .
It would seem that there is a similar female elite element , or ' Old Girls ' network , so there must be plenty of capable women who should be setting up their own corporations and heading them
Duncan , Glenrothes , Fife
A few years ago there were a number of women CEO 's in large public companies .
There are less now .
Why ?
Because they were n't up to the job .
John , France
My experience of living in a country with similar pressure to promote women is that companies willfully promote their least competent , and most docile , female employees .
I know it sounds counterintuitive , but you have to admit that it's a clever way of undermining the rules .
CE , US
The reason almost all positions of power are held by men is because quite simply , mens brains are different from women's .
Males are programmed to push forward and be more competitive whereas women are programmed to take care of things .
You employ people based on how well they can do the job , and in positions of power the natural choice is almost always a man , for the reasons above .
michael , glasgow , scotland
As a science secondary school teacher in the U.S. , I have seen the gender achievement gap first hand .
Girls are easily outperforming boys in science and other subjects .
We should recognize this change and support the advancement of women at the highest levels .
Nations that do otherwise will fall behind .
Tom Ericsson , Beverly , MA in the U.S.A .
I am currently a female engineering apprentice working for a satalite company .
I am the only female in my class .
This can act as both a blessing and a pain .
I sometimes wonder if this job that Im doing is because I was generally good enough to do it , or I was put in it because I am a girl .
I know it goes against my position at the moment , but I believe that people who get jobs should deserve to be there , and I would hope that the job should be given to the best person for it , not what was required to fill a certain quota .
Sam G , Portsmouth
I notice that even in Norway , boards contain slightly fewer women than they are forced to by law .
So if I were offered a meeting with a Norwegian female manager , I might be tempted to ask if I could speak with someone who got their position through merit .
Mark Saunders , Bath , England
I support the law .
It is interesting that the " old boys ' network " is taken for granted , and little or no real discussion has taken place on that matter .
The ' glass ceiling ' is not removed overnight , and it is not only a matter for private companies .
Women are also soon in majority when it comes to doctorates at university levels , but are a small minority among the professors .
But it is a step in the right direction .

Administration renews claims of Syrian nuclear weapons program Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday April 24 , 2008
|
Print This Email This U.S. intelligence officials on Thursday were showing members of Congress a videotape and other evidence supporting their case that Syria was building a nuclear reactor with North Korean assistance before it was bombed by Israeli planes last year .
Intelligence officials who have seen the evidence consider it " extremely compelling , " a US official said , adding that it was gleaned from a variety of sources , not just Israeli intelligence .
Syria has denied the administration 's allegations , and the videotape apparently was just a collection of still photos from inside the facility .
The administration 's presentation represents a renewal of claims about an alleged Syrian nuclear weapons program which were widely reported in the mainstream media last fall , following the Israeli bombing .
Those allegations were never substantiated , and although new evidence appears to have been added to strengthen the case , skepticism remains strong .
Political commentator Steve Clemons suggests that " [ Vice President ]
Cheney 's minions are pushing Congress to sponge up Israeli intelligence assessments about purported Syria - North Korea cooperation on a now destroyed , alleged nuclear site .
There are many who doubt Israel 's assessments in the U.S. intelligence community .
A consensus has built that North Korea and Syria were cooperating on some machine tool operation to retrofit increasingly sophisticated short range missiles with new capacity , perhaps air burst capacity that could potentially deliver biological or chemical agents . "
Last September , RAW STORY 's Larisa Alexandrovna was the first to report that the Syrians had been engaged in attempting to add chemical warheads to their stock of " older generation " North Korean missiles and quoted former CIA counterterrorism chief Vincent Cannistraro as saying that the building which was bombed was " absolutely not a nuclear weapons facility . "
In a follow - up article , Alexandrovna added that several of her sources saw Dick Cheney 's hand behind behind the leak of stories about a Syria nuclear program , stories which were not supported by the intelligence community .
According to one official , " We do n't have any independent intelligence that it was a nuclear facility -- only the assertions by the Israelis and some ambiguous satellite photography from them that shows a building , which the Syrians admitted was a military facility .
Lawrence Wilkerson , former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell , also told Alexandrovna , " I do not believe that the real story , if it is ever known , will have anything at all to do with nuclear weapons . "
Veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh has expressed skepticism towards the story as well .
The pattern of selective leaks , which appears to be typical of Cheney 's operations , is as apparent with the new evidence as it was last fall .
Rep. Gary Ackerman ( D - NY ) , chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Middle East subcommittee , accuses the Bush administration of " bizarre behavior " in giving information to reporters who lack security clearances while restricting what it presents to Congress .
" This is the selective control of information that led us to war in Iraq , " Ackerman stated .
The renewal of claims about the Syrian facility come as the Bush administration is pressuring North Korea to acknowledge its alleged nuclear proliferation as part of a disarmament agreement reached last year .
However , Steve Clemons points out that Vice President Dick Cheney appears to be trying to build a case against Syria , as well .
" A source reported to me yesterday that in the last two weeks , Cheney held forth at a meeting on Iraq WMDs and insisted that they were real and still out there , " Clemons reveals .
" Cheney believes that Syria has them -- and has been watching closely intelligence streams from a secret ' black SIGINT base ' that the US has placed in the mountains near the intersection of the Syrian , Turkish , and Iraqi borders . " ( with wire services )
Welcome to UKCIA – the Cannabis Internet Activist
Latest blog : Reefer Madness Dishonesty
There is nothing worse than a scientist attempting to influence an important referendum by promoting a belief as an established fact , presenting disputed research as proof whilst ignoring the many other issues pertinent to the debate .
This is the charge against Prof Mary Cannon .
What is UKCIA ?
UKCIA is an anti-prohibition site , specifically promoting the ending of the prohibition of cannabis , a policy that has been embraced by all UK governments since 1928 and which is causing very real damage , not only in the UK , but world wide
The site contains a wealth of information about the plant , comment and archives of the long running law reform campaign .
UKCIA does not claim cannabis is harmless , nothing on earth is .
But any harm cannabis can do is amplified greatly by the prohibition law because of the total lack of control over the huge and very profitable industry that supplies it .
Prohibition also adds many dangers of its own by creating opportunities for organised crime to flourish .
The aim of UKCIA is not only to spread knowledge about cannabis , the people who enjoy using it and the trade that supplies the demand but also to spread harm reduction knowledge
As the late Howard Marks once put it , “ Cannabis exists and people want to use it ” , that is the hard reality the government has to realise because prohibition has failed and cannabis is n’t going away .
UKCIA is a huge site and is very much text based , you ’ll do a lot of reading while you ’re here !
Knowledge is power , use it .
A Google bomb ( also referred to as a ‘ link bomb ’ ) is Internet slang for a certain kind of attempt to influence the ranking of a given page in results returned by the Google search engine , often with humorous or political intentions .
Because of the way that Google ’s algorithm works , a page will be ranked higher if the sites that link to that page use consistent anchor text .
A Google bomb is created if a large number of sites link to the page in this manner .
Google made changes to its algorithm to prevent such attempts at manipulating a keyword .
However , looks like people against Scientology have overcome Google ’s attempts to prevent Googlebombing .
If you type in “ dangerous cult ” into Google , the first result is the Church of Scientology ’s official website .

“ It is truly with a heavy heart , Madam Speaker , that I stand here reciting example after example of the maliciousness and condescending attitude exhibited by this administration .
It is a problem that ’s flowing from the top .
When I hear my friends on the other side of the aisle accusing this administration of stonewalling , of coverups , or thwarting investigations , I sadly must concur with them .
Even though I may disagree with what the policy issue of the day is , I have to agree that Congress is not being treated with respect and that the President is engaged in obfuscating and in stonewalling of rightful requests by this body .
This White House exemplifies needless hostility , turf jealousy , and obstructionism .
The American people should know it and should know that these charges come not from a partisan Democrat , but from a lifelong conservative Republican . ”

with out the MSM messing it up
You can post comments , too !
At the bottom , Your Imperial Presidents ' radio remarks yesterday .
bear in mind that prior to 9/11 , the US government
but alot can be done to expose the lies and distortions , too Think :
Just a few of the LIES and distortions from last year 's SoU and what we can expect on Monday ..
It 's easy to make ethical / moral attacks on the Bushistas ,
Bush selects his facts carefully to dress up the State of the Union address .
Summary
Sen . Jim Webb of Virginia , in a nine - minute response from the Democrats , also chose his data selectively .
Trying to put a gloomy cast on a generally upbeat economy , he claimed that worker wages " are at all - time lows as a percentage of national wealth . "
Webb would have been more accurate had he said " national income " rather than " wealth , " but it 's true that real wages ( after inflation ) are rising nicely after a long stagnation .
We found some puffery in President Bush 's State of the Union address .
He proposed a 20 percent cut in gasoline use , which turns out to be only an 11 percent decrease from current levels .
The President claimed to have cut the federal deficit in half , which has n't quite happened yet .
He trumpeted the 7.2 million jobs created since the worst of the 2003 job slump , ignoring the 2.7 million jobs lost during the first part of his tenure .
And once again Bush spoke of " energy independence , " though the nation 's dependence on imported oil has grown steadily since Bush took office despite all the talk and enactment of his energy legislation .
Analysis
Bush delivered his State of the Union address Jan. 23 , concluding that " the State of our Union is strong [ and ] our cause in the world is right . "
That broad judgment we 'll leave to others to evaluate .
Some of the specific facts the President cited , however , we found to be selective , and one we found to be incorrect .
Copyrighted Image ?

Gasoline Cut
Bush overstated matters when he proposed to slash the nation 's use of gasoline by one - fifth over the next decade :
Bush :
Let us build on the work we 've done and reduce gasoline usage in the United States by 20 percent in the next 10 years .
But , compared to what ?
In reality , Bush 's stated goal is not so grand as he made it sound .
A White House " fact sheet " says in the fine print that he 's talking about a 20 percent from projected levels , not from what motorists are using today .
There 's a big difference .
The Energy Information Administration predicts that if current trends continue American motorists will consume 12 percent more gasoline than they do currently by the year 2017 .
Cutting that projected consumption by 20 percent works out to a level that is just 11 percent less than current consumption .
That would still be a historic reversal and a major accomplishment , but roughly half of what Bush 's words seemed to promise .
Foreign Oil
Bush – once again – spoke of lessening dependence on Middle Eastern oil and imported oil generally :
Bush :
For too long our nation has been dependent on foreign oil .
He did n't mention that the nation has become significantly more dependent on foreign oil during his time in office .
According to the Energy Information Administration , the US imported 60.2 percent of the oil it consumed in 2006 , up from 52.9 percent in Bill Clinton 's last year in office .
Dependency has grown in each year of the Bush presidency save one , despite all the talk and enactment of his energy legislation .
Federal Deficit and Fiscal Discipline
Bush called for fiscal restraint and claimed credit for cutting the federal deficit in half :
Bush :
What we need is to impose spending discipline in Washington , D.C.
We set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009 , and met that goal three years ahead of schedule .
Actually , Bush inherited a budget with a comfortable surplus , and then ran up enormous deficits that continue to the present .
Under Bush , the national debt ( debt held by the public ) has increased by more than $ 1.5 trillion .
The annual deficits peaked at $ 413 billion in fiscal year 2004 , and has declined since then .
But in fiscal year 2006 ( which ended last Oct. 31 ) the deficit was still $ 248 billion .
The latest estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office project a further reduction in the current fiscal year , to $ 172 billion .
That would indeed be less than half the worst of Bush 's deficits , but it would be only two years prior to fiscal 2009 , not three .
As for spending restraint , Bush has shown little if any to date .
He allowed spending to soar 42 percent during his presidency , and did n't veto a single spending bill .
( His only veto was of a bill to loosen restrictions on federally funded stem - cell research . )
He did sign massive tax cuts , and revenues increased only 21 percent during the same period .
Education
The President called for reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act , saying :
Bush : Students are performing better in reading and math , and minority students are closing the achievement gap ... the No Child Left Behind Act has worked for America 's children .
According to the government 's own National Center on Education Statistics , the overall achievement gap between minority students and white students has decreased between 2002 , when Bush signed the law , and 2005 .
But the act 's impact on math and reading scores is debatable .
Students in 4th and 8th grades performed at historic high levels in math in 2005 .
However , scores had been on the rise since before the law passed .
In reading , there was no difference between 4th graders ' scores in 2002 and 2005 , and the scores of 8th graders actually dropped two points in that interval .
The reading scores in 2005 were barely different from those in 1992 .
The Economy
When it came to describing the economy , Bush was pretty much on the mark :
Bush : Unemployment is low , inflation is low , and wages are rising .
In fact , the 4.5 percent unemployment rate for December was well below the historical average .
For all months since 1948 , when the BLS started publishing its current statistical series , the average rate has been 5.6 percent .
The current rate is not far above the 4.2 percent rate that prevailed when Clinton left office .
Inflation remains reasonably low .
The Consumer Price Index rose 2.5 percent during 2006 , less than the 3.4 percent rise of 2005 .
And it 's also true that wages are rising , and finally rising faster than inflation .
According to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics , average weekly earnings for rank - and - file workers rose 2.1 percent last year even after adjustment for inflation .
But last year 's rise came after many years of stagnation .
In December workers were earning only 2.9 percent more per week than when Bush took office , taking inflation into account .
Job Gain
The President puffed up his description of the economy using an apparently bogus number .
And in fact , when we dug into this we found that the White House has been using inflated numbers for job gains for more than four months .
Bush :
We 're now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth , in a recovery that has created 7.2 million new jobs -- so far .
The 7.2 million figure is correct according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , counting an unusually large upward adjustment in the figures for total non-farm employment that the BLS announced in October .
However , as in the past , Bush concentrated only on the period since August 2003 , which was the low point of the prolonged job slump that plagued the first 2 - 1/ 2 years of his presidency .
Since 2.7 million jobs were lost that time , the net gain from the time he took office has been 4.6 million jobs , a respectable number but still not so large as the one Bush highlighted .
Democratic Response
In contrast to the President 's upbeat description of the economy , Democratic Sen. James Webb of Virginia painted a rather bleak picture :
Webb : Wages and salaries for our workers are at all - time lows as a percentage of national wealth , even though the productivity of American workers is the highest in the world .
As previously mentioned , real wages ( after inflation ) are actually rising , and certainly not at " an all - time low . "
When we asked what Webb was talking about , his aides cited a recent article by the Economic Policy Institute , a liberal think tank , that cited " unprecedented income inequality . "
Another liberal - leaning think tank , The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , using data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis , found that wages and salaries as a share of all national income was at an all time low .
In other words , income from such things as stock , bonds and rents is rising faster than paychecks .
Lori Hoag , a spokeswoman for the dairy unit of Monsanto , said her company did provide financial support to Afact .
But Ms. Hoag asserted that the group is led by farmers , not Monsanto .
“ They make all the governing decisions for their organization , ” she said .
“ Monsanto has nothing to do with that . ”
Afact has come together as a growing number of consumers are choosing milk that comes from cows that are not treated with the artificial growth hormone .
Even though the Food and Drug Administration has declared the synthetic hormone safe , many other countries have refused to approve it , and there is lingering concern among many consumers about its impact on health and the welfare of cows .
The marketplace has responded , and now everyone from Whole Foods Market to Wal - Mart Stores sells milk that is labeled as coming from cows not treated with the hormone .
Some dairy industry veterans say it ’s only a matter of time before nearly all of the milk supply comes from cows that were n’t treated with Posilac .
According to Monsanto , about a third of the dairy cows in the United States are in herds where Posilac is used .
And the trend might not stop with milk .
Kraft is planning to sell cheese labeled as having come from untreated cows .
IN his new book , “ True Enough : Learning to Live in a Post - Fact Society , ” Farhad Manjoo , a writer for Salon , argues that “ new communications technologies are loosening the culture ’s grip on what people once called ‘ objective reality . ’ ”
In an excerpt posted this week , he looks at an area where facts often become particularly slippery , specifically perceived bias in the news media against , of all things , a technology company : Apple .
“ Last year , ” Mr. Manjoo writes , “ I praised the iPhone in something of the way Romeo once praised Juliet :
The device , I said , is revolutionary  ‘ it marks a new way of life .
One day we ’ll all have iPhones , or things that aim to do what this first one does , and your life will be better for it . ’ ”
But because he mentioned that the phone was a bit pricey , “ several readers alleged that I was an Apple - hater . ”
One wrote him to ask , “ Does Salon actually pay you or are you being paid under the table by rival companies ? ”
There is a compulsions of wearing disposable face masks whenever people are exposed to germs in the air and particles and residues that are hazardous to health .
Either in the form of local spread of the disease or in the worst case if the spread takes the shape of a pandemic , face shield and masks are always helpful in keeping the breathing issues away .
It is a general concept that wearing 3M Masks and in risky conditions wearing n95 respirator is essential in order to keep ourselves safe from the germs in the air that could enter into the breathing tract .
But sometimes it is seen that wearing a 3 M 8511 mask or n95 masks is not necessary in the United States .
It is not because they would work as per their guaranteed performance but not wearing them may be because of some issues with the wearer .
In some cases , the use of is not necessary to protect the wearer from getting into other troubles which may be troublesome or sometimes life threatening .
There are different possibilities for everyone to choose whichever suits them or according to the conditions .
Despite the effectiveness of kn95 masks , some people may not be able to breathe easily through the masks .
Like if they are athletes and doing practice , have breathing issues or the kids below age of 2 years .
It is recommended that kids who are not even 2 years old may not wear any kind of ace masks to make sure they breathe easy and have no troubles .
Also people who are not able to put off the mask on their own have certain disabilities or have some impaired limb issues they may not put on a mask because in case of emergencies they might feel problematic in case if they are wearing any kind of face masks .
To make sure all people stay safe , it is made sure that if a person is not capable of wearing 3 M 8210 or any other face mask or they are not sure where to buy n95 masks they may make it sure that they keep practicing alternative options .
People can make use of social distancing and stay away from crowded areas so that they are not exposed to infected people or patients .
In addition to that , keeping hands and clothes clean and the use of hand sanitizer also makes it easier to stay away from the germs and particles that are causing the disease .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Citigroup Inc C.N said on Tuesday it plans to sell $ 3 billion of common stock to bolster its capital levels , sending its shares down in after - hours trading .

The largest U.S. bank is raising capital after suffering a $ 15 billion net loss over the last two quarters , and reporting more than $ 45 billion of write - downs and credit losses since June 30 .
Chief Financial Officer Gary Crittenden said in a statement that Citigroup had received “ strong ” interest in the public offering .
The company said the issue may grow in size .
Since late 2007 , Citigroup has raised more than $ 36 billion of capital , including last week ’s sale of $ 6 billion of preferred stock .
The bank is also selling assets , such as a $ 12 billion leveraged loan portfolio it sold this month to private equity investors .
Analysts said selling shares makes sense after Citigroup stock rose 46 percent from the low of $ 18.00 on March 17 , a level not seen since October 1998 , on optimism that the worst of the write - downs may have passed .
The offering is the first in Citigroup ’s recent capital - raising to involve common stock .
“ Obviously it ’s dilutive , but it ’s smarter than going out and having to pay a high premium for a preferred issuance . ” said William Smith , chief executive of Smith Asset Management in New York , which owns Citigroup shares .
Citigroup plans to sell the stock on Wednesday , people briefed on the matter said .
The U.S. Federal Reserve is also widely expected to cut interest rates that day .
If the central bank suggests that stability is returning to the financial system , bank stocks may rally , which could help Citigroup get a better price for its shares .
Citigroup is one of many large banks and brokerages worldwide to raise capital and shed assets after ramping up for years on subprime mortgages and other debt that has gone sour .
“ What ’s amazing is , as horrible as this sector is , however much everybody beats it down all the time , there seems to be an endless stream of people who are more than willing to throw money at these guys , ” Smith added .
ONE OF MANY
Shares of Citigroup , a Dow Jones industrial average .DJI component , fell 80 cents , or 3 percent , to $ 25.52 in after - hours electronic trading .
They had fallen 49 cents during regular trading .
Citigroup ’s market value is about $ 138 billion , based on the closing price and reported shares outstanding as of March 31 .
Among other U.S. banks to raise capital this month have been Bank of America Corp BAC.N , Wachovia Corp WB.N , Washington Mutual Inc WM.N and National City Corp NCC.N .
Citigroup said its common stock offering , combined with recent preferred share offerings , will leave its Tier - 1 capital ratio as of March 31 at 8.5 percent on a pro forma basis .
The bank on April 18 reported a 7.7 percent Tier - 1 ratio .
The ratio measures a bank ’s ability to cover losses .
Regulators say 6 percent implies a “ well - capitalized ” bank .
Citigroup ’s own investment bankers are arranging the latest stock offering .

Other people tipsBefore moving on to the tips for getting better PHP jobs , let me start by the announcement of this new PHP professionals search engine .
As you may recall , last November the PHPClasses site launched a new directory to list professionals available for working on PHP jobs .... That was the first step of a broader plan to make the PHPClasses site a place where all sorts of PHP professionals can meet businesses willing to hire them .
As it was released initially , this directory was not as useful as it could be because businesses were not able to check if the listed professionals had the skills they needed .
Therefore , after a few more months of development , the PHP professionals directory now has a search engine that lets businesses search professionals by skill .
The search interface consists of a form that lets anybody specify the skills of the professionals they are looking for ....
The form is split over several pages with tab buttons that the users can click to quickly switch to each of the pages .
On each page you can see several groups of skills .
The first page presents a few check boxes that to specify desired activities of the professionals being searched , such as : PHP developer , Web designer , systems administrator , and SEO ( Search Engine Optimization ) professional .
The other pages present several groups of skills to filter the search according to the desired level of experience in terms of years or months experience of the professionals on several aspects like : programming languages , databases , operating systems and PHP frameworks .
Currently , the form only presents skills that are frequently requested by employers .
This form may be extended in the future to accommodate other skills not yet listed here .
Once you have selected the relevant skills of the professionals you are looking for , just use the search button to retrieve the results .
A new page will appear with a list of professionals and a map of the world with icons pointing where the professionals are located .... This page will show only upto 10 professionals .
You may use links that appear on tabs to browse other professionals if the search retrieved more that 10 professionals .
The results show first featured professionals .
Those are professionals that have a PHPClasses premium subscription .
In case you are not aware , premium subscriptions consist of a package of paid services that provide site users several types of benefits , like being listed first in the professionals searches .
The premium subscriptions were launched last year .
Premium subscriptions are not free , but are quite inexpensive .
Just go to the premium services page if you are interested in acquiring a subscription or you want to know more about the other benefits of the premium subscribers :
Alternatively , you can get a lifetime premium subscription for free if you submit an innovative package to the site and you are one of the nominees of the PHP Programming Innovation Award .
Among other prizes , you may get a free premium subscription as a sign of gratitude from the PHP Classes site for making a valuable contribution .
Just go in the award page to learn more about the details of participation .
Currently the PHP professionals directory has over 1500 professionals from almost 120 countries around the world .
However , if you perform a search for all professionals right now , you only see a few tens of professionals .
That happens because the skills search interface was just released and only a few users have specified their skills .
To appear in the professionals search results you need first to go in the page to enter your professional profile details if you have not done it already .
Just click on the link that says " Add or edit your professional profile " : ... Then you can proceed to the skills editing page : ... This page presents a form very similar to the one in the search by skills page .
The main difference is that for the skills that the search form asked for experience in terms of years or months , but the skills editing form asks for a year and a month when you started learning the respective skill , like for instance the approximate year and month when you started learning PHP , or PHP 5 , or Javascript , and so on ....
If you have other skills that you think may be relevant but they are not listed in the predefined skill options , there is a text area below on which you can enter other skills you have .
Keep in mind that those other skills and your contact information will not be visible to all other site users unless you are a premium subscriber .
However , potential employers that are premium subscribers will be able to see your other skills and have access to your contacts even when you are not a premium subscriber .
In the future the site will add more skills to this form , so then can be used as search criteria .
Regularly the site will send you optional reports by e-mail with statistics of access to your profile .
If there were any new skills added after the last time you updated your profile , the statistics report message will let you know about the new skills , so you can come to the site and keep your skills upto date .
This is the first release of the skills searching interface .
Upcoming improvements include using AJAX to minimize the time that it takes to update the search results pages .
Another improvement will be made to the search form to let you restrict the searched professionals by country .
For now , you can go to the page that lists all professionals of a given country and perform the search from there .
In that case , it will only retrieve professionals from that country .
In the future the site will also provide an efficient means to let businesses send job proposals to the available professionals .
That will take some time though .
If you have suggestions for other improvements , please follow - up with comment to this article .
1 . Qualify yourself to stand out from the crowdOnce in a while I see PHP developers complaining that the market does not pay PHP developers very well , there is a lot of competition , and the developers of other languages , like Java , are better paid .
It seems to me there are some misunderstandings .
The job market follows the law of the offer and demand .
This means that if there are too many job candidates for a few job openings , candidates tend to compete in price and accept lower salaries to take take the job .
However , the reality is that PHP is the leading language for Web development .
There is a very large demand for qualified PHP developers .
There is no shortage of businesses willing to pay good salaries to well qualified developers .
The same goes for Java .
The Java job market in average tends to pay more because Java applications tend to require the knowledge of more complicated application frameworks and tools .
It is not unusual for Java jobs to require that candidates have a college degree to qualify .
If do not have a college degree in computing science or in a similar area , you should consider very seriously to get one .
If you have given up because it was too hard or too expensive , consider trying to get back and finish your degree as soon as possible .
It is not easy , but if you can make it you will not regret the sacrifice .
If it is not viable to get a degree , there are plenty of PHP training courses and certification exams you can take to qualify yourself .
It is not the same as taking a college degree , but it is better than not have any qualification to make you outstand from the crowd .
2 .
Stay upto date with the latest trends
The Web development is evolving and every year there are new technologies and approaches to develop Web applications .
AJAX and Web services APIs are no longer the new thing .
The new thing is taking Web applications and make them run offline with a network connection .
There are technologies like Google Gears , or Adobe Air and other similar products for that purpose .
Try to learn about these technologies and how they can be used to develop better applications , so you will be ready to get on the next job that will require them .
Since those are new technologies , very few people are qualified to work with them .
Therefore , jobs that require knowledge on these technologies tend to pay better .
Still these new things will become old news sooner rather than later .
But you do not need to despair if you never know what is the new new thing to pay attention .
There are plenty of good blogs that talk about Web startup companies are working on , like for instance TechCrunch or GigaOM .
Subscribe their news RSS feeds to stay upto date with the latest trends in Web technologies and application development .
If you want to focus more on PHP development , keep up with the latest news and PHP buzz following sites like PHPDeveloper.org , Planet PHP , Zend DevZone , Dzone , or listen to PHP podcasts .3 . Get more exposure to yourself in the PHP community Another way to stand out from the crowd is to participate more in the activities of the PHP community .
It is great if you can afford attending to several PHP events , local user group meetings and conferences that happen world wide .
The PHP site has a calendar of such events that you may consider to follow : Better than attending to such events is to participate as a speaker presenting a project , a technology , a library or a methodology you have been working on .
If you participate as a speaker with an interesting presentation , the organization of some events may even cover for your expenses .
Another way to get greater exposure is to participate in initiatives on which you are required to develop a project of exceptional interest , like for instance the Google Summer of Code or even the PHPClasses Innovation Award .
Participation on these initiatives is important enough to be mentioned in your resume .
4 .
Advertise yourself conveniently
If you want to get a better job you need to let the potential employers know that you are available .
If you participate in community events and other activities as suggested above , you may even get potential employers to ask you if you are interested in working for them .
If you are not able to do that , you need to find alternatives .
Posting your resume in job boards is usually the way to go for people looking for a new job .
Adding yourself to the PHP professionals directory as explained above is also another way to advertise yourself .
However , if you are already in a job and you do not want your current employer to know that you are willing to move to another job , advertising your availability under your real name , may not be convenient .
That is why the PHPClasses site allow you to list yourself in the professionals directory under a different name entered the " Business name " field .
This way you will not take the chance to be noticed by your current employer .
Alternatively you can just watch the newsletters or RSS feeds of new jobs that job boards or other sites like PHPDeveloper publish .
This will take you some time to keep track of the new jobs and you may need to wait for a while until a new opportunity of your interest arrives .
But it is still a solution to get new jobs without letting your current employer know .
5 .
Do well on job interviews
Once you find a new job opportunity , usually you need to go to an interview before you are accepted .
What you say and the way you behave in the interview is often very critical to succeed and get the job .
If you are not experienced with job interviews , you may loose the opportunity if you behave or say things that hint the interviewer that you are not the right person for the job .
The obvious tip is not never lie or be caught in contradiction .
Employers usually deposit a significant level of trust to their employers about private details of their businesses .
If you lie or make contradictory statements in your job interview , the interviewer deducts that you are not trustworthy and you may loose the job opportunity .
Some companies hire human resources consultants to perform certain tests that evaluate your psychological profile .
One type of tests is handwriting analysis .
They ask you to sign or write a text in a paper by hand during the job interview .
Then your handwriting is analyzed to detect traces of your attitude that may be inconvenient to the company .
Another kind of test is the psycho-technical exams .
There are many variants of this type of exams .
One of the variants consists in asking you many questions about different topics .
Often the same exam asks the same question in different ways .
If you provide contradictory answers , that may hint the job interviewer that you may not be trustworthy and you loose the job opportunity .
So , other than not lying , do not try to be smart and guess what the interviewer wants to know beyond what is being asked .
Just be objective and answer the question with confidence .
Another problem of failed job interviews happens when candidates express that they have goals that do not interest the companies .
For instance , usually businesses want to hire somebody that work on a project for as long as it lasts .
When asked why they want to get that job , some candidates tell that they want to get more money and add that company to their resume .
This may be a problem to the company because you may be hinting that you will leave the company in the middle of a project if you find a better paid job .
So , you may not be the right candidate for the job .
It is very important that not only you say it but also feel that you will like to work in that company , not just for the money or improving your resume .
6 .
Get ready to adapt to a new company culture
You should try to learn the aspects of the business and culture of the company that you like and emphasize that in the job interview as a great motivation to want to work there .
You also should express that you are willing to adapt to aspects of the company culture that you are not familiar .
Never try to push your own preferences unless that is a good thing for the company 's business .
For instance if the company develops applications with framework X , do not try to push framework Y just because you prefer it .
Refactoring applications to switch from framework X to Y is often inconvenient because it costs time and money to refactor the applications .
If you realize that the company works with libraries and tools different from your preference , but you really want to work on that company , emphasize that you are willing to adapt in the job interview .
7 .
Evolve in your career making your employer profit moreOnce you are working in a company , it is up to you to make it as good as possible .
If you do well , you may evolve your career even within the same company .
Companies are for - profit businesses .
Therefore the more you contribute to the profit of the company business , the more valuable you become to the company .
Profit is revenue minus expenses .
So you have two ways to contribute to the company 's profit , either by improving the company revenue or reduce the company expenses .
If you working in a technical position like being a PHP developer , it may seem that you cannot influence much the company revenue or expenses .
However , there are plenty of a ways you can influence .
For instance , if you develop tools or libraries that makes the company Web applications spend less memory , the company may need less servers to handle the same level of Web site audience .
Another example , if the company 's Web sites need to be secured , you can suggest tools to audit the security of the Web site servers .
There are plenty of security audit services , but to perform basic audits that may find common vulnerabilities , there are Open Source tools like Nessus that may help finding and closing existing holes .
There are some security audit companies that use Open Source tools like this to sell auditing services .
However , if you do some research and find tools like this that you company can use , you may save a lot of money in needless expenses .
Reducing the expenses is good but improving the company revenue is even better .
Nowadays there are several ways that companies can use to generate additional revenue from their sites .
If your company is not aware of these , you can do your research and find which ways can be used to generate more revenue .
For instance , you may have heard of Google AdSense program .
This program lets
Web site owners generate revenue from advertising that appears on site pages or search result pages .
AdSense is great .
A good part of the PHPClasses site revenue comes from Google AdSense .
But just putting AdSense ads just by itself it may not work as well as it could .
There are plenty of small tips you can apply to maximize AdSense revenue .
Sometime ago I have published some of those tips in this page : ... Another important aspect to maximize Web site revenue is related with search engines .
Search engines are responsible for sending a lot of traffic to Web sites .
That traffic may convert to more product sales or more advertising revenue to the company .
However , to maximize the number of visits sent to your company site pages they need to be well ranked in search engine sites , so they appear first in the result pages .
There are plenty of things to do in this area , which is called Search Engine Optimization : SEO .
If you have good SEO experience , your SEO skills may improve your company revenue significantly .
SEO consultants tend to be very well paid because of that .
There are plenty of resources from which you can learn and obtain good SEO skills .
If you want to get a good book to get started or improve your current SEO skills , you may want to read the " Professional Search Engine Optimization with PHP " book that was reviewed in the PHPClasses site some time ago .... 8 . Preserve your jobNowadays , for most people a job is not forever .
Often companies go through periods of crisis and need to layoff part of the employees .
It is common to see regularly 10 % of the work force of a company being laid off .
This is normal , it is called pruning .
Under periods of more severe crisis , companies may need to layoff much more than 10 % of the personnel .
Currently it is said that the United States is near a recession period .
That may force companies to lay off some of their employees .
Some analysts say that things may get worse because after the Olympic Games China may reduce their imports .
China has been investing a lot on infrastructure to appear well in the Olympics .
So after the games it is possible that they reduce the imported goods .
This may affect significantly the economy of many other countries that export to China .
Regardless if the worse happens or not , you must be ready to eventual job cuts in your company .
Loosing a job is often very traumatic .
So , you would better do what you need to do to not be one of the people that may be laid off .
If you do well what was suggested above and contribute to the maximize the company profit , that may save you from loosing the job .
But there may be other factors .
If you show consistent dedication to your company , you may not be the first to be sent out .
You can show dedication by being a good colleague to your fellow co-workers and especially the manager that is your boss .
If you provide them valuable input to help them doing their job better , rest assured that they will not want you to leave even in a period of crisis .
9 .
Get ready to move on to a better job
If you are not satisfied with your current job , there are several things you can do to improve that situation .
One of the things is to talk about your problems with your manager .
If you have shown dedication , contributed significantly to make the company profit more , and you feel you deserve a better position and a better salary , tell your manager that .
If you did that and there seems to not be much hope to improve your situation , you may need to seek a better job .
If you find a better job , make sure you leave the previous job without causing harm to the previous employer .
If you are near the end of a project , it is nice from you if you remain their until the end .
If possible , trying to find a capable person that can fill the position that you are about to leave , it is also nice of you .
If you are nice to the companies you have worked when you left , someday that pay up .
You will leaving a door opened to return later and occupy a better position as you wished .

While bear attacks are rare , a man should always be prepared for a bear encounter .
You never know when you ’ll need this information .
How you handle a bear attack depends on the type of bear you come across : grizzly or black .
So the first step in surviving a bear encounter is to know what kind you ’re up against .
Grizzly Bear Dossier
Color : Medium to dark brown .
Medium to dark brown .
Body Shape : Has distinct shoulder hump .
This is a muscle used for digging roots and slashing prey with their massive bear paw .

This is a muscle used for digging roots and slashing prey with their massive bear paw .
Height :
The grizzly bear averages around 6.5 feet in height .
The grizzly bear averages around 6.5 feet in height .
Claws : Grizzly claws are long — up to 4 ″ .
They can usually be seen from a distance .
Grizzly claws are long — up to 4 ″ .
They can usually be seen from a distance .
Location : Grizzlies are mostly found in Canada .
However , populations exist from Alaska and into portions of the northwest United States including Washington , Idaho , the Dakotas , and Montana .
How to Survive a Grizzly Bear Attack
1. Carry bear spray .
Experts recommend that hikers in bear country carry with them bear pepper spray .
UDAP bear spray is a highly concentrated capsaicin spray that creates a large cloud .
This stuff will usually stop a bear in its tracks .
2 . Do n’t run .
When you run , the bear thinks you ’re prey and will continue chasing you .
Do n’t think you can outrun a bear ; they can reach speeds of 30 mph .
So stand your ground .
3 . Drop to the ground in the fetal position and cover the back of your neck with your hands .
If you do n’t have bear spray or the bear continues to charge even after the spray , this is your next best defense .
Hit the ground immediately and curl into the fetal position .
4. Play dead .
Grizzlies will stop attacking when they feel there ’s no longer a threat .
If they think you ’re dead , they wo n’t think you ’re threatening .
Once the bear is done tossing you around and leaves , continue to play dead .
Grizzlies are known for waiting around to see if their victim will get back up .
Black Bear Dossier

Do n’t have the shoulder hump that grizzlies have .
Height : Slightly smaller than grizzlies , 3 - 4 feet tall when on all fours .
Slightly smaller than grizzlies , 3 - 4 feet tall when on all fours .
Claws : Claws are shorter than grizzly claws .
Claws are shorter than grizzly claws .
Location : Black bears are the most common bear in North America .
They live in all the provinces of Canada and 41 and of the 50 American states .
How to Survive a Black Bear Attack
1. Carry bear spray .
As with the grizzly bear , bear spray should be your first line of defense in a bear attack .
2. Stand your ground and make lots of noise .
Black bears often bluff when attacking .
If you show them you mean business , they may just lose interest .
3 . Do n’t climb a tree .
Black bears are excellent climbers .
Climbing up a tree wo n’t help you out here .
4 . Fight back .
If the bear actually attacks , fight back .
Use anything and everything as a weapon — rocks , sticks , fists , and your teeth .
Aim your blows on the bear ’s face , particularly the eyes and snout .
When a black bear sees that their victim is willing to fight to the death , they ’ll usually just give up .
Frequently Asked Questions
Will a gunshot kill a bear ?
A pistol , like a 9 mm , may kill a black bear if it ’s within a few feet and strikes the head or heart .
It wo n’t be immediate though , so do n’t rely on it .
A 12 - gauge may be more effective , but again , it ’s no guarantee .
Against a grizzly , it ’s quite possible you ’ll just piss it off .
With either type of bear , do n’t rely on a gun to save your life in the event of an attack .
Bear spray is actually going to be more effective .
How can you tell if a bear is stalking you ?
Bears do n’t actually stalk their prey very well .
They ’re large , lumbering animals that are n’t able to keep quiet very well .
That said , if a bear continues to look at you and follows you with its eyes , rather than walking off , stay alert .
Which bear is more aggressive ?
Grizzly bears are by far the more aggressive bear ; black bears are actually known for being one of the more tolerant bear species and will almost always back away from the prospect of a fight .
How do you avoid bear attacks / encounters in the first place ?
Hike in groups , stay on trails , and talk / sing loudly if you ’re in an area that has seen high bear activity .
Bells hung on your pack also work , but are less effective than other loud noises .
Can a bear outrun a human ?
Absolutely !
Bears can run 20 - 30 mph .
Definitely do not try to outrun a black bear or a grizzly bear .

Another Angry Black Preacher
WASHINGTON -- Let 's ask the hard question about the Rev. Jeremiah Wright :
Is he as far outside the African - American mainstream as many of us would like to think ?
Because Barack Obama 's speech on race in America was so candid about both the legitimacy of black and white grievances -- and the flaws in those grievances -- it carries the risk of offending almost everyone .
The man who , by parentage , is half black and half white took it upon himself to explain each side 's story to the other .
Obama resembled no one so much as the conciliatory sibling in a large and boisterous family shouting : " Please , please , will you listen to each other for a sec ? "
One of the least remarked upon passages in Obama 's speech is also one of the most important -- and the part most relevant to the Wright controversy .
There is , Obama said , a powerful anger in the black community rooted in " memories of humiliation and doubt " that " may not get expressed in public , in front of white co-workers or white friends " but " does find voice in the barbershop or beauty shop or around the kitchen table .
...
And occasionally it finds voice in the church on Sunday morning , in the pulpit and in the pews . "
Yes , black people say things about our country and its injustices to each other that they do n't say to those of us who are white .
Whites also say things about blacks privately that they do n't say in front of their black friends or associates .
One black leader who was capable of getting very angry indeed is the one now being invoked against Wright .
His name is Martin Luther King Jr .
An important book due out next month on King 's rhetoric by Barnard College professor Jonathan Rieder offers a more complex view of King than the sanitized version that is so popular , especially among conservative commentators .
In " The Word of the Lord is Upon Me , " Rieder -- an admirer of King 's -- notes that the civil rights icon was " not just a crossover artist but a code switcher who switched in and out of idioms as he moved between black and white audiences . "
Listen to what King said about the Vietnam War at his own Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta on Feb.
4 , 1968 : " God did n't call America to engage in a senseless , unjust war .
...
And we are criminals in that war .
We 've committed more war crimes almost than any nation in the world , and I 'm going to continue to say it .
And we wo n't stop it because of our pride and our arrogance as a nation .
But God has a way of even putting nations in their place . "
King then predicted this response from the Almighty : " And if you do n't stop your reckless course , I 'll rise up and break the backbone of your power . "
If today 's technology had existed back then , I would imagine the media playing quotations of that sort over and over .
Right - wing commentators would use the material to argue that King was anti-American and to discredit his call for racial and class justice .
King certainly angered a lot of people at the time .
I cite King not to justify Wright 's damnation of America or his lunatic and pernicious theories , but to suggest that Obama 's pastor and his church are not so far outside the African - American mainstream as many would now suggest .
I would also ask my conservative friends who praise King so lavishly to search their consciences and wonder if they would have stood up for him back in 1968 .
These are realities that Obama has forced us to confront , and they are painful .
Wright was operating within a long tradition of African - American outrage , which is one reason why Obama could not walk away from his old pastor in the name of political survival .
Obama 's personal closeness to Wright would have made such a move craven in any event .
I 'm a liberal and I loathe the anti-American things Wright said precisely because I believe that the genius of our country is its capacity for self - correction .
Progressivism and , yes , hope itself depend upon a belief that personal conversion and social change are possible , that flawed human beings are capable of transcending their pasts and their failings .
Obama understands the anger of whites as well as blacks , but he 's placed a bet on the other side of King 's legacy that converted rage into the search for a beloved community .
This does not prove that Obama deserves to be president .
It does mean that he deserves to be judged on his own terms and not by the ravings of an angry preacher .
Christian A. Torres ’s neighbors in Queens remember his pride , how he stepped tall when he first wore the uniform of a New York City police officer .
He ’d earned a 3.6 grade - point average at John Jay College of Criminal Justice while holding down one or two part - time jobs .
He became a leader in the Police Department ’s cadet program .
In July 2007 , he traded his books for a gun belt and joined the Police Academy .
Six months later , he was on patrol in the Brooklyn subways .
But on Friday , Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said that as he moved from cadet to recruit to probationary police officer , Christian A. Torres , 21 , was something else as well :
A serial bank robber .
Officer Torres , police officials said , committed three robberies at two branches of Sovereign Bank  twice in Manhattan and once in Pennsylvania  apparently using some of the $ 118,305 for a new car , for a diamond engagement ring for his girlfriend and to pay off his student loans .
He grew increasingly brazen , the police said : at the first robbery , in June 2007 , he simply handed a note to the teller demanding money .
At the second , in November , they said , he showed a gun in his belt , which police described as an imitation weapon .
At the third , on Thursday , he waved his personal 9 - millimeter gun at three bank employees as he demanded cash in $ 20 , $ 50 and $ 100 bills , the police said .
Both Stuart Staniford 's recent " Powering Civilization to 2050 " post and ( to a lesser extent ) Scientific American's " Solar Grand Plan " concentrated on using photovoltaic solar cells to provide the bulk of our energy needs .
While both thin film and traditional silicon based PV cells seem to set new efficiency records every couple of months ( a CIGS cell recently reached 19.9 % efficiency in lab tests , and multi-crystalline silicon PV cells recently reached 19.5 % efficiency ) , the most promising mechanism for large scale solar power generation seems to be solar thermal power ( often referred to as concentrating solar power , or CSP ) .
The biggest source of energy on this earth , now or ever , is solar .
I used to think it was so diffuse as to be impractical .
But I ’ve changed my mind .
It ’s not impractical … This technology exists right now .
So if we just convert the technology and research and facilities of the oil and gas industries , the chemical industry and the electrical power industry — we could do it tomorrow .
All we ’ve got to do is throw our weight into it .
While we spend a lot of time talking about traditional energy sources based on depleting resources that are extracted from the ground , I think its important to remember that the fastest growing sources of energy are solar and wind , and that these will never run out .
As M King Hubbert put it regarding solar power in particular :
While this subject has been covered previously at TOD ( from a slightly UK - centric viewpoint ) , I thought it was worth revisiting as solar thermal power has received a lot of press attention lately , as experience with generating power in this way grows and the potential becomes clearer to a larger number of parties .
History
Concentrated sunlight has been used to perform useful tasks for many centuries .
A legend claims Archimedes used polished shields to concentrate sunlight on a Roman fleet to repel them from Syracuse in 212 BC .
Leonardo Da Vinci considered using large scale solar concentrators to weld copper in the 15th century .
Auguste Mouchout successfully powered a steam engine with sunlight in 1866 - the first known example of a concentrating solar - powered mechanical device .
Concentrating Solar Power ( CSP ) systems use lenses or mirrors combined with tracking systems to focus sunlight which is then used to generate electricity .
The primary mechanisms for concentrating sunlight are the parabolic trough , the solar power tower ( not to be confused with solar updraft towers ) and the parabolic dish .
The high temperatures produced by CSP systems can also be used to provide heat and steam for a variety of applications ( cogeneration ) .
CSP technologies require direct sunlight ( insolation ) to function and are of limited use in locations with significant cloud cover .
Solar thermal power plants have been in commercial use in southern California since 1985 .
An area of desert around 250 km by 250 km covered with CSP power generation could supply all the world 's current electricity demand .
Solar thermal plants can be built in their entirety within a few years - much faster than many conventional power projects .
Solar thermal plants are built almost entirely with modular , commodity materials ( and thus have short development and construction times ) and do not encounter the sort of opposition on environmental grounds that traditional forms of power generation like coal and nuclear face .
Operational plants include :
* US ( California ) - 354 MW FPL 's Solar Energy Generating Systems ( SEGS ) plant , using parabolic troughs
* US ( Arizona ) - 1 MW Acciona Energy 's Saguaro Solar Generating Station using parabolic troughs
* Spain ( Seville ) - 11 MW
Abengoa 's PS10 solar tower
* Australia ( NSW ) - 35 MW Liddell Power Station using fresnel reflectors
* US ( Nevada ) - 64 MW Acciona Energy 's Nevada Solar
One plant ( not to be confused with the Solar One / Solar Two experimental plants ) using parabolic troughs
Plants currently under construction :
* Spain ( Seville ) - 20 MW
Abengoa 's PS20 solar tower
* Spain ( Seville ) - 20 MW ( each ) Abengoa 's PS20 and AZ20 solar towers
* Spain ( Seville ) - 50 MW ( each ) Abengoa 's Solnova 1 and 3 using parabolic troughs ( 5 plants planned in all )
* Spain ( Andalusia ) - 17 MW
Sener 's Solar
Tres solar tower ( molten salt energy storage )
* Spain ( Andalusia ) - 50 MW ( each ) Sener 's Andasol I , II and III plants ( molten salt energy storage )
Solar Thermal Heating Up
There has been a spate of new announcements regarding solar thermal power over the past year - there are over 5,800 MW of solar thermal plants in the planning stages worldwide .
The company receiving the most attention seems to be Ausra , a company set up by Dr David Mills ( who pioneered the CSP plant at the Liddell power plant in New South Wales using compact linear Fresnel - reflector technology ) with backing from Vinod Khosla and Kleiner , Perkins , Caulfield & Byers ( see here for a brief demo of how their technology works ) .
Mills estimates that solar thermal plants could provide more than 90 percent of current U.S. power demand at prices competitive with coal and natural gas .
" There 's almost no limit to how much you can put into the grid , " he says .
Mills presented a paper ( pdf ) at the IEA SolarPACES conference in Las Vegas recently which revealed some interesting statistics about the construction cost of solar - thermal technologies : US $ 3,000 per kW of capacity , estimating this will drop to US $ 1,500 per kW over the next " several " years .
The New York Times last year quoted GE Energy executives estimating coal plant construction between US $ 2,000 and US $ 3,000 per kW .
Ausra says it can generate electricity for 10 cents per kWh ( close to the current cost using natural gas ) , and it expects the price to drop even further .
According to Technology Review :
What distinguishes Ausra 's design is its relative simplicity .
In conventional solar - thermal plants such as Solel 's , a long trough of parabolic mirrors focuses sunlight on a tube filled with a heat - transfer fluid , often some sort of oil or brine .
The fluid , in turn , produces steam to drive a turbine and produce electricity .
Ausra 's solar collectors employ mass - produced and thus cheaper flat mirrors , and they focus light onto tubes filled with water , thus directly producing steam .
Ausra 's collectors produce less power , but that power costs less to produce .
Ausra is initially planning a 177 MW plant in California , and has committed to supply 1,500 MW of power to Californian utilities PG&E and FPL .
They are also rumoured to be moving in to Texas as well .
PG&E have also signed a 25 - year deal with Ausra competitor Solel Solar Systems of Israel to buy power from a 553 MW solar thermal plant that Solel is developing in California 's Mojave Desert .
FPL has also hired Solel to upgrade the SEGS solar - thermal plants it operates in the Mojave .
Another PG&E contract is with BrightSource to supply between 500 MW and 900 MW of power per year from solar tower plants in California , beginning in 2011 , with the first of a number of 100 MW facilities being built in Ivanpah .
Other companies active in the US include eSolar ( linked to Google 's energy initiatives ) , RocketDyne and SkyFuel .
Abu Dhabi's Masdar Initiative and Spain 's Sener are have formed a joint venture to build and operate concentrating solar power plants across the world 's sunbelt regions called Torresol Energy .
Independently of Torresol , Masdar is developing its 100 MW " Shams 1 " CSP plant in Abu Dhabi .
Algeria and Germany have signed a a joint research agreement for the development of a new generation of large - scale , low - cost solar thermal power plants ( which could contribute to the Desert - TREC vision of large scale CSP in North Africa powering Europe , which I once dubbed " Deserts Of Gold " ) .
More new plants are being planned in :
* Algeria - 20 MW
Abengoa 's plant in Hassi-R'Mel
* Australia - 10 MW Queensland State Government facility in Cloncurry
* Australia - 154 MW
Solar Systems and TRUEnergy 's plant in Mildura
* Egypt - 70 MW plant in Kuraymat
* Iran - 17 MW plant in Yazd
* Israel - 250 MW plant in Ashalim
* Morocco - 20 MW
Abengoa 's plant in Ain-Ben- Mathar
* US ( Arizona ) - 280 MW Abengoa and Arizona Public Service 's plant in Gila Bend
* US ( California ) - 50 MW Inland Energy 's plant in Victorville
* US ( California ) - 250 MW FPL Energy 's Beacon Solar Energy Project
Feasibility studies are also being done in Oman , China and Mexico .
Most of the plants in the middle east are combined gas / solar thermal plants , with the numbers above representing the solar component only .
Energy Storage
One of the key differentiating factors between solar thermal power and solar PV is that heat energy is more easily ( and efficiently ) stored than electricity , with solar thermal plants often combining energy storage into the design to enable around - the - clock , dispatchable electricity generation .
Most solar thermal plants are looking to use molten salt for storing energy - other alternatives being developed are graphite ( in the Cloncurry development ) , heated water / steam ( for the Ausra plants ) and heat - transfer oil such as therminol ( for the Abengoa plant in Arizona ) .
Cost
The existing plants prove that concentrated solar power is practical , but costs must decrease .
Electricity from solar thermal plants currently costs between US$ 0.13 per kilowatt hour ( kWh ) and US$ 0.17 per kWh , depending on the location of the plant and the amount of sunshine it receives .
Conventional power plants generate electricity for between US$ 0.05 and US$ 0.15 per kilowatt hour ( not including any carbon taxes or cap and trade related costs ) but in most places it 's below US $ 0.10 ( wind power generally costs around US $ 0.08 per kWh ) .
An economic analysis released last month by Severin Borenstein ( pdf ) , director of the University of California 's Energy Institute , notes that solar thermal power will become cost competitive with other forms of power generation decades before photovoltaics will , even if greenhouse - gas emissions are not taxed aggressively .
In 2006 a report by the Solar Task Force ( pdf ) of the Western Governors ’ Association concluded that CSP could provide electricity at US$ 0.10 per kWh or less by 2015 if 4 GW of plants were constructed .
According to Bernhard Milow from the German Aerospace Center ( DLR ) electricity from solar thermal plants could cost as little as € 0.04 per kWh [ US $ 0.06 / kWh ] by 2020 , with well sited plants potentially generating power at lower prices than coal .
The US DOE began supporting large scale CSP last year , aiming to reduce the cost of CSP power to 7-10 ¢ / kWh by 2015 and 5 - 7¢ / kWh by 2020 .
The DOE estimated that reaching these cost targets could lead to installation of up to 35,000 MW of new generating capacity by 2030 in the US .
James Fraser at The Energy Blog commented at the time that it was 5 years too late ( given recent commercial activity in the area ) and that PV solar may beat these price goals before solar thermal does , but that more solar options are good in any case , as both PV and thin film solar manufacturing will be constrained by availability for materials for some time as production continues to accelerate .
Another estimate from Sandia labs showed solar thermal costs ( for solar towers ) could fall to around 4 cents per kWh by 2030 .
Stirling Engines
Another variant on the solar thermal power theme are Stirling engine based power plants , which generate electricity directly rather than first storing the energy as heat .
Stirling Energy Systems seems to be the leader in this field , with some reports talking about agreements with Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric for up to 1.75 GW of power .
The company recently set a new world record of 31.25 % for Solar - to - Grid conversion efficiency .
Other companies pursuing stirling engine based solutions are Infinia and SunPower ( not to be confused with its larger namesake in the PV industry ) .
Passive Solar Thermal - Solar Hot Water And Others
Generating power is n't the only way to utilise solar thermal energy of course - solar hot water is a very cheap and efficient way of replacing gas or electricity usage with solar energy .
Solar hot water systems are in widespread use in Australia , with state and federal governments encouraging people to upgrade their home hot water systems to solar - almost cost free in some states .
The New Zealand government is also encouraging the use of solar hot water systems .
Some larger scale uses of solar thermal hot water are being put in place by Abengoa in Texas and Colorado .
Solar hot water is in wide use in China as well , with the city of Rizhao becoming somewhat famous for achieving widespread takeup of the units .
An unusual variation of the direct capture of solar energy in the form of heat is from a Dutch company that has developed a " Road Energy System " that siphons heat from roads and parking lots to heat offices and homes .
And one final use of solar thermal power - it can keep your house warm , if your windows face the right way , and even better , have insulating glass that does n't let the heat out again - which could help make your building energy positive .

Outmaneuvered by raucous Ron Paul supporters , Nevada Republican
Party leaders abruptly shut down their state convention and now must resume the event to complete a list of 31 delegates to the GOP national convention .
Outnumbered supporters of expected Republican presidential nominee John McCain faced off Saturday against well - organized Paul supporters .
A large share of the more than 1,300 state convention delegates enabled Paul supporters to get a rule change positioning them for more national convention delegate slots than expected .
" I 've seen factions walk out .
I 've never seen a party walk out , " said Jeff Greenspan , regional coordinator for the Paul campaign .
President Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980
The outline of a deal has almost been reached for Zimbabwe 's President Robert Mugabe to step down , opposition sources have told the BBC .
They say representatives of Mr Mugabe , military chiefs and the opposition have held meetings chaired by South Africa since Saturday 's elections .
The sources said Mr Mugabe would make the announcement on television , but his aides have denied the reports .
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said he was prepared to wait .
In his first public appearance since the election , Mr Tsvangirai did not confirm the reported deal .
The leader of the Movement for Democratic Change held a news conference on Tuesday evening , but did not declare himself winner of the election .
" I prefer to wait until the ZEC [ Zimbabwe Electoral Commission ] confirms the results , " Mr Tsvangirai said .
He said : " Robert Mugabe has said he 's an honest man .
I hope that when the results are announced it 's a true reflection of the vote and that there 's no reason to investigate fraudulent activities . "
Claim and counter - claim
The opposition says it won Saturday 's general elections , but results have been slow to emerge .
ELECTION RESULTS SO FAR Parliamentary constituencies MDC - Tsvangirai : 67 Zanu -PF : 68 Breakaway MDC faction : 5
Yet to declare : 70 Presidential results
None so far Winner needs more than 50 % to avoid run-off Source : ZEC
Results according to ZESN : Morgan Tsvangirai , MDC : 49 % Robert Mugabe , Zanu - PF : 42 % Simba Makoni , Independent : 8 %
Key role for security chiefs Voters react to delays Harare 's mood nosedive
Under the proposed deal , it has been claimed , Mr Tsvangirai would be declared the winner of the presidential race after Mr Mugabe publicly announced he was stepping down .
South Africa has also denied it is involved .
President Mugabe , 84 , came to power 28 years ago at independence , but the economy has been in freefall in recent years .
The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission has not yet given any results in the presidential race , sparking MDC claims that the outcome was being fixed .
BBC correspondent Ian Pannell has spoken to three MDC sources who have claimed a deal had almost been reached .
Run -off vote ?
The sources claim talks brokered by South Africa have been going on in Harare for the last few days , our correspondent says , although Johannesburg denies involvement .
The sources say Mr Tsvangirai 's victory was so overwhelming that Mr Mugabe would have no chance of victory , even in a run-off .
But our correspondent cautions it is in the opposition 's interests to talk up the possibility of Mr Mugabe 's exit and the claims are difficult to verify at the moment .
ROBERT MUGABE Born : 1924 Trained as a teacher 1961 : Married Ghanaian Sally Hayfron 1964 : Imprisoned by Rhodesian government 1980 : Wins post - independence elections 1996 : Marries Grace Marufu 2000 : Loses referendum 2000 : Land invasions start 2002 : Wins presidential polls , dismissed by observers Bright Matonga , Zanu - PF 's Deputy Information Minister , denied any talks were going on with the opposition .
" There are no discussions , no negotiations , and President Mugabe will not be going on state television to announce anything because there 's nothing to announce . "
Earlier , there had been increasing speculation that a second round vote would be needed , as no candidate had yet passed the 50 % threshold required for victory .
The MDC says that Mr Tsvangirai won 60 % of the vote , against 30 % for Mr Mugabe .
Parliamentary results released so far show that the MDC has 72 seats , including five for a breakaway faction of the party , against 68 for Zanu - PF , with 70 still to come .
As he cast his vote on Saturday , Mr Mugabe said : " If you lose an election and are rejected by the people , it is time to leave politics . "
Mr Mugabe has not been seen in public since the election .

What are these ?
President Bush acknowledged Friday that the nation ’s economy was going through troubled times , but cautioned against overreacting to current problems , saying such actions could cause longer - term problems .
Speaking at the Economic Club of New York , Mr. Bush said “ in a free market economy there will be good times and bad times ” and acknowledged “ we ’re going through a hard time . ”
The president ’s remarks came on a day when the Federal Reserve , the nation ’s central bank , had to intervene to provide credit for the troubled Bear Stearns investment company .
Mr. Bush praised the Fed ’s chairman Ben S. Bernanke saying he was “ doing a good job under tough circumstances . ”
Mr. Bush said the economic stimulus package adopted recently by Congress , which includes incentives for investments by business and cash payments for households , would start taking effect by the second quarter of this year and have a greater impact in the third .
“ The challenge is not to do anything foolish in the meantime , ” he said .
Sure , we could make the obligatory Keith Richards gag here , but dinosaur jokes are so Mesozoic Era .
Why do n't we just fast forward to the stories and deliver some Satisfaction instead ?
" Some children sing in choirs , " Mick Jagger has said , " [ and ] others like to show off in front of the mirror . " 
Believe it or not , Jagger was in the former group " “ he
started out as a choir boy .
Growing up on the outskirts of London , he was also a fan of great musicians like Muddy Waters , Leadbelly , and Chuck Berry ( whose " Come On "  would much later turn into the Stones ' first single ) .
Young Keith Richards was equally a fan of classic blues , jazz , and R&B .
He and Jagger went to the same elementary school , but they did n't really hook up until much later in their teens , when Mick was a student at the London School of Economics .
Keith recognized him on a train and , interested in listening to his old schoolmate 's record collection , quickly befriended him .
Why Richards changed his name , Â who was on the Stone 's first bill , and Â the true stories behind Wild Horses , Sympathy for the Devil and Brown Sugar , all after the break .
Eventually Keith learned that Mick was singing in a little band , " doing Buddy Holly numbers at school hops and stuff like that . " 
More crucially , Mick had a friend whose parents happened to be out of town for a couple of weeks , and another friend , Alexis Korner , who owned both an amplifier and a Grundig tape recorder , on which " you could hear how bad you were and still think you were fantastic . " 
The new band started playing small gigs as " Little Boy Blue and the Blue Boys "  at a hole - in - the - wall called the Ealing Club , where Korner introduced them to a buddy of his named Brian Jones , as well as a number of other musicians who would come and go , jamming with the band .
By 1962 they 'd changed their name to The Rollin ' Stones and winnowed down their members to Jagger , Richards , Jones , Ian Stewart on piano , Dick Taylor on bass , and Tony Chapman on drums .
They 'd also started to get some attention .
A guy named George Harrison , who'd had some success singing back - up with the band that would become The Beatles , introduced them to Decca Records executives .
The Stones also hooked up with manager Andrew Oldham , who promptly canned poor Taylor , saying he was n't teen - idol material .
Then Oldham asked Richards to drop the " S "  from his name , hoping to evoke Cliff Richard , the British pop star .
Richards , in a spat with his father , was all too happy to comply .
It was only in the 1980s that he took his original name back after reconciling with his dad , who he had n't spoken to in two decades .
Having made themselves media- ready , the Stones embarked on a tour of Europe and the States .
On their first tour of England , they were packaged with Ike and Tina Turner , Bo Diddley , the Ronettes , the Everly Brothers , and Little Richard .
If we ever invent
a time machine , the first thing we 're doing is getting tickets to that tour .
As for the stories behind their songs , though :
" Satisfaction " 
You'd think this one was spawned during a long , restless night of yearning ( or something like that , anyway ) , but the truth is far more boring :
One night in 1965 , on a tour stop in Clearwater , Florida , Keith Richards woke up in his hotel room with a guitar riff and the words " ca n't get no satisfaction " stuck in his head .
He recorded the riff on a portable tape deck and promptly went back to sleep " “ but since he 'd accidentally left the tape on , the tape ended up containing a good bit of his snoring , too .
" Sympathy for the Devil " 
The lyrics were inspired by Mikhail Bulgakov 's The Master and Margarita , one of the greatest Russian novels of the last hundred years " “ but they also throw out all sorts of later historical references , including WorldWar II and the Kennedy assassinations .
It 's not , by the way , a song about devil - worshipping , although the Stones thrived on the controversy and did n't do much to discourage speculation .
" Ruby Tuesday " 
Another Richards gem , this one 's about a groupie , although if you 're hoping to learn who , you 're out of luck .
Richards is often quoted as saying he does n't remember her name : " It certainly was n't Ruby .
That 's one of those things — some chick you 've
broken up with .
And all you 've got left is the piano and the guitar and a pair of panties .
And it 's goodbye , you know . " 
" Angie " 
The Stones had at least two Angies in their lives — David Bowie 's ex-wife , Angela , who was a friend of Jagger 's , and Angela " Dandelion " 
Richards , daughter of Keith and Anita Pallenberg .
Jagger himself has said that " the truth is that Keith wrote the title .
He said , " ˜Angie . '
And I think it was to do with his daughter .
She 's called Angela .
And then I just wrote the rest of it . "
The " rest of it , "  however , is far more interesting .
It appears , like many other Stones songs , to have been about Jagger 's tumultuous relationship with the singer Marianne Faithfull .
" Wild Horses " 
Faithfull again .
She has said that " wild horses could n't drag me away " were her first words to Jagger after she pulled out of a drug - induced coma in 1969 .
" Before They Make Me Run " 
By the time the Stones wrote this one , Richards was already running " “ the song was recorded while he was out on bail after getting caught with heroin in 1977 .
" Brown Sugar " 
Once you actually listen to the lyrics , it 's pretty hard to rock out to this one :
They 're about slavery and rape .
But a few people continue to argue that maybe
" Brown Sugar "  is an allegory for something else , like , well , heroin .
" Sister Morphine " 
Unbelievably , this one is n't about heroin :
It 's about a car crash and the completely legitimate painkilling medicine given in hospitals .

[ I finally begin to post on the " Hansonian " view of medicine , mentioned here , here , here , here . ]
How useful is medicine , to the average person , wondering if he should go to the doctor or skip it ?
We have perhaps a million medical studies , but how do we combine them into a total estimate of the value of medicine ?
It is hard to see how to correct for many potential biases such as fraud , funding bias , treatment selection bias , publication selection bias , and so on .
These biases can be partially overcome by focusing on studies of the aggregate effects of medicine on the general population , some of which compare millions of people over years .
Such studies usually find no health effect of more medicine , but most are correlation studies , so one may doubt if they controlled for enough relevant factors .
Fortunately , there has been one large randomized experiment on aggregate medicine .
If you remember only one medical study , it should be the RAND health insurance experiment , where from 1974 to 1982 the US government spent $ 50 million to randomly assign 7700 people in six US cities to three to five years each of either free or not free medicine , provided by the same set of doctors .
The plan was to compare five measures of general health , and also 23 physiologic health measures .
From their expanded 1983 New England Journal of Medicine article :
For the average person enrolled in the experiment , we observed two significant positive effects of free care relative to cost - sharing : corrected far vision … was better by 0.1 Snellen lines ( p = 0.001 ) and diagnostic blood pressure was lower by 0.8 mm HG ( p = 0.03 ) .
For the remaining measures … any true differences would be clinically and socially negligible .
For the five general health measures , we could detect no significant positive effect of free care for persons who differed by income .. and by initial health status .
…
Among participants who were judged to be at elevated risk with respect to smoking habits , cholesterol levels , and weight , free care had no detectable effect . …
For persons who were in the upper quartile of the distribution of risk factors included in the risk of dying index , the risk of dying was 10 percent lower on the free than the cost - sharing plans ( p = 0.02 ) .
It has long been obvious that eyeglasses help people see better , and eyeglasses are basically physics , not " medicine , " so that result should be set aside .
Since this experiment looked at thirty measures in total then just by chance one of them should seem significant at the three percent level , explaining the blood pressure result .
The " risk of dying index " effect is mainly just the blood pressure effect , and the index came from a 1976 paper on heart attack risk , which was chosen well after the RAND experiment started , so the statistical significances reported for that clearly did not correct for data mining .
The bottom line is that thousands of people randomly given free medicine in the late 1970s consumed 30 - 40 % more medical services , paid one more " restricted activity day " per year to deal with the medical system , but were not noticeably healthier !
So unless the marginal value of medicine has changed in the last thirty years , if you would not pay for medicine out of your own pocket , then do n’t bother to go when others offer to pay ; on average such medicine is as likely to hurt as to help .
Why is this shocking news unknown to most readers of the weekly health section of the newspaper ?
More tomorrow on the RAND experiment .

After identifying some 7,000 pages of classified memos , e-mails and other records relating to its forced disappearance , secret detention and torture program , the Central Intelligence Agency has refused to release the documents .
Responding to a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit filed last June in federal district court in New York by Amnesty International USA ( AIUSA ) , the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) and the International Human Rights Clinic at NYU School of Law ( NYU IHRC ) , the CIA has filed a motion for summary judgement ( dismissal ) to avoid turning over the files .
Concluding that criminal , administrative or civil investigations resulting from its “ black ” programs were “ virtually inevitable , ” the CIA sought legal advice from the Bush administration ’s Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) , a division of the Justice Department , according to documents filed by Agency lawyers in New York federal court Wednesday , Washington Post reported .
The CIA claims that the materials cannot be released because they relate to communications between CIA and Justice Department attorneys , or discussions with the White House .
Concluding the documents included guidance on the “ legality of certain interrogation techniques , ” the Agency admitted that it requested , and received , legal advice from OLC attorney John Yoo ’s torture shop .
ABC News revealed earlier this month that the National Security Council ’s Principals Committee held high - level discussions at the White House on the use of torture at CIA and Special Operations Command “ ghost prisons ” in Europe , Central Asia , the Middle East and at Guantánamo Bay ’s Camp Delta detention facility .
The meetings included choreographed demonstrations of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques by CIA officers .
According to ABC News , one of the “ principals , ” former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft said : “ Why are we talking about this in the White House ?
History will not judge this kindly . ”
Curiously enough prior to 9/11 , Ashcroft told acting FBI Director Thomas Pickard after multiple briefings related to “ imminent terrorist attacks ” on the United States by al - Qaeda , that “ he did not want to hear this information anymore . ”
Seemingly protected behind an impenetrable wall of impunity built by the Bush administration in the wake of the 9/11 attacks , the CIA is now attempting to shield its top officers from legal and congressional scrutiny by refusing to release these documents .
In response to requests from the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee , the Justice Department informed Congress “ that American intelligence operatives attempting to thwart terrorist attacks can legally use interrogation methods that might otherwise be prohibited under international law , ” The New York Times reported Sunday .
Times ‘ journalist Mark Mazzetti avers ,
The legal interpretation , outlined in recent letters , sheds new light on the still - secret rules for interrogations by the Central Intelligence Agency .
It shows that the administration is arguing that the boundaries for interrogations should be subject to some latitude , even under an executive order issued last summer that President Bush said meant that the C.I.A. would comply with international strictures against harsh treatment of detainees .
…
‘ The fact that an act is undertaken to prevent a threatened terrorist attack , rather than for the purpose of humiliation or abuse , would be relevant to a reasonable observer in measuring the outrageousness of the act , ’ said Brian A. Benczkowski , a deputy assistant attorney general , in the letter , which had not previously been made public .
Senator Ron Wyden ( D - OR ) , a committee member , said that the Bush administration ’s new rules put Geneva Convention restrictions against torture on a “ sliding scale . ”
According to the Center for Constitutional Rights ,
AIUSA , CCR , and NYU IHRC have filed FOIA requests with several U.S. government agencies , including the CIA .
These FOIA requests sought information about individuals who are–or have been–held by the U.S. government or detained with U.S. involvement , and about whom there is no public record .
The requests also sought information about the government ’s legal justifications for its secret detention and extraordinary rendition program .
Comprehensive information about the identities and locations of prisoners in CIA custody–as well as the conditions of their detention and the specific interrogation methods used against them –has never been publicly revealed .
This lack of transparency continues to prevent scrutiny by the public or the courts and leaves detainees vulnerable to abuse and torture . ”
Curt Goering , AIUSA senior deputy executive director told IPS ,
Given what we already know about documents written by Bush administration officials trying to justify torture and other human rights crimes , one does not need a fertile imagination to conclude that the real reason for refusing to disclose these documents has more to do with avoiding disclosure of criminal activity than national security .
The Agency acknowledged in its legal filings that its disappearance and torture program “ will continue . ”
Human rights reports “ indicate that the fate and whereabouts of at least 30 people believed to have been held in secret U.S. custody remain unknown , ” according to CCR .
To this day , comprehensive information about the identities and location of “ ghost prisoners , ” the conditions of their imprisonment and the specific interrogation techniques used against them to induce “ compliance ” have never been revealed .
The organizations involved in the FOIA lawsuit against the CIA will file their response brief next month in U.S. federal court .
2008 Campaign provides the opportunity to build a movement for fundamental change away from militarism
The issue on which Sen. Obama scored the most points in the January 31st debate with Sen. Clinton was the Iraq occupation .
While Iraq has been pushed from the front pages , despite continued carnage , it remains a priority for many voters .
Iraq persists to be an area of weakness for Clinton in the primary .
Indeed , the most recent CNN poll , which has Obama in the lead nationally for the first time , shows Democratic voters trust Clinton more on health care and the economy , but trusted Obama on Iraq .
Iraq is the issue propelling Obama ahead of Clinton .
Obama made a number of points on Iraq in their last debate , finishing with : “ I do n't want to just end the war , but I want to end the mindset that got us into war in the first place . ”
He followed that lofty goal with a promise : “ That 's the kind of leadership that I think we need from the next president of the United States .
That 's what I intend to provide . ”
Obama blames conventional , Washington thinking for the war saying :
“. . . conventional thinking in Washington lined up for war .
The pundits judged the political winds to be blowing in the direction of the President .
Despite , or perhaps because of how much experience they had in Washington , too many politicians feared looking weak and failed to ask hard questions .
Too many took the President at his word instead of reading the intelligence for themselves .
Congress gave the President the authority to go to war .
Our only opportunity to stop the war was lost . ”
The mindset for war often infects Washington .
Since World War II the U.S. has been a nation at war more often than not , and whether at war or peace , consistently invests in building the most powerful military in world history .
Peace Voters have already begun the process of changing that conventional thinking mindset in Washington .
Even Senator Clinton , who has voted for the war from the beginning , is now saying “ I will do everything I can to get as many of our troops out as quickly as possible . ”
She promises to take one to two brigades out per month .
Ending the “ mindset ” of war is essentially the position of the organization I direct , VotersForPeace .
Not only do we want to end the Iraq occupation but also prevent future wars of aggression .
We urge people to take the peace pledge which states : “ I will only vote for or support federal candidates who publicly commit to a speedy end to the Iraq war , and to preventing future ‘ wars of aggression ’ . ”
See VotersForPeace .US .
Obama ’s soaring rhetoric of hope and unity along with the proposition of the U.S. electing the first African American president makes me want to exclaim ‘ eurkea ! ’ finally a candidate who can bring much - needed change to the United States .
And , changing the mindset that leads to war would result in other changes in Washington .
On foreign policy the U.S. will need to work with other countries , not dominate them and rely on negotiation and diplomacy rather than force .
And , to prevent violence , the U.S. will need to help put in place solutions to the underlying problems that lead to military conflict .
Ending the mindset of war would also change domestic policy .
For decades the U.S. has been investing in the military economy at the expense of the civilian economy .
And , it shows – in the loss of industry , a weakened middle class , a failing infrastructure , and a deteriorating economy .
Could Obama really mean it ?
Does he really want to end the mindset that leads to war ?
How do voters opposed to war square Sen .
Obama ’s comment with his advocacy for an even bigger military – adding 100,000 more troops ?
The average annual cost of maintaining a single service member currently exceeds $ 100,000 .
The cost of these troops is tens of billions more dollars for the military .
And , if the U.S. has another 100,000 troops is n’t its leadership more likely to use them ?
Is n’t this a signal to the military industrial complex that Obama will not challenge them ?
Many members of VotersForPeace , including me , have been critical of Obama ’s votes on the war .
We all know he spoke out against the war when he was a state senator .
He described it as “ a rash war ” that would result in “ an occupation of undetermined length , with undetermined costs , and undetermined consequences . ”
He was right .
But we also know that since coming to the senate his record has been the same as Sen. Clinton .
He has voted to give Bush all the funds he has requested , with no strings attached and continue the occupation of Iraq .
And , peace advocates have seen Obama play to the right wing Israeli lobby , missing his first senate vote to speak to AIPAC event and telling them what they want to hear regarding Iran – “ all options are on the table . ”
Yes , he says he wants negotiation with Iran at the same time he keeps the military option available .
So , what is the meaning of Sen. Obama ’s comment ?
Can we trust him to really “ end the mindset ” that gets the U.S. into continuous wars ?
It is a lofty goal and would be an epic political struggle .
It would require him to challenge the military industrial complex , the oil industry , the pro-war Israeli lobby and others who profit from war .
Does Obama have the strength to overcome these political adversaries ?
So what is a peace voter supposed to do ?
Obama has consistently said , on issue after issue , that change is going to require the people to be organized , active and vocal .
He says “ change does not happen from the top down , but from the bottom up . ”
An organized citizenry is especially required when a fundamental paradigm shift is needed in a policy that has deep roots .
And militarism runs deep in the United States where half the discretionary spending goes to the military and with the U.S. already spending as much as the rest of the world combined on its armed forces .
The strength of the military industrial complex was evident way back when Eisenhower warned the country about it in his farewell speech in 1961 .

What do Indiana and North Carolina use for their voting ?
Are they open or closed primaries ?
I think I saw that Indiana allows paper ballots to vote early , at least that was a post I saw by someone who voted for voted in their first election .
We are in Michigan and my opinion about our votes just seems to change not that it does any good .
My husband and I are able to get paper ballots because of our age and we voted uncommitted back in January .
My mother is almost 92 and I had to tell her by way of email to be sure to vote uncommitted because if she tried to write in a vote it would n't be counted at all .
How many people did n't know that I wonder and how many just did n't vote at all because they could n't vote for their preference .
Our son lives in Oregon and as most know they vote paper ballot and have for a long time .
I know all systems can be hacked , but at least you walk away from a paper ballot with something tangible knowing you did vote and it there is a record somewhere .

I hope NY does a better job with paper ballots than Stalin did .
Or NH for that matter .

The Oregon system came about in the 1990s .
The last time I went to a polling place , a local church , the church chose to hang a " God is watching you " banner above the voting stations .
I got very angry at this .
So I registered " Permanent Absentee " .
This was a status that allowed me to vote forever by mail .
By the mid-1990s , about 1/3 of Oregon voters were registered as " Permanent Absentee " .
It would brought up to referendum , and passed , so in effect , every voter in Oregon votes an absentee ballot in every election .
It works just like absentee ballots in every other state .
You get it in the mail about 3 weeks ahead .
You can vote at your kitchen table , with the voter 's guide , the internet , friends , family and the dog for help .
Oregon is famous for referenda , so a ballot title like " Stops disallowing non-aid recipients from unencumbered loss provisions " it helps to read through all the arguments as you vote .
And then you fold it and pop it in the mail .
Counting is done via optical scan readers .
This is the opposite of " electronic voting " because if there is ever a discrepancy , they just pop the whole batch into the reader to recount it .
The batch can be your voting area , your county , or the whole darn state !
In nearby Washington State , the Governors race in 2004 was decided by under 100 votes and it took three counts , three months and every count was different .
The Oregon system insures we can recount in a matter of days , and if the counts ever differ , we can find the cause .
Voting is not subjective .
So in Oregon we have no e-vote machines .
We have no chads .
We have no polling places .
Every vote is a paper trail .
Our country would be well served if the other 49 states would adopt this type of system .

Thanks for the explanation , our son is in Astoria at least away from a rural area , we lived in the rural area in Michigan for 14 years moved back to the Detroit area and know the differences between living in a rural area and a city .
Now we came back to not only the mix of blacks and whites which I sorely missed living in an all white area , but 14 years and now we have an Arab American exposure as well as African American , and quite frankly I love it all .
Doctors , dentists and just the mixture of different people now .

With all due respect to the processes that OR uses , much of that is in place only due to your good SoS Bradbury .
Should he leave , many of his processes are not statutory , and could create some huge problems .
Furthermore , you ( accidentally ) mislead folks by saying there are no e-voting systems in use in Oregon .
Those counts , which come out differently each time , are likely due to the fact that op - scan systems are notoriously inaccurate , and do n't necessarily count the same ballot twice .
Furthermore , vote - by - mail has all kinds of problems , beginning with the sale of those votes around the kitchen table ( if one wishes ) , to the black hole the ballots get dropped into when you give them to the post office and hope they arrive and get counted , to the black hole they get counted in , without all of the folks watching on Election Night as in other states .
Security is also a big issue with VBM .
I hope to be doing a piece here ( if ever I can find the time ! ) called " The Trouble with Vote - by - Mail " to help spell out some of the many concerns about that system .

Broadly speaking , the serious contenders for the Democratic nomination are offering similar policy proposals  the dispute over health care mandates notwithstanding .
But there are large differences among the candidates in their beliefs about what it will take to turn a progressive agenda into reality .
At one extreme , Barack Obama insists that the problem with America is that our politics are so “ bitter and partisan , ” and insists that he can get things done by ushering in a “ different kind of politics . ”
At the opposite extreme , John Edwards blames the power of the wealthy and corporate interests for our problems , and says , in effect , that America needs another F.D.R.  a polarizing figure , the object of much hatred from the right , who nonetheless succeeded in making big changes .
Over the last few days Mr. Obama and Mr. Edwards have been conducting a long - range argument over health care that gets right to this issue .
And I have to say that Mr. Obama comes off looking , well , naïve .
川合さんのエッセ イ「 Schemer 's way 」 は面白く、とてもためになります 。
ただ一点、フェアな議論なのか気になるところがありました。
多くの言語では、新しいオペレータを追加するのは言語そのものを拡張しなければならないだろう。例えばJavaを拡張してPerlの `x ' オペレータを実装するには、構文規則から書き直さねばならない。既存のオペレータに新しい意味を追加するというメカニズムは、これもいくつかの言語では言語そのものに組み込みの機能となっている。
Lisp系の言語では、オペレータと関数呼び出しとの間に区別が無いため、オペレータの機能の拡張ということは議論にならない。新しいオペレータが欲しければ、あるいは既存のオペレータを拡張したければ、いつでも自分で書けるからだ。
Java には構文規則を変えなければいけない例を挙げているのに、Lisp では構文規則を変えなくてよい例を出しています。
僕も Lisper なので Lisp の肩を持ちたいところですが 、Lisp だって前置構文の範疇を越えようと思うと、構文規則を変えないといけないのではないでしょうか？
ハッシュの 演算子 たとえば、ハッシ ュ( hash ) をキー( key ) で検索した結果の値を知りたいとしましょう。JavaScript では、その演算子を " .

Soft fur and big eyes can be hard to resist .
But taking home a puppy that 's sick or genetically defective can result in sky - high vet bills or a dog that can't be kept .
A new group of states is considering joining the 17 that have puppy lemon laws , which give consumers recourse if their new pet has problems .
New York , Florida and Pennsylvania are among the states that have such laws .
Three more — Wisconsin , Ohio and Illinois — have bills pending before committees .
The Ohio bill is at committee review and being revised .
The other two await committee action .
A proposed law died in the Indiana Legislature this year , but its author , state Rep. Trent Van Haaften said he will introduce narrower legislation in 2008 .
He said the law should allow consumers " to put themselves back into the position they were before they were sold the defective product . "
" You should n't have to shell out $ 2,000 two days after you get a dog , " said Amber Hodgson , a Madison , Wis. , dog owner who said she did that for " JP , " an $ 800 Yorkshire terrier .
Hodgson 's dog recovered after receiving antibiotics .
Hodgson said her vet thought the dog had a bacterial problem .
" I asked the vet , ' Is there any chance the dog could have gotten this sick in the past two days ? ' " she said .
" They said it was highly , highly , highly unlikely . "
JP is now healthy , and Hodgson , a legislative aide for a state lawmaker , works to help her boss pass legislation to help other pet owners .
Laws vary from state to state but basically allow buyers to get a new dog , reimbursement for their vet bills or their money back from the seller .
Some state dog lemon laws date back to the 1980s and 1990s — New York 's dates back to 1988 .
Recent reports of animal abuse at so - called puppy mills , and stories of pet owners spending hundreds on dogs they later discover are sick , have prompted additional lawmakers to introduce legislation .
Most state laws go beyond lemon provisions and include measures to regulate dog breeders .
Some laws apply only to dogs while others also apply to cats .
Mike Winikoff of the animal rights group Last Chance for Animals said there have been fewer lemon laws passed in recent years because animal rights groups pushed for laws that regulate breeders and protect dogs .
Eilene Ribbens Rohde , executive director of the Wisconsin Puppy Mill Project , said her state 's proposed legislation does n't address animal cruelty and neglect issues .
She said lemon laws might protect consumers , but not dogs .
" Typically , the animals end up being victims once again , " Rohde said . "
If the dog goes back to the breeder , a knock over the head with a hammer will solve the problem . "
Hank Greenwood , vice president of the American Dog Breeders Association , said most responsible breeders have contracts to replace a dog if a genetic defect surfaces .
If not , pet buyers should demand one , he said .
" We actually believe that if we can educate the buyers of the dogs , then basically these lemon laws are a mute point , " he said .
Wisconsin state Sen. Jeff Plale , who employs Hodgson , authored Wisconsin's " Dog Purchaser Protection Act , " which includes language on licensing dog breeders .
" I think it 's a little bit more on people 's radar screen as No. 1 , a humane issue and No. 2 , a consumer issue , " he said .

Allocating ( generously ) , 60 percent of the remaining superdelegates to Clinton and running the following projections through Forbes 's delegate calculator , I 've come up , quite unexpectedly , with a 1,976 to 1,976 delegate tie .
I 'll call this scenario " Gertrude . "
If I change the superdelegate allocation to 60 % to 40 % in the favor of Obama , he wins the nomination by 26 delegates .
If the superdelegates split down the middle -- there are roundabout 352 of them , in Forbes 's estimation -- Obama is 14 votes short .
So you see why the math still favors Obama .
Were Clinton to add , say , 30 extra delegates and hundreds of thousands of net popular votes from revoting in Michigan and Florida -- well -- even under a split superdelegate scenario , she would have a much better case to make that the nomination is essentially tied and that the superdelegates and even the pledged delegates are lobbyable .

About the study :
At least one pharmaceutical was detected in tests of treated drinking water supplies for 24 major metropolitan areas , according to an Associated Press survey of 62 major water providers and data obtained from independent researchers .
Only 28 tested drinking water .
Three of those said results were negative ; Dallas says tests were conducted but results are not yet available .
Thirty - four locations said no testing was conducted .
Test protocols varied widely .
Some researchers looked only for one pharmaceutical or two ; others looked for many .
Some water systems said tests had been negative , but the AP found independent research showing otherwise .
Both prescription and non-prescription drugs were detected .
Because coffee and tobacco are so widely used , researchers say their byproducts are good indicators of the presence of pharmaceuticals .
Thus , they routinely test for , and often find , both caffeine and nicotine 's metabolite cotinine more frequently than other drugs .

When water providers find pharmaceuticals in drinking water , they rarely tell the public .
When researchers make the same discoveries , they usually do n't identify the cities involved .
There are plenty of reasons offered for the secrecy : concerns about national security , fears of panic , a feeling that the public will not understand — even confidentiality agreements .
AP PROBE : Drugs found in drinking water nationwide NYC : Sedative traces found in system that does not filter water " That 's a really sensitive subject , " said Elaine Archibald , executive director of California Urban Water Agencies , an 11 - member organization comprised of the largest water providers in California .
She said many customers " do n't know how to interpret the information .
They hear something has been detected in source water and drinking water , and that 's cause for alarm — just because it 's there . "
As The Associated Press documented in a five - month investigation , drinking water provided to at least 41 million people living in 24 major metropolitan areas has tested positive for trace amounts of pharmaceuticals .
Most Americans probably think they have a good idea of what 's being detected in their water .
Federal law requires water providers to distribute annual " consumer confidence reports " that reveal levels of regulated contaminants .
Providers are not , however , required to tell people if they find a contaminant that is not on a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency list .
And there are no pharmaceuticals on the EPA list .
In Philadelphia , the water department has not informed its 1.5 million users that traces of 56 pharmaceuticals or their byproducts — like the active ingredients in drugs to treat depression , anxiety , high cholesterol , fever and pain — have been detected in the drinking water , and that 63 pharmaceuticals or byproducts had been found in the city 's source watersheds .
Initially balking at the AP 's request to provide test results , Philadelphia Water Department spokeswoman Laura Copeland said , " It would be irresponsible to communicate to the public about this issue , as doing so would only generate questions that scientific research has not yet answered .
We do n't want to create the perception where people would be alarmed . "
New York City water officials declined repeated requests for an interview and waited more than three months before participating in an AP survey , supplying information only after being informed that every other major city in the nation had cooperated .
The AP learned that the New York state health department and the U.S. Geological Survey detected heart medicine , infection fighters , estrogen , anti-convulsants , a mood stabilizer and the active ingredient in an anti-anxiety medication in the city 's watershed upstate .
And the city 's Department of Environmental Protection ultimately said that it does not test its downstate drinking water .
Officials in Arlington , Texas , said pharmaceuticals had been detected in source water but would n't say which ones or in what amounts , citing security concerns .
Julie Hunt , director of water utilities , said to provide the public with information regarding " which , if any , pharmaceuticals or emerging compounds make it through the treatment process can assist someone who wishes to cause harm through the water supply . "
Mayor Robert Cluck later said a trace amount of one pharmaceutical had survived the treatment process and had been detected in drinking water .
He declined to name the drug , saying identifying it could cause a terrorist to intentionally release more of it , causing significant harm to residents .
" I do n't want to take that chance , " Cluck said .
" There is no public hazard and I do n't want to create one . "
Ron Rhodes , water treatment plant supervisor in Emporia , Kan. , explained why he would n't disclose whether his community 's source water or drinking water had been tested for pharmaceuticals .
" Well , it 's because of 9/11 .
We want everybody to guess . "
How , Rhodes was asked , could it endanger anyone to know if Emporia 's water has been screened for traces of pharmaceutical compounds ?
" We 're not putting out more information than we have to put out , " said Rhodes .
" How about that ? "
Milwaukee 's water department is an anomaly , posting on its website an 11 - page detailed drinking water quality report that includes test results for 450 unregulated contaminants , including pharmaceuticals .
While they found minute concentrations of cotinine , a nicotine derivative , they did n't detect hundreds of other contaminants including estrogens and other hormones , acetaminophen and ibuprofen .
When asked what power the EPA had to require public disclosure when pharmaceutical contamination is discovered in a water provider 's supplies , Benjamin H. Grumbles , the agency 's assistant administrator for water , said , " We work very closely with utilities across the country and we encourage them to share with their community information they find out about their source water . "
But there 's no such requirement if the detected contaminant is not regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act , he said in response to a question .
Grumbles was asked how he thought water providers have been responding to the EPA 's " encouragement . "
" I think we have more work to do , " he said .
Several hours after the interview , Grumbles issued a statement : " As head of the National Water Program , I will do everything in my authority to make certain that public water suppliers inform their consumers if they detect pharmaceuticals in the drinking water . "
It 's not just the water departments that have failed to disclose such information .
The AP spoke with many scientists , federally funded researchers , university professors and private drinking water experts who have detected pharmaceuticals in drinking water , but would not say where they had obtained their samples .
Archibald said her organization joined an American Water Works Association Research Foundation study with the understanding that secrecy would be assured .
" We agreed ahead of time that no specific agency would be mentioned in terms of which place had detections , " Archibald said .
She insisted that even she did n't have the test results .
" It 's all being held very carefully .
Water agencies were assigned numbers so none of us would even know what was detected in each other 's water . "
Robert Renner , the foundation 's executive director , said AWWARF study participants are routinely promised anonymity .
" Being involved in a study , they do n't want this information blown out all over , " he said .
Citing confidentiality agreements , he declined to name the 20 different drinking water treatment plants around the U.S. where pharmaceuticals have been detected in water heading to more than 10 million people .
" It 's a hard topic to talk about without creating fear in the general public , " Renner said .
Some said those fears could lead to much larger problems than the actual contamination .
Doctors " do n't want people to be afraid to take their medicine because of environmental concerns , " said Virginia Cunningham , an environmental executive for drug maker GlaxoSmithKline PLC .
Utilities also generally only allow scientists to test their water if they ensure confidentiality .
In order for research to progress , scientists " need the confidence of utilities and other public / private stakeholders to allow us access to waters which we can study without any negative implications for those stakeholders , " said Howard Weinberg , an environmental chemist at University of North Carolina .
" Without this confidence , such research could not be undertaken . "
John Vargo , program manager at the University of Iowa 's University Hygienic Laboratory , said he found traces of pharmaceuticals in the finished drinking water of several major Midwestern cities but , under terms of those contracts , he could not disclose their identity .
Peter Rogers , Harvard University professor of environmental engineering , said improvements in detection techniques could help fuel fears among the general public .
" We 're chasing this down to molecular - sized measurements , so the more you look , the more you find , " said Rogers .
" I think the government and utilities are quite right to be very skittish about telling people their results .
People will claim it is causing all sorts of problems .
If I were a water utility , I would stop those measurements right away because if you measure something , it will get out , and people will overreact .
I can just imagine a whole slew of lawsuits . "

What does it mean to exist ?
When we talk about a person existing , we are referring to that person being a material object in the universe .
Concepts are also said to exist .
For example , patriotism exists , but you ca n’t hold it in your hand .
For this discussion let ’s agree that we are only talking about existence in the material sense .
To be material , that generally means an object has mass .
But what is mass ?
According to Einstein , mass has an equivalence with energy .
If we understand energy , we might better understand what mass is .
But what is energy ?
Energy is defined as a “ property of objects . ”
In other words , it is a concept , such as patriotism , velocity , or honesty .
You ca n’t grab a handful of a concept and put it in your pocket .
So there you have it :
To exist , you must have mass .
Mass is equivalent to energy .
Energy is nothing but a concept .
Therefore , you are nothing but a concept , probably in a computer program designed by someone else .
Atheists say God does n’t exist .
I say atheists do n’t exist .
The news from the banks seem to have triggered two kinds of reactions :
one is a further expectation of Central Bank rate cuts to protect the banking sector from systemic risk .
As Greenspan unashamedly asserts in this interview ( in French ) , we should not punish the financial world for its follies , because that would have all too real impacts for the rest of the economy - in fact , we should save them to save theeconomy , thereby " forgiving them for their excesses .
Bernanke is on the same line , and the financial markets thus expect once more that their losses are insured by the Fed ( i.e. by us ) and that they can go back to betting merrily ;
another is an expectation that the banks have finally managed to put a tag price on the recent crisis and , as a lot of the crisis was about the uncertainty on the losses , and the fear that it was bigger than aticipated , the certainty of having a clear number is good news , whatever the actual number .
Banks have cleaned up and can move forward .
So , losses swallowed , we can go back for one more merry round of the great bubble making machine ...
... except that things are not so rosy .
The other argument used to be bullish is to look at China , and other emerging markets , and expect them to " save " growth for the world on their own .
We 've had a whole spat of articles outlining how Chinese growth was actually contributing more to world growth than the US right now , and how China itself was increasingly protected from the vagaries of the US economy thanks to its larger exports to other regions ( Europe and the rest of Asia , mainly ) and to its own solid domestic demand .
Markets are very obviously betting that multinational companies will benefit from that trend :
The Dow ’s resurgence shows more confidence in the rest of the world than in the US .
Since it peaked on July 19 , the best Dow stock is Procter & Gamble – a consumer group with steady demand for its products which gains from a weak dollar because it sells all over the world .
It is up 12.75 per cent .
The worst performer , down 16.3 per cent , is Home Depot , which is primarily a play on the US .
A consumer - led recession would clobber its profits .
This Dow peak reflects bullishness on emerging markets , but not on the dollar or the US economy .
( FT )
So the health is the US corporations is becoming completely decoupled from that of the US economy , which is a frankly new development .
That may or may not be a good thing ( it certainly is for the investor class ) , but it is worth flagging , as it is likely to have far reaching political consequences , given US corporations ' influence on domestic US politics .
The interests of US corporations and US citizens have never been completely aligned , but at least they were still falling somewhat within the same community .
It may no longer be the case at all .
Which is worth pondering .

Whisper it quietly , but Zimbabwe may be witnessing the final days ( if not hours ) in office of the only leader it has ever known .
While the people of this ruined country waited last night for their electoral voice to be heard , reports from high - level talks between aides of Robert Mugabe and the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai suggested they were edging closer to accomplishing the previously impossible .
After 28 years of seemingly unshakeable authority – in which all opponents have been sidelined , exiled or killed – the " old man " as Zimbabweans call him , was reported to be considering relinquishing power .
Saturday 's elections went so strongly against the ruling party , that it is understood he has been advised to quit now rather than face a humiliating second round against his hated rival , Mr Tsvangirai .
Sources close to the talks said that an " exit package " was being negotiated that could see the 84 - year - old retire or even , according to one scenario , leave the country .
While an agreement was far from settled , Mr Mugabe was believed to be seeking immunity from prosecution as well as guarantees relating to millions of pounds worth of assets held in a number of countries .

A US State Department official confirmed negotiations were under way , saying they followed indications that Mr Tsvangirai would secure a majority in the presidential election but fall short of the 51 per cent required to avoid a run-off .
However , both the ruling party and the opposition were at pains to quash the rumours .
" Any speculation about deals and negotiations is speculation , because the results have not been announced , " said Mr Tsvangirai in his first public appearance since Saturday 's vote .
" Let 's wait for [ the electoral commission ] to complete its work , then we can discuss the circumstances that will affect the people . "
And a junior minister in Mr Mugabe 's government said : " There is no need for a deal ... there are no negotiations whatsoever . "
As speculation swirled , Zimbabwe 's electoral commission continued its theatre of the absurd .
The official results , released at a trickle , continued to show the ruling Zanu - PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) running neck - and - neck in terms of parliamentary seats .
However , these results contradicted both the findings of independent election observers and the results amassed by opposition polling agents nationwide .
Three days after the poll , there had still been no official results concerning the presidential vote .
A second round , which would have to be held within 21 days , appeared unlikely , after massive resources were poured into Saturday 's poll , much of it in the form of crude vote - buying by Zanu - PF .
One scenario is that Mr Mugabe would stand aside and allow an alternative candidate from Zanu - PF to contest a second round .
But that also carries the risk that the opposition would unite and the angry populace would give an even more resounding " No " to Zanu - PF than they did four days ago .
" There is no way that Mugabe wants a second round .
He would lose badly and be humiliated , " said a senior diplomat close to the election crisis .
Mr Mugabe himself ruled out a run -off before the weekend , saying there was no " second round in this boxing match " .
Zimbabwe 's two main cities remained calm , although riot police have been dispatched for nightly patrols , and roadblocks mounted outside all major towns .
But Harare was awash with wild rumours .
The wildest of those – that " Comrade Bob " had already fled the country – was quashed after he was spotted in the suburbs by foreign diplomats .

Political and business cronies will be dreading any departure of Comrade Bob .
" I was talking to some of the bigwigs in the ruling party and they are also concerned about the possibility of a change of guard , " Marwick Khumalo , the head of the Pan - African Parliament observer mission , told local radio in South Africa .
" Zanu - PF has actually been institutionalised in the lives of Zimbabweans , so it is not easy for anyone within the sphere of the ruling party to accept that ' Maybe we might be defeated or might have been defeated ' . "
Were Mr Mugabe to negotiate his exit now , he would leave behind him a country of 90 per cent unemployment ; life expectancies of 34 and 37 for women and men respectively ; 4,000 dead per month from Aids ; and four million close to starvation .
Yet no statistic encapsulates the turmoil of Zimbabwe as completely as the rate of inflation : 200,000 per cent and climbing .
The staunch Catholic emerged from more than a a decade in a Rhodesian prison to lead one faction of the liberation struggle against the white rule of Ian Smith , then won a resounding victory in the first elections to follow independence in 1980 .
Cast in the role of liberator , Mr Mugabe was initially the darling of the liberal world .
Now he is the man who perfected the art of democratic dictatorship .
The full extent of his fall may be apparent to him as he mulls the shrinking list of countries that might entertain him in exile in his dotage .
The demise of Africa 's dictators
Gnassingbe Eyadema
He was Africa 's longest - serving ruler , presiding over the tiny nation of Togo for almost 40 years until his unexpected death .
A former wrestling champion who was rarely seen in public without his dark glasses , Eyadema became head of state when Harold Wilson was Britain 's prime minister .
Until his death on 5 February 2005 at 69 , Eyadema was the world 's longest - serving leader after Cuba 's Fidel Castro .
Afterwards , Eyadema 's son , Faure Gnassingbe , seized power with the backing of the army , triggering protests and riots .
Charles Taylor
He launched a rebellion in his homeland Liberia in 1989 but violence rumbled on for 14 years even after he became President .
Went into exile in Nigeria in 2003 in a deal to end the conflict .
In 2006 , he was held by Nigerian police as he tried to cross the border into Cameroon .
Currently on trial in The Hague for war crimes , accused of fomenting war in Sierra Leone .
Mobutu Seso Seke
Ruled the renamed Zaire ( previously Congo ) for more than 30 years .
He seized power in 1965 with tacit support from the West , to act as a bulwark against Communist expansion .
But Zaire 's people sank into deeper poverty , despite its vast natural resources .
Mobutu fled with $ 5 bn ( £ 2.5 bn ) in 1997 after rebel forces approached , but died four months later at 66 .
Idi Amin
The former Ugandan dictator seized power in a coup in 1971 , unleashing a reign of terror on the east African country .
Up to 400,000 people are believed to have been killed during his time in office .
He was forced from power in 1979 by Tanzanian troops and Ugandan exiles , and fled to Libya and Iraq before settling in Saudi Arabia , where he died in 2003 .
Hastings Banda
Appointed himself " president - for - life " of Malawi in 1971 and ruled with an iron fist , squashing dissent , reshuffling ministers to prevent the emergence of a rival and accumulating a fortune .
In 1993 , when the tyrant was ill , voters rejected his one - party state in a referendum , held the first multi-party elections and voted Banda out and into retirement .

( CNN ) -- Within minutes of posting a story on CNN 's homepage called " Gender or race : Black women voters face tough choices in South Carolina , " readers reacted quickly and angrily .
Readers want media to focus more on the candidates and how they feel about the issues not their gender or race .
Many took umbrage at the story 's suggestion that black women voters face " a unique , and most unexpected dilemma " about voting their race or their gender .
CNN received dozens of e-mails shortly after posting the story , which focuses largely on conversations about Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama that a CNN reporter observed at a hair salon in South Carolina whose customers are predominantly African - American .
The story states : " For these women , a unique , and most unexpected dilemma , presents itself :
Should they vote their race , or should they vote their gender ? "
Read the story
An e-mailer named Tiffany responded sarcastically : " Duh , I 'm a black woman and here I am at the voting booth .
Duh , since I 'm illiterate I 'll pull down the lever for someone .
Hm ...
Well , he black so I may vote for him ... oh wait she a woman I may vote for her ...
What Ise gon ' do ?
Oh lordy ! "
Tiffany urged CNN to " pull this racist crap off " the Web site and to stop calling Hillary the " top female candidate . "
" Stop calling Barack the " Black " candidate , " she wrote .
Many readers were upset that the story did not delve beyond a cursory mention of the issues .
Watch women say what 's important to them »
The article stated : " While race and gender play a role , most women here say they plan to vote based on the issues .
They rank health care , education and the economy in order of importance . "
The salon owner , Angela Jackson , a Clinton supporter , is quoted as saying : " They do n't pay my bills .
And they 're not attached to my belly .
Nobody is attached to my belly but me .
They do n't feed me , clothe me .
I do n't care what they think .
...
She 's a woman , I 'm a woman . "
A reader named Joan e-mailed : " Really CNN , is this how you view black women [ ? ]
Are you suggesting that white women are going to have it easier [ ?]
How about issues ?
Should a black woman consider the candidates position on issues , or should we just stick to race and gender .
Disgusting ! "
Matt e-mailed , " The article itself shows black women have brains and actually choose candidates based on issues and not just gender or race , but CNN does n't seem to give them that credit . "
Others responding to the story wrote that they want CNN and other media to focus on the substance of the candidates ' accomplishments and stances on issues , rather than their appearance .
" Since Edwards no longer officially exists , as a white male I face the same choice - either I vote my race ( Clinton ) or my gender ( Obama ) .
Or I could just pick the candidate based on who I think would be best , " wrote Michael .
Another e-mailer , D.T. , who describes herself as a young , white woman , said voters should choose the candidate best qualified to lead .
" I 'm sure there are plenty of black women who are Republican and could care less who the Dem leader will be , " she said .
" Close your eyes and look at who can fulfill the best to their promises . "

Thanks alot
I have returned to the States from Ghana .
I ca n’t believe that time passed by in a blink of an eye .
My 12 week stay there has come to an end .
I just want to let you know that my project there was a success ; thanks to my dedicated interpreter and my Coordinator ’s care and attentiveness to each and every one of the participants .
I am also impressed with the caliber and the dedication of other Cosmic Volunteers , Shalle and Nathan .
They are so dedicated to their projects and they also have a genuine concerned with the people that they are working with .
Both my Coordinator and Nathan were with me in Nkanfoa during my last meeting with the women this past Friday .
Nathan helped me guest facilitate by answering the medical / health related questions while My Coordinator was there seeing how the meeting was conducted so that he could send future participants to continue my project .
I bought little gifts for the women who attended the sessions so that they could remember me .
I also compiled a report documenting each of my meetings with the women .
The purpose of the report is for future participants to read the topics covered during my meetings so that they can continue where I had left off .
I hope that the informal educational sessions in Nkanfoa could continue and that Cosmic could place participants , especially those with medical / health related backgrounds to work at the PPAG Clinic that is scheduled to operate in Nkanfoa in late June / early July and help continue the informal educational sessions .
I had an opportunity to visit the Lake Volta area and the northern part of Ghana .
I went to Mole National Park , saw the unique African style mosque in Larabanga , passed by Tamale and visited a remote village outside Bolgatanga during the weekend before my last week there .
It was truly an African adventure that I will never forget in my lifetime .
I had to sleep on a bench in the junction to Mole National Park , bike for a total of 12 kilometers from Larabanga to Mole and back since no trotros or taxis are available , and ride a two hour bus ride from Damango to Tamale on a rough , bumpy and dusty road .
I was so dusty by the time that I reached Tamale .
In the remote areas of the northern region , there are no electricity or running water .
They really need infrastructural development and investments to help improve the livelihood of this region .
Whenever an opportunity arises , I will encourage people , businesses and organizations to invest in the northern region of Ghana and help develop the infrastructure there .

BBC News , Bangladesh
An infestation of rats is creating severe food shortages in the impoverished Chittagong Hill Tracts region of Bangladesh , close to the borders of India and Burma .
Sangram , a rat catcher in the remote Bangladeshi village of Theihkyong , has never been busier and nor has his work been as important as it is now .
Sangram has placed rat traps along field boundaries
That is because the fields surrounding the village have been stripped by an invading army of rodents , which villagers say crossed over the nearby border with India three months ago .
It has become more than a job .
Sangram now needs the rats to keep his family members alive .
They eat two bowls of smoked rat a day , accompanied by the wild roots he finds in the forest .
" My wife , my five children and I normally eat rice , but the rats have destroyed everything , " the grim - faced Sangram said .
" All we have left are the rats and these wild potatoes . "
We are in big trouble and want people to realise that
Lal Jinja , priest
They live in a traditional one - room house - the roof is of thatched grass - the walls and floors weaved strands of bamboo .
It sits on high stilts .
There is space underneath for a harvest of rice , maize and vegetables but this year it is empty .
Theihkyong is a poor village with two churches and a community school .
But there is no clinic , no electricity , no running water or telephones .
The people here have to fend for themselves .
They are proud of their independence and their identity as members of one of Bangladesh 's tribal minorities , but when something bad happens , they have nothing to fall back on .
The rat minefield The rat traps that Sangram looks after are huge and ingenious .
A long bamboo fence divides two fields but every so often Sangram has left open a booby - trapped entrance .
When the rat walks in , it triggers the trap , and a bamboo pole , weighted with soil , drops with a thump .
He walks along the fence throwing the squashed , light - brown rats into a basket he wears on his back .
At home they will be strung together and smoked over an open fire until they are black and hard .
Sangram also checks uninhabited houses that dot the fields .
Inside are dozens of carefully concealed snares .
It is the villagers ' revenge .
They have turned their desolated hillsides into a rat minefield .
They have caught thousands of them .
In the community centre of Theihkyong they gather to show me baskets of dried rat tails .
They have kept them as proof of the crisis now facing the village , a crisis that outsiders refused to believe for months .
" We are in big trouble and want people to realise that , " Theihkyong 's priest Lal Jinja said .
" We want people to see these rat tails so they can understand our suffering . "
The government and relief agencies are finally beginning to believe them and are waking up to the problem , which extends far beyond the boundaries of this single village .
Occupying force According to the UN's development programme , about 125,000 people have been affected by food shortages and the rats .
Some have started to receive aid , but unless more arrives soon these people will be cut off from the outside world , without any food to eat for months .
The villagers have collected thousands of rat tails
That is because the monsoon is on its way .
There are not many bridges and it will be impossible to ford the rivers once the rains come .
The starving communities sit in the hills along Bangladesh 's south - eastern borders with India and Burma .
It is an impoverished region called the Chittagong Hill Tracts , where the indigenous Christian and Buddhist tribes complain of decades of mistreatment by the central authorities .
The only government institution that is decently funded is the army .
It says it needs a large presence to defend the region against a myriad of tribal rebel groups from India , Burma and Bangladesh itself .
But locals say it sometimes acts like an occupying force .
The looming famine is proof of this neglect , as the crisis - and the rat invasion - were entirely predictable .
It happens to this region roughly every 50 years .
That is how often the bamboo forests that cover the hillsides blossom .
Their seeds are high in protein and , when the rats eat them , they breed four times faster than normal .
After their numbers swell and they finish eating the bamboo seeds , they move into people 's fields and eat their crops .
The blossoming , the rat problem , and the food shortages began two years ago in India then moved into Bangladesh in January and have now headed south into Burma as well .
The last rat plague in 1959 caused devastation just over the border in the Indian state of Mizoram .
The people there suffered so much and were so appalled by the lack of help from the government , they launched a rebellion that lasted 20 years .
In the Chittagong Hill Tracts , many people remember that time as well .
One of them is the 93 - year - old king of the Marma tribe , Raja Aung Shue Prue Chowdhury .
He tells me that the rats then " were as big as pigs " .

Alvaro Uribe AFP / Getty Images Alvaro Uribe AFP / Getty Images CRISIS IN LATIN AMERICA CRISIS IN LATIN AMERICA Analysis : Experts say war not likely between Colombia , Venezuela Raid in Ecuador : Senior FARC commander , 17 rebels killed by Colombian military Venezuela responds : Chavez warns Colombia 's military move spurs war Colombia 's accusation : Chavez accused of funding FARC rebels Tension escalates : Charges fly , troops move in S. American showdown Envoys try to head off conflict as troops near Colombia BOGOTA , Colombia ( AP )  Venezuela moved troops toward Colombia and forced cargo trucks to back up at border crossings on Tuesday as tensions increased in a war of nerves over Colombia 's cross - border strike on a leftist guerrilla base in Ecuador .
Ecuador also reinforced its border with more troops and sought international condemnation of the attack , which killed 23 guerrillas including a rebel leader who had been key to hostage talks with Venezuela , France and other European countries .
CLAIMS : Rebels trying to make dirty bombs , Colombia tells U.N.
As Ecuador accused Colombia of violating its human rights , and Colombia accusing the guerrillas of trying to acquire radioactive material for dirty bombs , the U.S. backed the incursion into Ecuadorean territory .
President George W. Bush accused Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez of making " provocative maneuvers " and said the U.S. stands with Colombia , its right - leaning ally in a region now dominated by leftists .
Other leaders tried to dampen the war talk while saying Colombia was clearly wrong to send troops across its borders , and called for an investigation by the Organization of American States , which scheduled an emergency meeting in Washington to try to calm one of the region 's worst political showdowns in years .
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe said the International Criminal Court should try Chavez for " genocide " for allegedly financing the rebels , citing a reference to a US$ 300 million ( euro197 million )
Venezuelan payment to the rebels they said was found in documents in laptops recovered by Colombian commandos at the bombing scene .
But Uribe said he would not allow his nation to be drawn into open war .
" Colombia has never been a country to go to war with its neighbors , " Uribe said .
" We are not mobilizing troops , nor advancing toward war . "
In Washington , a Colombian official apologized to Ecuador for the incursion but Ecuador responded that the apology was not enough .
Foreign Minister Maria Isabel Salvador told an OAS sesssion that Colombia must condemn the incursion , appoint a commission to investigate it and call an urgent meeting of the region 's foreign ministers to be held " at the latest March 11 . "
Colombia 's ambassador to the OAS , Camilo Ospina , acknowledged that his nation 's helicopters entered Ecuador in search of the rebel camp and said the government has issued repeated public apologies to Ecuador 's government for the raid " and will do so again today . "
Venezuela was sending about 9,000 soldiers — 10 battalions — to the border region as " a preventive measure , " retired Gen. Alberto Muller Rojas , a former top Chavez aide , told The Associated Press .
Ecuador 's President Rafael Correa said he was sending 3,200 more troops to its border .
Agriculture Minister Elias Jaua said Tuesday that Venezuela was closing the border to imports and exports , and would look to other countries for necessary imports .
" Lamentably , we cannot depend for anything at all on a country that 's in a war posture against its neighboring countries , " Jaua said .
Some 300 vehicles , including trucks carrying food , shoes , ceramics and other products , were stuck waiting for permission to enter Venezuela , said Leonardo Mendez , a spokesman for a Colombian cargo transport association .
Fuel distribution was sharply reduced in the Venezuelan border state of Tachira , where the situation " worsened a lot " Tuesday at border crossings , agreed Isidoro Teres , who runs a Venezuelan business chamber the border town of Urena .
Venezuela and Colombia share annual border trade worth US $ 5 billion ( euro3.29 billion ) , most of it Colombian exports sorely needed by Venezuelans already suffering milk and meat shortages .
In Ecuador , where trade with Colombia adds up to US $ 1.8 billion annually , commerce and migration continued freely on Tuesday , according to Carlos Lopez , Ecuador 's undersecretary of immigration .
Chavez warned Uribe that any strike on Venezuelan soil could provoke war .
But his forces would be outnumbered : Venezuela and Ecuador have about 172,000 active military troops between them .
Colombia 's U.S. - equipped , trained and advised military has more than 250,000 .
Despite the withering rhetoric of Uribe , Chavez and Correa — who called Uribe a " bold - faced liar " on Tuesday , the biggest losers from the killing of rebel spokesman Raul Reyes appeared to be hostages that might have been swapped for jailed guerrillas .
Colombia was well aware that Reyes was a key hostage negotiator with Spain , Switzerland , and France , whose president Nicolas Sarkozy has made a priority of pressing for the freedom of former Colombian presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt , a dual French national kidnapped by the rebels more than six years ago .
The rebels said in a communique Tuesday that Reyes died " completing a mission to arrange , through President Chavez , a meeting with President Sarkozy " aimed at securing Betancourt 's release .
Sarkozy said last week that Betancourt could be near death , and that her " martyrdom is the martyrdom of France . "
Correa claims his government also was working for a hostage swap , denying Colombian allegations that he was deepening political relations with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC .
" All of this was frustrated by the war - mongering , authoritarian hands " of the Colombian government , " Correa complained .
Publicly , there had been little indication of progress toward a swap of 40 high - value FARC hostages , who also include three U.S. military contractors , for hundreds of jailed guerrillas .
Saturday 's raid followed the FARC 's release last week of four hostages to Venezuela 's justice minister , Ramon Rodriguez Chacin , who said Colombia wanted to " hamper the handover of hostages , because that is the path of peace . "
The bombing not only wrecked any chance of Chavez and Correa brokering more hostage releases on Colombian soil , it also scored an intelligence bonanza when commandos seized three laptops from the camp .
Among the incriminating documents : evidence that Chavez gave the rebels US$ 300 million ( euro197 million ) for an " armed alliance , " according to national Colombia 's national police chief , Gen. Oscar Naranjo .
Other documents suggest rebels were seeking to buy uranium , Naranjo said , without providing details .
The claim was repeated without evidence by Colombia 's vice president , Francisco Santos , at the disarmament forum in Geneva .
Both Venezuela and Ecuador dismissed the allegations as lies .
Several Latin American leftist leaders have suggested the U.S. was intimately involved in executing the raid by 60 Colombian commandos that killed Reyes .
U.S. satellite intelligence and communications intercepts have put the FARC on the defensive , the Colombian military has said .
But the U.S. Southern Command would neither confirm or deny American military participation on Tuesday .
" We do provide intelligence support to partner nations but I can't get into details on operations , " spokesman Jose Ruiz told the AP from Miami .
Venezuela later produced a laptop of its own .
Also without offering any details , it said the computer belonged to a Colombian drug trafficker and contained documents implicating Naranjo in the cocaine trade .
Uribe 's decision to attack Ecuadorean territory also reflected Colombia 's long frustration over the rebels ' ability to obtain refuge just outside its borders .
Uribe complained Tuesday that he provided Chavez with precise information on the location of FARC camps in Venezuela — one of which , he alleged , was home to rebel leader Ivan Marquez .
Chavez and Correa have denied providing support to the rebels in their territories .
Correa said Ecuador has " captured " 47 rebel camps in Ecuador during his presidency —
" And they ask me if we are accomplices of the FARC ? "
In a communique Tuesday , the FARC announced that Reyes ' leadership position would be filled by Milton de Jesus Toncel , also known as " Joaquin Gomez , " a 61 - year - old veteran who repeatedly defeated Colombia 's military in the 1990s and later acted as a peace negotiator with one of Uribe 's predecessors .

Editor ’s note :
This is a guest post from The Art of Manliness reader and my good friend , Josh Wilsie .
One of the fastest and easiest ways to increase your income is to ask for a raise .
But some men ’s palms get clammy just thinking about doing so .
Here are five tips on how to ask ( and get ) the raise you deserve .
1. Just ask
Just like anything in life , you are n’t going to get what you want if you do n’t ask for it .
It ’s the same principal as asking girls out on dates ( instead of “ hanging out ” ) .
You will never make any sales if you do n’t make any calls .
I am constantly surprised by how many of my friends and coworkers are fearful of asking for a raise because they do n’t want to seem ungrateful or are afraid of getting turned down and feeling rejected .
People do n’t seem to grasp the concept that you are simply selling a service to your company by being employed with them .
That service is your time and your labor .
If you ’ve been with your company for over 6 months or up to a year and have n’t received any pay adjustments , I ’d say just asking will work 75 % of the time ( if you ’re good at your job ) .
Learn these magic words : “ I ’d like to talk to you about a salary adjustment . ”
2 . No ultimatums
A big mistake I have heard a few people make when asking for a raise is giving ultimatums to their employers .
I ca n’t stress enough that the workplace is a competitive environment , and while there is nothing wrong with asking for a raise , demanding one can backfire in the worst kind of way .
Many managers , faced with this situation , will simply call your bluff .
Obviously if you suck at your job , or the company is losing money hand over fist , you do n’t stand a snowballs chance , ultimatum or no ultimatum .
If you are n’t yet sure if you are worth more , then read on , as you can do something about that too .
3. Determine your value by job browsing .
It ’s always a good idea to keep an eye on what a fair and competitive wage is in your industry .
Recruiters and online job websites can be great resources for determining what you can expect to make .
Even if you are n’t looking for a new job , check out Monster.com , dice.com , and other job boards ( not at work preferably ) .
Find a similar job suited to your talents and send them your resume .
Feel them out , and if given a phone interview , ask for specifics with regard to salary range .
If you know you are n’t interested because they ’re not paying enough or you ’re comfortable with your existing job , be upfront and courteous .
Inform the person with whom you ’re speaking that you ’re happy with your current position ( if you are ) and be sure to thank them for their consideration .
Hopefully you have wasted as little of their time as possible .
Remember that you are n’t indebted to your employer .
You entered a business arrangement with them when you were hired .
You sell them your time and labor in return for your salary .
Shopping around is n’t unethical .
It ’s good business .
Who knows ?
You might even go on an interview and land a great new gig .
4. Ensure people know your value
Everybody knows the brash and obnoxious “ hot - shot ” type at work that needs to validate his worth publicly .
Everybody resents that person for it too .
A real man knows the thin line between confident and cocky .
Mastery of this line at work is key to proving your worth to those around you .
Just as Teddy Roosevelt was famously quoted , “ Speak softly , and carry a big stick , and you will go far . ”
Instead of trumpeting every small success you have every day , quietly get everything assigned to you done and done well .
When people around you struggle with their work , give them the help they need to get it done , unless of course you work in some ultra-competitive Glengarry Glen Ross type boiler room ( Third place is : You ’re fired ) .
In that case , get a new job .
Having a “ go - to ” and “ willing to help ” attitude has a strange way of uplifting everyone around you .
It increases morale and productivity .
If your boss or supervisor does n’t pick up on this and recognize this kind of leadership , get a new job .
5 . Increase your value
If you are still having trouble establishing value in your position , consider learning something relevant in your free time .
Not everything requires a class or course to be learned .
Often times it only takes putting down Call of Duty 4 and reading about the subject .
If your employer ever offers optional training or certifications , do not pass up on the opportunity .
For example , I was offered an optional training course in Asterisk , an open source PBX ( like Linux for phone systems ) in 2006 .
With that course and a bit of tinkering in my free time , I became an authority on the subject .
Ever since our company moved our software platform onto Asterisk , I ’ve received three separate pay increases .
Seriously , do everything you can to improve your worth .
Once you ’re sure you have established your value as a go - to guy , it ’s time to seek your reward for all that hard work .
Without sounding accusatory or argumentative , let your employer know about the successes you ’ve had since you ’ve been at your current position .
Show them projects you have spearheaded and people you have helped .
Make sure they know about all the relevant job skills you ’ve picked up while working there .
If through conversations with others in your industry , you ’ve discovered your salary is n’t competitive , let your current employer know .
Win them over to your side and you ’re almost guaranteed to be earning more .

Some of man ’s greatest discoveries have been made entirely by accident .
If it were n’t for many of these things , life would be very different for us .
This is a list of the 10 greatest accidental discoveries .
10 . Viagra
Millions of men around the world owe a salute to the hard working stiffs in the Welsh village of Merthyr Tydfil where , in 1992 , their hard work testing this new angina drug produced firm evidence of its unexpected sex enhancing power .
This discovery would be much higher on the list if it were n’t for the fact that it is the cause of 90 % of the spam I receive every day !
9. Chocolate Chip Cookies
According to Nestle , Mrs. Wakefield ( owner of the Toll House Inn ) was making chocolate cookies but ran out of regular baker ’s chocolate , so she substituted it with broken pieces of semi-sweet chocolate , thinking that it would melt and mix into the batter .
It clearly did not , and the chocolate chip cookie was born .
Wakefield sold the recipe to Nestle in exchange for a lifetime supply of chocolate chips ( instead of patenting it and making billions ! )
Every bag of Nestle chocolate chips in North America has a variation of her original recipe printed on the back ( margarine is now included both as a variant on butter and for those people who want to pretend it is healthy ) .
8. Popsicles
The Popsicle was invented by an 11 year who kept it secret for 18 years .
The inventor was Frank Epperson who , in 1905 , left a mixture of powdered soda and water out on the porch , which contained a stir stick .
That night , temperatures in San Francisco reached a record low .
When he woke the next morning , he discovered that it had frozen to the stir stick , creating a fruit flavored ice treat that he humbly named the epsicle .
18 years later he patented it and called it the Popsicle .
7. Artificial Sweetener
Like many artificial sweeteners , the sweetness of cyclamate was discovered by accident .
Michael Sveda was working in the lab on the synthesis of anti-fever medication .
He put his cigarette down on the lab bench and when he put it back in his mouth he discovered the sweet taste of cyclamate .
Aspartame was discovered in 1965 by James M. Schlatter , a chemist working for G.D. Searle & Company .
Schlatter had synthesized aspartame in the course of producing an anti-ulcer drug candidate .
He discovered its sweet taste serendipitously when he licked his finger , which had accidentally become contaminated with aspartame .
Saccharin ( the oldest artificial sweetener ) was first produced in 1878 by Constantin Fahlberg , a chemist working on coal tar derivatives in Ira Remsen ’s laboratory at the Johns Hopkins University , and it was he who , accidentally , discovered its intensely sweet nature .
6. Brandy
Initially wine was distilled as a preservation method and as a way to make the wine easier for merchants to transport .
It was also thought that wine was originally distilled to lessen the tax which was assessed by volume .
The intent was to add the water removed by distillation back to the brandy shortly before consumption .
It was discovered that after having been stored in wooden casks , the resulting product had improved over the original distilled spirit .
No one is sure who it was that discovered the delightful taste of this distilled liquor , but he was clearly guided by God in its discovery for the betterment of man .
5. Teflon
Teflon was invented accidentally by Roy Plunkett of Kinetic Chemicals in 1938 .
Plunkett was attempting to make a new CFC refrigerant , the perfluorethylene polymerized ( say that 3 times fast ! ) in a pressurized storage container .
In this original chemical reaction , iron from the inside of the container acted as a catalyst .
In 1954 , French engineer Marc Grégoire created the first pan coated with Teflon non-stick resin under the brand name of Tefal after his wife urged him to try the material , that he ’d been using on fishing tackle , on her cooking pans .
Teflon is inert to virtually all chemicals and is considered the most slippery material in existence – second only to the political wrangling of President George Bush .
4. Microwave
Percy LeBaron Spencer of the Raytheon Company was walking past a radar tube and he noticed that the chocolate bar in his pocket melted .
Realizing that he might be on to a hot new product he placed a small bowl of popcorn in front of the tube and it quickly popped all over the room .
Tens of millions of lazy cooks now have him to thank for their dull food !
3. Potato Chips
The first potato chip was invented by George Crum ( half American Indian half African American ) at Moon ’s Lake House near Saratoga Springs , New York , on August 24 , 1853 .
He was fed up with the constant complaints of a customer who kept sending his potatoes back to the kitchen because they were too thick and soggy .
Crum decided to slice the potatoes so thin that they could n’t be eaten with a fork .
Against Crum ’s expectation , the customer was ecstatic about the new chips .
They became a regular item on the lodge ’s menu under the name “ Saratoga Chips ” and a large contributing factor of the Western world ’s obesity problems .
2. LSD
LSD was first synthesized on November 16 , 1938 by Swiss chemist Dr. Albert Hofmann at the Sandoz Laboratories in Basel , Switzerland , as part of a large research program searching for medically useful ergot alkaloid derivatives .
Its psychedelic properties were unknown until 5 years later , when Hofmann , acting on what he has called a “ peculiar presentiment , ” returned to work on the chemical .
While re-synthesizing LSD - 25 for further study on April 16 , 1943 , Hofmann became dizzy and was forced to stop work .
In his journal , Hofmann wrote that after becoming dizzy he proceeded home and was affected by a “ remarkable restlessness , combined with a slight dizziness ” .
Hofmann stated that as he lay in his bed he sank into a not unpleasant “ intoxicated like condition ” which was characterized by an extremely stimulated imagination .
He stated that he was in a dreamlike state , and with his eyes closed he could see uninterrupted streams of “ fantastic pictures , extraordinary shapes with intense , kaleidoscopic play of colors . ”
The condition lasted about two hours after which it faded away .
Following this , he took a massive dose on what has become known as Bicycle Day .

He turned up at work one day and discovered a blue - green mould that seemed to be inhibiting growth of the bacteria .
He grew a pure culture of the mould and discovered that it was a Penicillium mould .
After further experiments , Fleming was convinced that penicillin could not last long enough in the human body to kill pathogenic bacteria , and stopped studying it after 1931 , but restarted some clinical trials in 1934 and continued to try to get someone to purify it until 1940 .
The development of penicillin for use as a medicine is attributed to the Australian Nobel Laureate Howard Walter Florey – he shared the Nobel Prize with Fleming and Ernst Boris Chain .

In the last two weeks Senator Obama has been sounding rather hawkish .
Perhaps he believes he has the Democratic nomination wrapped up and now can start running to the center - right .
The peace movement needs to let him know his positions are not acceptable .
Some peace advocates had already given up on Sen.
Obama because of his record since he came to the U.S. Senate .
His voting record on Iraq and foreign policy is very similar to Sen. Clinton .
Obama did make a great speech before the war began , saying much the same thing that peace advocates were saying , but that seems to have been the peak of his peace advocacy .
Indeed , Black Agenda Report described how Obama took his anti-war speech off his website once he began running for the senate .
And since coming to the senate he has voted for Iraq funding , giving Bush hundreds of billions of dollars .
Further , he is calling for nearly 100,000 more U.S. troops as well as keeping the military option on the table for Iran .
But in the last two weeks he has moved to the right .
On April 1 , Amy Goodman of Democracy Now !
interviewed Obama about what type of U.S. residual forces he would leave behind in Iraq .
First , Obama acknowledged combat troops would be left behind as “ a strike force in the region . ”
Where would this strike force be based ?
Obama said “ It does n’t necessarily have to be in Iraq ; it could be in Kuwait or other places . ”
Of even greater concern was the 140,000 civilian troops — the private security forces that some describe as mercenaries — who are in Iraq .
With regard to these Obama said : “ we have 140,000 private contractors right there , so unless we want to replace all of or a big chunk of those with US troops , we ca n’t draw down the contractors faster than we can draw down our troops . ”
When Goodman pressed him on whether he would support a ban on private military forces Obama said “ Well , I do n’t want to replace those contractors with more U.S. troops , because we do n’t have them , alright ? ”
Obama seems to be choosing his words very carefully when he talks of his Iraq plan .
He always talks in terms of only “ withdrawing ” “ combat ” troops and ending “ the war . ”
Withdrawal is not the same as bringing troops home as it could mean moving the troops somewhere else in the region and into Afghanistan .
Combat troops are a minority of the 150,000 troops in Iraq .
And , ending the “ war ” is not the same as ending the occupation .
Indeed , Obama plans to keep the massive U.S. Embassy as well as the long - term military bases being built in Iraq .
No wonder he does not talk about ending the occupation as it does not seem that is his intent .
What are the two - thirds of Americans who oppose the Iraq war and want to see U.S. forces brought home to think ?
It sounds like Obama would leave more than 100,000 and perhaps even more than 200,000 public and private military troops in Iraq .
And , he would leave strike forces in the region “ not necessarily in Iraq ” who could strike in Iraq when needed .
Is this what he means by withdrawal ?
The other important speech that Obama gave focused on his broader approach to foreign policy .
In this speech , given on March 28th , Obama praised the foreign policy of George H.W. Bush .
Obama described his foreign policy as a traditional U.S. approach — certainly not the “ change ” he promises in his big campaign speeches saying “ my foreign policy is actually a return to the traditional bipartisan realistic policy of George Bush ’s father , of John F. Kennedy , of , in some ways , Ronald Reagan . ”
There is lot to unravel in the foreign policy of these former presidents .
While these X - President ’s are much more popular than the current occupant of the White House , which is why Obama believes tying himself to those will garner votes , each of their foreign policy strategies relied heavily on the use of the U.S. military .
Here are some highlights :
Both George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan get credit for negotiating with Iran to hold the U.S. hostages until after Reagan - Bush took power in return for military and financial assistance to Iran .
This act put their personal political ambitions ahead of the needs of U.S. citizens being held hostage .
Perhaps the best known Reagan - Bush foreign policy was the Iran - Contra scandal , a scheme to circumvent U.S. law by providing arms to overthrow the government in Nicaragua .
They shipped weapons to the mullah ’s in Iran in return for cash which was used to fund the Nicaraguan fighters .
This was done because the Congress passed a law preventing U.S. tax dollars being used to arm the rebels in Nicaragua .
As part of their campaign against the Soviet Union the Reagan - Bush team also armed Islamists fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan .
This allowed Osama bin Laden to gain a stronghold in Afghanistan and is one of the root causes of today ’s military adventures .
Thus Reagan - Bush armed two current “ enemies ” Iran and al Qaeda .
In fact , they also armed Saddam Hussein by providing him with the makings of an array of weapons of mass destruction .
The arming of Saddam continued with the Bush - Quayle administration even after Saddam “ gassed ” his own people .
President George H.W. Bush was the only CIA director to become president .
As in the Reagan era , Bush I treated Saddam Hussein as a close ally .
Shortly before the Gulf War he approved the sale of an additional $ 4.8 million in “ dual-use ” technology to factories identified by the CIA as Saddam ’s nuclear and bio-weapons programs .
And , just before Saddam invaded Kuwait , Bush sold him $ 600 million in advanced communications technology .
Prior to the Kuwait invasion the Bush administration sent signals to Saddam that the U.S. was not worried about a military conflict between Iraq and Kuwait .
But when Saddam sent tanks into Kuwait the U.S. responded with an aggressive aerial campaign that destroyed much of Iraq ’s civilian infrastructure and a 100 hour ground war .
Bush then urged anti-Saddam forces to rise - up against Hussein and then left them hanging without U.S. support .
Then , the “ peace ” with Iraq led to the sanctions of the Bush and Clinton administrations which killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis .
The only Democrat mentioned by Obama was JFK .
Obama did not mention the less popular LBJ , Jimmy Carter or his opponent ’s husband , Bill Clinton .
Perhaps because the Kennedy administration was so long ago he expects voters not to remember their militarism .
And , the Camelot aura of Kennedy is one Obama aspires to .
Of course , President Kennedy must be given credit for the steady expansion of the Vietnam conflict and its escalation into a quagmire that trapped his successor .
Kennedy drew a line in the sand against communism in Vietnam saying “ ” Now we have a problem making our power credible and Vietnam looks like the place . ”
Troop escalation went from hundreds to more than 15,000 , the Green Berets and helicopters were both sent in .
Kennedy approved a coup which led to the killing of the prime minister and his brother in 1963 and a succession of regimes seen more and more as U.S. puppets .
Kennedy was assassinated shortly after the coup but the path into Vietnam had been laid .
What other foreign policy misadventures does JFK get credit for ?
One of note was a military attack on Cuba known as the Bay of Pigs .
This invasion by 1,500 exiled Cubans ended in disaster for the U.S. as it was easily rebuffed by Castro with most of the troops captured .
JFK did not give up on regime change after this failure ; in fact he escalated it with Operation Mongoose .
Mongoose , which lasted until the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 , included among its plans the use chemical weapons against sugar cane workers , sending the Green Beret ’s into Cuba , using gangsters to kill Cuban police , propagandizing the Cuban people , sabotaging mines , cash rewards for killing Cuban officials and false flag attacks against the U.S. to be blamed on Cuba .
And Kennedy also gets credit for taking the initial steps that ended up with Saddam Hussein in Iraq .
In 1963 Kennedy backed a coup against the Iraqi government .
The CIA helped bring the Baath Party to power .
The CIA provided the new Iraqi government with a list of suspected Communists to kill .
Saddam Hussein was one of those who carried out the killings which included hundreds of doctors , teachers , technicians , lawyers , Iraqi professionals and officials .
The U.S. began to arm the Iraq regime with weapons they used against the Kurds and U.S. and British oil companies began profiting from Iraqi oil .
No doubt Senator Obama is well - aware of this history , so what did he mean when he said his foreign policy would emulate these three ?
Are we to expect more coups of regimes we do n’t like ?
The arming of future adversaries ?
Illegal actions to circumvent the Congress ?
Now that Sen. Obama has tied himself to Kennedy , Reagan and H.W. Bush he needs to clarify whether this Hall of Shame history of bi-partisan U.S. foreign policy is what he intends to emulate .
Senator Obama clearly thinks he can take the peace movement for granted .
Many peace advocates support Obama because of his pre-U.S. Senate speech against the Iraq invasion .
But , now his foreign and Iraq policies are coming more closely into focus maybe it is time to re-think that support .
It is time for the peace movement to push Sen .
Obama to be a better candidate , one that will really bring change to U.S. foreign policy .
For those who like Obama ’s message of “ hope ” and “ change ” it is important to realize his foreign policy , as he is beginning to define it , brings neither .
Obama is risking the loss of votes to three strong alternatives to the two parties .
If Obama is not pulled back toward his pre-Senate position more and more peace voters will desert him for either former Representative Cynthia McKinney of the Green Party , Ralph Nader and Matt Gonzalez ’s independent campaign , or possible Libertarian candidates Mike Gravel or former congressman Bob Barr .
These are all candidates who are strongly opposed to military intervention and the Iraq occupation .
In November there will be choices of real peace candidates or a major party nominee who is no longer promising real change .
Pressure now from the peace movement , if heeded by Sen. Obama , will make him a stronger candidate .
Is it time to for the peace movement to protest Obama ?
Introduction
Cutting - edge computer games use different graphics subsystems -- so - called 3D graphics engines .
Source ( used in Half Life 2 ) , Unreal Engine ( Unreal Tournament ) , idTech 4 ( Doom 3 ) , CryENGINE2 ( Crysis ) or Clever 's Paradox engine are well - known among the players and the game industry experts .
It 's time to learn a new 3D game engine name : Microsoft Excel .
It is understood that Excel is an all - round office tool , but probably it is unknown that it has a bunch of features that makes Excel a high - class 3D graphics engine .
In this article I will demonstrate Excel 's arithmetical facilities , the embedded rendering subsystems ( there are two of them ! ) and the revolutionary approach which might just cause a paradigm shift .
I hope you will discover that Excel effectively and efficiently incorporates practicality , tons of features , the multi-platform portability and the high performance with the unique and futuristic 3D engine features .
The chapters even have demo programs and movies created with the Excel 3D engine .
Warning : Only for determined experts !
Arithmetic
Maybe Excel 's arithmetic functions need a demonstration least of all .
The core functions of the 3D object manipulation ( e.g. the four rules of arithmetic , trigonometric functions , matrix algebra ) mean the essence of Excel - but it is worth examining them because of their unequalled compactness and its magnificent elegance with which Excel towers above the current entire 3D engine field .
Compactness
It is very likely that not too many game engines solve the whole 3D arithmetic in a half screen size .
The upper part of Figure 1 contains the spatial shift , the rotation around X , Y , Z axis and the perspective projection as well .
As it can be seen in the demo applications , the polygon visibility , the Z - buffering and the reflection calculation require about the same size .
Figure 1 : Essence of the 3D engine
The yellow color marks the user - defined parameters and green color indicates the engine - calculated values .
Numbered areas contain the following data :
Parameters of the perspective projection 3D coordinates of the objects ' points ( relative to their center ) Shift and rotation matrix ( further details can be found e.g. at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection)
Parameters of the rotation 3D absolute coordinates of the points after the shift and rotation 2D coordinates of the points after the perspective projection Screen coordinates of the points End points of the objects ' edges Formula of an element in the shift and rotation matrix .
Simplicity and compactness are clearly visible .
Elegance
The development environment of Excel not only allows the programmers to edit a plain or syntax - highlighted source code , but it also provides all of its well - known formatting functions for the engine developers : several fonts can be used simultaneously ( with different types and sizes ) , the cells and texts colored , pop -up notes added , and -- sit down ! -- sounds or even entire movies inserted if required .
Over the past 200 years , the stock market 's steady upward march occasionally has been disrupted for long stretches , most recently during the Great Depression and the inflation - plagued 1970s .
The current market turmoil suggests that we may be in another lost decade .
The stock market is trading right where it was nine years ago .
Stocks , long touted as the best investment for the long term , have been one of the worst investments over the nine - year period , trounced even by lowly Treasury bonds .

1959 : Luna 2 becomes the first artifact of humanity to strike the moon .
The Soviet Union launched The Sputnik - like probe from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on Sept. 12 .
It took 33.5 hours to reach its destination .
Hitting the moon , as prestigious an accomplishment as it was for the young Soviet space program , was not Luna 2's only objective .
Prior to impact , the craft also sent back data confirming , among other things , that the moon had neither a magnetic field nor any radiation belts .
Because Luna 2 itself lacked a propulsion system , it was guided along by the third stage of its SS - 6 booster rocket until the two separated shortly before impact .
The probe hit the lunar surface east of Mare Serenitatis ( momentarily disrupting the serenity near the Sea of Serenity ) , near the Aristides and Archimedes craters .
The booster 's third stage hit the moon about a half - hour later .
Luna 2 was the second in the Soviet Union 's ambitious and long - running Luna Program , which collected information about the lunar environment at least in part to prepare for a Russian attempt to land a man on the moon , which failed to materialize .
Four Luna probes ( 2 , 9 , 13 and 15 ) reached the moon before Neil Armstrong did , but the biggest prize of all eluded the Russians , and the Luna Program came to an end with Luna 24 in 1976 .
Despite the failure of the U.S.S.R. to get a man to the moon , the Luna Program must be considered a success in the long view .
Among its scientific achievements and firsts : first lunar flyby ( Luna 1 ) , first landing ( Luna 2 ) , first photographs from the dark side of the moon ( Luna 3 ) , first successful soft landing on the lunar surface ( Luna 13 ) , first analysis of lunar soil , and first deployment of a lunar rover ( Luna 17 ) .

Two organisations share the responsibility for rating video games
Given that the average gamer is aged 23 or above , it 's perhaps no surprise that a lot of games are rated over - 18 only .
But who are the guardians of taste and decency and how do they decide a videogame 's age rating ?
In the UK , video games are classified by two bodies - the Pan European Game Information system ( Pegi ) and the British Board of Film Classification ( BBFC ) - both of which have overlapping roles .
" The Pegi system is the industry - backed system which classifies products by age for suitability to play , " says Paul Jackson , director general of the games industry trade association Elspa .
However , about 10 % of games in the UK also go to the BBFC .
" At the moment the only games that come to the BBFC are the ones that contain gross violence which is roughly the equivalent of an 18 certificate movie or certain types of games that contain linear material that can bring them to the BBFC attention as well , " says BBFC director David Cooke .
" So that means we see two types of games .
We see quite often games with adult content in , but we see games at all other levels as well because they happen to have this particular type of non-interactive material that means it has to come to us . "
Protecting children Debate about the way that video games are rated has been sparked by the recent review penned by psychologist Dr Tanya Byron for the British government .
Dr Byron recommends overhauling the video games ratings system
The report into the risks children face from the internet and video games was the first of its kind anywhere in the world .
It arrived at a couple of conclusions which could have far - reaching implications for the video games industry .
" She has essentially said three things , and I think those things are very important , " says Mr Jackson .
" She said firstly that the parents must be involved with their children 's online and game playing usage , because they are the only guardians in the home .
The second thing she said is where possible parental locks should be easy to use and should be implemented .
" And finally she said we need to have a clear age rating classification .
I think we have got some more to do on that . "
Classification methods
It is not just the issue of who classifies what .
The differing approaches the two bodies take to classifying games has also raised questions in the games industry over which is better placed to tackle the job .
They will play the game and sample it at all levels .
They will have help from the publisher , so they have cheat codes because it is n't necessarily easy if you are getting killed all the time
David Cooke , BBFC
" The Pegi system is a classic self - regulatory system , " says Mr Jackson .
" Every publisher who is putting a game forward for publication reviews the whole game , every element of it , and puts together a report for the Pegi organisation .
" The Pegi organisation then uses a set of criteria to decide what age that is appropriate for .
That is how it is published across Europe . "
The BBFC use a team of two examiners .
" These are people typically in their early 30s , not blokes in suits and bowler hats .
They are people who in some cases actually come from the games industry , " explains Mr Cooke .
" They will play the game and sample it at all levels .
They will have help from the publisher , so they have cheat codes because it is n't necessarily easy if you are getting killed all the time .
" The other thing that 's important is that we are able to look at context and tone .
It 's not just a matter of ticking boxes about such and such an issue of violence or such and such an issue of bad language . "
Complicated system
It would seem that while consumers are well aware of the age rating system for movies , the same can not be said for video games .
" I think there is a generational gap , " says Mr Cooke .
" The Byron report found , and it's our experience and our finding as well , that games and games classification is not as well understood as film classification or DVDs .
" The games classification system at the moment is more complicated because there is a sort of split of responsibility between the BBFC and Pegi .
There are a lot of reasons why that should be , but it does makes a lot of sense to try and raise the awareness levels to the kind of levels that you do find in films and for DVDs . "
It looks like this issue will take a while to be resolved .
In the UK it has been suggested that the games industry needs to embark on a further 18 - month consultation period with the government , to decide upon a unified strategy for video games classification .

Jeroen van der Veer is no pushover .
The 60 - year - old CEO stands out as a tough guy in an industry filled with them .
In 2004 , after taking the helm of Shell , the frugal , hawk - faced chief executive forced the $ 300 billion oil company through a painful restructuring .
He borrowed a management model from his Dutch military days , deliberately holding strategy sessions in cramped rooms where his subordinates had to stand while their leader remained seated .
This tough demeanor was glaringly absent , however , when van der Veer met with Russian president Vladimir Putin in the winter of 2006 .
Shell had toiled for a decade to develop Sakhalin - 2 , a vast $ 22 billion oil and gas project on Russia ’s remote eastern coast , when Putin seized the reins and handed them off to Gazprom , the state energy concern .
To retain a financial stake in the project , Shell reportedly had to pay the Kremlin a special dividend worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually .
Yet in announcing the deal , the hard - assed CEO came off more like a cheerleader .
“ Thank you very much for your support , ” van der Veer gushed , addressing Putin as the two men stood together in an ornate Kremlin stateroom .
“ I think for us , the great news is there ’s now stability , so we can all work together . ”
Groveling may not come naturally to guys like van der Veer , but they ’d best get used to it .
Soaring oil prices have emboldened Russia and other petrostates to stand up to Western execs and build up their own state - run petroleum operations .
While some oil multinationals continue to haul in record profits , they ’re rapidly losing global clout , and with their holdings on the decline , executives have little choice but to grin and bear it .
We ’re “ seeing a further shifting in the oil industry in which national oil companies are the power brokers , ” says Andrew Neff , senior energy analyst at economic forecaster Global Insight .
Anyone inclined to celebrate Big Oil ’s recent misfortunes had better hold off on the champagne .
For however badly the Western firms may have behaved , the new global oil barons could one day leave environmental and social activists nostalgic for the bad old days of ExxonMobil .
A decade ago , Western petroleum companies still ruled the world .
To entice these firms to develop their oil resources , cash - strapped exporters such as Venezuela and Russia gave away the store .
Fairly typical was the original Sakhalin - 2 agreement , which let Shell recoup all the money it had put in before Russia earned a dime in oil revenues , and generous incentives from Caracas lured some 60 firms to Venezuela ’s oil sector during the 1990s .
Funny how a sevenfold price increase changes the game .
Years of global terrorism , war in Afghanistan and the Middle East , rebel attacks in Nigeria , and assorted other mayhem recently helped oil broach $ 100 per barrel .
Asian industrialization has done the rest : China , once able to produce all the crude it needed , is projected to import three - quarters of its petroleum by 2025 , and consume half as much as the United States .
The booming demand has transformed Russia from a pauper state into one that sits atop nearly $ 500 billion in liquid assets , while Iran , with the world ’s third - largest supply of crude , now earns record annual revenues from oil .
Pay ’em not to drill Ecuadoran president Rafael Correa says his country will leave nearly a billion barrels of oil untapped in the Yasuní , a delicate stretch of rainforest , if rich nations pony up $ 4.6 billion — half of the expected revenues .
Seems like a pump dream , yet Spain has committed $ 4 million , others are interested , and the Clinton Global Initiative has embraced the project .
But even supporters fear betrayal , so Ecuador will issue certificates redeemable if the Yasuní is later exploited .
Correa recently approved drilling in another sensitive area , but still , sitting on Ecuador ’s largest oil prospect would be truly historic .

Big Oil , by contrast , faces a grim future .
During the 1960s , multinationals such as Mobil , BP , and Shell had access to more than 80 percent of global oil and natural gas reserves .
These days , Western multinationals control just 10 percent of the world ’s oil , while state - run firms , according to a November 2007 paper from Rice University ’s James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy , exercise exclusive domain over roughly 77 percent .
America ’s own oil production has been in a prolonged slide , and exploration prospects appear limited — Iraq , once the great Western hope , has barely recovered to prewar production levels .
The petrostates have n’t been shy about wielding their power .
In addition to negotiating the Shell coup , the Kremlin pushed British energy giant BP to sell its stake in Kovykta , a major Russian gas field .
In spring 2007 , Venezuela , which ranks seventh in oil reserves , took control of projects owned by foreign companies in the rich Orinoco Belt , a move that cost America ’s ConocoPhillips 10 percent of its oil holdings and nearly erased the firm ’s profits for that quarter .
“ They wo n’t be missed , ” president Hugo Chávez said of the Westerners .
In nearby Bolivia , president Evo Morales nationalized his oil and gas fields in 2006 , and Ecuador has forced foreign firms to cough up more in taxes .
“ They understand the way energy markets have changed , and they ’re reinforced by Chávez ’s success , ” says Michael Shifter , vice president for policy at the Inter - American Dialogue , a Washington , D.C. , nonprofit .
The state - run firms have exploded in size and number and now include 15 of the world ’s top 25 oil companies , according to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly .
Gazprom is the biggest natural gas company on earth , and Aramco and the National Iranian Oil Company may be the globe ’s most powerful oil concerns .
The United Arab Emirates has amassed so much oil wealth that it boasts a state - owned investment fund worth an estimated $ 1.3 trillion .
Kazakhstan , where the world ’s biggest new oil field was discovered in 2000 , has also taken advantage of the power shift .
After letting a consortium of multinationals develop the massive project , last fall the government began pressuring the firms to boost its stake .
In December , the country ’s deputy finance minister told the Financial Times that the days of Western dominance were “ ancient times . ”
Ca n’t muster sympathy for the captains of industry ?
Well , consider this .
In the past , activists pushing for improvements from oppressive oil regimes such as Burma ’s got leverage by launching PR campaigns to embarrass their Western oil partners .
But those days are over .
Given their waning power , the multinationals are more likely than ever to overlook the abuses .
To get their hands on the petroleum of Libya , a nation with an abysmal human rights record , oil companies have offered dictator Moammar Qaddafi nearly all the proceeds from any partnership deals .
Six months after the Kremlin took back Sakhalin - 2 , Putin met with a collection of leading CEOs at a forum in his hometown of St. Petersburg where they competed to suck up to him .
“ The president is very open and straightforward , ” Christophe de Margerie , head of French oil giant Total , fawned to the press afterward .
“ We ’d like to invest more . ”
And even as the Kremlin turned the screws on BP to muscle it out of a key project in Russia , chief executive Tony Hayward turned on the charm , declaring that BP was “ pleased to be a minority shareholder in Rosneft , ” another state - controlled oil firm .
If Big Oil is willing to overlook the petrostates ’ abuses , there ’s another global partner that can even protect them from international sanctions .
China , after all , has veto power over United Nations Security Council resolutions .
PetroChina , Beijing ’s state - run behemoth , is the world ’s most valuable company , and its parent firm , China National Petroleum Corporation , is trolling for oil around the globe .
These firms share the multinationals ’ hunger for oil investment but resemble Gazprom in their lack of accountability .
Consumer campaigns in America mean little to autocratic regimes when China is knocking on the front door .
Most years , the triennial World Energy Congress plays out like a celebration of plutocracy .
Most years , the triennial World Energy Congress plays out like a celebration of plutocracy .
Over several days in some global metropolis , the heads of the world ’s biggest energy companies gather to talk business and schmooze with politicians .
But last fall in Rome , the high rollers were feeling some trepidation .
Facing an expectant audience was Rex Tillerson , head of the world ’s largest multinational oil company .
ExxonMobil inspires fear and admiration in the industry for its ruthlessness and success — in 2007 , it recorded the most profitable year of any firm in American history , with net income of $ 40.6 billion .
Yet world events had Tillerson worried .
“ At a time when we should open doors to trade , resource nationalism closes them , ” he warned .
“ At a time when we should be building bridges of international partnership , resource nationalism builds walls . ”
America ’s political and military leaders are perhaps the most concerned they ’ve been since the 1970s Arab oil embargo that exporters might use oil as a blunt instrument .
In an internal study , the Pentagon ’s Southern Command , responsible for Latin America , cautioned that the rise of state - dominated companies could threaten U.S. access to South American oil ; Venezuela , for instance , is America ’s fourth - biggest oil supplier , and president Hugo Chávez could damage the U.S. economy were he to make good on threats to cut off shipments .
He roiled global oil markets in February with just such a threat after ExxonMobil won an injunction freezing up to $ 12 billion in Venezuelan oil assets in retaliation for the Orinoco takeover .
The loss of Venezuelan oil , according to a 2006 study by the Government Accountability Office , would reduce U.S. gross domestic product by more than $ 20 billion and lead to an increase in gasoline prices .
Meanwhile , at a 2006 closed - door Washington meeting sponsored by several government agencies , intelligence analysts fretted that the rapid entry of Chinese companies into Africa , a continent the United States has cultivated as an alternative to the Middle East , may undermine vital energy supplies there as well .
With America ’s growing oil consumption , the rise of state - run companies , and booming competition for foreign oil , higher prices at the pump are all but inevitable .
The U.S. government estimates that Americans will use more than 4 million additional barrels of liquid fuels per day by 2030 — at which point gasoline could make organic milk seem like a bargain .
Given the political fallout of sky - high fuel costs , Congress and the White House have paid much lip service to improving the nation ’s energy independence .
( See “ The Seven Myths of Energy Independence . ” )
President Bush has even set a goal to slash Middle Eastern oil imports some 75 percent by 2025 .
“ The best way to break this addiction is through technology , ” he proclaimed in his 2006 State of the Union speech .
In reality , his budgets have called for cuts in renewable energy programs , and his administration has fought proposals to mandate energy - efficiency standards for utilities .
The Democratic Congress seems just as shortsighted .
Like it or not , ethanol is being pushed as a major oil alternative , but rather than supporting research to produce it sustainably from agricultural waste , Congress has overwhelmingly subsidized corn - based ethanol production , which expends about as much energy as it produces and spews more greenhouse gases than it ultimately prevents .
In the meantime , an Iowa State University study concluded that importing cheap ethanol from democratic Brazil — whose sugarcane­ ethanol could be environmentally superior given land - use restrictions to prevent rainforest clearing — would prompt Americans to use some 300 million extra gallons of ethanol ( and presumably less gasoline ) .
But Midwestern legislators have convinced Congress to maintain massive tariffs on ethanol imports , protecting agriculture giants such as Archer Daniels Midland , which stand to gain significantly from the wasteful corn-fed process .
Of course , the ills of nationalized oil extend well beyond U.S. energy policy .

Burma ’s second - largest city felt tranquil at first glance .
Crimson - robed monks padded through side alleys at dawn , begging for rice , while vendors stirred massive vats of bubbling oil and water to make thin rice noodles .
But as the world recently witnessed , pent - up fury at Burma ’s military regime percolates just under the surface .
“ This government , it ’s nothing for us , ” one middle - aged resident told me .
“ We have nothing . ”
Those frustrations erupted last summer and fall after the government halted fuel subsidies , leading to a spike in food prices .
Across the nation , monks swarmed into the streets to assail the policies of the ruling junta , which responded to the unrest with a violent crackdown .
Subsequent sanctions imposed by the United States , the EU , and other democracies did n’t seem to trouble Burma ’s leaders — they have “ no major concerns , ” one head of Burma ’s national oil company told a trade publication in November , “ as there are a lot of Indian , Chinese , Thai , and Malaysian companies operating in exploration and production . ”
The country has discovered some of Southeast Asia ’s largest natural gas deposits in recent years .
Even as riot police beat and arrested protesters , India ’s oil minister was on hand to witness the signing of a $ 150 million contract for further gas exploration .
A new pipeline is planned to carry Burma ’s gas to the southwestern Chinese province of Yunnan , raising the specter of brutality .
“ Areas of Burma that are subject to major development projects experience some of the most pervasive abuses , ” Human Rights Watch reported last year .
The planned pipeline likely “ will involve the use of forced labor , and result in illegal land confiscation , forced displacement , and unnecessary use of force against villagers , ” the group warned , and the sales windfall will further entrench the military regime .
But do n’t expect any action from the United Nations .
In January 2007 , China vetoed a Security Council resolution pressuring the Burmese junta to release political prisoners and ease its repression .
Mere days after the veto , Burma granted China resource - exploration rights to three areas off its coast .
Burma is not an isolated example : Governments in Venezuela , Russia , and many other oil - rich countries have become increasingly authoritarian and corrupt .
The D.C. - based monitoring group Freedom House cited a trend of international “ freedom stagnation ” in its 2007 “ Freedom in the World ” report and has deemed energy - rich countries “ among the world ’s poorest performers in governance and democratic process . ”
Russia , by the group ’s annual analyses , has declined from “ partly free ” in 2002 to “ not free ” last year .
The Kremlin has become less responsive to American concerns , and it blocked Western election observers from monitoring Russia ’s parliamentary vote this past December .

For its part , oil - rich Kazakhstan , once considered a leading democratic light in Central Asia , has devolved into a thugocracy where a prominent opposition leader was brutally murdered and longtime president Nursultan Nazarbayev , along with his oil minister , was accused of accepting $ 78 million in bribes in exchange for oil deals .
In Venezuela , which ranks near the bottom of Transparency International ’s annual index of perceived corruption , Chávez uses his state oil company as a private purse to fund pet projects .
Some , such as literacy programs , promote social improvement and allow Chávez to appear the good guy , while others , like oil - funded purchases of arms and helicopters , help consolidate his power domestically .
Chávez also wields his nation ’s oil for regional influence .
He has spread subsidized petroleum to his allies , bought up billions ’ worth of Argentine bonds , and helped other countries build up their own national oil firms , thereby gaining the loyalties of leaders from Argentina to Cuba .
He has even used it to gain public sympathy while thumbing his nose at the Bush administration : Since 2005 , Citgo , the U.S. subsidiary of Venezuela ’s state petroleum company , has doled out tens of millions of gallons of heavily discounted heating oil to low - income Americans , touting the giveaways — and the recipients ’ gratitude — in splashy print and television ads .
Where Chávez has used the carrot , Russia has wielded the stick .
In late 2005 , a year after Ukraine ’s Orange Revolution swept a more democratic government into power , Gazprom jacked up the price of natural gas to its neighbor .
During the dispute that followed , Gazprom briefly cut off gas supplies midwinter , forcing Ukraine to pay more .
The following winter , the firm used the same strategy against Georgia , another neighbor that had elected pro-Western leaders .
This February , Russia and Ukraine reached a settlement after Gazprom again threatened to cut off gas to Ukraine , where average winter temperatures in the capital are below freezing .
On the environmental front , state - run oil companies make Shell and ExxonMobil look like Greenpeace .
On the environmental front , state - run oil companies make Shell and ExxonMobil look like Greenpeace .
The multinational firms may cozy up to nasty regimes , but they are at least obligated to respond to public criticism .
Shell releases detailed annual reports about its sustainability efforts , and most of its peers have signed on to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative , a voluntary compact designed to reduce corruption in countries with oil and gas investments .
Embracing some environmental issues helps the firms win favor from shareholders and the public , which is why BP , for one , has put a huge PR push behind its modest initiatives to combat global warming .
( See “ Scrubbing King Coal . ” )
The national concerns , by contrast , behave with near impunity .
A lengthy study by Matthew Chen , a researcher at Rice University ’s Baker Institute , found that some of these firms provide virtually no information about their corporate citizenship .
Two of China ’s top three oil companies , in fact , have been implicated in serious ecological mishaps , including a massive spill of carcinogenic benzene in 2005 that poisoned water supplies in northeast China and across the border in Russia .
In its 2007 ranking of the world ’s largest firms by their commitment to business and social responsibility , Fortune rated China National Petroleum Corporation 80th out of 100 companies .
Gazprom ranked worse at 86th .
Clustered at the top of the list , meanwhile , were several multinational oil companies , including Shell , Total , Marathon , and in the No. 1 slot , BP .
It may be greenwashing , but at least these firms care about their image .
There ’s also the efficiency factor to consider .
Generally speaking , Western companies use the latest technology to reduce waste and maximize oil - field output .
But with corrupt leaders bleeding money from state oil coffers — cash that might have been invested in better equipment — the national firms tend to extract less oil from the ground and expend far more energy doing so .
Despite vast deposits , oil - field production has been dropping in Mexico , Iran , and Venezuela .
In Kazakhstan , where the government recently negotiated a larger stake in its vast oil field , state - run firm KazMunaiGaz “ does n’t have the expertise to take over the project , or the environmental expertise , ” says Global Insight ’s Andrew Neff .
To some in Russia , Gazprom ’s December 2006 takeover of Sakhalin - 2 signaled a new era of global influence for Moscow .
But locals of Sakhalin Island , home to vast virgin forests and a critical spawning ground for salmon , see nothing to celebrate .
“ I would n’t say that anything is changed in environmental or social matters , ” says Dmitri Lisitsyn , head of Sakhalin Environmental Watch .
Photos taken by his nongovernmental organization reveal massive erosion around the pipeline , barren plains and landslides where woods­­ used to stand ; others show huge earthmovers dumping crushed stone into a riverbed where salmon normally breed .
When Shell was in charge , environmentalists might have used such photos to shame the company into concessions — when the greens blasted the company ’s plan to run part of the Sakhalin undersea pipeline through a critical whale habitat , Shell postponed the project .
And after the World Wildlife Fund criticized Shell ’s management of the island ’s environment , the company responded in detail .
Despite its diminished stature , Shell still plays a role in managing Sakhalin - 2 .
But since the Gazprom takeover , according to Russian news agency Interfax , the state - run firm has ignored instructions from Rosprirodnadzor , Russia ’s version of the EPA , to address “ gross violations ” of environmental protection laws .
And why not ?
During this era of petro-nationalism , Gazprom and other state - run companies finally have the world at their command .
Says Michael Shifter of the Inter - American Dialogue , “ Right now what ’s driving this is , ‘ This is our turn . ' ”
Stone Fills Out Cast for Bush Movie Oliver Stone is filling out the cast for his movie about President Bush .
April 1 , 2008  -- Oliver Stone is filling up the cast for his upcoming warts - and - all film about President Bush .
The controversial director is reportedly in final negotiations with " Mission Impossible II " star Thandie Newton to play Condoleeza Rice in his upcoming " W , " which starts filming this month .
And " Fantastic Four " star Ioan Gruffudd is the favorite to play British Prime Minister Tony Blair .
The film already stars " No Country for Old Men " star Josh Brolin as Bush , " Forty - Year - Old Virgin " star Elizabeth Banks as Laura Bush , " Babe " star James Cromwell as George Bush Sr. and Ellen Burstyn as Barbara Bush .
Though the movie is scheduled for release in 2009 , there is a chance that it might be pushed up to come out before the November election , say insiders .
According to an early script obtained by ABCNews.com , the movie is a classic American story :
In the prime of his life , a man who parties too much and lives in the shadow of his esteemed father turns his life around .
He gives up alcohol , embraces religion and finds a new purpose .
But will his desire to impress his dad and purge his personal demons put the world in danger ?
The film 's script captures purported notorious moments in Bush 's life :
Rumors that his father pulled strings to get him into Harvard Business School .
His arrest during college for tearing down the goalposts at a football game .
Almost getting into a fistfight with his father when he comes home drunk one night in the 1970s .
His vow to quit drinking when he wakes up with a wicked hangover soon after his 40th birthday .
It also covers plenty of his administration 's lowlights -- from Bush 's reported obsession with invading Iraq , which Stone will portray as a desire to avenge Saddam Hussein 's assassination attempt on Bush 's father and his frustration with the failed search for WMDs to his penchant for malapropisms and cheery optimism about the chances for civil war in Iraq .
Hard Drinking , Family Feud
The first scene , in which Bush and his advisers brainstorm different terms to describe their global enemies , from " Axis of Hatred " to " Axis of Unbearably Odious , " is followed by an early glimpse of the hard - drinking young man when he was a college student at Yale .
Drinking vodka mixed with orange juice out of a trash can at the DKE frat house , Bush impresses the fraternity leader with his ability to memorize the names of his fellow pledges .
Asked whether he 'll follow in the steps of his politician father and grandfather , Dubya quips , " Hell no , that 's the last thing in the world I 'd want to do . "
Years later , after Dubya drains a pint of Wild Turkey and runs over a pile of trash cans while driving home , his angry father tells him to call Alcoholics Anonymous , prompting Dubya to sarcastically deride his dad as " Mr. Perfect .
Mr. War Hero. Mr F-- God Almighty . "
Stone , who mined psychological motives in his previous presidential movies , from the conspiratorial " JFK " to the dark character study of " Nixon , " makes much of Bush 's competitive relationship with his father and how it fueled his desire to invade Iraq .
When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld purportedly confronts Bush in 2002 about his obsession with Saddam : " What 's the big deal about Saddam ?
Bin Laden 's the trained ape that wrought this hell on us , " Dubya 's response sounds like a line out of " The Godfather " : " You do n't go after the Bushes and get to talk about it .
Ya got me ? "
After his born - again experience , Bush says that he does n't ask his dad for advice because " there 's a higher Father I appeal to . "
When his father cries after losing to Bill Clinton in 1992 , Bush sticks it to his dad by telling him that he would have won if he'd ousted Saddam at the end of the first Gulf War .
When Bush 's parents tell him to hold off running for governor of Texas until after younger brother Jeb Bush has a chance to wins Florida 's top spot , Barbara tells him that he can't win because " you 're loud and you have a short fuse . "
Stone also portrays the president as stubborn and aggressive when it came to prosecuting the war in Iraq .
Before the invasion , he tells a shocked British Prime Minister Tony Blair about alternative plans such as baiting Saddam by painting a U.S. spy plane in U.N. colors and assassinating the Iraqi leader .
When he hears about French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac 's desire to give weapons inspectors 30 more days to work in Iraq , Bush explodes : " Thirty days !
I 'd like to stuff a plate of freedom fries down that slick piece of s-- 's throat ! "
The Lighter Side of Bush
Stone includes many lighter moments , such as Bush 's fondness for nicknames and teasing , like calling Colin Powell " Balloon Foot " and telling Paul Wolfowitz to trim his ear hairs .
In one scene , Bush practices his parachute landing in the White House pool but forgets to properly release the harness and sinks to the bottom .
In another scene , Rumsfeld doodles a drawing of Condoleeza Rice standing on a piano with a globe spinning on her finger .
During the planning of the war , Bush and his top advisers are shown locking the war - wary Powell out of a room , erupting into laughter when they finally let him in .
Other times , Bush 's light touch seems blithely out of touch with reality .
While he munches on bologna and cheese sandwiches on white bread , he brags to Cheney about how his running time has improved since the Afghanistan invasion .
And he compares the troops ' ordeal in the deserts of Iraq to his ability to run in 100 - degree heat .
At one point , Bush describes giving up sweets as " my personal sacrifice to show support for our troops . "
He interrupts a meeting with Prince Bandar , in which he informs the Saudi ambassador about plans to invade Iraq , so that he can catch the rest of the 2002 Miami Dolphins - Baltimore Ravens playoff game .
Bush is later shown choking on a pretzel and passing out during the second quarter .
But the film also strives to paint a humanistic portrait of the commander in chief , with Bush once telling the Rev. Billy Graham that " there 's this darkness that follows me . "
" People say I was born with a silver spoon , but they do n't know the burden that carries . "
Soon after a disastrous news conference in April 2004 , Bush retreats to the White House den to watch a Texas Rangers game in the final scene of the script .
Popping open a nonalcoholic beer , he lapses into his favorite dream : playing center field for the Rangers .
Hearing the crack of the bat , he looks up for the ball but he can't find it in the sky .
Is it Accurate ?
Stone , who was accused of reanimating long - discredited conspiracy theories in " JFK " and bending the facts in his other films , might come under fire for his portrayal of Bush as an impetuous leader .
Already , one former Bush administration official objects to the accuracy of the film .
One explosive scene in the movie features press secretary Ari Fleischer complaining to Bush about longtime reporter Helen Thomas who questioned the run-up to the war in Iraq .
Bush explodes in a profanity - laced outburst , " Did you tell her I do n't like motherf -- who gas their own people !
Did you tell her I do n't like a -- holes who try to kill my father !
Did you tell her I 'm going to kick his … a -- all over the Middle East ? "
" It 's fantasy , " said Fleischer .
" He used to talk like that before he was president ?
But he never talked like that around me .
He mentioned his father once , in a public setting , at a fundraiser in Houston in 2002 . "
Fleischer does n't blame Stone , explaining that the screenwriter did his research and that there are erroneous accounts of the administration in books and magazines .
" Hollywood is Hollywood . "
The White House declined comment on the movie and its portrayal of the president .
How Will It Do ?
One film columnist , who has read the script , thinks that it 's a well - written story that could do well .
" The lifeblood of this film is not content , there 's nothing revelatory or stunning in it , but acting opportunities especially for Josh Brolin as Bush , " said Jeffrey Wells , who runs the movie blog Hollywood - elsewhere.com .
" It 's about a guy who 's got a life - long identity crisis but he finds himself when he goes to war .
He uses the Iraq War to assert himself and make him feel like he's his own man . "
If the movie , which also stars " 40 - Year - Old Virgin " star Elizabeth Banks as Laura Bush , comes out before the election , it could have an effect because John McCain 's support for the Iraq War remains a central part of his message .
" It 's happened before where movies such as ' All the President 's Men ' have had an impact on an election , " said Robert Brent Toplin , a professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington and the author of " Michael Moore 's Fahrenheit 9/11 : How One Film Divided a Nation . "
" That movie hurt Gerald Ford by revealing the investigation and focusing on the corruption of the Nixon administration .
He lost by a few points in 1976 and the movie came out early that spring . "
Moore 's " Fahrenheit 9/11 " came out before the 2004 election but it did n't prove to have much of an effect .
" The right - wingers did a good job of discrediting the message and the messenger , " said Toplin .
Many political movies , such as " Primary Colors " and " Wag the Dog , " did n't have much of an effect and did n't do that well at the box office .
" But if Stone can make this entertaining , the timing could be superb . "
Crumbly Mexican cheese and holistic medicine may not seem like fodder for research , but both have managed to find a home in the wide world of chemistry .
During the past week , thousands of scholars converged on Morial Convention Center in New Orleans for a meeting of the American Chemical Society .
Some shared inventions which could save countless lives , while others told amusing tales about how everyday things look under the lens of scientific study .
We sat through talks about nanotechnology and zig - zagged through enormous poster sessions to compile this collection of the most fascinating presentations :
Someday , your fancy soft - shell jacket could be made by the deep blue liquid in this flask .
For over sixty years , the chemical parent of nylon has been made by a two - step process that generates tons of waste .
To remedy that problem , Shannon Davis and her students at Georgia Southern University have been testing a smorgasbord of methods to produce adipic acid in an earth - friendly manner .
By using catalysts , enzymes , or copper on spongy ceramics called zeolites , she hopes to replace the industrial reaction with something cleaner and more efficient .
That ’s called green chemistry , and luckily it ’s a huge trend .
In this case , Davis and her student Christopher Riley made a brew of cyclohexane , hydrogen peroxide , and a copper catalyst to produce the chemical precursor to nylon .

Plants produce a tremendously wide variety of useful chemicals , but scientists are not even close to sorting through all of them to find new medications .
At the University of Portland , Angela Hoffman and her students are making a noble effort to comb through the wide world of natural products in search of drugs for malaria .
The disease , which is caused by parasites including Plasmodium falciparum , is terribly common in the developing world .
For those bugs , bitter melon is a deadly pill to swallow .
Hoffman and her students , Thuy - Tien Pham and Thanh Tam Hoang , learned that chemicals from bitter melon can kill the deadly parasite , even if it is resistant to chlorquine – one of the standard treatments .
They are using high performance liquid chromatography to separate chemicals from the plant and test them individually .
Hopefully , they will their search will reveal a new weapon in the war against tropical diseases .

Inventors like Dean Kamen have developed ways to save the billions of people who lack clean drinking water , but their approaches are quite costly .
Xuan Li , a graduate student at the University of Illinois , has come up with a cheap alternative .
Glass fibers act as a sturdy support for iron oxide nanoparticles .
Together , they act as a filter which can remove viruses and arsenic – two of the most dangerous contaminants – from water .
Under the guidance of Professor James Economy , Li learned that viruses get stuck to the iron oxide nanoparticles by electrostatic forces .
In other words , the nanoparticles are positive and some viral particles carry an opposite charge , which makes them cling to each other .

Foodies love the texture of queso fresco , a crumbly Mexican cheese made from unpasteurized milk , but health officials are terrified that it may make people sick .
To develop a safe replacement , Michael Tunick and his colleagues at the U.S. Department of Agriculture have put the dairy product through the scientific wringer .
Their goal is to learn why it tastes and feels so much better when made with untreated milk .
Working with scientists at the Center for Food and Development research in Mexico , Tunick used sophisticated lab equipment to learn that pasteurized cheeses must be more moist and rubbery in order to compete with the original recipe .
Unfortunately , making a suitable replacement will be tricky because milk proteins are damaged by the quick heating process .

Mallory Strickland , a student at Westminster College , firmly believes that alternative medicine should be put to the test – for better or for worse .
The first holistic treatment to face her scrutiny , called therapeutic touch , is practiced by people who believe they can aid the natural healing process by placing their hands by a patient and manipulating energy fields which surround them .
To evaluate the practice , she asked Glenn Wood , an expert in that field , if he could repair a damaged enzyme without touching it .
As it sat in a dialysis bag , he attempted to fix the untangled protein .
But despite ten attempts , he was unsuccessful .
Strickland seems to feel that more alternative medicine should be integrated into modern healthcare , but she conducted her study with stringent controls and few expectations – even if the results were a bit disappointing .

In recent months , a lot of people have been handed financial get - out - of - jail - free cards .
C.E.O.s who presided over billions in losses have walked away with tens of millions in compensation .
The Federal Reserve has showered cheap money on banks and brokerages .
Even Bear Stearns caught a break when , last week , J. P. Morgan agreed to quintuple the price it will pay to take over the firm .
But there ’s one group for whom forgiveness has not been forthcoming : ordinary consumers struggling with piles of credit - card debt .
For them , escaping the burden of their bad decisions and their bad luck has become much harder .
That ’s because of a law that Congress passed in 2005 which has made it more difficult for people to write off their debts .
Filing for bankruptcy has become much more expensive .
More important , while lower - income people can still declare Chapter 7 , which takes away your assets but then discharges your debts , most middle - and higher - income people now have to declare Chapter 13 .
That means they have to pay their creditors monthly for five years before they ’re free .
Historically , the U.S. has treated debtors leniently .
But the credit - card industry , which was the driving force behind the new law , insisted that tolerance had caused a bankruptcy “ crisis ” : the number of bankruptcies in the U.S. quintupled between 1980 and 2003 .
Irresponsible debtors , the argument went , were buying plasma TVs and fancy vacations and then declaring bankruptcy to escape their debts .
And they were being supported by the rest of us , who had to pay higher interest rates and fees on our credit cards to cover credit - card companies ’ billions in annual write - offs .
Cracking down on those who “ abused the bankruptcy laws , ” President Bush said , would therefore “ make credit more affordable . ”
And we ’d all be better off .
So are we ?
That depends on your perspective .
The law did slash the number of bankruptcies — they fell by sixty - two per cent between 2004 and 2006 .
And the credit - card companies should be happy — their profits rose thirty per cent between 2005 and 2007 .
But the law has n’t done much for anyone else .
Interest rates and credit - card fees have not fallen as promised .
And for debtors life has become significantly harder : many ca n’t afford bankruptcy — strangely enough , it ’s possible to be too poor to pay the filing fees — and many others can’t qualify .
These people will either spend the next five years having their paychecks garnished or simply muddle along , avoiding debt collectors and accumulating huge interest and late fees on their credit cards .
One might say : so what ?
Even if bankruptcy is sometimes precipitated by bad luck or by an economic downturn , it ’s always the result of people living beyond their means , and why should they get away scot - free while the rest of us pay our bills ?
It ’s a fair question .
But there ’s a reason we did away with debtors ’ prisons : having millions of people enslaved to their debts is a bad thing for an economy .
Putting people into Chapter 13 essentially means they pay a heavy extra tax that goes straight to the credit - card companies .
That creates a disincentive for debtors to work , since the more they earn the more they pay .
It also takes away spending power — not the best thing during a recession .
Making it harder for people to discharge their credit - card debts has other drawbacks as well .
Homeowners would once do almost anything to keep up payments on their homes , even if it meant falling behind on other debts .
In the past year , though , economists have reported an increase in the number of people who are just walking away from their homes , because it ’s now often easier to abandon a mortgage than a credit - card bill .
( The practice has even been given a name — “ jingle mail , ” because people simply send their keys back in an envelope . )
So the new law may very well have exacerbated the housing crisis .
There are long - term disadvantages to tougher bankruptcy laws , too .
In the past , America ’s lenient attitude to bankruptcy encouraged entrepreneurship , by making it easy for people to start over if they failed .
( According to one recent study , in fact , more than fifteen per cent of personal bankruptcies are the result of failed business ventures . )
A paper by John Armour and Douglas Cumming has found a close correlation between the nature of a country ’s bankruptcy laws and its rate of self - employment : the more liberal the laws , the more likely people are to start businesses and work for themselves .
That ’s why the U.K. and the E.U. have actually been liberalizing their bankruptcy laws .
In toughening our law , we ’re discouraging people from taking risks , like investing in their own business , or learning a new trade .
That will probably mean that we end up fewer business failures , but there ’ll also be fewer successes .
It ’s true , of course , that although we want people to get a second chance , we also want them to pay their debts , and a tougher law might have made sense if the U.S. really had been dealing with a crisis .
But it was n’t .
While the number of bankruptcies soared , the economy as a whole showed no sign of strain ; it grew briskly , creating millions of new businesses and new jobs .
The credit - card companies themselves were doing fine , too : between 1995 and 2004 , as bankruptcies nearly doubled , their profits nearly tripled .
In responding to an imaginary threat , we ended up making the economy less dynamic and less flexible .
Now that hard times are here , we may find ourselves with a genuine bankruptcy crisis .
But it will be one that Congress created . ♦
I do well by the railways of this country .
I travel off peak , have a senior railcard and have the kind of life that allows me to book in advance .
I have sometimes had such cheap ticket deals that I fully expected to be arrested by the ticket inspector for trying to cheat the system .
No serious complaints there , then .
But minor criticism , yes .
The range of ticketing deals on offer is now so wide that even I , happy traveller that I am , always suspect I might not be getting the best .
There 's often a disparity between what is quoted online and what is charged at the station ticket booth .
On occasion I meet up with other travellers and find that they have paid less and feel smug , while I , having paid more , feel furious .
Ruth Kelly promised to get it sorted , and next month the new system begins , a straightforward choice of three : advance , off - peak and any time .
There will still be all the variants that go with special discounts , of course , but at last you can begin to comprehend the logic .

It is n't always so .
As technology gets more complicated , there are more chances of being bamboozled by plausible salesmen .
The whole world of mobile phone contracts is a case in point , and I am its victim .
I lost my mobile phone , for which I seemed to be paying well over the sweet - talking deal I had signed up for .
So I was n't sad to see it go , to ditch the whole enterprise and start again .
In I went to one of those shops displaying racks of phones , and in no time at all I was having my path smoothed by a kindly young man who explained that " this is exactly what you need " .
" But I thought of pay - as - you - go , " I offered weakly , as I rarely use the phone and do n't want people calling me all day long .
Surely that would be cheaper .
" Oh , no this is much cheaper ! "
I insisted that he spell out the cost as it would appear on my monthly bill .
I was satisfied .
All it needed , he added blithely , was for me to have the number transferred from my old service provider .
I 'd been with them some while , so there could n't , could there , be much to pay ?
How wrong I was : I am now stuck with a bill just short of £ 300 , before I can transfer my number .
It seems I signed up for an 18 not 12 - month deal and did n't read the small print .
Reading small print gets harder as you get older : not just the eyes , but the wits can't always grasp it .
Technology victimises the old .
And technology is going to get more complicated with the range of options multiplying and an infinite number of services being offered by everyone from supermarkets to libraries , from internet websites through a maze of BlackBerries and yet to be invented gadgetry .
There is a story going round in the West Country of an old man who was persuaded by developers to sell his property under equity release .
He got a derisory lump sum down plus an attractive monthly payment for as long as he lived .
He was familiar with his usual transactions going through a long - standing account but under this equity release deal that would n't do : it had to be online banking .
The old man was confused and perhaps not clear about what was involved .
It was rumoured he was suffering from cancer .
He certainly did n't take the advice he needed .
In the event he died within a matter of months , his estate decimated and the developers rubbing their hands .
How often must that happen across the country !
In times past it was simply not done to reveal your financial situation and worries to the outside world .
Think of Jane Austen 's families , dreading poverty but keeping up appearances .
The tradition survives in the reluctance of older people to divulge what they feel are intimate matters of income and expenditure .
Struggling to cope on their own , they fall easy prey to unscrupulous rogues .
But technology only makes matters worse : and they do need to be helped .
Help the Aged have the right idea .
They are calling for a " financial abuse taskforce " as a way of providing professional help to stop old people being cheated .
They reckon financial abuse – and they 've checked out numerous reports – is second only to physical abuse in the dangers facing the old .
The other option as you get older is to ignore the latest fad and opt for the moment in the technological evolution where you felt most comfortable .
Plenty of writers still write longhand .
I know a number of my generation who no longer drive , who do n't have a mobile , who never learnt to handle emails and who appear to live lives of serene contentment .
I 'm sometimes inclined to envy them .

Wine Therapy is a web bulletin board for serious wine geeks .
It 's been active since 2000 , and its database of back posts and comments is a wealth of information : tasting notes , restaurant recommendations , stories and so on .
Late last year someone hacked the board software , got administrative privileges and deleted the database .
There was no backup .
Of course the board 's owner should have been making backups all along , but he has been very sick for the past year and was n't able to .
And the Internet Archive has been only somewhat helpful .
More and more , information we rely on – either created by us or by others – is out of our control .
It 's out there on the internet , on someone else 's website and being cared for by someone else .
We use those websites , sometimes daily , and do n't even think about their reliability .
Bits and pieces of the web disappear all the time .
It 's called " link rot , " and we 're all used to it .
A friend saved 65 links in 1999 when he planned a trip to Tuscany ; only half of them still work today .
In my own blog , essays and news articles and websites that I link to regularly disappear – sometimes within a few days of my linking to them .
It may be because of a site 's policies – some newspapers only have a couple of weeks on their website – or it may be more random : Position papers disappear off a politician 's website after he changes his mind on an issue , corporate literature disappears from the company 's website after an embarrassment , etc .
The ultimate link rot is " site death , " where entire websites disappear : Olympic and World Cup events after the games are over , political candidates ' websites after the elections are over , corporate websites after the funding runs out and so on .
Mostly , we ignore the problem .
Sometimes I save a copy of a good recipe I find , or an article relevant to my research , but mostly I trust that whatever I want will be there next time .
Were I planning a trip to Tuscany , I would rather search for relevant articles today than rely on a nine - year - old list anyway .
Most of the time , link rot and site death are n't really a problem .
This is changing in a Web 2.0 world , with websites that are less about information and more about community .
We help build these sites , with our posts or our comments .
We visit them regularly and get to know others who also visit regularly .
They become part of our socialization on the internet and the loss of them affects us differently , as Greatest Journal users discovered in January when their site died .
Few , if any , of the people who made Wine Therapy their home kept backup copies of their own posts and comments .
I 'm sure they did n't even think of it .
I do n't think of it , when I post to the various boards and blogs and forums I frequent .
Of course I know better , but I think of these forums as extensions of my own computer – until they disappear .
As we rely on others to maintain our writings and our relationships , we lose control over their availability .
Of course , we also lose control over their security , as MySpace users learned last month when a 17 - GB file of half a million supposedly private photos was uploaded to a BitTorrent site .
In the early days of the web , I remember feeling giddy over the wealth of information out there and how easy it was to get to .
" The internet is my hard drive , " I told newbies .
It 's even more true today ; I do n't think I could write without so much information so easily accessible .
But it 's a pretty damned unreliable hard drive .
The internet is my hard drive , but only if my needs are immediate and my requirements can be satisfied inexactly .
It was easy for me to search for information about the MySpace photo hack .
And it will be easy to look up , and respond to , comments to this essay , both on Wired.com and on my own blog .
Wired.com is a commercial venture , so there is advertising value in keeping everything accessible .
My site is not at all commercial , but there is personal value in keeping everything accessible .
By that analysis , all sites should be up on the internet forever , although that 's certainly not true .
What is true is that there 's no way to predict what will disappear when .
Unfortunately , there 's not much we can do about it .
The security measures largely are n't in our hands .
We can save copies of important web pages locally , and copies of anything important we post .
The Internet Archive is remarkably valuable in saving bits and pieces of the internet .
And recently , we 've started seeing tools for archiving information and pages from social networking sites .
But what 's really important is the whole community , and we do n't know which bits we want until they 're no longer there .
And about Wine Therapy , I think it started in 2000 .
It might have been 2001 .
I can't check , because someone erased the archives .

Italy 's new parliament met for the first time yesterday with applause for Rome 's mayor - elect , Gianni Alemanno , a day after followers celebrated his triumph with straight - arm salutes and fascist - era chants .
Alemanno , a former neo - fascist youth leader , took 54 % of the vote in a run-off on Sunday and Monday , crushing his rival , Francesco Rutelli , a deputy prime minister in the last , centre - left government .
Silvio Berlusconi , who won a general election earlier this month , welcomed the latest evidence of Italy 's leap to the right by declaring : " We are the new Falange . "
Although he took care to wrap his remark in a classical context , his choice of words appeared to be a nod and a wink to his most extreme supporters .
The original Falange - the word means " phalanx " - was the Spanish fascist party , founded in the 1930s , which supplied Francisco Franco 's dictatorship with its ideological underpinning .
The prime minister - elect 's closest ally , Umberto Bossi , the Northern League leader , kept up the intimidating rhetoric , arriving for the first session of Italy 's parliament warning of violence if the centre - left did not go along with his plans for federalism .
" I do n't know what the left wants [ but ] we are ready , " he told reporters .
" If they want conflicts , I have 300,000 men always on hand . "
On Monday night , the area around Rome 's city hall rang to chants of " Duce ! Duce ! " , the term adopted by Italy 's dictator , Benito Mussolini , equivalent to the German " Führer " .
Supporters of the new mayor gave the fascist Roman straight - arm salutes .
Alemanno , however , has promised to be the mayor of all Romans .
He yesterday sent telegrams to both the Pope and the Chief Rabbi .
Rome 's Jewish community was shaken by the prospect of a mayor with Alemanno 's record .
During the campaign , there was a protest aimed at him in the city 's old Jewish ghetto , where many of the city 's Jews still live .

WASHINGTON  A Russian businessman regarded by the United States as one of the world ’s most notorious arms dealers was arrested in Thailand on Thursday as part of an American - led sting operation .
He was promptly charged in the United States with conspiracy for trying to smuggle missiles and rocket launchers to rebels in Colombia .
The businessman , Viktor Bout , 41 , is suspected of supplying weapons to the Taliban and Al Qaeda and of pouring huge arms shipments into Africa ’s civil wars with his own private air fleet .
He was arrested by the Thai authorities at a hotel in Bangkok in an operation in which undercover investigators posing as rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC , sought to purchase millions of dollars in arms .
Federal prosecutors in New York said they would seek the extradition of Mr. Bout ( pronounced boot ) and an associate , Andrew Smulian , who was also detained in Bangkok on Thursday , to stand trial in the United States on a charge of conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization .
Although American officials said Thailand appeared to be eager to be rid of Mr. Bout , it was not known when he would be brought to the United States .
Michael J. Garcia , the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York , said that Mr. Bout “ was apprehended in the final stages of arranging the sale of millions of dollars of high - powered weapons to people he believed to represent a known terrorist organization , the FARC . ”
CNN : ' Pressured ' resignation in another GOP gay scandal David Edwards

Print This Email This Washington State lawmaker Richard Curtis resigned his office tonight after a man he allegedly paid for sex spoke to the media about the encounter .
Curtis is the third conservative lawmaker in just as many months to resign amid allegations of soliciting gay sex .
CNN noted similarities between the seemingly ' pressured ' resignations in this and other Republican scandals involving homosexuality .
" I sincerely apologize for any pain my actions may have caused , " Curtis wrote in a statement .
" This has been damaging to my family , and I do n't want to subject them to any additional pain that might result from carrying out this matter under the scrutiny that comes with holding public office . "
The Associated Press reports , " Three days earlier , Curtis had insisted to his local newspaper that he was not gay and that sex was not involved in what he said was an extortion attempt by a man last week .
But in police reports , Curtis said he was being extorted by a man he had sex with in a Spokane hotel room .
The other man contends Curtis reneged on a promise to pay $ 1,000 for sex . "

Anti-Scientology agitators have repeatedly harassed and threatened violence against a 59 - year - old PG&E worker and his wife , who were mistakenly flagged as pro-Scientology hackers .
John Lawson , who lives in Stockton , California with his wife Julia , began receiving threatening phone calls around 2 a.m. Saturday morning .
He did n't know why until THREAT LEVEL explained that a hacking group calling itself the g00ns ( goons spelled with zeros , not goons with the letter o ) posted his home address , phone number and cell numbers , as well as Julia 's Social Security number , online .
The obscene and threatening calls have continued through Tuesday , according to Lawson .
SEE UPDATE AT BOTTOM FOR G00N's RESPONSE
The calls are just one small offshoot of an ongoing , larger attack on the Church of Scientology by a ragtag group of internet troublemakers who call themselves Anonymous .
The group says it is targeting Scientology in part for its use of litigation to suppress unflattering documents on the internet .
Over the weekend , the g00ns thought they had caught a hacker who had busted into a server being used to help coordinate the online attacks and real world protests against Scientology .
But Lawson says the callers have the wrong guy .
" I do n't even really know how to use a computer , " Lawson said .
His phone just keeps ringing , Lawson said , and when he answers , callers spout vulgarities and threats and then hang up .
On Monday , he got a call that seemed to originate from the Virgin Islands .
The caller threatened to kill him .
" They have got the wife really scared because they have my address , " Lawson said .
" I think I am going to buy me a gun today just in case . "
The Stockton police came out on Sunday to take a report , and Lawson has put fraud protection alerts on his and his wife 's credit reports .
Lawson wants his personal information off the internet but does n't know who to talk to to get it down .
The address of the site with their personal information was shared in online chat rooms where members of a group called Anonymous congregate to plan attacks on the Church of Scientology .
The site 's URL was also submitted to Digg , where it made it to the front page .
Planning for those attacks was disrupted in the last four days by a counter - hack group calling itself the Regime .
That group hacked and severely disrupted 711 chan.org , one of the central planning facilities for the Anonymous attack .
According to an e-mail from the hacker to THREAT LEVEL , the Regime 's " main objective was to obtain logs and various data including user names and passwords " and " to take down our targets in the best way possible to bring as much embarrassment / shame as we could to the offending organization . "
The hacker said his group turned over the purloined data to the Church of Scientology .
Soon after , the g00ns claimed to have found out where the Regime was hacking from , and managed to obtain personal information about the
Lawsons .
John Lawson believes that information came from Comcast , his ISP .
A Digg commenter suggested that the g00ns tracked down an IP address used in the attack on 711 chan and traced it to Lawson .
If that 's the case , the group overlooked the possibility that Lawson 's computer or router had been compromised and was used by the real attacker as a proxy that would hide the attacker 's real location .
For his part , Lawson does n't care about the how or why , he just wants the calls to stop .
" I called three news places in Stockton just to get something out there to let them know they have the wrong guy , " Lawson said .
This is n't the first time that the anti-Scientologists have hit the wrong target .
Last week , participants downloaded hacking software that accidentally targeted a school in the Netherlands , rather than a Scientology site .
That misfire lasted only a few minutes , but its lesson seems not to have been learned by online vigilantes who think their righteous ends justify illegal means .
UPDATE : 10:50 PST
Members of g00n tell THREAT LEVEL that they immediately took down the Lawsons ' contact info after seeing this story , but emphasize that they had nothing to do with the harassing phone calls and that they have not been involved at all in the Anonymous attacks on Scientology .
They say their motivation for posting the info was to send a warning to the Regime hacker in order to help their friend at 711 chan.org , whose website was repeatedly hacked by the Regime .
They also said that the IP address associated with the Lawsons ' had been used in attacks on 711 chan for four days , and then later was used to access and probe the site where the Lawsons ' info was posted .
They say they called the Lawsons before posting the info to verify it , and swear that the person they spoke with sounded much younger than a 59 year - old man .
They further contend that 711 chan 's server logs showed that the IP address was associated with a computer running the Debian flavor of Linux , which casts doubt on the theory that the attacker remotely taken over the Lawson 's computer .
If that were the case , the OS would have been a flavor of Windows .
Another possibility is that the Lawsons have a compromised wireless router .
The g00ns say its clear something is n't right in Stockton and vow to figure out who the Regime is , but blame him for leaving a trail that led to the Lawsons , rather than using some sort of proxy or anonymizing tool such as TOR .
They forwarded THREAT LEVEL a transcript of a chat between 711 chan 's operator and the Regime hacker , which showed the Regime hacker trying to blackmail the 711 chan operator into turning over information about the g00ns , by implying that not doing so would make him turn over more information to the Church of Scientology .
THREAT LEVEL has no way of verifying that transcript .

Nine months from now , the 44th president will be inaugurated .
Looking at the debates , votes cast and money raised in this year 's presidential primary races , the next president may not only be a Democrat , but Barack Obama , the most liberal of the 100 members of the U.S. Senate .
Add the announced retirement of six Republican senators and 29 Republican House members ( compared with just seven House Democrats ) and the Democrats are likely to control both the House and the Senate with much bigger majorities than they do today .
So both the next president and the new congressional majorities will be much more liberal than the officeholders they have replaced , and that will result in a broad - reaching , socialist - leaning , greatly expanded American government .
* * *
Four significant public policy changes are certain : the size , scope and spending of the federal government will substantially expand ; income taxes will go up ; protectionism will replace free trade ; and a commitment to global internationalism will saddle America with a broad Kyoto global warming agreement that , according to the U.N. Climate Treaty Secretariat , should exempt China and India .
WAYCROSS , Ga. ( AP ) 
A group of children ages 8 to 10 apparently were mad at their teacher because she had scolded one of them for standing on a chair , authorities say .
That led the third - graders , as many as nine boys and girls , to plot an attack on the teacher at Center Elementary School in south Georgia .
Police Chief Tony
Tanner said the students apparently planned to knock the teacher unconscious with a glass paperweight , bind her with handcuffs and duct tape and then stab her with a broken steak knife .
The scheme involved a division of roles , Tanner said .
One child 's job was to cover windows so no one could see outside , and another was supposed to clean up after the attack .
" We 're not sure at this point in the investigation how many of the students actually knew the intent was to hurt the teacher , " Tanner said .
School officials had alerted police Friday after a pupil tipped off a teacher that a girl had taken a weapon to school .
Tanner said the teacher told detectives the children were n't known as troublemakers .
" You ca n't dismiss it , " Tanner said .
" But because they are kids , they may have thought this was like a cartoon — we do whatever and then she stands up and she 's OK .
That 's a hard call . "
The purported target teaches third - grade students with learning disabilities , including attention deficit disorder , delayed development and hyperactivity , friends and parents said .
Two of the students were arrested on juvenile charges Tuesday and a third arrest was expected .
District Attorney Rick Currie said other students told investigators they did n't take the plot seriously or insisted they had decided not to participate .
" Some of the kids said , ' We thought they were just kidding , ' " Currie said .
" Another child was supposed to bring a toy pistol , and he told a detective he did n't bring it because he thought he would get in trouble . "
Currie said the children are too young to be charged as adults , and probably too young to be sentenced to a youth detention center .
" We did not hear anybody say they intended to kill her , but could they have accidentally killed her ?
Absolutely , " Tanner said .
" We feel like if they were n't interrupted , there would have been an attempt .
Would they have been successful ?
We do n't know . "
Currie said he decided to seek juvenile charges against two girls , ages 9 and 10 , who brought the knife and paperweight and an 8 - year - old boy who brought tape .
He said they face charges of conspiracy to commit aggravated assault , and both girls are being charged with taking weapons to school .
Nine children have been given discipline up to and including long - term suspension , said Theresa Martin , spokeswoman for the Ware County school system .
She would not be more specific but said none of the children had been back to school since the case came to light .
School system policy says any student who brings " anything reasonably considered to be a weapon " is to be expelled for at least the remainder of the school year .

Did you hear what happened with the candidates ?
Was it spontaneous or part of a carefully orchestrated plan ?
How is it going to affect the race ?
Is the timing significant ?
Will the momentum shift ?
As I listen to myriad panels of television and radio pundits commenting on the twists and turns of the presidential campaign , racing to split every speech and position paper into smaller and smaller bits for intense scrutiny , I begin to wonder if they 're talking about politics or participating in a high - velocity debate on subatomic physics .
This trend can be summed up in eight words : " Tell me what 's new and make it quick . "
It 's been gathering momentum for decades .
The modern world is relentlessly busy .
Speed is synonymous with efficiency , and being efficient means not getting bogged down by long periods of study or introspection .
Busy people only have time for headlines , highlights , and talking points .
But by focusing so much collective attention on " right now " and " the latest details , " we become distracted and eventually disconnected from the past .
Here 's an important update : History is more than just old news .
Surfing across the media tidal wave of analysis , spin , and speculation creates the illusion of becoming informed .
What I see is a system of mass communication sinking into a quagmire of assertions and opinions that are often out of context , inaccurate , or just plain wrong .
One example that still resonates with me happened after the 2007 State of the Union address .
A TV correspondent interviewed a US senator about the occupation of Iraq , and the senator made a comparison to postwar Germany that included this statement : " We had a soldier on every corner . "
That 's untrue , literally and figuratively , and it went unchallenged .
I was annoyed , but not surprised .
The period from 1945 - 50 was a cavalcade of social and political change all over the world .
After the war ended , US forces occupying Germany and Japan were left alarmingly thin by the rapid pace of demobilization .
Americans wanted their loved ones back home right away .
No political leaders in 1946 could get away with saying , " Hold on , we should keep a few million troops overseas to handle potential new threats . "
The public would have been outraged .
How do I know this ?
My sources are " The Best Years , " by Joseph C. Goulden and " Truman , " by David McCullough , two books that should be required reading for all candidates and commentators .
Both are hefty volumes .
CliffsNotes are n't available .
Sometimes the path to knowledge and insight has no shortcuts .
You have to make the time to walk the distance and take the weight .
Here 's my challenge for anyone who wants to debate where America should be heading in the future :
First , do you have a clear understanding of where we 've been during the past six decades ?
And , equally important , can you point out anything this country should have done differently along the way that would have brought us to a better spot than where we are right now ?
Campaign issues such as our political and economic relations with China , Europe , and the Middle East did n't spontaneously emerge from a void .
They 've been getting revised and realigned for more than 60 years .
The story is complicated and can't be told with a few sound bites .
We do ourselves a disservice when we debate these enormous issues without serious context .

Rated PG - 13 .
Out on DVD .
Directed by Seth Gordon .
With Steve Wiebe & Billy Mitchell .
.
One of the great qualities of a good documentary is that it can take a seemingly esoteric subject and give it universal appeal .
The King of Kong : A Fistful of Quarters is ostensibly about to men trying to get the high score in Donkey Kong , a 1980s arcade game that most people are aware of but stopped playing over two decades ago .
It ’s really about so much more –what drives people to obsession , the cult of celebrity , the importance of family , justice and fairness , and ultimately how a man chooses to define himself .
The film introduces us to a sub-culture of people who are still obsessed with classic arcade games — from well - known games like Pac - Man to obscure games that only a select few even remember .
Of all those games , however , Donkey Kong is considered to be the most difficult , and thus its high score is looked upon as the holy grail of this world .
In 1982 , Billy Mitchell , a legendary figure and regarded as the best classic arcade gamer of all - time , set a record that lay unmatched for two decades .
The narrative revolves around Steve Wiebe , a recently laid - off father of two from suburban Seattle who makes it his quest to break Mitchell ’s record and have it recognized but runs into a lot of roadblocks along the way .
First , the governing body “ Twin Galaxies ” run by Walter Day makes it difficult for Wiebe , and eventually he has to travel to the Mecca of classic arcade games , a place called Funspot in a small town in New Hampshire to prove his worth .
While Wiebe performs brilliantly , it is clear that two separate sets of rules exist for Mitchell and everyone else .
Wiebe is a soft - spoken guy , nice to a fault .
You can see how much this record means to him and his self - worth and it ’s sort of tragic to see the lengths he goes to prove himself to the world .
He ’s a guy who , according to his way - too - supportive wife , is good at a lot of things , but was never great at any of them .
He ’s the protagonist of the film , and it ’s clear that Gordon , the filmmaker , sympathizes with him — but there are moments where you can see the toll it is taking on his family ’s life .
There is a particularly heartbreaking exchange where his young daughter tells him about the Guinness Book of World Records , “ Some people sort of ruin their lives to be in there . ”
If Wiebe is the hero of the story , then the arrogant , brash Mitchell would be the villain — a crafty , charismatic figure who manages to stay one step ahead of the more naive Wiebe .
Mitchell is portrayed as someone who on one hand is willing to do whatever it takes to keep the record , but on the other makes it seem like he is now too good for the challenge .
As the poster - boy for Twin Galaxies and the hero to most of the people in the film , Mitchell is the Goliath to Wiebe ’s David .
There are other memorable characters , like Brian Kuh ( “ There ’s a Donkey Kong kill screen coming up ! ” ) and my favorite , Mr. Awesome , who advises Steve to not chumpatize himself .
But the story belongs to the conflict between Wiebe and Mitchell and ultimately it is what elevates it above a curiousity to a really great film .
The biggest flaw is in the editing — while it bothered me more after when reading about the film than while watching it , it was clear that Gordon was favoring Steve and was very selective with certain facts .
It plays more as a stylized documentary than the real thing , where Gordon plays with the timeline and facts to fit his ideal narrative .
Day has specifically pointed out numerous inaccuracies and is unhappy with how the story is portrayed .
Mitchell , who is obviously a larger - than - life character is clearly cast as the villain in the film but seems way less so in real life , and the relationship between the two men is not as frosty as the film would have us believe .
Apparently Gordon is in talks to make a fictionalized Hollywood remake , but the original in pretty much in that vein anyway .
While it may not be as accurate as a documentary should be , The King of Kong is still compulsively watchable and way more entertaining than a movie about Donkey Kong has any right to be .
The story is still ongoing and there are updates on the DVD , but there ’s a high likelihood that a few years down the road there will be a follow - up film as the record continues to get passed back - and - forth .
Viewed as purely a documentary , the lack of accuracy hurts it , but viewed as a film , I highly recommend it .
Grade : A-

FOO -OF !
Everyone has their own style of naming accessors , but here 's a meme I 've occasionally tried to spread :
( defclass bar ( ) ( ( foo :accessor foo - of ) ) )
This works like a charm , and with good reason .
You are highly unlikely to ever want to name a function with arity other then 1 with the postfix - OF .
It just does n't make sense .
In this way this style is superior to plain FOO , and to a lesser extent better then GET - FOO and friends .
If you are partial to BAR - FOO , then you are beyond help .
The problems with this approach in conjuction with subclassing are amply documented , so nuff said .
If your objection is purely aesthetic then I can only assure you that the eye gets used to it .
CLASS - OF and TYPE - OF provide sufficient precendent to my satisfaction .
If you find yourself needing either of the above as accessors , this is what shadowing and generic functions are there for !
( defpackage " EXAMPLE " ( : use " COMMON - LISP " ) ( : shadow " TYPE - OF " ) ) ( in-package " EXAMPLE " ) ( defgeneric type - of ( instance ) ( : method ( instance ) ( cl:type - of instance ) ) )
Done .
