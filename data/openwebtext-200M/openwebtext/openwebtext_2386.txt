WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Pentagon denied on Tuesday an Iranian news report that a U.S. military aircraft had violated Iranian territory and had been forced to land in Iran , saying all American planes were accounted for .
“ All aircraft in the region are accounted for and we have no reports of any aircraft landing in Iran , ” Lt. Col.
Patrick Ryder told reporters .
“ I have n’t heard anything like that , ” said Pentagon Bryan Whitman .
The Iran news agency reported earlier that a U.S. warplane had violated Iranian territory and had been forced to land in Iran .
Callie Shell : Obama

Travels With Barack
Four years ago Time photographer Callie Shell met Barack Obama backstage when she was covering presidential candidate John Kerry .
She sent her editor more photographs of Obama than Kerry .
When asked why , she said , " I do not know .
I just have a feeling about him .
I think he will be important down the road . "
Her first photo essay on Obama was two and half years ago .
She has stuck with him ever since .

How did we get into the current financial mess ?
Great question .
Turmoil in the Making
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In 1910 , seven men held a secret meeting on Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia .
It ’s estimated that those seven men represented one - sixth of the world ’s wealth .
Six were Americans representing J.P. Morgan , John D. Rockefeller , and the U.S. government .
One was a European representing the Rothschilds and Warburgs .
In 1913 , the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank was created as a direct result of that secret meeting .
Interestingly , the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank is n’t federal , there are no reserves , and it ’s not a bank .
Those seven men , some American and some European , created this new entity , commonly referred to as the Fed , to take control of the banking system and the money supply of the United States .
In 1944 , a meeting in Bretton Woods , N.H. , led to the creation of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank .
While the stated purposes for the two new organizations initially sounded admirable , the IMF and the World Bank were created to do to the world what the Federal Reserve Bank does to the United States .
In 1971 , President Richard Nixon signed an executive order declaring that the United States no longer had to redeem its paper dollars for gold .
With that , the first phase of the takeover of the world banking system and money supply was complete .
In 2008 , the world is in economic turmoil .
The rich are getting richer , but most people are becoming poorer .
Much of this turmoil is directly related to those meetings that took place decades ago .
In other words , much of this turmoil is by design .

Watch as John McCain responds to Obama ’s taunt that McCain is n’t raising Bill Ayers and other over - the - top attack lines in Obama presence — or as Obama put it , “ say it to my face ” :
In case you missed it , here ’s Joe Biden riffing on this line yesterday , bringing his old - neighborhood swagger into the routine :
10.54 pm. Initiatives easing marijuana laws are outpolling Obama in Massachusetts and Michigan .
People are less afraid than politicians .
10.52 pm . You drinking yet ?
Stupid question .
I have n't touched a drop .
Honest .
But I 'm close .
It 's been a long year since that Atlantic piece .
10.51 pm .
The next time I 'm on CNN , I 'm going to insist on a hologram .
10. 50 pm. Bitter , Party Of One .
10. 45 pm . Fox calls Virginia for Obama .
It looks good in North Carolina .
Not all the South is resistant to change .
10.33 pm. Virginia is very close but the northern counties have not reported fully .
Obama is probably going to win it - but more narrowly than expected .
10.20 pm. North Carolina is a nail - biter .
So 's Indiana .
10.18 pm. Decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana is winning big in Massachusetts .
10.03 pm. Evangelicals move to Obama in the rust - belt .
But the Southern Christianists harden toward McCain .
The GOP will become more fundamentalist , more Southern , and whiter after this election .
They now have the power in a shrunken GOP .
9.54 pm . A senior McCain aide tells Ambers : " At this point , we need a miracle . "
9.51 pm .
It 's looking grim for marriage equality in Florida .
But they need 60 percent and Miami - Dade is n't in yet .
Several days ago , I posted an invitation to discuss Jesus and Gas Prices on this blog .
It ’s a topic that , to a large extent , will reveal how much we really can engage our imagination with the concept of Jesus shaped discipleship .
For example , one evangelical has taken his particular view of rising gas prices and started a movement called “ Pray at the Pump . ”
Somehow , the rise of gas prices is a sign of the end times and praying at the pump for God to lower prices will apparently prove that he ’s in charge .
Of course , one wonders if it ever occurred to anyone that the inconvenience to the American lifestyle of mobility and affluence is n’t really something that God would respond to as an act of mercy .
Most Americans are inconvenienced by gas prices because of the value they place on mobility and the decisions they ’ve made about the kind of life they want to live , decisions made with the assumption of cheap gas in the background .
So somewhere a homeless man or a family struggling to put food on the table will see a group of middle class suburban Christians gathered around a gas pump , praying that God will have mercy and get things back to where we can all go about our business .
I do n’t have to spend much time asking if Jesus would join such a prayer meeting .
This is the imagination and mindset of American Christians :
God is committed to our lives as we imagine them .
He is committed to the gas , the SUVs , the economics , the houses , the conveniences , the investments , the stability , the politics , the military and the religion that maintain the lives we lead .
And if you question this , you risk going down a hole labelled “ Fanaticism . ”
I grew up with parents and grandparents who had lived through the great depression .
( That was an economic downturn in the early 20th century , not a psychological episode . )
This event had stamped their view of life in America .
They were never quite comfortable with prosperity as we are .
They were embarrassed by having too much , and they were deeply aware of what poverty looked like .
My mother ’s family knew what it was like to be hungry .
Were it not for a wealthier relative , she was quite sure they would have starved in the 1930’s .
My father ’s family of eastern Kentucky mountaineers lived in what we would call third world conditions today , with just enough subsistence farming and hunting to survive in the backwoods of Lee County , Kentucky .
In the 1970 ’s , my father had money buried in jars in the back yard .
Because he ’d lived through bank runs and closings , he never entirely trusted banks .
Almost every one reading this post has their savings and retirement placed where you could n’t get it tomorrow if you had to .
And I really do n’t think about it , because life seems very secure .
It is that feeling of security , and where it is , that gets in the way of knowing Jesus .
It is why people are praying at gas pumps , and why millions of Christians will believe that whatever changes the American way of life is an “ end times crisis , ” while the daily poverty and desperation of others around the world is no crisis worth thinking of .
Here ’s what I want to get to : Most people who know anything about Jesus know that he lived and taught some kind of radical economics .
Christians may differ markedly on what it all means , but Jesus taught again and again that you ca n’t serve God and the god of financial security .
Your treasure must be laid up in heaven .
When you are rich in this world , you may be blind to truth and compassion .
Your presumption that God is on the side of your economics may be called “ foolishness ” tomorrow .
Most people know this , and it appears that most American middle class evangelicals and many of their churches do n’t know it .
Jesus seems to be a spiritual guru , a success in life teacher , a ticket to heaven .
He does n’t mind the economic decisions I make unless I invest in porn or abortion or Democratic candidates .
He ’s on the side of whatever it takes for our country to have it ’s “ way of life , ” including $ 2 gas in mom ’s Upward soccer delivery SUV .
So ….it occurs to me that , should there be a serious economic crisis in America - and would anyone like to bet on the likelihood of that ? – it appears that most evangelicals are absent the individual or collective resources to process it on any level other than something like “ Satan is attacking God ’s people ” or “ The rapture will happen any minute now . ”
I ’d like to suggest that evangelicals need to learn how to embrace poverty .
Not for show , but because at some point we will have to embrace poverty and , right now , we ’d be without a clue on what to do .
We need to look at our churches , technology , luxuries , lifestyles and comfort zones with a ruthless eye .
How can we untether ourselves from the God we believe has made all of this happen and told us to move into it as the American promised land ?
How can we embrace downward mobility as the way of Christ without self - righteous carping , but with genuine repentance for the foolish way we ’ve ignored the economic dimension of discipleship ?
We need some contemporary St. Francis ’s to throw away their personal affluence and show us another way .
We need Bible teaching that challenges our involvement in what is surely a doomed system .
We need leaders willing to walk away from the building and the salary , and to teach others to do the same .
We need a holy imagination of what it would mean to be “ simple church ” in terms of economics , and not just programs .
What will your church , your student ministry , your children ’s ministry , your discipleship , your worship , your youth program and your evangelism look like in an extended economic crisis ?
We need to be so formed by Jesus that the possibilities and authenticity of poverty will be beautiful to us .
We may be forced to embrace economic realities that have prayer meetings at the gas pump looking appropriate .
If that ’s not going to be the case , we need a new way of following Jesus now .
A friend in Florida just told me of his experience in voting this morning .
He was n't hampered in any way because they use paper ballots .
But what he told me is startling .
They could be trying to turn the flow of red to blue votes .
If this is widespread , it could have a significant impact across the country where paper ballots are used .
Here 's his story ...
I was standing in line and started reading a sign .
The sign said :
“ You are voting in a Primary Election , if you registered democrat you MUST vote Democrat .
If you registered Republican you MUST vote Republican .
If you are an independent you may only vote for non-partisan items such as local amendments . ”
I ’m sure that ’s not the exact wording but you get the idea .
I asked one of the election officials why that sign was posted .
She looked at it , got a worried look on her face , said “ I do n’t know ” , and removed the sign .
I then saw her take the sign to another official and I overheard the other official say “ Well , I did n’t put it there ” .
The sign was placed in a plastic container and life goes on .
Now , if Republicans that were going to vote for Obama changed their vote because of that sign ...
Kind of make one wonder does it not ?
The good Lord created only two kinds of people in the world : those who are Irish and those who wish they were .
Welcome to part two of my somewhat random Halloween Series !
I love old cemeteries ( which apparently makes me a taphophile , which I just learned today ) .
I know that 's a little weird , but as a writer , it sort of makes sense " “ tombstones get my imagination going , especially the really old ones that are falling over , sinking into the ground or have intriguing epitaphs .
Whenever we travel , I invariably end up looking to see if there 's anything interesting in the area .
Today 's Quick 10 is a list includes a couple I 've been to , but mostly just famous ( or infamous ) places that serve as the final resting place for thousands .
By the way , I 'm omitting Sleepy Hollow Cemetery because I have a whole Sleepy Hollow post planned for later in the month .
1. Mount Moriah Cemetery in Deadwood , South Dakota , is like Mecca to Wild West buffs .
Here , you 'll find Wild Bill Hickok , Calamity Jane , Seth Bullock , Potato Creek Johnny and Sol Star .
A lot of the inhabitants of Mount Moriah used to be buried at Ingelside Cemetery , but at some point in the 1880s , it was decided that they would be moved to Mount Moriah so the Ingelside area could be used for housing .
The Deadwood visitor 's site says that it's not uncommon for people gardening or doing work on their houses to find bones leftover from when their part of town used to be Ingelside Cemetery .
Other than its celebrities , the cemetery is noted because it was granted permission by Congress to fly the flag 24 hours a day .
Normally , a flag has to be taken down at dark or during inclement weather .
Only a handful of places in the U.S. are granted permission to do this , including the birthplace of Francis Scott Key ( the Star Spangled banner composer ) , the White House and the Washington Monument .
Gettysburg College does a variation of this ; more on that below .
2. Arlington National Cemetery .
I 've been there twice , but once was in fifth grade and once was on a class trip in eighth grade " ¦ way before I became interested in the historical aspects of cemeteries .
Back then I was probably way more concerned about the heat making my hair look bad in front of Clint Johnson ( who did n't know I existed anyway ) .
But I 'd be much more fascinated by the cemetery today " “ it has some very interesting stories .
First , there 's the Tomb of the Unknown Soliders , or Tomb of the Unknowns - constantly guarded tombs for unidentified soldiers from WWI , WWII , the Korean War and Vietnam .
The latter Unknown is no longer there , and no longer Unknown .
It was determined in 1998 that the soldier was Air Force 1st Lt. Michael J. Blassie , who was then laid to rest near his family in St. Louis .
Other memorials at Arlington include the JFK Eternal Flame , the memorial to the USS Maine ; the Challenger Memorial ; the 9/11 Pentagon Memorial ; the memorial to the victims of Pan Am Flight 103 and a monument to Glenn Miller ( his remains were not recoverable ) .
There 's also the graves of Joe Louis , Medgar Evers , William Jennings Bryan , Robert Todd Lincoln , Lee Marvin , William Rehnquist and William Howard Taft , among others .
Another interesting interrment is James Parks , the only man buried at Arlington who was also born at Arlington .
He was born on Arlington Estate before the land was made a military burial ground .
Parks worked there for nearly his entire life , digging graves and doing general upkeep .
He was a slave before his owner , George Washington Park Custis ( George 's adopted son and also his step - grandson ) freed him in 1862 .
I know ; I 'm getting totally carried away with this bullet point .
And that 's only the beginning of the fascinating things at Arlington .
3. PÃ¨re Lachaise in Paris .
I visited this one in 2002 and can vouch for its gorgeousness .
It was established by Napoleon in 1804 after another large cemetery was closed because of its close proximity to an outdoor food market .
It was n't popular at the time because it was considered to be too far away form the city center " ¦ so what did the cemetery officials do ?
They marketed , of course , and made sure that everyone thought PÃ¨re Lachaise was THE place to spend your afterlife .
First , the remains of La Fontaine and MoliÃ¨re were transferred there , followed about 13 years later by AbÃ©lard and HÃ©loise .
It 's tradition that people who are searching for true love leave letters at their crypt in hopes that they will find a romance as famous as this duo's .
But it might not actually be their final resting place " “ The Oratory of the Paraclete , the monastery founded by Abelard , says that he and Heloise are buried on their site and the monument at PÃ¨re Lachaise is merely a memorial .
Other famous people buried there : Balzac , Oscar Wilde Sarah Bernhardt , Chopin , Edith Piaf , Isadora Duncan , Pissarro , Marcel Marceau , Gertrude Stein , Proust and sort of Maria Callas .
After being stolen from the cemetery and recovered , her ashes were scattered at sea " “ but the empty urn is still on display .
I feel like I 'm forgetting someone " ¦ hmmm " ¦ oh yeah , Jim Morrison .
Along with Oscar Wilde , Morrison 's is the most - visited grave there .
It 's constantly defaced and vandalized by souvenir - seekers , which has caused the families of other , non-famous people buried at PÃ¨re Lachaise to become quite angry .
4. The Forest Lawn Parks in California .
Each one of these could be listed as their own bullet points , but I 'm going to lump them together for the sake of keeping the list at least a little diverse .
The Hollywood Hills version contains all kinds of statues and works of art , including a replica of the of Old North Church in Boston .
There is also a cenotaph there that will be used in a crazy - elaborate Penn and Teller card trick " “ the monument is engraved with a three of clubs and the saying , " Is this your card ? " 
But if card tricks are n't your thing , you can check out the graves of Steve Allen , Gene Autry , Bette Davis , Sandra Dee , Roy Disney , Marty Feldman ( who I include because he was Igor in Young Frankenstein , Marvin Gaye , Andy Gibb , Buster Keaton , Ernie Kovacs , Dorothy Lamour , Stan Laurel , Liberace , Ozzie and Harriet Nelson , Ricky Nelson , John Ritter and Telly Savalas .
And that 's just at Hollywood Hills .
At Glendale , you 'll find a stained glass replica of The Last Supper , full - sized reproductions of Michelangelo 's David and Moses ( using marble from the same quarry the real ones were made from , mind you ) , three chapels , a mosaic of the signing of the Declaration of Independence , a 13 - foot tall Statue of George Washington and a 195 - foot long panorama of the Crucifixion of Christ .
Supposedly the gates to the cemetery are even historic " “ they are thought to be the world 's largest wrought - iron gates .
At Glendale , you may be able to visit these people ( I say " may "  because some of them are in private areas the general public can't get to ) : Gracie Allen and George Burns , L. Frank Baum , Humphrey Bogart , Mount Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum , Clara Bow , Nat King Cole , Sam Cooke , Dorothy Dandridge , Sammy Davis , Jr. , Walt Disney , Errol Flynn , W.C. Fields , Larry Fine from The Three Stooges , Clark Gable and Carole Lombard , Jean Harlow , Edith Head , Alan Ladd , Louis L'Amour , Mary Pickford , Norma Shearer , Jimmy Stewart and Spencer Tracy .
5. Gettysburg National Cemetery , Pennsylvania .
Between the Union and Confederate armies , there were nearly 8,000 people killed at the Battle of Gettysburg " ¦ and that does n't even include the missing people .
A vast majority of the bodies were just buried in shallow graves where they fell , so a proper cemetery was purchased for the 3,512 Union dead ( 979 of which were never identified ) .
The Confederate dead were just left where they were buried until seven years after the battle .
The cemetery was dedicated on November 19 , 1863 .
Abraham Lincoln was n't the main speaker at the event , but he is certainly the one who is remembered today .
As I mentioned before , Gettysburg College is another of the few places that the U.S. flag is allowed to fly day and night " “ Pennsylvania
Hall is the site where the battlefield hospital and lookout would have been located during the battle .
To honor this fact and those who died , a Civil War - era flag flies at all times .
6. Highgate Cemetery in London
The Highgate has been there since 1839 and is known as one of the " Magnificent Seven "  cemeteries around London .
Like Pere Lachaise , it became very fashionable to be interred there - people were dying to get in ( c'mon " ¦ oldest joke in the book .
Had to do it . ) .
It 's filled with elaborate landscaping , including lots of old - growth trees and vaults dug into hillsides .
Karl Marx is buried there , along with Douglas Adams , Michael Faraday and George Eliot ( Mary Ann Evans ) .
Highgate apparently had an unwanted resident in the 1970s " “ a ghost , I 'm sure you 're thinking .
Well , yeah - people claiming to see ghosts at Highgate was not exactly uncommon .
But a vampire sighting was definitely not the norm .
A local man , David Farrant , was the first to make these claims .
He was backed up by another local , Sean Manchester , who claimed his research showed that a noble from Europe ( a local newspaper cited Wallachia , the homeland of Vlad the Impaler ) was buried there and that modern - day occultists had brought him back to life .
A Vampire Hunt was organized on Friday , the 13th of March , and a mob of people determined to stake the vamp showed up to help .
No vampire was found , but a bitter feud formed between Manchester and Farrant , which continues to this day .
They both have their own vampire websites , so if you have an interest in vampires and a high level of tolerance for B.S. , check them out .
7 . The Merry Cemetery is a cemetery that defies all expectations of a gloomy , Gothic burial ground .
This open - air museum in Romania has colorful , cheerful tombstones with epitaphs that are often funny and poetic .
The first epitaph was carved in 1935 by Stan Ioan Patras , an artist who sculpted all of the crosses out of wood and wrote all of the epitaphs / poems .
When he died in 1977 , he , of course , was buried in the Merry Cemetery .
This is n't his epitaph , but here is an example of what you would find written on the tombs there :
... Now I will tell you a good one
I kind of liked the plum Å£uica
With my friends at the pub
I used to forget what I came for
8. Westminster Abbey in London .
It 's home to tons of poets and royals .
There 's even a section dedicated just to writers and other people associated with the arts , appropriately called Poets ' Corner .
The first to be buried there was Geoffrey Chaucer , but now he is kept company by the likes of Robert Browning , Charles Dickens , Thomas Hardy , Rudyard Kipling , Laurence Olivier and Alfred Tennyson .
Royals buried there are quite numerous , so I 'll just hit a few of the highlights : Elizabeth I ; Mary I ( AKA Bloody Mary ) ; Anne of Cleves ; Mary , Queen of Scots ; Edward the Confessor and Henry VII .
There 's also Darwin and Isaac Newton .
I 've been to London a few times ; I can't believe I 've never made it a point to go here ...
9. ... but I have been to St. Peter 's Basilica in Vatican City .
There are 91 Popes buried there , Pope JPII being the most recent , of course .
The first Pope ever , St. Peter , is said to be buried here as well .
In fact , the basilica is supposed to be built on the spot where he was crucifed by Nero in 64 A.D.
This has never been proved , though " “ Pope Pius XII announced in 1950 that none of the remains buried under the Basilica could definitively be declared as St. Peter's .
In 1968 , Pope Paul VI said that the relics of St. Peter had definitely been found , though .
However , around the same time , some monks in Jerusalem discovered hundreds of coffins believed to be from the first century , including one clearly labeled , " Shimon Bar Yonah " - Simon , the Son of Jonah : the original Biblical name of the Disciple Peter . "
So who knows ??
10 . The Ben and Jerry 's Flavor Graveyard .
Why not end with a fun one ?
When Ben and Jerry 's retires a flavor , they do it in style .
Every year , eight to 12 flavors are laid to rest based on their sales numbers .
There are a ton of deceased flavors I 'd love to tell you about , but something tells me that will make a good Quick 10 later this week .
Stay tuned !
Picture from Roadside America , which has a fun story on visiting Ben and Jerry's .
So , I was speaking to an Iranian friend about what a mind - bending thing it must be for people in the Middle East to see Americans , seven years after 9/11 , electing someone named Barack Hussein Obama as president .
America is surely the only nation that could  in the same decade  go to war against a president named Hussein ( Saddam of Iraq ) , threaten to use force against a country whose most revered religious martyr is named Hussein ( Iran ) and then elect its own president who ’s middle - named Hussein .
Is this a great country or what ?
Much has been written about how people all around the world are celebrating the victory of our Hussein  Barack of Illinois , whose first name means “ blessing ” in Arabic .
It is , indeed , a blessing that so many people in so many places see something of themselves reflected in Obama , whether in the color of his skin , the religion of his father , his African heritage , his being raised by a single mother or his childhood of poverty .
And that ensures that Obama will probably have a longer than usual honeymoon with the world .
But I would n’t exaggerate it .
The minute Obama has to exercise U.S. military power somewhere in the world , you can be sure that he will get blowback .
For now , though , his biography , demeanor and willingness to at least test a regime like Iran ’s with diplomacy makes him more difficult to demonize than George W. Bush and Dick Cheney .
“ If you ’re a hard - liner in Tehran , a U.S. president who wants to talk to you presents more of a quandary than a U.S. president who wants to confront you , ” remarked Karim Sadjadpour , an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment .
“ How are you going to implore crowds to chant ‘ Death to Barack Hussein Obama ’ ?
That sounds more like the chant of the oppressor , not the victim .
Obama just does n’t fit the radical Islamist narrative of a racist , blood - thirsty America , which is bent on oppressing Muslims worldwide .
There ’s a cognitive dissonance .
It ’s like Hollywood casting Sidney Poitier to play Charles Manson .
It just does n’t fit . ”
US Banking Collapse a ' Controlled Demolition '
" We are in the middle of a crisis much larger than most Americans could imagine , a portion of America can't even handle it , for that matter .
The Bailout is an awful idea , and the majority of Americans realize that .
There is even a provision that would grant Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson dictatorial powers , and that is obviously insane , but here we are debating it .
It 's like asking a dead man whether he wants to be buried or cremated ; it 's a non issue and Congress is just playing a game to distract the American people .
We need to move ahead , and we should begin with taking our country back from the tyrants . "

Pre-election Militarization of the North American Homeland .
US Combat Troops in Iraq repatriated to " help with civil unrest "
" Civil unrest resulting from from the financial meltdown is a distinct possibility , given the broad impacts of financial collapse on lifelong savings , pension funds , homeownership , etc .
The timing of this planned militarization is crucial : how will it affect the presidential elections scheduled for Tuesday November 4 . "

E-voting Machines are a National Security Threat
" The video is posted in full below with ten short clips for You Tube viewing .
This interview is so important and explosive that we urge everyone to watch it .
Spoonamore says that the GOP wanted e-voting to steal elections but now foreign governments will be hacking and the winner will be determined by the best hackers .
He says that if the GOP wins the hacking competition , McCain will win 51.2 percent with three electoral votes over Obama , and it will be a stolen election . "

DPC Uncovers Widespread Corruption Diverting American Tax Dollars To Al Qaeda
" We received startling and sobering news at the Senate Democratic Policy Committee hearing I chaired on Monday , September 22 .
Former high - level Iraqi government officials gave first - hand accounts of massive , widespread corruption in the Iraqi government , corruption that has diverted millions of American taxpayer dollars to al Qaeda . "

Rare recordings of some of the last century 's greatest writers are to be released for the first time - from F Scott Fitzgerald reciting Othello to Tennessee Williams lambasting critics and Raymond Chandler drunkenly slurring his way through an interview with Ian Fleming .
The British Library CDs are a literary goldmine , with recordings of 30 British writers and 27 from the US , most of whom are being heard for the first time since they were in front of the microphone .
They include the only surviving recording of Virginia Woolf , the sole recording of Arthur Conan Doyle , battily explaining the importance of spiritualism and the existence of telepathy , and Gertrude Stein incomprehensibly explaining how she writes .
" We have opened up a real treasure trove , " said Richard Fairman , of the library 's sound archive .
" The reason people love hearing the CDs is because we read these authors and we feel we know them through reading their work .
But when we hear them speak it 's like meeting them in person .
It 's not quite as good as having them walk up to you , but it 's not bad . "
If you were to meet Vladimir Nabokov , it would be an alarming experience , on the basis of his broadcast .
The author of Lolita answers questions in the style of a ham actor reciting poetry .
He is asked if writing is a pleasure or drudgery : " Pleasure and agony while composing the book in my mind .
Harrowing irritation when strolling with my tools and viscera , the pencil that needs resharpening , the bladder that has to be drained , the word that I always mis-spell and always have to look up . "
Tennessee Williams , on the other hand , sounds as you might expect , with a wonderful , warm southern drawl .
In the 1959 edition of the BBC's Frankly Speaking he says people have taken advantage of him .
" I 'm an extremely malleable person .
Almost anybody can twist me round their finger .
And I 've been twisted around so many fingers that I feel like a multiple pretzel . "
He concedes critics can kill a play .
" It 's a very humiliating experience and an unfair one because , if a play on which you 've worked say two years or three years or even , in the case of Orpheus Descending , 17 years off and on , its fate can be decided in a couple of hours of reflection . "
One of the most poignant recordings is Joe Orton , a week before he was murdered by his lover Kenneth Halliwell .
He explains he has done well out of Loot but wants to save his money " because I shan't always be young and I do n't want to do anything grand with it , because there 's nothing I particularly want to do , but I would like to sort of put it away so that when I 'm not writing any more ... I shall be able to go away and do something else . "
He adds : " I only have so much inspiration .
I think any playwright does .
It 's like a boxer , a really good playwright 's career is quite short .
A boxer 's career is usually 10 years and then they start to get punchy , which I think playwrights do as well .
Shakespeare 's career was pretty short ... probably 15 years .
And he wrote some pretty rum plays at the beginning of his life .
I hope I 've never written anything as bad as the early Shakespeares . "
One of the jolliest interviewees is PG Wodehouse , in conversation with Alistair Cooke in 1963 .
They talk jocularly about a new theory that automation is going to throw so many people out of work that by the year 2000 every middle - class family will need four servants to keep people employed .
The drunkest interviewee is Raymond Chandler , who had been at the whisky before his 1958 interview with his friend Ian Fleming .
The British Library CDs are the latest in its series of historic recordings .
Fairman said there were still gaps in the sound archive , and if anybody had recordings of DH Lawrence , John Galsworthy and George Orwell they should get in touch .

In their own words
" Perhaps then one reason why we have no great poet , novelist or critic writing today is that we refuse to allow words their liberty .
We pin them down to one meaning , their useful meaning .
A meaning which makes us catch the train , the meaning which makes us pass the examination . "
Virginia Woolf , 1937
" I 've had a very disappointing life , I feel , but still it 's been well worthwhile ...
I think life 's really , and has been probably through history , quite horrible , but it 's great fun somehow . "
Rebecca West , 1958
" Obscenity is something that I abhor .
I do n't think there 's anybody more squeamish than I am about what is obscene .
I cannot stand anything scatalogical , anything physically disgusting ... my plays are extremely moral in my opinion .
I 'm almost an old puritan . "
Tennessee Williams , 1959
PG County is a garbage place to live , period .
Their Police Department ranks right up there at Number 1 with Los Angeles , in terms of corruption and brutality .
It is also now amongst the Car - jacking Capitals of America , right alongside Newark , NJ .
People are randomly gunned down ALL the time , for absolutely senseless reasons .
D.C. is the same .
I can hardly recall the number of times I have heard about gunmen just driving / walking around shooting random people for fun , even little kids , with no apparent motive or cause .
However , if anything , I would begin to question whether or not these are Terrorist Hits .
I doubt that it would be an internal issue , unless you have some dirty Spy within these particular Agencies , such as the alleged FBI Agent at the door .
There are leaks within these Agencies , and at times Spies .
Just look at the Robert Hanssen case if you need an example .
The economic news , in case you have n’t noticed , keeps getting worse .
Bad as it is , however , I do n’t expect another Great Depression .
In fact , we probably wo n’t see the unemployment rate match its post -Depression peak of 10.7 percent , reached in 1982 ( although I wish I was sure about that ) .
We are already , however , well into the realm of what I call depression economics .
By that I mean a state of affairs like that of the 1930s in which the usual tools of economic policy  above all , the Federal Reserve ’s ability to pump up the economy by cutting interest rates  have lost all traction .
When depression economics prevails , the usual rules of economic policy no longer apply : virtue becomes vice , caution is risky and prudence is folly .
To see what I ’m talking about , consider the implications of the latest piece of terrible economic news : Thursday ’s report on new claims for unemployment insurance , which have now passed the half - million mark .
Bad as this report was , viewed in isolation it might not seem catastrophic .
After all , it was in the same ballpark as numbers reached during the 2001 recession and the 1990 - 1991 recession , both of which ended up being relatively mild by historical standards ( although in each case it took a long time before the job market recovered ) .
But on both of these earlier occasions the standard policy response to a weak economy  a cut in the federal funds rate , the interest rate most directly affected by Fed policy  was still available .
Today , it is n’t : the effective federal funds rate ( as opposed to the official target , which for technical reasons has become meaningless ) has averaged less than 0.3 percent in recent days .
Basically , there ’s nothing left to cut .
Sesame Workshop
Once upon a time , before he became a brilliant movie actor with an Oscar and dozens of films under his belt , Morgan Freeman was known to a generation of children as the Easy Reader , Count Dracula , and hosts of other characters on The Electric Company .
From 1971 - 77 , The Electric Company was a sort of hip older step - cousin to Sesame Street , and it helped teach a lot of kids how to read , or how to read better .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Starting in January , an entirely new generation of kids will get their own version of the show , being developed by Sesame Workshop and to be shown on PBS Kids as part of their Raising Readers effort .
There are far too many kids with poor reading skills , so it seems to me that January is not a moment too soon .
The new version wo n’t look like the old one , but that ’s only natural — the old one was very much a 1970s show , with references to things that many adults today would have trouble remembering , let alone kids .
And of course the new one has to conquer a huge problem the old one did n’t :
It needs to be noticed in the cacophonous crowd of kids ’ programs that exists today .
In the original ’s time , the only other major kids ’ shows , really , were Sesame Street and Saturday morning cartoons ; now , there are whole cable networks devoted to them .
The new Electric Company will feature a group of four culturally - diverse teens — Lisa , Keith , Jessica , and Hector — who have powers to make and manipulate words in ( educationally ) cool ways .
From a natural - foods diner , somewhere in New York City , they fight word crimes , particularly those of the mischevious ( but not truly evil ) Pranksters .
Each episode will tell a story featuring these characters , with animated and live - action phonics lessons sprinkled in here and there , focusing on vocabulary .
That ’s something the original show did n’t really do , but that ’s another sign of the times , since PBS Kids ’ research has shown that kids today need a lot of help on that front .
They have also , as with the original , made sure to make the show funny , because they know they ’ll hold kids ’ interest a whole lot better if they do .
And there will , again , be someone in a gorilla suit making occasional appearances .
( There ’ve been rumors of Rita Moreno making a cameo on the new show , and I ’m holding out a little hope for Morgan Freeman and Bill Cosby , too . )
As you ’d expect for a show premiering in 2009 , there will be an online piece as well , not to mention a magazine being published by Marvel Comics .
As usual with Sesame Workshop shows , they ’ve done and are continuing to do a ton of testing of the show ’s concepts , to make sure they ’re hitting the right notes .
They have already begun conducting an outreach program to twenty low - income , low - literacy locations around the United States , to inform parents and kids about the program ’s impending premiere .
Speaking as someone who grew up watching ( mostly reruns of ) the original show , and who bought the first set of DVDs of the original to show to his kids , I ’m really excited about the new one .
At first I thought it sounded too different from the original , but then I realized that the new one has to be aimed at today ’s kids just as the original was at kids of its era .
My kids will definitely be watching the show when it premieres .
Until then , you can watch some short previews on the show ’s website .
From Josh Marshall :
MSNBC just ran what we can only call an extraordinary interview with NBC News ’ Chuck Todd and Brian Williams .
They were discussing the interview NBC just did and will soon broadcast of John McCain and Sarah Palin .
We ’ll have the video shortly but what really stood out was the candidness of Todd ’s discussion of his sense that the wheels may be coming off the campaign and his willingness to discuss what he saw as the tension between the two candidates speculate that McCain may be starting to blame Palin for his campaign tanking .
Steven Spielberg and his Dreamworks company stole the plot of last year 's Disturbia from the classic 1954 Alfred Hitchcock film Rear Window , according to a lawsuit filed yesterday in New York .
Spielberg is being sued by a trust which owns the rights to the 1942 Cornell Woolrich short story Murder from a Fixed Viewpoint .
It claims that Hitchcock and his lead actor , James Stewart , bought the rights to adapt the book in 1953 , prior to making Rear Window .
They argue that Spielberg , Dreamworks , parent company Viacom and Universal Pictures should have done the same before starting work on their own version , which was directed by DJ Caruso .
" What the defendants have been unwilling to do openly , legitimately and legally , ( they ) have done surreptitiously , by their back - door use of the Rear Window story without paying compensation , " the lawsuit reads .
It goes on to claim that Rear Window and Disturbia are " essentially the same " .
Both feature a protagonist who views what may or may not be a killing through his window .
The plot , characters and their interactions are all similar , the suit contends .
" In the Disturbia film the defendants purposefully employed immaterial variations or transparent rephrasing to produce essentially the same story as the Rear Window story , " it reads .
Disturbia starred Shia LaBeouf in the main role and was a sizable box - office hit upon its release , taking $ 80 m ( £ 45.5 million ) in the US alone on a budget of just $ 20 m .
Critics at the time were quick to note that it had borrowed heavily from the earlier film .
So far neither Spielberg nor Dreamworks have made any comment on the suit , which was filed at a Manhattan federal court by the estate of late film producer Sheldon Abend , who owned the rights to Murder from a Fixed Viewpoint .

The federal government took steps on Thursday to begin oil and natural gas exploration off the coast of Virginia .
The Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) estimates that this area under consideration , beginning at least 50 miles offshore , may contain 130 million barrels of oil and 1.14 trillion cubic feet of natural gas .
By opening the public comment period for drafting an environmental impact statement ( EIS ) on offshore drilling , the Interior Department has now taken the first concrete action in Washington since Bush and Congress lifted certain bans on offshore drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf .
The environmental analysis is the first step in opening 2.9 million acres of waters to a lease sale scheduled for 2011 .
Comments are sought from all interested parties about particular environmental , biological , archaeological , socioeconomic , and geological ( including natural hazard areas ) conditions or potential conflicts , or other information that might bear upon the potential leasing , exploration , and development of the program area and vicinity .
Needless to say , not everyone is pleased with the late - term move from the Bush administration and any environmental groups are eager to see this era pass .
Mike Daulton , the legislative director for the National Audubon Society , says the Bush administration has done a lot of damage to our nation ’s environmental protections over the last eight years , and thinks coastal oil development invites oil spills and tourism - killing industrialization of the coast .
“ We think it ’s a special favor for the oil industry before Bush leaves office , ” said Daulton .

During the Old Stone Age , between thirty - seven thousand and eleven thousand years ago , some of the most remarkable art ever conceived was etched or painted on the walls of caves in southern France and northern Spain .
After a visit to Lascaux , in the Dordogne , which was discovered in 1940 , Picasso reportedly said to his guide , “ They ’ve invented everything . ”
What those first artists invented was a language of signs for which there will never be a Rosetta stone ; perspective , a technique that was not rediscovered until the Athenian Golden Age ; and a bestiary of such vitality and finesse that , by the flicker of torchlight , the animals seem to surge from the walls , and move across them like figures in a magic - lantern show ( in that sense , the artists invented animation ) .
They also thought up the grease lamp — a lump of fat , with a plant wick , placed in a hollow stone — to light their workplace ; scaffolds to reach high places ; the principles of stencilling and Pointillism ; powdered colors , brushes , and stumping cloths ; and , more to the point of Picasso ’s insight , the very concept of an image .
A true artist reimagines that concept with every blank canvas — but not from a void .
Some caves have rock porches that were used for shelter , but there is no evidence of domestic life in their depths .
Sizable groups may have visited the chambers closest to the entrance — perhaps for communal rites — and we know from the ubiquitous handprints that were stamped or airbrushed ( using the mouth to blow pigment ) on the walls that people of both sexes and all ages , even babies , participated in whatever activities took place .
Only a few individuals ventured or were permitted into the furthest reaches of a cave — in some cases , walking or crawling for miles .
Those intrepid spelunkers explored every surface .
If they bypassed certain walls that to us seem just as suitable for decoration as ones they chose , the placement of the art apparently was n’t capricious .
In the course of some twenty - five thousand years , the same animals — primarily bison , stags , aurochs , ibex , horses , and mammoths — recur in similar poses , illustrating an immortal story .
For a nomadic people , living at nature ’s mercy , it must have been a powerful consolation to know that such a refuge from flux existed .
As the painters were learning to crush hematite , and to sharpen embers of Scotch pine for their charcoal ( red and black were their primary colors ) , the last Neanderthals were still living on the vast steppe that was Europe in the Ice Age , which they ’d had to themselves for two hundred millennia , while Homo sapiens were making their leisurely trek out of Africa .
No one can say what the encounters between that low - browed , herculean species and their slighter but formidable successors were like .
( Paleolithic artists , despite their penchant for naturalism , rarely chose to depict human beings , and then did so with a crudeness that smacks of mockery , leaving us a mirror but no self - reflection . )
Their genomes are discrete , so it appears that either the two populations did n’t mate or they could n’t conceive fertile offspring .
In any case , they would n’t have needed to contest their boundless hunting grounds .
They coexisted for some eight thousand years , until the Neanderthals withdrew or were forced , in dwindling numbers , toward the arid mountains of southern Spain , making Gibraltar a final redoubt .
It is n’t known from whom or from what they were retreating ( if “ retreat ” describes their migration ) , though along the way the arts of the newcomers must have impressed them .
Later Neanderthal campsites have yielded some rings and awls carved from ivory , and painted or grooved bones and teeth ( nothing of the like predates the arrival of Homo sapiens ) .
The pathos of their workmanship — the attempt to copy something novel and marvellous by the dimming light of their existence — nearly makes you weep .
And here , perhaps , the cruel notion that we call fashion , a coded expression of rivalry and desire , was born .
The cave artists were as tall as the average Southern European of today , and well nourished on the teeming game and fish they hunted with flint weapons .
They are , genetically , our direct ancestors , although “ direct ” is a relative term .
Since recorded history began , around 3200 B.C. , with the invention of writing in the Middle East , there have been some two hundred human generations ( if one reckons a new one every twenty - five years ) .
Future discoveries may alter the math , but , as it now stands , forty - five hundred generations separate the earliest
Homo sapiens from the earliest cave artists , and between the artists and us another fifteen hundred generations have descended the birth canal , learned to walk upright , mastered speech and the use of tools , reached puberty , reproduced , and died .
Early last April , I set off for the Ardèche , a mountainous region in south - central France where cave networks are a common geological phenomenon ( hundreds are known , dozens with ancient artifacts ) .
It was here , a week before Christmas in 1994 , that three spelunkers exploring the limestone cliffs above the Pont d’Arc , a natural bridge of awesome beauty and scale which resembles a giant mammoth straddling the river gorge , unearthed a cave that made front - page news .
It proved to contain the oldest known paintings in the world — some fifteen to eighteen thousand years older than the friezes at Lascaux and at Altamira , in the Spanish Basque country — and it was named for its chief discoverer , Jean - Marie Chauvet .
Unlike the amateur adventurers or lucky bumblers ( in the case of Lascaux , a posse of village urchins and their dog ) who have fallen , sometimes literally , upon a cave where early Europeans left their cryptic signatures , Chauvet was a professional — a park ranger working for the Ministry of Culture , and the custodian of other prehistoric sites in the region .
He and his partners , Christian Hillaire and Éliette Brunel , were aware of the irreparable damage that even a few indelicate footsteps can cause to an environment that has been sealed for eons — posterity has lost whatever precious relics and evidence that the carelessly trampled floors of Lascaux and Altamira , both now sealed to the public , might have yielded .
The cavers were natives of the Ardèche : three old friends with an interest in archeology .
Brunel was the smallest , so when they felt an updraft of cool air coming from a recess near the cliff ’s ledge — the potential sign of a cavity — they heaved some rocks out of the way , and she squeezed through a tight passage that led to the entrance of a deep shaft .
The men followed , and , unfurling a chain ladder , the group descended thirty feet into a soaring grotto with a domed roof whose every surface was blistered or spiked with stalagmites .
Where the uneven clay floor had receded , it was littered with calcite accretions — blocks and columns that had broken off — and , in photographs , the wrathful , baroque grandeur of the scene evokes some Biblical act of destruction wreaked upon a temple .
As the explorers advanced , moving gingerly , in single file , Brunel suddenly let out a cry : “ They have been here ! ”
The question of who “ they ” were speaks to a mystery that thinking people of every epoch and place have tried to fathom : who are we ?
In the century since the modern study of caves began , specialists from at least half a dozen disciplines — archeology , ethnology , ethology , genetics , anthropology , and art history — have tried ( and competed ) to understand the culture that produced them .
The experts tend to fall into two camps : those who ca n’t resist advancing a theory about the art , and those who believe that there is n’t , and never will be , enough evidence to support one .
Jean Clottes , the celebrated prehistorian and prolific author who assembled the Chauvet research team , in 1996 , belongs to the first camp , and most of his colleagues to the second .
Yet no one who studies the caves seems able to resist a yearning for communion with the artists .
When you consider that their legacy may have been found by chance , but surely was n’t left by chance , it , too , suggests a yearning for communion — with us , their descendants .
Two books published in the past few years , “ The Cave Painters ” ( 2006 ) , by Gregory Curtis , and “ The Nature of Paleolithic Art ” ( 2005 ) , by R. Dale Guthrie , approach the controversy generated by their subject from different perspectives .
Guthrie is an encyclopedic polymath who believes he can “ decode ” prehistory .
Curtis , a former editor of Texas Monthly , is a literary detective ( his previous book , on the Venus de Milo , also concerned the obscure provenance of an archaic masterpiece ) , and in quietly enthralling prose , without hurry or flamboyance , he spins two narratives .
( The shorter one , as he notes , covers a few million years , and the longer one , the past century . )
I packed both volumes , along with some hiking boots , protein bars , and other survival gear , all of it unnecessary , for my sojourn in the Ardèche .
My destination was a Spartan summer camp — a concrete barracks in a valley near the Pont d’Arc .
It is owned by the regional government , and normally houses groups of schoolchildren on subsidized holidays .
But twice a year , for a couple of weeks in the spring and the autumn , the camp is a base for the Chauvet team .
They , and only they , are admitted to the cave ( and sometimes not even they : last October , the research session was cancelled because the climate had n’t restabilized ) .
Access is so strictly limited not only because traffic causes contamination but also because the French government has been embroiled for thirteen years in multimillion - dollar litigation with Jean - Marie Chauvet and his partners , as well as with the owners of the land on which they found the cave .
( The finders are entitled to royalties from reproductions of the art , while the owners are entitled to compensation for a treasure that , at least technically , is their property — the Napoleonic laws , modified in the nineteen - fifties , that give the Republic authority to dispose of any minerals or metals beneath the soil do not apply to cave paintings .
Had Chauvet been a gold mine , the suit could n’t have been brought . )
By dusk on the first night , most of the researchers had assembled in the cafeteria for an excellent dinner of rabbit fricassée , served with a Côtes du Vivarais , and followed by a selection of local cheeses .
( The Ardèche is a gourmet ’s paradise , and the camp chef was a tough former sailor from Marseilles whose speech and cooking were equally pungent . )
Among the senior team members , Evelyne Debard is a geologist , as is Norbert Aujoulat .
He is a former director of research at Lascaux , and the author of a fine book on its art , who calls himself “ an underground man . ”
Marc Azéma is a documentary filmmaker who specializes in archeology .
Carole Fritz and Gilles Tosello , a husband and wife from Toulouse , are experts in parietal art , and Tosello is a graphic artist whose heroically patient , stroke - by - stroke tracings of the cave ’s signs and images are essential to their study .
Jean - Marc Elalouf , a geneticist , and the author of a poetic essay on Chauvet , has , with a team of graduate students , sequenced the mitochondrial DNA of the cave ’s numerous bears .
They pocked the floor with their hibernation burrows , and , in a space known as the Skull Chamber , a bear ’s cranium sits on a flat , altar - like pedestal — perhaps enshrined there by the artists .
The grotto is littered with other ursine remains , and some of the bones seem to have been planted in the sediment or stuck with intent into the fissured walls .
( No human DNA has yet surfaced , and Elalouf does n’t expect to find any . )
Dominique Baffier , an official at the Ministry of Culture , is Chauvet ’s curator .
She coördinates the research and conservation .
Jean - Michel Geneste , an archeologist , is the director of the project , a post he assumed in 2001 , when Jean Clottes , at sixty - seven , took mandatory retirement .
“ I ’ve rented the extra room to an escaped convict — maybe you know him . ”

Clottes is a hero of Gregory Curtis ’s “ The Cave Painters , ” one of the “ giants ” in a line of willful , brilliant , and often eccentric personalities who have shaped a discipline that prides itself on scientific detachment but has been a battleground for the kind of turf wars that were absent from the caves themselves .
No human conflict is recorded in cave art , although at three separate sites there are four ambiguous drawings of a creature with a man ’s limbs and torso , pierced with spearlike lines .
More pertinent , perhaps , is a famous vignette in the shaft at Lascaux .
It depicts a rather comical stick figure with an avian beak or mask , a puny physique , and a long skinny penis .
He and his erect member seem to have rigor mortis .
He is flat on his back at the feet of an exquisitely realistic wounded bison , whose intestines are spilling out .
The bison ’s glance is turned away , but it might have an ironic smile .
Could the subject be hubris ?
Whatever it represents , some mythic contest — and the struggle of prehistorians to interpret their subject is such a contest — has ended in a draw .
Curtis profiles a dynasty of interpreters , beginning with the Spanish nobleman Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola , who discovered Altamira in 1879 — it was on his property .
( Parts of Niaux and Mas d’Azil , two gigantic painted caves in the Pyrenees , had been known for centuries , but their decorations were regarded as graffiti made in historic times , perhaps by Roman legionaries . )
He was accused of art forgery , and his scholarly papers on the paintings ’ antiquity were ridiculed by two of the era ’s greatest archeologists , Gabriel de Mortillet and Émile Cartailhac .
Sautuola died before Cartailhac repented of his skepticism , in 1902 .
By then , the art at two important sites , Les Combarelles and Font - de - Gaume ( which contains a ravishing portrait of two amorous reindeer ) , had come to light , and , in 1906 , Cartailhac published a lavish compendium of cave painting that was subsidized by the Prince of Monaco .
The book ’s much admired illustrations of Altamira were the work of a young priest with a painterly eye , Henri Breuil , who , in the course of half a century , became known as the Pope of Prehistory .
He divided the era into four periods , and dated the art by its style and appearance .
Aurignacian , the oldest , was followed by Perigordian ( later known as Gravettian ) , Solutrean , and Magdalenian .
They were named for type - sites in France : Aurignac , La Gravette , Solutré , and La Madeleine .
But Breuil ’s theory about the art ’s meaning — that it related to rituals of “ hunting magic ” — was discredited by subsequent studies .
During the Second World War , Max Raphael , a German art historian who had studied the caves of the Dordogne before fleeing the Nazis to New York , was looking for clues to the art ’s meaning in its thematic unity .
He concluded that the animals represented clan totems , and that the paintings depicted strife and alliances — an archaic saga .
In 1951 , the year before Raphael died , he sent an extract of his writings to Annette Laming - Emperaire , a young French archeologist who shared his conviction that “ prehistory cannot be reconstructed with the aid of ethnography . ”
Beware , in other words , of analogue reasoning , because no one should presume to parse the icons and figures of a vanished society by comparing them with the art of hunter - gatherers from more recent eras .
In 1962 , she published a doctoral thesis that made her famous .
“ The Meaning of Paleolithic Rock Art ” dismissed the various , too creative theories of its predecessors , and , with them , any residual nineteenth - century prejudice or romance about the “ primitive ” mind .
Laming - Emperaire ’s structuralist methodology is still in use , much facilitated by computer science .
It involves compiling minutely detailed inventories and diagrams of the way that species are grouped on the cave walls ; of their gender , frequency , and position ; and of their relation to the signs and handprints that often appear close to them .
In “ Lascaux ” ( 2005 ) , Norbert Aujoulat explains how he and his colleagues added time to the equation .
Analyzing the order of superimposed images , they determined that wherever horses , aurochs , and stags appear on the same panel , the horse is beneath , the aurochs in the middle , and the stag on top , and that the variations in their coats correspond to their respective mating seasons .
The triad of “ horse - aurochs - stag ” links the fertility cycles of important , and perhaps sacred or symbolic , animals to the cosmic cycles , suggesting a great metaphor about creation .
Laming - Emperaire had an eminent thesis adviser , André Leroi-Gourhan , who revolutionized the practice of excavation by recognizing that a vertical dig destroys the context of a site .
In twenty years ( 1964 - 84 ) of insanely painstaking labor — scraping the soil in small horizontal squares at Pincevent , a twelve - thousand - year - old campsite on the Seine — he and his disciples gave us one of the richest pictures to date of Paleolithic life as the Old Stone Age was ending .
A new age in the science of prehistory had begun in 1949 , when radiocarbon dating was invented by Willard Libby , a chemist from Chicago .
One of Libby ’s first experiments was on a piece of charcoal from Lascaux .
Breuil had , incorrectly , it turns out , classified the cave as Perigordian .
( It is Magdalenian . )
He had also made the Darwinian assumption that the most ancient art was the most primitive , and Leroi - Gourhan worked on the same premise .
In that respect , Chauvet was a bombshell .
It is Aurignacian , and its earliest paintings are at least thirty - two thousand years old , yet they are just as sophisticated as much later compositions .
What emerged with that revelation was an image of Paleolithic artists transmitting their techniques from generation to generation for twenty - five millennia with almost no innovation or revolt .
A profound conservatism in art , Curtis notes , is one of the hallmarks of a “ classical civilization . ”
For the conventions of cave painting to have endured four times as long as recorded history , the culture it served , he concludes , must have been “ deeply satisfying ” — and stable to a degree it is hard for modern humans to imagine .
Jean Clottes is a tall , cordial man of seventy - four , who still attends the biannual sessions at Chauvet , conducting his own research ( this April , he and Marc Azéma found a new panel of signs ) , while continuing to travel and lecture widely .
The latest addition to his bibliography , “ Cave Art , ” a luxuriously illustrated “ imaginary museum ” of the Old Stone Age , is due out from Phaidon this summer .
Clottes ’s eminence in his field was never preordained .
He once taught high - school English in Foix , a city in the Pyrenees , near the Andorran border , which is an epicenter for decorated caves .
He studied archeology in his spare time , and earned a doctorate at forty - one , when he quit teaching .
He had been moonlighting in a job that gave him privileged access to new caves , and an impressive calling card — as the director of prehistory for the Midi-Pyrenees — but a nominal salary .
The appointment was made official in 1971 , and for the next two decades Clottes was usually the first responder at the scene of a new discovery .
The most sensational find , before Chauvet , was Cosquer — a painted cave near Marseilles that could be reached only through a treacherous underwater tunnel , in which three divers had drowned .
Like Altamira , Cosquer was , at first , attacked as a hoax , and some of the press coverage impeached Clottes ’s integrity as its authenticator .
He could judge its art only from photographs , but , in 1992 , a year after Cosquer was revealed , carbon dating proved that the earliest paintings are at least twenty - seven thousand years old .
That year , the Ministry of Culture elevated him to the rank of inspector general .
At the base camp , Clottes bunked down , as did everyone , in a dorm room , and braved the morning hoarfrost for a dash to the communal showers .
There is a boyish quality to his energy and conviction .
( At sixty - nine , he learned to scuba dive so that he could finally explore Cosquer himself . )
One evening , he showed us a film about his “ baptism , ” in 2007 , as an honorary Tuareg ; the North African nomads crowned him with a turban steeped in indigo that stained his forehead , and he danced to their drums by a Saharan campfire .
Among his own sometimes fractious tribesmen , Clottes also commands the respect due an unusually vigorous elder , and it was hard to keep pace with him as he scampered on his long legs up the steep cliff to Chauvet , talking with verve the entire way .
The path skirts a vineyard , then veers up into the woods , emerging onto a corniche — a natural terrace with a rocky overhang on one side , and a precipitous drop on the other .
“ En route to Chauvet , the painters might have sheltered here or prepared their pigments .
Looking at the valley and the river gorge , they saw what we do , ” Clottes said , indicating a magnificent view .
“ The topography has n’t changed much , except that the Ice Age vegetation was much sparser : mostly evergreens , like fir and pine .
Without all the greenery , the resemblance of the Pont d’Arc to a giant mammoth would have been even more dramatic .
But nothing of the landscape — clouds , earth , sun , moon , rivers , or plant life , and , only rarely , a horizon — figures in cave art .
It ’s one among many striking omissions . ”
Where the terrace ended , we plunged back into the underbrush , following a track obstructed by rocks and brambles , and , after about half an hour of climbing , we arrived at the entrance that Jean - Marie Chauvet and his partners discovered .
( The prehistoric entrance has been plugged , for millennia , by a landslide . )
A shallow cave at the trailhead has been fitted out as a storeroom for gear and supplies .
From here , a wooden ramp guides one along a narrow ledge , shaped like a horseshoe , that was formed when the cliffs receded , to a massive metal door that ’s as well defended — with voice alarms , video surveillance , and a double key system — as a bank vault .
Some members of the team relaxed with a cigarette or a cold drink and a little academic gossip , but Clottes immediately changed into his spelunking overalls , donned a hard hat with a miner ’s lamp , and disappeared into the underworld .
On a map , Chauvet resembles the British Isles , and , like an island with coves and promontories , its outline is irregular .
The distance from the entrance to the deepest gallery is about eight hundred feet , and , at the northern end , the cave forks into two horn - shaped branches .
In some places , like the grotto that Éliette Brunel first plumbed in 1994 ( it is named for her ) , the terrain is rocky and chaotic , while in others , like the Chamber of the Bear Hollows , the walls and floor are relatively smooth .
( In the nineteen - nineties , a metal catwalk was installed to protect the cave bed . )
The ceilings of the principal galleries vary in height from about five to forty feet , but there are passages and alcoves where an adult has to kneel or crawl .
Twenty - six thousand years ago ( six millennia after the first paintings were created ) , a lone adolescent left his footprints and torch swipes in the furthest reaches of the western horn , the Gallery of the Crosshatching .
The Megaloceros Gallery — a funnel in the eastern horn named for the huge , elklike herbivores that mingle on the walls with rhinos , horses , bison , a glorious ibex , three abstract vulvas , and assorted geometric signs — is the narrowest part of the cave , and it seems to have been a gathering point or a staging area where the artists built hearths to produce their charcoal .
Dominique Baffier , the curator , and Valérie Feruglio , a young archeologist who arrived at the base camp during my visit with her new baby , were moved to write in “ Chauvet Cave ” ( 2001 ) , a book of essays and photography on the team ’s research , “ The freshness of these remains gives the impression that . . . we interrupted the Aurignacians in their task and caused them to flee abruptly . ”
They dropped an ivory projectile , which was found in the sediment .
From here , one emerges into the deepest recess of Chauvet , the End Chamber , a spectacular vaulted space that contains more than a third of the cave ’s etchings and paintings — a few in ochre , most in charcoal , and all meticulously composed .
A great frieze covers the back left wall : a pride of lions with Pointillist whiskers seems to be hunting a herd of bison , which appear to have stampeded a troop of rhinos , one of which looks as if it had fallen into , or is climbing out of , a cavity in the rock .
As at many sites , the scratches made by a standing bear have been overlaid with a palimpsest of signs or drawings , and one has to wonder if cave art did n’t begin with a recognition that bear claws were an expressive tool for engraving a record — poignant and indelible — of a stressed creature ’s passage through the dark .

To the far right of the frieze , on a separate wall , a huge , finely modelled bison stands alone , gazing stage left toward a pair of figures painted on a conical outcropping of rock that descends from the ceiling and comes to a point about four feet above the floor .
The fleshy shape of this pendant is unmistakably phallic , and all of its sides are decorated , though only the front is clearly visible .
The floor of the End Chamber is littered with relics .
In order to preserve them , the catwalk stops close to the entrance , and the innermost alcove , known as the Sacristy , remains to be explored .
But one of the team ’s archeologists , Yanik Le Guillou , rigged a digital camera to a pole , and was able to photograph the pendant ’s far side .
Wrapped around , or , as it appears , straddling , the phallus is the bottom half of a woman ’s body , with heavy thighs and bent knees that taper at the ankle .
Her vulva is darkly shaded , and she has no feet .
Hovering above her is a creature with a bison ’s head and hump , and an aroused , white eye .
But a line branching from its neck looks like a human arm with fingers .
The relationship of these figures to each other , and to the frieze on the adjacent wall , is among the great enigmas in cave art .
The woman ’s posture suggests that she may be squatting in childbirth , and the animals , on a level with her loins , seem to be streaming away from her .
Gregory Curtis , who fights and loses a valiant battle with his urge to speculate , admits in “ The Cave Painters ” that he can’t help reading a mythical narrative into the scene , one that relates to the Minotaur — the hybrid offspring of a mortal woman and a sacred bull “ who lived in the Labyrinth , which is a kind of cave . ”
Art on the walls of Cretan palaces depicts the spectacle of youths leapfrogging a charging bull , and that public spectacle — in the guise of the bullfight — has , he points out , endured into modern times precisely in the regions where decorated caves are most concentrated .
“ European culture began somewhere , ” he concludes .
“ Why not right here ? ”
In the course of a friendly correspondence , Yanik Le Guillou gave Curtis a warning about indulging his imagination .
Perhaps that sin might be forgiven in an American journalist , but not in Jean Clottes .
The book that sets forth his controversial theory about the art , “ The Shamans of Prehistory , ” co-written with the South African archeologist David Lewis - Williams , and published in 1996 — the year Clottes took over at Chauvet — detonated a polemical fire - storm that has n’t entirely subsided .
Defying the prohibitions against importing evidence to the caves from external sources , the authors grounded their interpretation in Lewis - Williams ’s studies of shamanism among hunter - gatherers , historical and contemporary , and of African rock art , specifically the paintings of a nomadic people , the San , whose shamans still serve as spiritual mediators with the powers of nature and with the dead .
In an earlier article , “ The Signs of All Times , ” written with the anthropologist T. A. Dowson , Lewis - Williams had explored what he called “ a neurological bridge ” to the Old Stone Age .
The authors cited laboratory experiments with subjects in an induced - trance state which suggested that the human optic system generates the same types of visual illusions , in the same three stages , differing only slightly by culture , whatever the stimulus : drugs , music , pain , fasting , repetitive movements , solitude , or high carbon - dioxide levels ( a phenomenon that is common in close underground chambers ) .
In the first stage , a subject sees a pattern of points , grids , zigzags , and other abstract forms ( familiar from the caves ) ; in the second stage , these forms morph into objects — the zigzags , for example , might become a serpent .
In the third and deepest stage , a subject feels sucked into a dark vortex that generates intense hallucinations , often of monsters or animals , and feels his body and spirit merging with theirs .
Peoples who practice shamanism believe in a tiered cosmos : an upper world ( the heavens ) ; an underworld ; and the mortal world .
When Clottes joined forces with Lewis - Williams , he had come to believe that cave painting largely represents the experiences of shamans or initiates on a vision quest to the underworld , where spirits gathered .
The caves served as a gateway , and their walls were considered porous .
Where the artists or their entourage left handprints , they were palping a living rock in the hopes of reaching or summoning a force beyond it .
They typically incorporated the rock ’s contours and fissures into the outlines of their drawings — as a horn , a hump , or a haunch — so that a frieze becomes a bas - relief .
But , in doing so , they were also locating the dwelling place of an animal from their visions , and bodying it forth .
This scenario has its loose ends , particularly in the art ’s untrancelike fidelity to nature , but it fits the dreamlike suspension of the animals in a vacuum , and it helps to explain three of the most sensational figures in cave art .
One is the bison - man at Chauvet ; another is the bird - man at Lascaux ; and the third , known as the Sorcerer , looks down from a perch close to the high ceiling at Les Trois Frères , a Magdalenian cave in the Pyrenees .
He has the ears and antlers of a stag ; handlike paws ; athletic human legs and haunches ; a horse ’s tail ; and a long , rather elegantly groomed wizard ’s beard .
In the wake of the decision by the Bush administration to try and neuter the Endangered Species Act , environmental groups across America have come out in opposition to the plans .
The latest , the Ecological Society of America , has come out hitting hard .
" The concept of independent scientific review has been in practice since the 18th century and is crucial to ensuring that ideas and proposed work are scientifically sound , " said Alison Power , president of the Society and professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University .
" This overhaul of the Endangered Species Act would place the fate of rare species in the hands of government stakeholders who are not qualified to assess the environmental impacts of their activities . "
However it goes even further than that , considering that many companies in existence at the moment do n’t play by the rules that do exist , let alone ones that will change in the future .
Can you honestly picture a company , given the opportunity to do otherwise , halt development of a project ( for example ) in favor of protecting a species of animal ?
This move by Bush comes at the same time that he has announced he hopes to set up two new protected areas in US waters .
And it seems very much as if , in his last few months in office , Bush is trying to please as many people as possible , which will only end up pissing off even more .
" What if we allowed pharmaceutical companies to approve and distribute drugs without consulting the Food and Drug Administration ? " asks Power .
" The result would spell potential disaster for humans .
In this case , the vulnerable party is our environment . "
And as often happens , humans come first , in place of the environment .
A justifiable point of view , sure , until you realize that by harming the environment now , we destroy the future for humans later .

Kudzu and the California Marriage Amendment
by Rick Moen
August 25 , 2008
( last updated October 21 , 2018 )
This past century , large portions of the American South have been consumed by an unintended side - effect .
I refer to the infamous " kudzu " vine , imported from Japan for its stunning erosion - control properties .
This tactic worked : Crumbling riverbanks and hillsides were stabilized all over the South — but , then , everyone realized with mounting horror that this hardy legume is almost completely unstoppable anywhere protected from hard freezes , growing at the awesome rate of a foot per night and reaching heights of 100 feet .
Entire abandoned houses have been observed to vanish under a kudzu carpet , over a summer growing season .
It 's now considered a pest ; sometimes , an outright menace .
The plant can be used with caution , where its invasive side - effect is known and planned for — but the point is that it was deployed without understanding its full effects .
Laws ' side - effects , likewise , can render them self - defeating ( though , on the bright side , bad laws are easier to eradicate than kudzu ) :
I 'm going to explain , below , why recently popular marriage - definition legislation like California 's November 2008 " California Marriage Protection Act " ( an initiative state - constitutional amendment ) creates kudzu - class unintended side effects its proponents have n't anticipated and will find horrific — in that they 're going to end up mandating and legally sanctifying exactly the sort of same - sex marriages they 're intending to ban .
Please note : Yr. humble author is deliberately avoiding the question of whether same - sex marriage is desirable , an offense against God , and so on .
( For what it 's worth , said author is a heterosexual genetic male , happily and monogamously married to qty .
one ( 1 ) heterosexual genetic female .
So , this essay is not a sneaky ploy to induce gender confusion in unwary citizens . )
It 's not that I do n't have opinions on that contentious question .
It 's just that they 're not relevant to what I 'm writing about .
In short : I 'm going to show that recent legislation restricting marriage to " a man and a woman " — regardless of whether you consider that effort good , bad , or indifferent — is going to produce harmful , unintended side effects ( maybe even for you , your family , your friends , and so on ) , exactly the opposite of what proponents intend .
I 'll not be moralizing , and this is n't lobbying from the " intersex " movement or anyone else .
I 'm just a regular hetero guy , quietly telling you what 's starting to happen , why , and how to see for yourself .
OK ?
Marriage Protection Meets Biology
Here 's the sort of law we 're talking about :
Proposition 8
Eliminates Right of Same - Sex Couples to Marry : Initiative Constitutional Amendment SECTION I. Title
This measure shall be known and may be cited as the " California Marriage Protection Act . "
SECTION 2 . Article I. Section 7.5 is added to the California Constitution , to read : Sec. 7.5 .
Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California .
Now , that 's simple and should have predictable , orderly results , right ?
I 'll bet the Soil Conservation Service guys in the 1950s thought that about kudzu , too .
The biggest problem is that laws like the California initiative will make the courts decide who is male and who is female — and all available decision criteria create unavoidable miscarriages of justice that will , or should , dismay initiative proponents .
You 're probably thinking , about now , that I 'm going to exaggerate the sex - definitional1 problem : Probably , you and everyone you know is unambiguously male or female — or at least has always believed himself or herself to be so , and nobody 's challenged that , and nobody 's likely to .
That 's true , absolutely :
Only maybe one live birth in 100 has some non-standard sex anatomy , and genetic anomalies are slightly rarer than that .
However , let 's talk about those 1 - in - 100 or 1 - in - 1000 cases — because those could be you , or your aunt or uncle , or your best friend — and because our system of law has to deal with 1 - in - 1000 situations , too .
An illustrative example : Let 's say you 're an adult woman .
You were always female ; you never had any doubts about this .
You have all the right parts and none of the wrong ones ; you think of yourself as a gal .
You get married .
( Yes , I do mean to a man . )
Somewhere down the road , your genes get tested :
To your astonishment , it says you 're not only not XX ( double - X being the classic female chromosome pairing ) , but in fact XY ( classic male chromosomes ) .
Testing shows your blood to be loaded with testosterone and other classic androgens ( male hormones ) .
Ultrasound locates an undescended set of testes in your abdomen .
What 's going on ?
( Note that all women do produce androgens , normally , but at much lower levels than in men . )
What 's going on is called Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome ( AIS , found in both " Partial " = PAIS and " Complete " = CAIS sub-variants ) , where , at a critical early stage of development , because of a structural variation on your X chromosome , your cells ' androgen receptors became unable ( with CAIS ) or poorly able ( with PAIS ) to respond to those hormones .
The hormones were there , but had no ( or much reduced ) effect .
Your entire subsequent development was thus into a woman .
You 're a gal — one with no ovaries / womb and thus infertile , and with vestigial testes somewhere inside , but every other inch a woman .
Laws like Proposition 8 might very well cause such a woman 's marriage to be retroactively annulled — or prohibited in the first place .
Furthermore , if the law decides that this particular citizen is male on account of the Y chromosome , testosterone , and testes , then she would be permitted to marry ... guess who ?... another woman .
So , courtesy of Prop. 8 , we are likely to suddenly have court - mandated same - sex marriages .
Let 's say you 're an adult male .
You 've always been male ; you seem to have exactly the right parts , and so on .
Your genes get checked one day , and they come up " XX " — the classic chromosome pair of a genetic female .
Yet , you 're a 230 lb. guy with facial hair who was a high school running back .
What 's going on ?
When your mother and father 's genes fused , the key part of Dad's Y chromosome ( the " SRY " = Sex - determining Region Y bloc ) got translocated to somewhere other than chromosome 46 .
Are you an XY , a genetic male ?
Well , no , you 're not — even though you think you 're a guy , you look like a guy , and so on .
Your marriage might end up getting annulled , too — and you might end up being permitted to marry only men .
It turns out , those two cases — AIS and transported SRY blocs — are only the beginning of the troubles we 're facing .
Here 's a litany of other ways people can end up biologically difficult to classify , through no fault of their own .
I 'll keep the jargon factor low , but you can certainly skip this list if not interested :
You 're a girl with female sex organs — but , at puberty , your voice deepens and some testes descend out of your lower abdomen .
( I 'm steering clear of some of the more graphic details , here . )
It turns out you have XY chromosomes ( male ) , but you look like a young woman .
You might or might not be fertile , but it would ( if so ) be as a male .
This is a recessive genetic condition called " 5 - alpha - steroid reductase deficiency " , that causes testosterone to be chemically transformed in peripheral tissues before it can have its usual effect .
You 're a man with all of the apparent parts , facial hair and all .
One day , during unrelated abdominal surgery , doctors are surprised to find inside a full set of normal female parts ( ovaries , Fallopian tubes , womb , etc. ) .
Genetic typing shows you to be XX , but something called " Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia " , starting early in life , caused your adrenal glands ( near your kidneys ) to induce production of an unusual mix of sex hormones , changing your entire course of post-natal development , leading you to appear , and believe yourself to be , male .
You 're a gal :
All the gal parts .
None of the others .
Yet , you 're XY .
It turns out that , during development , you ended up short of a hormone called " Müllerian Inhibiting Factor " .
That factor would have let your Müllerian ducts regress and the related Wolffian duct develop , leading to more - complete and functional development of male organs , which would have given you more androgens .
Its absence means you end up looking , seeming , and believing yourself female .
( This pattern of early development is called " gonadal dysgenesis " . )
2
You 're a girl — but you do n't seem to be entering puberty .
Genetic testing shows you 're XY , although in all other respects apparently completely female .
What 's happened is that the sex - determining " SRY " region of the Y chromosome did n't trigger the development of testes , with resulting female development .
This is called " Swyer syndrome " , or " XY gonadal dysgenesis " .
You 're a man , albeit somewhat on the tall and thin side .
You and your wife are having fertility problems .
You 're both checked :
It turns out you , the husband , have " XXY " or " XXXY " or " XXYY " chromosomes .
( There 's also been one reported case of " XYYY " . )
You might be borderline fertile ( as a man ) , or you might be out of luck .
This is called " Klinefelter 's syndrome " .
There 's also a variant " mosaic " form of Klinefelter 's where some of your body 's cells have XY chromosomes and others are XXY .
Speaking of mosaicism :
You 're a male with all the fixings , but also female equivalents — and raised as a boy .
You then get the worst parts of both types of puberty , with both menstruation and your voice cracking , and so on .
This is an incredibly rare but documented " cellular mosaic " condition where you have some XY cells and some XX ones , the only known way of generating true ( bi- fertile ) hermaphrodism , which is otherwise impossible and a medical myth .
( There can be diverse combinations of mosaicism : XY with XXY , XX , XXXY , and so on . )
You 're a man with all the normal parts .
You and your wife are having fertility problems .
Genetic testing shows you to be " XX " , but with the sex - determining " SRY " genetic bloc also present on some non-standard chromosome , and thus producing male development anyway .
( This is called " De la Chapelle syndrome . " )
You 're an apparently normal man , with fertility problems .
Genetic testing reveals " XX " genes , and no SRY block can be found anywhere .
This " SRY - negative XX male syndrome " is observed but so far not fully understood .
You 're a gal .
You 're late entering puberty .
The doctors find no womb or a partial one .
Otherwise , you 're an ( infertile , except via surrogacy ) XX woman with absolutely nothing wrong with you .
The causes are not really understood , but it 's called Mayer Rokitansky Küster Hauser ( MRKH ) syndrome .
You 're a gal , but your secondary sex characteristics at puberty seem underdeveloped , relatively speaking .
You turn out not to be XX , but rather have a single , unpaired X chromosome ( also called either " XO " or " 45,X " as opposed to " 46,XX " ) — or a second X is present but abnormal , or some single - X cells are mosaiced among XX ones .
In any of those cases , you might be fertile , or maybe not , and it 's called Turner ( or Ullrich - Turner ) syndrome .
You may be unsurprised to hear that babies also sometimes end up with mixed sexual characteristics caused by fetal conditions ( e.g. , Mom was prescribed a progestin - based medicine such as Danazol , a testosterone - related hormone once prescribed to treat endometriosis ) , or for no identifiable reason .
Traditionally , obstetricians tend to pick a sex and use neonatal surgery to converge the baby towards it — something more common than people realize , as nobody wants to talk about it — yet another contentious , opinion - soaked issue I 'm carefully avoiding .
( But , anyway , the point is :
Are you sure you 're not a man , or a woman , primarily because a scalpel made you that way ? )
( If keeping count , please note that I 've listed 13 distinct , real - world , genetic / hormonal / developmental conditions raising profound sex- classification conundrums , not 11 : AIS and transported SRY blocs count as the 12th and 13th . )
What 's the point of all this ?
It 's that , even if you and everyone you know falls into none of the above categories — and , honestly , how many of us know for sure ? — somewhere on the order of 1 in 1000 of us do .
In the USA , that 's enough people to populate Minneapolis or Colorado Springs .
The entire populace of a medium - sized American city could be told by some court , " No , you 're not the sex you always thought you were .
Go marry someone of that sex you minutely resemble , and have always believed yourself to be , but that ( according to us ) you are n't . "
If you back laws like Proposition 8 , you 're trying to put all such people into exactly the situation you say you 're against — pushing them into marrying the same sex .
In fact , you 're doing something more extreme than that :
You 're saying they should be permitted to marry only the same sex .
Proto - Kudzu : The Olympics
These ironies have been seen before — i.e. , we really should know better — because of sex - testing 's unfortunate history during the 20th Century 's Olympic Games .
In the years and decades following the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics , awareness grew of the strange , ultimately sad case of Dora Ratjen ( 1918 - 2008 ) of Bremen , who'd been a women's high - jump competitor for Germany ( eliminated in the finals ) , and then took gold for the German Reich at the September 1938 European Athletics Championships in Vienna .
A few days later , on an express train to Cologne ( Köln ) , Magdeburg Police Detective Sergeant Sömmering , hearing a tip about a woman passenger who was actually a man , insisted on taking Dora to the police station for questioning as to whether she were a man .
There , Dora hesitated , then said she was indeed a man , albeit one legally female who'd been raised female from birth .
Dora was arrested on suspicion of fraud and her gold medal confiscated .
Charges were later dropped as evidence emerged that neither Dora nor any of the athletic officials had been guilty of fraudulent intent , as there was no scheme for financial gain : Dora had been raised female in part because of somewhat non-standard genital anatomy , realizing she had male traits only at puberty , but then lead a lonely life of concealment , attempting to continue the only life she 'd ever known .
The 1938 train ride changed that , as she was suddenly ruled male .
Dora changed her name to Heinrich Ratjen , Jr. , was a working man in Hanover for some years , and then lived out a quiet life running his parents ' bar in Bremen .
German and international sports authorities adjusted competition records , handling the matter quietly , as the Ratjen family had requested .
Public attention to the case was therefore very low until an extremely inaccurate short piece appeared in the Sept. 16 , 1966 issue of Time magazine , breaking the story to English - speaking audiences :
Time 's uncredited author invented out of whole cloth a subsequently oft - repeated but totally bogus moralistic tale of former Olympic athlete Dora Ratjen having been unmasked in 1957 as " Hermann [ sic ] Ratjen " , a waiter in Bremen , and then ( supposedly ) tearfully confessed having been forced by the Nazi authorities to compete as a woman " for the sake of the honor and glory of Germany " .
( I regret having repeated , in early versions of this essay , a variant of Time 's baseless account , working from a BBC World News story that had been likewise lead astray by the deeply dishonest , dishonorable , and unethical Time piece .
By contrast , my profound thanks to Der Spiegel 's Berlin bureau chief Stefan Berg for correcting the Henry Luce rag 's misdeed in 2009 , after Ratjen had been maligned once again in supposedly " based on a true story " movie Berlin ' 36 , once again based on Time 's fishwrap - reject article . )
In any event , following the ( sensationalistic ) 1960s retellings , Dora 's story impelled the International Olympic Committee to attempt to fix the problem using physical exams , during preparations for the 1968 Mexico City Summer Games ( after trying them on an experimental basis during the 1968 Grenoble Winter Games ) — only to find that a significant minority of athletes had what one might call ambiguous parts .
So , they tried switching to " buccal [ i.e. , cheek ] smears " — testing cheek swabbings for the " Barr body " ( aka " sex chromatin " ) in a cell nucleus that indicates an inactive X chromosome — which is what occurs with double - X .
The IOC inferred — badly — that athletes without Barr bodies must be XY and thus male .
Later , starting with the 1992 Albertville Winter Games , IOC switched to looking checking for the key " SRY " gene bloc on a Y chromosome ( using a molecular polymerase chain reaction to amplify the gene sequence where present ) — but not for that same gene bloc if attached to a non-standard chromosome — that codes for male traits .
Both tests accidentally implicated innocent CAIS women with XY genes ( female in all respects that should matter ) and others as detailed above , whose genetic anomalies gave them no competitive advantage .
In particular , in 1967 , Polish sprinting champion Ewa Kłobukowska was disqualified , publicly humiliated , and stripped of her medals ( and banned from professional sports ! ) for being ( probably ) XXY with XX mosaicism , on the basis of failing the Barr body test , as was Spain 's hurdler Maria José Martínez Patino for being XY ( CAIS ) in the 1980s .
Worse , during preparations for the 1968 Grenoble Winter Games , Austrian skier Erika Schinegger was genetically tested , determined to be XY , and disqualified .
This was a great shock to all three women , who were raised female and had no reason to think otherwise .
( Erika subsequently did have a sex change , having her previously unsuspected internal male genitals surgically uncovered , is now Erik , and became a father .
Maria 's competitive eligibility was reinstated .
but only in 1988 , long past her prime as a runner .
Ewa retired , married , and gave birth to a son .
Her medals were never returned , nor was she ever given an apology for the committee 's error . )
For extra irony : CAIS ( and 5 - alpha - steroid reductase deficiency ) women athletes are in fact about the only humans on earth of either sex who logically should be above suspicion :
Unlike everyone else , those women 's condition makes them uniquely unable to cheat by taking anabolic steroids to build muscle , because by definition their bodies simply do n't respond at all to steroids ( including testosterone ) , making them , actually , hyper - female — more female , in absolutely all ways that matter , than are regular XX women with normal androgen metabolism .
And , worst of all : The SRY - bloc test failed to spot men with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia or androgen - producing tumors , who are XX but enjoy all the muscle advantages of maleness — or , likewise , men with Klinefelter 's syndrome , or men with their SRY genes on non-standard chromosomes ( or , even more problematically for testing , on no chromosomes at all ) .
The IOC wisely gave up after two more revelations : First , 1930s track and field Polish gold - medalist Stella Walsh ( née Stanisława Walasiewiczówna ) tragically died in a 1980 armed robbery : Autopsy showed some parts of both male and female genitalia , plus both XX and XY chromosomes ( i.e. , mosaicism ) .
( Ironically , Walsh had accused 1936 Olympics competitor Helen Stephens of being male after Stephens edged out Walsh for the gold in the 100 meter dash .
Stephens underwent a sex exam and passed . )
Then , the 1996 Atlanta Summer Games furnished what was probably the final blow against IOC 's testing program : Eight athletes were announced to have failed IOC 's SRY - bloc test :
To IOC 's embarrassment , seven turned out to be androgen - insensitive XY women , and the eighth to have 5 - alpha - steroid reductase deficiency — both of the classic conditions in which XY genes inherently confer absolutely no advantage in sports .
All eight women were permitted to compete .
Sensing a no-win situation , IOC finally about - faced , starting June 1999 ( effective starting at the 2000 Sydney Summer Games ) :
There is no longer a mandate for sex testing ( although Beijing 's local 2008 Olympics committee is testing some female athletes at a local sex testing lab at Peking Union Medical College Hospital , i.e. , those who have been challenged , without IOC imprimatur — and , in fact , against the advice of IOC 's medical commission chairman ) .
( 2012 update : IOC 's Executive Board took another stab at the issue , using somewhat more rational criteria .
Female athletes at the 2012 London Summer Olympics can be challenged to see if ( 1 ) their serum testosterone is elevated to the " male range " , ( 2 ) that androgen elevation is " functional " ( i.e. , not CAIS women who have high serum testosterone but have zero effect from it ) , and ( 3 ) " confers a competitive advantage " .
Those criteria might work , even though the scientific assumption about testosterone being the factor that yields advantage is arguably doubtful . )
( 2016 update : Controversy continues .
IOC has at times made moves towards a new policy , such as dictating a maximum blood - testosterone level for women athletes , but then backed off . )
The Kudzu Vines Start Creeping : Legal Effects and Sex Changes
The dilemma of innocent Olympic athletes helps highlight one sort of problem with " marriage protection " laws , with which anyone can have sympathy — citizens with genetic anomalies but who are n't trying to game the system being shocked to have their marriages to what they thought was the opposite sex suddenly annulled ( or prohibited ) .
All available criteria suffer that fault :
A judicial test defining sex by external genitalia will fail on citizens with ambiguous parts , of various descriptions .
One that defines female as XX and male as XY will fail on any number of genetic anomalies .
One that defines female as " having a womb " ( or ovaries ) will fail on men with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia or androgen - producing tumors , people with cellular mosaicism , women with MRKH , and others .
One that defines male as " having testes " will fail on CAIS women , 5 - alpha - steroid reductase deficiency women , and others .
One that defines male as " having the SRY gene " will fail on CAIS women , on SRY - negative XX males , and others .
One that defines male by hormone levels will fail on CAIS women and others .
One that defines sex by fertility will fail on ( obviously ) the infertile and on women past menopause .
( Do we really want to define the infertile as neuter and forbid them from marrying ?
I hope not . )
3
One that defines a person 's sex as " whichever sex the obstetrician wrote on the birth certificate " will fail on people whose botched sex- assignment surgery is corrected later in life , on people with some of the developmental anomalies cited earlier , and on transsexuals and similar .
( See below . )
There really are no workable tests .
This is n't just a technical problem that has n't been worked out : Remember , the best minds in the International Olympic Committee , aided by the world 's top doctors and scientists , tried to solve it for 31 years , and gave up .
I mentioned first the plight of CAIS women trapped by dumb testing regimes partly because it 's so easy to sympathize .
By contrast , some readers will , for various reasons including socially conservative views , be less sympathetic towards people who voluntarily change sex — either fully via sexual reassignment surgery ( SRS ) , or in sundry other ways taking on traits of the other sex .
Again , I will not touch that contentious subject ( where even the vocabulary is an ideological minefield ) , except to say that , approve or not , it happens , and creates situations with real - world legal effects — effects even more contrary to " marriage protection " proponents ' intentions than the scenarios described earlier .
Consider a pre-operative transsexual XY male who wishes to marry an XX female , and end up living as two married women .
The two first marry — which is lawful per the " marriage protection " law .
Then , the male changes sex : Voila , same - sex marriage .
( The law does not invalidate marriages automatically because of SRS — nor for more depressing reasons such as adultery or wife - beating .
However , if it did , a male wanting to " game the system " could use measures to live as female short of full SRS .
A female could do the reverse .
If the state , by contrast , does n't recognize SRS as changing one 's legal sex , then marriage can lawfully occur either before or after surgery . )
This is n't mere speculation .
Texas 's " marriage protection " law is exactly what let two women , Jessica and Robin Wicks , one a male - to - female transsexual , win their marriage license in San Antonio , Texas :
The women had been previously denied that marriage license as a same - sex couple , but successfully argued that the Texas 4th Court of Appeals 's 1999 " Littleton v. Prange " decision ( Littleton being a widow barred from suing over her husband 's death from medical malfeasance , because she 'd been born male and then had SRS ) guaranteed them the right to marry , based upon their inferred chromosomes — because the judge ruled chromosomes rather than outward sex characteristics to govern which sex Jessica Wicks ( né Grady Roland Wicks ) is .
The Wicks newlyweds ' attorney was quoted as saying he was encouraging other transsexuals to travel to San Antonio to get married .
( Same - sex couples giving public thanks to a " marriage protection " statute and a socially conservative judicial district : the first of many " marriage protection " ironies to come . )
Around the same time , in New Hampshire , another two women , Judi and Mikayla Howden , were in a similar situation : Mikayla started out as Michael , married Judi , and then arrived at the painful decision that he was rightfully a woman and underwent SRS to become Mikayla .
The result ?
A lawful same - sex marriage , despite — and , in fact , courtesy of — New Hampshire 's ban on such things .
An article on the matter cannily points out :
[ SRS ] recognition lets existing , heterosexual marriages like the Howdens ' become same - sex .
Denying recognition permits new same - sex marriages - like one between Judi and Mikayla if they were to marry today - because the spouses ' sexes differ only on paper , not visibly .
Oh dear , oh dear .
" Marriage protection " statutes not only fail to ban same - sex marriage , but also furnish a legal blueprint for its mass - production .
So , What , Then ?
To sum up , " marriage protection " statutes are already a debacle from the standpoint of their own advocates :
Those laws spectacularly fail to advance their objectives — and are in fact a powerful tool for social conservatives ' political and social enemies to create same sex marriages that were impossible without them .
That effect can only get worse , over time .
The only thing they 're particularly good for is breaking up real , existing marriages of those unlucky enough to fail an inevitably arbitrary and unrealistic legal test of one 's sexual identity :
None of those " Which sex are you ? " tests proposed , tried , or likely to emerge fixes the problem .
This honestly is n't supposed to be an advocacy piece , so : Maybe being choked by kudzu is appealing .
It 's ( famously ) hardy , is a lovely shade of green , has delicious edible roots that can be cooked and eaten like potatoes , and has quite pretty purple flowers .
On the other hand , if you , our voters and legislatures , decide you 'd rather not be blanketed by kudzu , then y'all should consider ceasing to plant it .
Just a thought .
Nov. 5 , 2008 addendum :
After a furious electoral battle , whose $ 40 M " yes " campaign was funded mostly by $ 30 M + from out - of - state Mormon ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) and , to a lesser extent , Scientology , church interests , California 's Proposition 8 passed by a very narrow margin .
I trust that the irony of Mormons lobbying to limit marriage to " one man and one woman " will be lost on no one ( even if the concept of " traditional marriage " did n't have numerous ironies including counter - examples within the Christian faith 's most devout segments ) .
June 17 , 2011 addendum :
An increasing number of Federal judges are now ruling the 1996 nationwide " Defense of Marriage Act " , of which Proposition 8 was a direct copy , to be unconstitutional on equal - protection grounds , such as this week 's decision by 20 judges of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California , refusing to dismiss as contrary to DOMA a bankruptcy petition from one of the 22,000 same - sex couples married in California prior to Proposition 8's passage — underlining the point that marriage has no necessary connection to reproduction and child - rearing in the first place , and is discrimination lacking the " rational basis " required ( among other things ) if discrimination is claimed to be lawful .
Failure to meet the rock - bottom " rational basis " standard was one of the many reasons why veteran conservative George W. Bush - appointed Federal District Court judge Vaughn R. Walker threw out Proposition 8 in its entirety in landmark decision Perry v. Schwarzenegger , which devastatingly eviscerated proponents ' arguments ( and should be read by anyone interested in this issue , as his writing is clear and novice - accessible ) .
Judge Walker 's decision for the US District Court for the Northern District of California was ( initially ) stayed pending appeal .
Critically , California 's officials declined to appeal Walker 's decision , so the ballot initiative 's proponents appealed in their place , as ' intervenor - defendants ' .
July 7 , 2011 addendum :
The illustrious Randall Munroe of XKCD fame brought broad public attention to this essay with a laudatory mention on Google +.
Yr. humble author should n't brag , but has always been an avid XKCD fan , so : Woot !
Feb. 7 , 2012 addendum :
A three - judge panel at the Ninth Circuit upheld Walker 's decision on slightly different ( narrower ) grounds than the ones Walker himself applied .
( The case had been redubbed Perry v. Brown , at this point , reflecting changeover in the Governor 's office . )
Proponents ' request to appeal that decision to be reheard by all of the justices en-banc was denied , so proponents attempted appeal to the US Supreme Court .
June 26 , 2013 addendum :
In 2012 , the US Supreme Court agreed to review the case ( re - dubbed once again as Hollingworth v. Perry ) , and on June 26 , 2013 disposed of the case by ruling that the whole case was invalid because Prop.
8 's supporters had lacked legal standing to defend the case at all , and remanding the decision back to the Ninth Circuit with instructions that proponents ' appeal to the Ninth Circuit be dismissed .
Consequently , Judge Walker 's District Court decision voiding Prop. 8 will stand .
Additional litigation may occur to settle whether Walker 's decision applies to everyone or just the two couples who sued ( because it resulted in an injunction ) , but that is likely to be swept aside by the governor and county clerks treating Prop. 8 as dead .
( DOMA 's prohibition of Federal recognition for same - sex marriages was also finally voided , in a companion decision on equal - protection grounds , and holding that the Federal government has no business interfering with states ' laws protecting the fundamental rights of citizens . )
June 28 , 2013 addendum : The Ninth Circuit having moved swiftly to vacate its stay of Justice Walker 's decision , there are happy couples getting married again .
Oct. 21 , 2018 addendum : Showing that some people just refuse to learn , according to a New York Times report , the Trump Administration 's Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) has been circulating ( for about half a year ) a draft memo that would define " sex " for purposes of Federal enforcement of Title IX , Education Amendments
Act of 1972 ( the Federal statute banning discrimination on the basis of sex , in Federally funded education programs ) .
The memo says ( in part ) : " Sex means a person ’s status as male or female based on immutable biological traits identifiable by or before birth ....
[ According to the story , this means genitalia . ]
The sex listed on a person ’s birth certificate , as originally issued , shall constitute definitive proof of a person ’s sex , unless rebutted by reliable genetic evidence . "
As shown by decades of Olympics experience , there is no known criterion based on " reliable genetic evidence " that does n't give rise to absurd and obviously wrong outcomes in a huge number of cases .
The DHS draft memo claims this policy would establish for applicable Federal agencies ( Education , Justice , HHS , and Labor ) a uniform definition of sex as either male or female " on a biological basis that is clear , grounded in science , objective , and administrable " .
However , as we 've already seen , this claim is entirely false , in a very significant number of cases .
Therefore , the proposed policy is , if adopted , likely to create further travesties , not to mention litigation .

1 Note : Sex , not " gender " .
The latter term properly refers to psychological and cultural categories , never to biological ones : Masculine / feminine are examples of gender concepts ; by contrast , male / female are sex categories .
Thus , semi-literate expressions like " same - gender marriage " and " gender testing " are meaningless — except perhaps in reference to such things as who 's wearing trousers .
In the 2010s , many people appear to have started using the word " gender " to mean " what sex ( if any ) you identify as " .
It would be convenient if such a word existed in English .
( After all , how we 're plumbed , i.e. , our sexes , is a personal matter relevant only to those closest to us , and our doctors . )
A language shift to create one may thus be underway .
However , borrowing " gender " for that purpose does have the drawback , for now , of creating confusion given the word 's established meaning .

Yesterday I incidently decided to attend the bi-weekly TWiki release meeting .
Release meetings with TWiki were more than suggested by just the name : over time they became general meetings where the community discussed the state and future of TWiki .
Lucky me , since tonight turned out to be pretty historic : TWiki.net gave the community the finger , and forced a fork .
A short run down for those of you who have n’t been following this blog for that long ( i wrote about it twice already ) :
TWiki is an open - source wiki , a project that was founded about a decade ago by Peter Thoeny .
He forked another product , and built on that to create one of the first ‘ structured wiki ’ platforms .
Over the years ,
Thoeny ’s coding contributions declined in favour of a motivated and skilled group of people that carried the TWiki project to maturity .
About a year ago , Thoeny founded the company TWiki.net .
Initial skepticism turned out to be justified .
TWiki .net decided to forego the community , and force a governance model on the project that met with a lot of resistance from the community .
This resulted in a TWiki community summit in Berlin that Thoeny did not attend , and left Tom Barton ( TWiki. net ceo ) red-eared by taking in the displeased frustration of the community .
So what happened yesterday evening ?
At the beginning of the meeting , at which even Tom Barton ( who normally showed only a passing interest in the community ) showed up , Thoeny introduced a new agenda item : what he dubbed the ‘ TWiki.org relaunch ‘ .
I am still mulling over the finer points and implications of this move .
An important fact is that the entire community content on the twiki.org site is locked down .
Only by signing the ‘ terms of use ’ , one is allowed to contribute again ( or remove earlier contributions ) .
Needless to say , i did not sign those yet .
And I do n’t think I will .
Although the events are sad in one way , it is refreshing to finally see twiki .
net take a definitive stand against the community , making explicit what has been implicit in their behaviour .
The project can now be taken out of limbo .
Most ( if not all ) of the active contributors have jumped ship and gotten on the fork bandwagon .
There ’s a great number of features lined up that people did n’t commit during the governance crisis , for fear of being taken advantage over by TWiki.net .
They have proven again and again that marketing the hard work of community volunteers as their own is not below them .
Obviously , TWiki . net ’s recent action forced the active community to continue the project under another name ( as the TWiki trademark is owned by Thoeny and licensed to TWiki.net ) .
With the active contributors locked out of the TWiki project home site , it is being used as a propaganda platform .
Thoeny has already threatened the community to sue when the fork mentions the T - word in its name or otherwise .
It ’s sad to see the last throws of a dying power - hungry dictator .
It is sad to see TWiki die .
It is sad to see hardware donated to the community by SUN and others being reappropriated by TWiki. net for their own marketing strategies .
But there is hope .
The project is free of its shackles again !
There will be a lot of work getting the new project infra-structure in shape , and it is truly a pity that Thoeny forces the community to this duplication of effort .
On the other hand , there is much room for improvement , improvement that now can be made .
The same goes for the project itself , which will not be known as TWiki anymore .
The next few days will give us the projects new name , and a first release is expected in the very near future .
TWiki is dead , long live TWiki !

Dancing With the Stars co-host Brooke Burke and David Charvet , her longtime partner and fiance , got married last night , according to reports .
The location :
On a boat under the stars off the coast of St. Bart 's , with their kids .
Hard to imagine a more special moment for the couple , both 39 .
" We 're just at that place , where love is deep and meaningful , and we 're feeling very settled , " Brooke said of their relationship earlier this year .
Burke began dating Charvet , who starred on Baywatch and the original Melrose Place , in 2005 .
He proposed to her just one year later , in 2006 .
They are parents to daughter Heaven Rain , 4 , and son Shaya Braven , 3 .
Burke has two daughters , Neriah , 11 , and Sierra , 9 , with ex-husband Garth Fisher .
In an interview with THG earlier this year , Brooke spoke about her " celebrity mom " status and making time for both herself and her relationship with David , despite challenges posed by balancing her career and four kids .
It 's a busy life , but no doubt , it seems like it could n't be going better for her .
Congratulations to the newlyweds and to the entire family !
( CNN ) -- A 53 - cent drop in gas prices over the last two weeks has set another record , and the publisher of a national survey predicted Sunday that prices will continue to decline -- but at a slower pace .
The average price of self - serve , unleaded gas in the United States as of Friday was $ 2.78 a gallon .
The average price of self - serve , unleaded gas in the United States as of Friday was $ 2.78 a gallon , compared to $ 3.31 on October 10 , said Trilby Lundberg , publisher of the nationwide Lundberg Survey .
The 35 - cent price reduction measured on the 10th , which brought the average price to $ 3.31 , was the largest drop in the six - decade history of the survey , she said .
The all - time high average was $ 4.11 , set on July 11 , according to Lundberg , and prices have been dropping ever since .
She attributed the price reductions to crude prices and demand .
" It is those same two factors that will decide what gasoline prices do from here .
I think they will probably keep falling , but more slowly , " Lundberg said .

Money : OPEC may decrease production
The price of crude oil is the more dominant determinant , she said .
Oil Cartel OPEC , the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries , said Friday it would cut production by 1.5 million barrels per day starting in November .
Oil prices have fallen by more than half from $ 147 a barrel in July because of lower demand due to tough economic times , especially in the United States .
On Friday , the price of crude closed at $ 64.15 a barrel , Lundberg said .
" The price of oil does n't seem likely to jump up substantially any time soon and , considering the U.S. economy , it seems likely that oil prices will stay in their current neighborhood , " she said .
The Lundberg Survey is based on responses from more than 5,000 service stations nationwide .
On Friday , Wichita , Kansas , posted the lowest gas price of $ 2.26 a gallon .
The highest prices were in Anchorage , Alaska , $ 3.50 , and Honolulu , $ 3.48 .
Other prices include :
San Francisco , California $ 3.37
Chicago , Illinois $ 3.12
Portland , Oregon $ 2.91
Miami , Florida $ 2.87
Manchester , New Hampshire $ 2.79
Philadelphia , Pennsylvania $ 2.79
Denver , Colorado $ 2.72
Milwaukee , Wisconsin $ 2.65
Atlanta , Georgia $ 2.57
Houston , Texas $ 2.50
Jackson , Mississippi $ 2.46

Purge your mind for a moment about everything you ’ve heard and read in the last decade about investing on Wall Street and think about the following business model :
Until Congress holds serious investigations and hearings , the U.S. taxpayer may be funding little more than Ponzi schemes while companies that provide real products and services , legitimate jobs and contributions to the economy are left to fail .
You take your hard earned retirement savings to a Wall Street firm and they tell you that as long as you " stay invested for the long haul " you can expect double digit annual returns .
You never really know what your money is invested in because it ’s pooled with other investors and comes with incomprehensible but legal looking prospectuses .
The heads of these Wall Street firms have been taking massive payouts for themselves , ranging from $ 160 million to $ 1 billion per CEO over a number of years .
As long as new money keeps flooding in from newfangled accounts called 401 ( k ) s , Roth IRAs , 529 plans for education savings , and hedge funds ( each carrying ever greater restrictions for withdrawing your money and ever greater opacity ) everything appears fine on the surface .
And then , suddenly , you learn that many of these Wall Street firms do n’t have any assets that anybody wants to buy .
Because these firms are both managing your money as well as having their own shares constitute a large percentage of your pooled investments , your funds begin to plummet as confidence drains from the scheme .
Now consider how Wikipedia describes a Ponzi scheme :
“ A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that involves promising or paying abnormally high returns ( ‘ profits ’ ) to investors out of the money paid in by subsequent investors , rather than from net revenues generated by any real business .
It is named after Charles Ponzi… One reason that the scheme initially works so well is that early investors – those who actually got paid the large returns – quite commonly reinvest ( keep ) their money in the scheme ( it does , after all , pay out much better than any alternative investment ) .
Thus those running the scheme do not actually have to pay out very much ( net ) – they simply have to send statements to investors that show how much the investors have earned by keeping the money in what looks like a great place to get a high return .
They also try to minimize withdrawals by offering new plans to investors , often where money is frozen for a longer period of time …
The catch is that at some point one of three things will happen : ( 1 ) the promoters will vanish , taking all the investment money ( less payouts ) with them ; ( 2 ) the scheme will collapse of its own weight , as investment slows and the promoters start having problems paying out the promised returns ( and when they start having problems , the word spreads and more people start asking for their money , similar to a bank run ) ; ( 3 ) the scheme is exposed , because when legal authorities begin examining accounting records of the so - called enterprise they find that many of the ‘ assets ’ that should exist do not . "
Looking at outcomes 1 , 2 , and 3 above , here ’s where we are today .
The promoters have clearly not vanished as in outcome 1 .
In fact , they are behaving as if they know they have nothing to fear .
As over $ 2 trillion of taxpayer money is rapidly infused through Federal Reserve loans and over $ 125 Billion in U.S.
Treasury equity purchases to keep these firms from collapsing , the promoters are standing at the elbow of the President - Elect in press conferences ( Citigroup promoter , Robert Rubin ) ; they are served up as business gurus on the business channel CNBC ( former AIG CEO and promoter , Maurice “ Hank ” Greenberg ) ; they are put in charge of nationalized zombie firms like Fannie Mae ( Herbert Allison , former President of Merrill Lynch ) ; they are paying $ 26 million and $ 42 million , respectively , for new digs at 15 Central Park West in Manhattan , where their chauffeurs have their own waiting room ( Lloyd Blankfein , CEO of Goldman Sachs ; Sanford “ Sandy ” Weill , former CEO of Citigroup , who put his penthouse in the name of his wife ’s trust , perhaps smelling a few pesky questions ahead over the $ 1 billion he sucked out of Citigroup before the Fed had to implant a feeding tube ) .
We are definitely seeing all the signs of outcome 2 : the scheme is collapsing under its own weight ; there are panic runs around the globe wherever Wall Street has left its footprint .
But outcome 3 is the most fascinating area of departure from the classic Ponzi scheme .
Legal authorities have , indeed , examined the books of these firms , except for one area we ’ll discuss later .
They found worthless assets along with debts hidden off the balance sheet instead of real depositor funds .
Instead of arresting the perpetrators and shutting down the schemes , Federal authorities have developed their own new schemes and pumped over $ 2 trillion of taxpayer money into propping up the firms while leaving the schemers in place .
Equally astonishing , Congress has not held any meaningful investigations .
This has left many Wall Street veterans wondering if the problem is n’t that the firms are “ too big to fail ” but rather “ too Ponzi - like to prosecute . ”
Imagine the worldwide reaction to learning that all the claptrap coming from U.S. think - tanks and ivy - league academics over the last decade about efficient market theory and deregulation and trickle down was merely a ruse for a Ponzi scheme now being propped up by a U.S. Treasury Department bailout and loans from our central bank , the Federal Reserve .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Fortunately for American taxpayers , Bloomberg News has some inquiring minds , even if our Congress and prosecutors do n’t .
On May 20 , 2008 , Bloomberg News reporter , Mark Pittman , filed a Freedom of Information Act request ( FOIA ) with the Federal Reserve asking for detailed information relevant to whom the central bank was giving these massive loans and precisely what securities these firms were posting as collateral .
Bloomberg also wanted details on “ contracts with outside entities that show the employees or entities being used to price the Relevant Securities and to conduct the process of lending . ”
Heretofore , our opaque central bank had been mum on all points .
By law , the Federal Reserve had until June 18 , 2008 to answer the FOIA request .
Here ’s what happened instead , according to the Bloomberg lawsuit : On June 19 , 2008 , the Fed invoked its right to extend the response time to July 3 , 2008 .
On July 8 , 2008 , the Fed called Bloomberg News to say it was processing the request .
The Fed rang up Bloomberg again on August 15 , 2008 , wherein Alison Thro , Senior Counsel and another employee , Pam Wilson , informed the business wire service that their request was going to be denied by the end of September 2008 .
No further response of any kind was received , including the denial .
On November 7 , 2008 , Bloomberg News slapped a federal lawsuit on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve , asserting the following :
“ The government documents that Bloomberg seeks are central to understanding and assessing the government ’s response to the most cataclysmic financial crisis in America since the Great Depression .
The effect of that crisis on the American public has been and will continue to be devastating .
Hundreds of corporations are announcing layoffs in response to the crisis , and the economy was the top issue for many Americans in the recent elections .
In response to the crisis , the Fed has vastly expanded its lending programs to private financial institutions .
To obtain access to this public money and to safeguard the taxpayers ’ interests , borrowers are required to post collateral .
Despite the manifest public interest in such matters , however , none of the programs themselves make reference to any public disclosure of the posted collateral or of the Fed ’s methods in valuing it .
Thus , while the taxpayers are the ultimate counterparty for the collateral , they have not been given any information regarding the kind of collateral received , how it was valued , or by whom . ”
As evidence that Bloomberg News is not engaging in hyperbole when it uses the word “ cataclysmic ” in a Federal court filing , consider the following price movements of some of these giant financial institutions .
( All current prices are intraday on November 12 , 2008 ) :
American International Group ( AIG ) : Currently $ 2.16 ; in May 2007 , $ 72.00 Bear Stearns : Absorbed into JPMorganChase to avoid bankruptcy filing ; share price in April 2007 , $ 159 Fannie Mae : Currently 65 cents ; in June 2007 $ 69.00 Freddie Mac : Currently 79 cents ; in May 2007 $ 67.00 Lehman Brothers : Currently 6 cents ; in February 2007 , $ 85.00
What all of the companies in this article have in common is that they were writing secret contracts called Credit Default Swaps ( CDS ) on each other and / or between each other .
These are not the credit default swaps recently disclosed by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation ( DTCC ) .
These are the contracts that still live in darkness and are at the root of why the Wall Street banks wo n’t lend to each other and why their share prices are melting faster than a snow cone in July .
A Credit Default Swap can be used by a bank to hedge against default on loans it has made by buying a type of insurance from another party .
The buyer pays a premium upfront and annually and the seller pays the face amount of the insurance in the event of default .
In the last few years , however , the contracts have been increasingly used to speculate on defaults when the buyer of the CDS has no exposure to the firm or underlying debt instruments .
The CDS contracts outstanding now total somewhere between $ 34 Trillion and $ 54 Trillion , depending on whose data you want to use , and it remains an unregulated market of darkness .
It is also quite likely that none of the firms that agreed to pay the hundreds of billions in insurance , such as AIG , have the money to do so .
It is also quite likely that were these hedges shown to be uncollectible hedges , massive amounts of new capital would be needed by the big Wall Street firms and some would be deemed insolvent .
Until Congress holds serious investigations and hearings , the U.S. taxpayer may be funding little more than Ponzi schemes while companies that provide real products and services , legitimate jobs and contributions to the economy are left to fail .

As our government continues to try and rescue our nation ’s financial markets in an effort to prevent a horrific economic freefall , we hear about one of the most outrageous and heinous uses of taxpayer money yet .
AIG , a company our government deemed necessary of bailing out with federal funds , received an $ 85 Billion loan recently to ward off bankruptcy .
A report comes out that just a few days after receiving access to the taxpayer funded money the company ’s executives were rewarded with a luxury vacation .
Just how “ luxury ” you ask ?
Try almost a half a million dollar getaway …
AIG felt that a $ 440,000 vacation was necessary for its executives to relax and come back recharged for the trek back to respectability .
Oh , you did n’t know that to come back completely refreshed , it requires about $ 23,000 on spa treatments to clear the mind ?
I ’m sorry .
I just assumed it was a natural cost expenditure of a company retreat …
All sarcasm aside , how can anyone in their right mind believe this is an appropriate use of funds when a company has failed , and is failing ?
Of course there are untold counts of other companies leeching cash from their coffers to fund similar pursuits .
I ’m sure they are hidden within the accounting ledger and written off as sales events , customer appreciation , or working retreats .
But , how can a company propped up by taxpayer money be allowed to do something so blatantly wrong ?
The government OWNS 80 % of AIG as it stands right now .
Ownership implies specific rights .
One of those rights includes the ability to fire employees .
Each and every participant and decision maker of this venture should be fired immediately , escorted from their offices , and required to pay back every penny of their misuse of funds .
In my opinion , what they did is a form of embezzlement .
They have appropriated funds from the company for their own personal use and gain .
Did the shareholders ( American citizens at this point ) agree to send these people on their luxury jaunt ?
Would we EVER ?
Of course not …
However , as our lawmakers fume and posture in the halls of Washington , will justice be served ?
Will we see those who have slapped the face of those who have helped them be rewarded with their justified consequences ?
I can only hope so .
AIG has just given a black eye to the companies who truly need federal assistance to survive .
Can people not do what is right even when we are in some of the darkest financial times our generation has ever experienced ?
Is it too much to ask that executives actually come to work and perform their duties without receiving golden parachutes worth millions whether the company survives or fails ?
Is it too much to ask that executives , when running a failing company , “ give up ” their luxury items and take vacations like normal American citizens ?
Or better yet , not take them at all because they ca n’t afford them …
The solution to this problem is complete oversight of taxpayer money being given to these bailed out companies .
Without that , there will be countless millions of dollars wasted , we know that .
Greed can not be fixed even with failure .
When we are shown and faced with this greed , we must take the next step and weed these individuals and groups from within these companies and start anew .
AIG is the one who has been caught .
They have made our lawmakers stand up and take notice because of their blatant disregard for what is right .
Our lawmakers must remove these “ leaders ” and require immediate repayment for their actions .
Any less and they are in a sense , advocating what they have done .
Fire them , fire them now .
This is not a political debate of any kind , this is a human debate .
Do what ’s right because it ’s the right thing to do .
These employees of AIG have shown their true colors of greed and we have been shown why their company was failing in the first place .
Greed eventually consumes and destroys .
AIG is just one simple case .
Their flaunting of greed is astounding .
We can only hope that our lawmakers do what is right and reverse the damage AIG has done .

National Review ’s Rich Lowry actually wrote the following without irony .
A very wise TV executive once told me that the key to TV is projecting through the screen .
It ’s one of the keys to the success of , say , a Bill O’Reilly , who comes through the screen and grabs you by the throat .
Palin too projects through the screen like crazy .
I ’m sure I ’m not the only male in America who , when Palin dropped her first wink , sat up a little straighter on the couch and said , “ Hey , I think she just winked at me . ”
And her smile .
By the end , when she clearly knew she was doing well , it was so sparkling it was almost mesmerizing .
It sent little starbursts through the screen and ricocheting around the living rooms of America .
Everyone ’s mocking Lowry , but I at least partially agree with him .
I described myself as stunned , which is n’t that far from mesmerized .
I had a tremendous amount of difficulty processing any meaning in what she was saying .
Part of the reason for that was that she was speaking extraordinarily quickly and part of it was that she kept making unsignaled changes in direction .
Part of it was because a lot of what she was saying was filler , and basically meaningless .
But another big factor was that I could n’t believe my eyes .
I could n’t believe that she was acting like a beauty contestant , and it stunned me almost insensate .
I could n’t believe that John McCain had allowed this to happen .
I still can’t .
So my sympathy goes out to Rich Lowry .
He ’s now the butt of a joke .
But , for me , those little starbursts in the living room were real .
They came from my frying synapses .

I found a really fascinating and powerful story about the nonviolent path of transforming enemies into friends , in Walter Wink ’s book The Powers That Be .
On a Sunday morning in June 1991 , Cantor Michael Weisser and his wife , June , were unpacking boxes in their new home , when the phone rang .
“ You will be sorry you ever moved into 5810 Randolph St. , Jew boy , ” the voice said , and hung up .
Two days later , the Weissers received a manila packet in the mail .
“ The KKK is watching you , scum , ” read the note .
Inside were pictures of Adolf Hitler , caricatures of Jews with hooked noses , blacks with gorilla heads , and graphic depictions of dead blacks and Jews .
“ The Holohoax was nothing compared to what ’s going to happen to you , ” read one note .
The Weissers called the police , who said it looked like the work of Larry Trapp , the state leader , or “ grand dragon , ” of the Ku Klux Klan .
A Nazi sympathizer , he led a cadre of skinheads and klansmen responsible for terrorizing black , Asian , and Jewish families in Nebraska and nearby Iowa .
“ He ’s dangerous , ” the police warned .
“ We know he makes explosives . ”
Although confined to a wheelchair because of late - stage diabetes , Trapp , forty - four , was a suspect in firebombings of several African Americans ’ homes around Lincoln and was responsible for what he called “ Operation Gooks , ” the March 1991 bombing of the Indochinese Refugee Assistance Center in Omaha .
( He later admitted to these crimes . )
And Trapp was planning to blow up the synagogue where Weisser was the spiritual leader .
Trapp lived alone in a drab efficiency apartment .
On one wall he kept a giant Nazi flag and a double - life - sized picture of Hitler .
Next to these hung his white Ku Klux Klan robe , with its red belt and hood .
He kept assault rifles , pistols and shotguns within instant reach for the moment when one of his enemies might come crashing through his door to kill him .
In the rear was a secret bunker he ’d built for the coming “ race wars . ”
When Trapp launched a white supremacist TV series on a local public access channel — featuring men and women saluting a burning swastika and firing automatic weapons — Michael Weisser was incensed .
He called Trapp ’s KKK hotline and left a message on the answering machine .
“ Larry , ” he said , “ do you know that the very first laws that Hitler ’s Nazi ’s passed were against people like yourself who had no legs or who had physical deformities or physical handicaps ?
Do you realize you would have been among the first to die under Hitler ?
Why do you love the Nazis so much ? ”
Then he hung up .
Weisser continued the calls to the machine .
Then one day Trapp picked up .
“ What the f— do you want ? ! ” he shouted .
“ I just want to talk to you , ” said Weisser .
“ You black ? ” Trapp demanded .
“ Jewish , ” Weisser replied .
“ Stop harassing me , ” said Trapp , who demanded to know why he was calling .
Weisser remembered a suggestion of his wife ’s .
“ Well , I was thinking you might need a hand with something , and I wondered if I could help , ” Weisser ventured .
“ I know you ’re in a wheelchair and I thought maybe I could take you to the grocery store or something . ”
Trapp was too stunned to speak .
Then he cleared his throat .
“ That ’s okay , ” he said .
“ That ’s nice of you , but I ’ve got that covered .
Thanks anyway .
But do n’t call this number anymore . ”
“ I ’ll be in touch , ” Weisser replied .
During a later call , Trapp admitted he was “ rethinking a few things . ”
But then he went back on the radio spewing the same old hatreds .
Furious , Weisser picked up the phone .
“ It ’s clear you ’re not rethinking anything at all ! ” After calling Trapp a “ liar ” and “ hypocrite , ” Weisser demanded an explanation .
In a surprisingly tremulous voice , Trapp said , “ I ’m sorry I did that .
I ’ve been talking like that all my life … I ca n’t help it … I ’ll apologize ! ”
That evening the cantor led his congregation in prayers for the grand dragon .
The next evening , the phone rang at the Weissers ’ home .
“ I want to get out , ” Trapp said , “ but I do n’t know how . ”
The Weissers offered to go over to Trapp ’s that night to “ break bread . ”
Trapp hesitated , then agreed , telling them he lived in apartment number three .
When the Weissers entered Trapp ’s apartment , he burst into tears and tugged off his swastika rings .
Soon all three were crying , then laughing , then hugging .
Trapp resigned from all his racist organizations and wrote apologies to many people he had threatened or abused .
Creative is an intangible .
There are n’t many great creatives in radio .
In branding there are less .
In strategizing there are even less .
Most companies have no BRAND .
The products and services are amazing , the businesses are often brilliant .
There is just nothing for consumers to grab and buckle themselves into .
The web sites are also no influence in creating the brand , brand strategy , ad concept or ads .
iNET creative has dozens of mind traps and hooks .
Duplicitous meanings and meanings left for the listener to decipher or wonder at .
While these traps can get a listener stuck in a thought midstream over two , three , twenty exposures they force acceptance of the message and action .
When they discover the hidden hooks listeners feel like insiders , part of the story and part of the brand .

More than a week after the passage of Proposition 8 , activists opposed to the ban on gay marriage have shifted their protests to new arenas -- using boycotts to target businesses and individuals who contributed to the winning side .
The effect of the boycotts remains unclear .
Merchants said that the overall poor economy made it difficult to tell whether their businesses were declining specifically because of the threats .
But the protests have been highly visible and have drawn strong objections from backers of the initiative .
“ No matter your opinion of Proposition 8 , we should all agree that it is wrong to intimidate and harass churches , businesses and individuals for participating in the democratic process , ” Ron Prentice , of ProtectMarriage.com , said in a statement .
Boycotters were “ unabashedly trampling on the rights of others , ” he said .
Activists behind the boycott effort argue they are simply exercising their political rights .

“ People are determining who their friends are , and who are not their friends , ” said Fred Karger , a Los Angeles resident and retired political consultant .
“ I think people need to be held accountable for their financial support . ”
The activists have pored though campaign contribution databases and then “ outed ” Proposition 8 donors on sites like Facebook.com and craigslist.com .
“ People are going to do what they want , and it ’s in this society where you have campaign reporting that is all public information , ” said Karger .
Some gay rights activists also have gone onto the restaurant website yelp.com , giving bad reviews to eateries linked to the Yes on 8 movement .
“ This one star is for their stance on Prop. 8 , ” one poster wrote of El Coyote Mexican Cafe .
“ Enjoy it . . . .
You deserve it . ”

Hundreds of protesters converged on El Coyote on Beverly Boulevard on Wednesday night , and the picketing got so heated that LAPD officers in riot gear had to be called .
All because Marjorie Christoffersen , a manager there and a daughter of El Coyote ’s owner , had contributed $ 100 to the Yes on 8 campaign .
Christoffersen , who is Mormon , met with protesters Wednesday and at one point broke down in tears , said Arnoldo Archila , another El Coyote manager .
But the activists were not satisfied with her explanation and continued to post protests about her on the Web .
“ She had a chance to make nice and blew it .
I was almost feeling a tiny bit of sympathy for her .
Not no more !! ” wrote one blog poster , who also listed competing Mexican restaurants where diners should go instead of El Coyote .

By Thursday , Christoffersen had left town , said Archila , who said El Coyote employees -- some of whom are gay -- were left staggered by the protests , including more than 50 calls a day criticizing the restaurant .
“ We are all a family , ” Archila said .
“ If this is going to affect the business , its going to affect them .
There are people who have to feed children and pay mortgages . ”
Some activists are now turning their attention to Texas - based Cinemark , one of America ’s largest theater chains , whose chief executive contributed nearly $ 10,000 to Yes on 8 .
A prolonged protest could cause trouble for the Sundance Film Festival , which uses Cinemark screens to show movies during the January event in Park City , Utah .
The state of Utah is a focus of some boycotts because the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , which has its headquarters there , marshaled millions of dollars in contributions from its members for the Yes on 8 campaign .
Advertisement
Brooks Addicott , a spokeswoman for the Sundance Institute , said the festival received about 100 e-mails over the last few week , many of which had the same text , but it appeared that the efforts had peaked .
“ Our position is that we have a festival that is essentially three months away , ” Addicott said .
“ We are committed to having our 25th festival ; it ’s a celebration for us .
We would be incredibly disappointed if people decided not to come because of a boycott . ”
Officials at Cinemark did not return calls for comment .
Gay marriage activists had been targeting some Yes on 8 donors well before the Nov. 4 election .
In July , Karger started the website Californians Against Hate , which lists a “ dishonor roll ” detailing more than 800 donations of $ 5,000 or more to the Yes on 8 campaign .
He said the site was getting 300 to 350 hits a day before the election .
Now , it ’s receiving an average of 7,500 hits daily .
Advertisement
One business affected by the campaign is Lassen ’s , a family - owned chain of nine health food stores throughout California , from Bakersfield to Thousand Oaks .
Lassen ’s owners gave $ 27,500 to the Yes on 8 campaign .
Scott Parvel , general manager of the Ventura store , said the contribution was a “ private donation ” by family members who are Mormon .
But No on 8 supporters listed their stores along with many others on websites , urging a boycott .
Since the election , the stores have received angry calls about Proposition 8 as well as comments from customers .
“ They have a right to their views , but they should take it up with the person who did it , not the people who work here .
. . .
We ’re providing a business , that ’s all we do , ” said Parvel , who has worked for the company since 2001 .
Advertisement
Robert Hoehn was another person who made Karger ’s “ dishonor roll . ”
Hoehn , vice president of the Carlsbad - based Hoehn Motors , gave $ 25,000 of his own money to the Yes on 8 campaign in February .
And he called what followed “ a really , really ugly experience . ”
Hoehn said that most of the campaign against him came before the vote , when he received “ dozens and dozens and dozens ” of phone calls and his Honda dealership was picketed .
Since the proposition passed , he said , he has received a few “ vitriolic messages and phone calls . ”
Next time , he said , he will be “ smarter ” about how he gives such a donation , possibly in a way that does n’t require listing his business .
“ I would n’t not do it because of fear , ” he said .
“ I am not ashamed of it , but it has been a very educational experience . ”
Despite the criticism , activists say they plan to continue applying pressure .
“ It does n’t matter if it ’s the CEO or if it ’s the hostess that greets you at El Coyote .
It really makes no difference , ” said Gerry Moylan , 47 , a Los Angeles Realtor who planned a night of picketing in front of the restaurant Thursday .
Advertisement
“ If I ’m going to eat dinner at El Coyote and part of my money is going to pay the hostess ’ pay and she turns around and uses her pay to promote a proposition that takes away my rights , then I ’m going to stop paying my money to her . ”

Lehman 's Fate Hits Commodities Market
So what 's the connection between economic demand for fuel and the mega - bankruptcy of a venerable Wall Street institution ?
Lehman Brothers ' ( LEH ) commodity contracts are unwinding , for one thing , and the ripple clearly convinced other players to dump oil futures Monday .
Investors who steadily piled into energy as prices rose are looking for excuses , er , signs , of economic weakness so they can bail , says Peter Beutel , who runs an energy risk management firm , Cameron Hanover , in New Canaan , CT .
Oil futures fell $ 5.47 , or 5.4 % , to close Monday afternoon at $ 95.71 per barrel on the NYMEX , the lowest close since Feb. 15 . The Amex Oil Index ( XOI ) dropped more than 8 % and is now near the 52 - week low it set last week .
Shares of oil refiner Sunoco ( SUN ) were especially hard hit , down 20 % to $ 38.18 , given the sorry state of refineries in hurricane - hit Texas .
Last week , senior Weeden & Co. energy analyst Charles Maxwell told Barron 's that oil , today , is worth somewhere between $ 75 and $ 115 , and could reach $ 300 .
Beutel agrees prices could get to $ 300 in the next bull market , but thinks oil will fall back to between $ 69 and $ 79 per barrel in order to properly reflect real fundamentals -- things like global supply shortages , strong demand in emerging markets , global strife cutting off supplies and , of course , bad weather .
Despite all this gloom , Monday 's oil price drop helped some airline stocks breathe a sigh of relief .
Shares of United Airlines parent UAL ( UAUA ) and American Airlines parent AMR ( AMR ) were each up nearly 9 % .
Others including Delta Air Lines ( DAL ) , Northwest Airlines ( NWA ) , Southwest Airlines ( LUV ) and Continental Airlines ( CAL ) were off less than 1 % . - Dimitra DeFotis , Staff Writer , Barron 's Magazine

If you think the problems we create are bad , just wait until you see our solutions .
They may seem inefficient and feckless at times , but your representatives in Washington just want what ’s best for you .
Assuming you ’re a major corporation .
Otherwise , you ’re pretty much screwed .
PERFECT FOR :
The suspicions of many in the iPhone developer community have been confirmed by Google .
A spokesman for the company told CNet yesterday that its latest update to Google Mobile does indeed make use of an undocumented API in order to read the proximity sensor in the iPhone , which allows it activate its voice search function when a user is ready to speak .
The new voice search feature of Google Mobile caught a lot of attention for its interesting ability to activate voice search when appropriate .
You can simply lift the iPhone to you head , as if taking a call , and speak — the iPhone 's proximity sensor lets the app know that it 's time to start taking voice commands .
The only problem is that , as far as anyone knew , there was no official API in the iPhone SDK that allowed access the iPhone 's proximity sensor .
After some digging , Erica Sadun determined that Google was using an undocumented , but not unknown , method to find out when the proximity sensor is activated .
Though Google admits it is using an undocumented API , the spokesman adamantly denied using any private frameworks .
Google took a risk , the same one any developer using undocumented APIs does ; it was hoping that Apple would ( a ) not reject the app for violating the iPhone SDK agreement , and ( b ) not later change the API to access the sensor .
If Apple rescinds its approval or changes the API , it would force Google to change their code or perhaps even change the UI to avoid using the proximity sensor .
And it's not the first time Google has taken a chance in using undocumented APIs .
Analysis of the code for its open - source Chrome browser shows that it specifically calls undocumented APIs in certain versions of Windows in order to provide greater security against malicious websites .
Finding these undocumented APIs actually appears to require some reverse engineering of Windows itself .
Doing so is expressly verboten under the Windows EULA .
However , it 's clear that Google 's goal — greater security than the documented APIs allows — is worth the risk .
Just as with Chrome , there may be an upside to Google Mobile using the undocumented API ; Apple may either document the current API , or make some kind of official API available to developers in an upcoming SDK update .
And the benefits to users are clear : the UI is innovative and intuitive — just the sort of thing Apple was hoping developers would bring to the platform .
Portland talk show host Lars Larson scooped the rest of the Oregon media Thursday by scoring an exclusive 16 - minute interview with Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin .
Of course , Larson is long past his television anchor days and can be counted on by Palin 's handlers to be an exceedingly friendly interview .
If you do n't believe me , here are his first seven questions :
1 . " Do I have to ask you who won the debate last night ? "
2 . " Is your family still glad you took on this job ? "
3 . " What about the attacks on your family ... What does that do to your heart ? "
4 . " Do you think [ Barack Obama ] adequately answered that question " in the debate about his ties to onetime domestic terrorist William Ayers ?
5 . " What scares you the most about the idea of Barack Obama as president ? "
6 . " Do you think Barack Obama has ever held a gun in his hands , and do you think he cares about whether Americans have a right to own guns ? "
7 . " Does that approach to taxes and government make Barack Obama a socialist ? "

Star
Trek ’s time - travel plot is set in motion when a Federation starship , the USS Kelvin , is attacked by a vicious Romulan ( Eric Bana ) desperately seeking one of the film ’s heroes .
From there , the film then brings Kirk and Spock center stage and tracks the origins of their friendship and how they became officers aboard the Enterprise .
In fact , the movie shows how the whole original series crew came together : McCoy ( Karl Urban ) , Uhura ( Zoë Saldana ) , Scotty ( Simon Pegg ) , Sulu ( John Cho ) , and Chekov ( Anton Yelchin ) .
The adventure stretches from Earth to Vulcan , and yes , it does find a way to have Nimoy appearing in scenes with at least one of the actors on our cover – and maybe both .
The storytelling is newbie - friendly , but it slyly assimilates a wide range of Trek arcana , from doomed Captain Pike ( Bruce Greenwood ) to Sulu ’s swordsmanship to classic lines like , “ I have been , and always shall be , your friend . ”
More ambitiously , the movie subversively plays with Trek lore – and those who know it .
The opening sequence , for example , is an emotionally wrenching passage that culminates with a mythic climax sure to leave zealots howling “ Heresy ! ”
But revisionism anxiety is the point .
“ The movie , ” Lindelof says , “ is about the act of changing what you know . ”
” All my smart friends liked Star Trek , ” he says .
” I preferred a more visceral experience . ”
Which is exactly why he accepted Paramount ’s offer in 2005 to develop a new Trek flick ; creatively , he was engaged by the possibility of a Star Trek movie ” that grabbed me the way Star Wars did . ”
That meant a bigger budget and better special effects than any previous
Trek film , plus freedom to reinvent the mythos as needed .
” We have worldwide aspirations and we need to broaden [ Trek ’s ] appeal , ” says Weston [ Brad Weston , Paramount ’s president of production ]
” Doing the half - assed version of this thing was n’t going to work . ”
Entertainment Weekly ’s 8 - page on ‘ “ ” cover story is now online including a very detailed look at the synopsis of the upcoming film .
Other highlights include J.J. Abrams informing audiences that they ’re not ” making a movie for fans of Star Trek , ” but instead are “ making a movie for fans of movies ” .

Karissa and Kristina Shannon can't deny they were arrested earlier this year for battery .
After all , there are police records and stuff .
But Karissa told St. Petersburg police that a coworker 's boyfriend - some dude named Ben - attacked Kristina while they were partying at their coworker 's apartment in January .
Do n't you just hate when that happens ?
The incident report has been uncovered , revealing the following quotes and details related to the Shannon twins ' shady past .
To wit :
" Ben and Kristina started to argue , " Karissa said of the melee .
" Ben was calling Kristina names and making her cry .
Ben hit Kristina .
He then hit her with a beer bottle . "
From there , Karissa added that their coworker , Erica , her boyfriend in the attack , hitting Kristina in the " mouth , head and nose . "
Consequently , Karissa pulled Erica 's hair to get her away from Kristina .
In a tough break , though , , the jolt resulted in the coworker running into a wall and falling over .
Oh , and the entire incident took place after Ben attempted to sell the twins Xanax .
Despite the fracas , the twins had no idea they were in trouble .
When cops told Karissa and Kristina to get " up against the wall and spread 'em , " they assumed it was a typical Saturday night .
Hugh Hefner looks thrilled to be photographed here with new girlfriends Karissa and Kristina Shannon .
Sounds like they 're the type to bring handcuffs to bed .
" Run on limited resources and you 'll be forced to reckon with constraints ... And that 's a good thing .
Constraints drive innovation . " — from Getting Real , by 37 Signals
What 's an entrepreneur ?
It 's someone who , given limited resources and terrible odds , can create something truly great ; when life gives you lemons , build a multi-million dollar company .
Productivity app maker 37 Signals has become as famous for its philosophy as its products : " Less is More " , went the mantra .
From Getting Real , the company 's 2006 manual for the web - dev set : " The answer is less .
Do less than your competitors to beat them ...
Instead of oneupping , try one - downing .
Instead of outdoing , try underdoing . "
Constraints , goes the thesis , unleash creativity : less money , less people , less time ... all these things force creative solutions to problems .
And suddenly startups have less money .
Everyone does .
More About Less
The concept is n't new .
You could quote Frank Lloyd Wright : " ‘ Man built most nobly when limitations were at their greatest . "
Or G. K. Chesterton : " There are no rules of architecture for a castle in the clouds . "
Or Thomas Huxley : " A man ’s worst difficulties begin when he is able to do as he likes . "
( There are dozens of these .
Read more here . )
Alas , when times are good , sticking to your own advice is hard .
37 Signals ignored their own guidance by taking funding in 2006 .
Times are no longer good ; choice is limited ; creativity is key .
Beyond Cloud Castles : What To Do
I 'm looking forward , with anticipation , to a new wave of necessity - driven innovation .
More specifically , to a laser - sharp focus on business models .
Let 's hope to see :
Radically inventive new business models
Reinvention : old business models returning in unexpected places
The next great revenue generator beyond Google 's Adsense / AdWords
Utility over users : a focus on usefulness over scale
This is not an attempt at contrarian positivity in a crisis .
Not at all .
More simply : the money tree has stopped bearing fruit .
Conditions are perfect , then , for entrepreneurship to flourish .

More than twelve million voters have already cast ballots in the presidential contest , according to one estimate , and new data from the Washington Post - ABC News tracking poll shows these voters breaking Democratic by a wide margin .
Among those who said they have already voted at an early voting location or sent in an absentee ballot , Barack Obama picked up 60 percent of the vote in the new poll to John McCain 's 39 percent .
These voters make up 9 percent of " likely " voters in the track .
The senator from Illinois has a similar lead , 58 to 39 percent , among those who plan to vote early but have not yet .
( Those who plan to vote on Election Day also go for Obama , but by a narrower , 51 to 45 percent . )
These early voting numbers are a near mirror - image of those from the last two elections : A paper using the National Annenberg Election Study reports that George W. Bush scored 62 percent of early voters in 2000 and 60 percent of them in 2004 .
A man in the US used a candy cane lawn ornament to fight off a knife - wielding neighbour who had been attacking holiday guests at a Sacramento home .
Police spokesman Sgt Norm Leong said the man used the two - foot - tall plastic ornament to subdue the attacker until officers arrived .
He said the 49 - year - old suspect became intoxicated , went over to a neighbour 's home on Thanksgiving and began waving a kitchen knife at people gathered on the lawn .
He cut several peoples ' clothing before one of them decided to fight back .
Police said the man with the knife was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon .
The guest who took up the candy cane was not arrested because police determined he acted in self - defence .

NASA video clips of the incident , which have been viewed more than 100,000 times on YouTube , show Stefanyshyn - Piper reaching out , but to no avail .
Now , Kevin Fetter , a veteran satellite observer in Brockville , Ontario , has spotted the lost tool bag using his backyard observatory and published a video of it online .
He captured the backpack - sized bag at the exact time it passed over his observatory .
In an email interview , Fetter said his find had little to do with luck and he had planned to capture the tool bag on video as it was " something new in orbit " .
The US military tracks objects in space and releases orbital data about them , allowing star gazers to pinpoint their location .
A satellite tracker tool on the SpaceWeather .com site allows people to determine exactly when objects such as the tool bag are going to be floating over their suburbs .
" Depending on the size of the object and how much light its surface reflects will determine if I can see it , and get it on video , " Fetter said .
Lister Staveley - Smith , professor of physics at the University of Western Australia and vice - president of the Astronomical Society of Australia , said military radars could track objects " much smaller than a tool bag " using equipment similar to the airport radars used to detect planes .
" The radio waves are sent out from a radar , they bounce off the tool bag or satellite and [ then ] they come back to Earth and are detected by a radar [ receiver ] , " he said .
The information allowed astronomers to pinpoint the location of the object to within a few metres from its actual location , he added .
Fetter used a $ 900 Celestron Nexstar 102 SLT telescope fitted with a high - resolution camera , which was in turn connected via a networking cable to his computer .
The set - up allows him to control the telescope from inside his house and record the video directly to his computer .
A detailed outline of Fetter 's equipment and several video clips of his space observations can be found on his website .
" I do n't have any [ professional ] background in astronomy .
Just one night I looked up at the night sky and got hooked on astronomy .
It was many years later that I started satellite observing , " he said .
Staveley - Smith said it was important for NASA to monitor the position of the tool bag as there was a remote chance it could cause damage to the space station .
" As space junk goes it 's quite small but because it 's roughly in the same orbit as the space station itself there 's a chance that it might later on collide with the space station 's solar panels , " he said .
In an interview from the space station with The Associated Press after losing the bag , Stefanyshyn - Piper vowed to triple - check all tethers to avoid another incident .
" We 're definitely not going to do it again .
You 're not going to see us lose another bag , " she said .
COLLEGE STATION , Texas -- Texas A&M University agreed Tuesday to pay $ 2.1 million to settle a lawsuit over the collapse of a bonfire tower that killed 12 people and injured dozens more nearly a decade ago .
The families of four students killed and several of those who were injured sued the university and construction contractors hired to help build the 59 - foot - tall tower of logs that fell apart in November 1999 .
After the collapse , the university prohibited students from building the bonfire on its property -- a tradition for the Texas A&M - Texas football game going back to 1909 .
Since then , the fire has been held off campus by students and alumni .
Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania just accused the campaign of Senator John McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin of flat - out “ lying ” about Senator Barack Obama ’s plan on taxes .
Mr. Obama would cut taxes for the majority of Americans , according to the Tax Policy Center that has examined his proposals , and yet the McCain campaign continues to say that Mr. Obama would raise them .
“ I call on Senator McCain to stop misleading , stop lying , about Senator Obama ’s tax plan , ” Mr. Rendell said in a conference call with reporters .
Politicians rarely accuse each other of lying , preferring euphemisms instead .
Mr. Rendell ’s unusually blunt language is a sign of the anger that Democrats are feeling as they watch the McCain camp distort Mr. Obama ’s proposals ( Factcheck.org says the McCain campaign is engaging in “ a pattern of deceit ” ) and their frustration at being unable to stop it .
Governor Rendell was highlighting the issue in advance of a visit Tuesday to Pennsylvania by Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin .
Mr. Rendell repeated his accusation several times .
He said that most speakers at the Republican convention in St. Paul last week had “ lied ” about Mr. Obama ’s tax plans and that Mr. McCain ’s television ads “ have continued to lie . ”
He said Mr. McCain was using “ the big lie strategy , ” which is to repeat something often enough in hopes that it will stick .
And , he lamented , “ to some extent it has stuck . ”
The McCain campaign had no immediate response to Mr. Rendell ’s characterization , but we ’ll post it as soon as we receive one .
Update : A new Obama television commercial also suggests that the McCain / Palin ticket is “ lying . ”
It says that the two Republicans are not really the mavericks they claim to be .
On the screen at the end are the words “ A Naked Lie , ” attributed to an article in The New Republic , as the announcer asks , “ Politicians lying about their records ? ”
The new ad , combined with Mr. Rendell ’s remarks , suggest a new aggressiveness by the Obama camp in trying to beat back the Republicans ’ message , with the outright assertion that they are lying .
Mr. Rendell hinted at the reason for this approach : the Republican message is gaining some traction .
In Alaska , the image of Sarah Palin has been a constant presence on TV screens , magazine covers , cartoons , and the front page of the newspaper every day since her VP nod .
Shortly after the ticket had been announced , there were yard signs , and bumper stickers .
Then came the “ Super Sarah ” t- shirts with modified Superman logo , and the “ Our Mama Beats Your Obama ” shirts .
Those really started to drive me crazy .
And then the universe said , “ You want something to complain about ?
I ’LL give you something to complain about ! ”
And lo , the pitbull merchandise arrived – buttons , stickers , more t- shirts , and even hockey jerseys , all with lipstick .
I thought I ’d seen it all , including a Super Sarah t- shirt for sale in our local Natural Foods store , merchandised ironically beside the “ petroleum - free ” lip balm display , and just above the reusable shopping bags .
But wait , there ’s more !
This email just came , announcing that I could “ Bring Sarah to [ my ] Kitchen !!! ” ( with 3 , count ’em 3 exclamation points !!!)
Wow !!!
Now available are five designs of …and I quote … ” classy tempered kitchen boards ” for your chopping amusement .
Images are n’t yet available , but two of the five designs just say “ Palin ’ 08 ” , apparently assuming that McCain wo n’t last very long .
Another design makes reference to Palin firing the personal chef , saying “ We cook for ourselves . ”
And , of course , what would a Sarah Palin cutting board be without a handy recipe for moose stew ?
And for the discerning collector , you can visit Wal - Mike ’s roadside store in Trapper Creek , Alaska , and purchase this fine vintage “ Palin for Governor ” frisbee , now worth $ 1500 .
Wake me up when it ’s over .
This directly contradicts the claim made by a top surrogate , former Massachusetts Gov. Jane Swift , last week :
JACKSONVILLE , Fla . ( AP ) — Did Barack Obama really call Sarah Palin a pig , as a John McCain ad leads people to believe ?
" No , " McCain said Monday .
The Republican presidential nominee defended the ad anyway , saying Obama " chooses his words very carefully . "
The implication : Obama was slyly up to something when he said McCain 's call for change in Washington is " lipstick on a pig , " days after Palin made a lipstick joke at the Republican convention .

Last night on Fox Business Network ’s Cavuto , the host took a moment to shred John McCain ’s economic policy , calling it inconsistent , “ cockamamie , ” and “ a mockery . ”
While Cavuto explained that he is against Obama ’s policies , he argued that they are at least consistent , whereas McCain ’s are all over the place :
I am sure I ’m not the only one confused … confused by a man who says he hates government spending , but supports pushing $ 300 billion to bail out folks behind on their mortgage .
You ca n’t say you ’re against earmarks when you ’re earmarking that kind of dough , Senator .
Or adding more than $ 50 billion to a stimulus plan you cannot pay for … all the while blasting your opponent for coming up with programs he can’t pay for .
Frankly , neither of your numbers adds up .
But I ’ve come to see a consistent pattern in Obama’s .
For the life of me , Senator Straight Talk , I see no such straight thing with yours .
That , Cavuto says , is why John McCain is losing .
“ You rail against big government , ” he says , addressing the candidate .
“ Yet continue to push cockamamie spending plans that make a mockery of it . ”
It ’s not exactly an endorsement for Obama , but it ’s certainly some withering fire from a camp that was supposed to be friendly .

“ THE nice thing about a long - haul flight is you ’ve got time to do a lot of different things , ” said Jack Blumenstein , the chief executive of Aircell .
True .
You can read .
You can watch the movie or , on a few airlines , enjoy live satellite television .
You can work , eat , drink or sleep .
And now , thanks to new technology by Aircell , you can get broadband Internet service on your laptop .
But one thing you may not do is use that Internet hookup for VoIP , the voice over Internet protocol services provided by companies like Skype .
In other words , you may not use your newly empowered laptop connection in flight to make a voice phone call , even though the technological capability to do so is there .
Reflecting the continuing battles over cellphone use in other public settings , Aircell and American Airlines  so far the only airline offering Aircell ’s in - flight Internet access , called Gogo  have erected technological barriers to block Skype and similar software programs from enabling voice calls in the insulated environment of the airplane cabin .
American Airlines began offering Gogo last month .
The New York Times has a fascinating piece on some new software that automatically tweaks pictures of human faces to make them more attractive by reducing the concept of facial beauty to simple vector - based algorithms .
The image on the right is a ‘ before and after ’ picture of the software at work , and the researchers have a page for the project with many more examples and the full - text of the academic paper .
The researchers asked participants to rate the attractiveness of a series of faces and they then used software to calculate distances and directions between key facial landmarks .
By combining the attractiveness ratings and the landmark vectors they created a statistical model of which general facial attributes are most attractive .
Their software allows new faces to be subtly altered to more closely approximate the general model of attractiveness .
I ’m fascinated by the fact that software advances are increasingly taking advantage of the quirks of our mind and brain .
The MP3 format is perhaps the most well known , which allows audio files to be compressed because it takes advantage of a psychological effect called auditory masking where , when two sounds of certain frequencies are present , we can only perceive one .
The MP3 encoding algorithm simply scans sound files for times when auditory masking would eliminate the perception of one sound , and then actually eliminates the data from the file , thereby making it smaller .
Another wonderful idea is chroma subsampling used in jpg and digital video compression .
It ’s based on the finding that our visual system is less accurate at pinpointing colour differences than brightness differences .
Chroma subsampling takes advantage of this by storing colour information at a lower resolution than brightness information .
For example , rather than storing separate colour information for every pixel , it will store it for every four .
When we see the image , we often ca n’t tell the difference .
This is particularly true for moving images , and you ’ll notice sometimes when you stop YouTube videos the colours seem to be fuzzy and bleed from where they ’re supposed to be ( have a look at this YouTube still I used on a recent post ) even though you hardly notice this when the video is playing .
These software advances would n’t have happened without the psychology research to find the bugs / features in human perception and it ’s curious to think that these new developments build on both the digital and neural platforms .
What will be most interesting is if software starts to take advantage of cognitive features found only in certain members of the population ( for example , some women have four types of colour receptor in the retina , rather than the usual three ) .
In other words , we might find that some important software advance will only work on some people ( or rather , will be developed with only some people in mind ) , and so these people might be preferentially hired to work with certain applications .
If these applications become particularly high value ( usually due to their use in the military or intelligence services ) , people might starting attempting to engineer themselves or others to have the uncommon attribute .

Open the box for the Cy - Fi and you 'll be surprised at what 's missing .
There 's no CD with an online manual or synchronization software .
There 's no USB chord or instructions in seven languages .
There 's only a wall charger , two mounting clips , the transmitter and the speaker itself .
Stick the transmitter into the bottom of your iPod press play and voilá ; anyone with 20 yards is listening to your playlist .
Even the mounting clip is simple and adjustable to various handlebars .
The clip remains on the bike for future usage while the speaker clips easily on and off .
The transmitter only adds an inch of length and the iPod can be stuffed in your pocket or , in my case , in the front basket of the attractive blond riding alongside on her own beach cruiser .
The speaker itself has buttons for adjusting the volume , play / pause and skipping tracks .
Our lone complaint was the buttons were a bit tough to push while controlling a bike and weaving through tourists .
This is Amy Lumet , the California socialite daughter of filmmaker Sidney Lumet ( and granddaughter of chanteuse Lena Horne ! )
As you might have noted , she is voluptuous !
Three years ago she told the Village Voice she wanted to be in Playboy ; she apparently used to model .
We bring her up today because of some highly unsubstantiated internet rumors that she had an affair with John McCain during the Gulf War while she was married to cancer - stricken conservative pundit P.J. O'Rourke and O'Rourke was on assignment in the Middle East , where John McCain 's wife was coincidentally consuming some of the aircraft carriers worth of Percocet she took to cope with the pain of her loveless marriage .
We might wait for more evidence as to the veracity of such a rumor if the mere existence of Amy Lumet were not so fascinating in itself .
For instance , did you know …
Amy Lumet was briefly of a fixture in Republican Washington social life in the late eighties .
When she started dating O'Rourke , possibly while still in college at some unspecified school in New Hampshire .
They married in late 1990 after living in sin for two and a half years , when O'Rourke was 43 and Lumet was 26 .
Because O'Rourke thought that if he died covering the Gulf War , it " would make everything simpler if we had been married .
It seemed much simpler to be a widow than a girl with a dead boyfriend . "
In 1991 Lumet began working for John McCain in some unspecified capacity .
At which point this would have presumably happened .
By 1992 she was a budding public intellectual herself !
( Other dreams would bud later . )
She wrote about uniting her generation of " Baby Cons " in the National Review .
In an essay that did not appear to make much sense .
In 1992 John McCain 's marriage " of convenience " to Cindy was known to be somewhat less than blissful .
By 1993 the couple had moved to New York and Lumet was a columnist for Seventeen .
So Julia Allison of the Right with the career trajectory , yes ?
Okay , by the end of the year they 'd split up , in part supposedly because O'Rourke hated New York .
Fifteen years later she is married to the son of Gregory Peck .
Sharon Osborne , for what it 's worth , has gone on record as liking the boob job .
And O'Rourke can lavish praise on the Republican presidential candidate in a Weekly Standard essay wherein :
Supposedly the " women 's vote " is . . . well , let 's not go too far with this .
I can speak to John 's honor , duty , valor , patriotism , etc. , but I 'm not sure how well his self - discipline would have fared if he'd been on an aircraft carrier with more than 500 beautiful women sailors the way I was .
At least John likes women , which is more than we can say about Hillary 's attitude toward , for instance , the women in Bill 's life , who at this point may constitute nearly the majority of the " women 's vote . "
Whoa .
So if indeed McCain came between O'Rourke and the jailbait first wife he later admitted he married because it seemed like the " honorable " thing to do , he seems to have graciously forgiven the old guy .
That , too , shows a kind of honor ; if of a starkly different stripe from the sort we commonly associate with the presidential candidate who so famously endured years of torture only to sign up for a few more out of loyalty and honor but can't let go of a two - year - old ethics bill brush - off for long enough to freaking shake his opponent 's hand for more than half a second ?
Sure , John McCain would sooner lose an election than win a war , suspend his campaign than ignore an economic crisis , bomb Iran preemptively than look Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the eye , but it also increasingly seems like he'd sooner hand the reins to Stalin himself than Barack Obama .
You know , just out of principle .
It it hard , I am saying , to imagine that were the roles reversed , John McCain would prove capable of summoning such sentiments for the man who wrecked his marriage as :
Some say John McCain 's character was formed in a North Vietnamese prison .
I say those people should take a gander at what John chose to do — voluntarily .
Being a carrier pilot requires aptitude , intelligence , skill , knowledge , discernment , and courage of a kind rarely found anywhere but in a poem of Homer 's or a half gallon of Dewar 's …
Some people say John McCain is n't conservative enough .
But there 's more to conservatism than low taxes , Jesus , and waterboarding at Gitmo .
Conservatism is also a matter of honor , duty , valor , patriotism , self - discipline , responsibility , good order , respect for our national institutions , reverence for the traditions of civilization , and adherence to the political honesty upon which all principles of democracy are based .
Given what screw - ups we humans are in these respects , conservatism is also a matter of sense of humor .
Heard any good quips lately from Hillary or Barack ?
Ha ha , in fact yes !
Whereas the charitable , self - deprecating and straight - talking funny guy the media romantics fell for is just not there anymore .
He 's angry and distant and standing next to Sarah Palin .
And if this scurrilous rumor has no basis in fact , are n't you glad you learned Amy Lumet existed ?
There may yet prove less to this story than meets the eye .

There 's a new gold rush .
The financial crisis is prompting people to look for safer forms of investment than stocks and shares .
Both international speculators and ordinary Austrians want to get their hands on gold
The interest in gold coins is so great that many of the world 's major mints are struggling to keep up with demand , including the Austrian Mint , which produces the Vienna Philharmonic - one of the best - selling bullion coins worldwide .
Sales of Vienna Philharmonic gold coins have gone up by more than 230 % since last year .
Kerry Tattersall , the director of marketing at the mint , says production has gone into overdrive .
" We are running at present something like three shifts on all of the machines , on the presses , producing both gold and the silver bullion coins .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement " We 've actually got delays in delivering orders in silver .
With gold , we are just about keeping pace , but it is a bit of a struggle . "
In September alone , the mint sold 100,000 ounces in gold coins - in normal times it would take three to four months to sell that much .
Mr Tattersall says people are looking for security .
" We are seeing a lot of panic buying at the moment .
People are losing confidence in the economy - whether that is justified or unjustified is a matter of opinion .
But we are seeing a lot of people looking for a safe haven . "
King 's ransom
In the mint , chunks of gold are melted down in a fiery furnace .
Then a stream of molten metal is formed into a thin strip of gold , out of which the blank coins are cut .
Later the blanks are struck with the design of violins and musical instruments .
The Austrian mint , in the heart of Vienna , was founded more than 800 years ago to make coins out of the silver ransom paid for King Richard the Lionheart , who was taken prisoner in Austria on his way home from the Crusades .
It is a sign of the importance people have attached to precious metals over the centuries .
But there is no such thing as a completely safe investment .
The Vienna Philharmonic is one of the world 's best - selling bullion coins Gold , like all commodities , is vulnerable to fluctuations in price .
Prices tumbled in 1999 when Gordon Brown announced a decision to sell off some of the Bank of England 's gold reserves .
Robert Stoeffele , an analyst at Austria 's Erste Bank , says until recently there was less interest in gold as an investment .
" We forgot the appeal of gold in the last 28 years because we had a bear market in gold .
But within the last few years we have seen a huge fundamental bull market for gold .
" Gold is like a thermometer for the financial markets .
I 'd say we 've got fever , " he said .
Life savings
But rising demand for gold is not just a phenomenon of global finance .
Ordinary Austrians , shocked by the precipitous falls in their own stock market - which was suspended this week for the first time ever - are also looking for a more solid store of wealth .
The shop at the Austrian Mint usually specialises in selling collectors ' coins .
But these days , a number of customers are buying bullion there - in bulk .
I saw one middle - aged couple handing over thousands of euros in cash , in exchange for dozens of 1oz Vienna Philharmonic gold coins .
A little later , a Viennese pensioner took a thick wad of 500 - euro notes out of her handbag , and gave it to the sales assistant .
He sold her a large gold bar , which looked as though it weighed a kilo .
" I have taken one piece of gold , " she told me .
" You see , I am old , and I have earned money all my life and now I have the money in the bank and I am afraid of the financial situation , that it will disappear .
Gold is safe , I think . "

What are these ?
Here ’s a very simple message queue using Python ’s sched module and processing ( available as multiprocessing in Python 2.6 ) .
This lets you asynchronously schedule events to occur at a specific time .
It would be very easy to modify this to process messages with a pool of workers , or use threading instead of processing .
There is one thing I could use lazyweb ’s help with : find places in the code where I need to use a lock or where I am ignoring these guidelines .
Update :
Here ’s a cleaned up version using threads .
" " " Simple message queue .
Messages are scheduled and processed in a single worker process spawned from the main process .
Thus , events are enqueued asynchronously , but processed in a linear fashion . " " " import sched import time from processing import Queue , Process from processing .
queue import Empty def delay_put ( duration , queue , message ) : time.sleep( duration ) queue.put ( message ) queue.close ( ) class Scheduler ( sched.scheduler ) : def __init__ ( self , queue , handler ) : delayfunc = self.make_delay_func(queue , handler ) sched.scheduler.__init__(self , time .time , delayfunc ) def make_delay_func( self , queue , handler ) : def delay ( duration ) : if duration >
0 : # Spawn a process that will sleep , enqueue None , and exit .
Process ( target=delay_put , args=( duration , queue , None ) ) . start ( ) try : message = queue.get ( True , duration + TIMEOUT ) # Block !
except Empty : print " Timed out . " else : if message is not None : # A message was enqueued during the delay .
timestamp = message.get ( ' timestamp ' , time . time ( ) ) priority = message. get ( ' priority ' , 1 ) self .
enterabs ( timestamp , priority , handler , ( message , ) ) return delay def startup ( self ) : print " Starting scheduler ! " def run( self ) : # Schedule the `startup` event to trigger `delayfunc` .
self.
enter(0 , 0 , self.startup , ( ) ) sched.scheduler.run( self ) def handle ( message ) : print " [ %s ] MESSAGE : %s " % ( time.time ( ) , message ) def run_scheduler ( scheduler ) : scheduler.run ( ) print " Scheduler done . " QUEUE = Queue ( ) # Message queue .
Use `enqueue` to add messages .
TIMEOUT = 10 # Seconds for scheduler to wait for items in queue .
SCHEDULER = Scheduler ( QUEUE , handle ) # Message handler scheduler .
PROCESS = None # Process running the scheduler . def enqueue ( message ) : global PROCESS QUEUE.put ( message ) if PROCESS is None or PROCESS.getExitCode ( ) is not None : #
There is no scheduler process running ; start one .
PROCESS = Process( target=run_scheduler , args =( SCHEDULER , ) ) PROCESS.start ( )
Here ’s a usage example :
John McCain hosted an event in Wisconsin today where he touted his support for women ’s rights .
This is just madness .
If we look at this record — the one women can “ count on ” — we see the exact opposite of what McCain vowed .
Adam Jentleson explained , “ In April , McCain opposed a major Senate bill seeking equal pay for women … .
In 2000 , McCain opposed an amendment that aimed to ‘ provide more effective remedies to victims of discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex . ’
In 1985 , McCain voted against a study to investigate pay differences among federal employees , and determine whether they were the result of discrimination . ”
Indeed , after the ridiculous Supreme Court ruling in Ledbetter , McCain “ dismissed the importance of equal pay , saying that women simply need ‘ education and training . ’”
In other words , McCain was campaigning today on women ’s issues , hoping desperately that voters do n’t know anything about his record of women ’s issues .
Once again , McCain is counting on public ignorance to get him through the campaign .
During its approach to the solar system 's innermost planet , NASA 's Messenger probe took this image of a crescent Mercury .

The image is one of a set of 11 taken through different filters to study the colors of the surface .

Gallup Daily is tracking the percentage of registered voters who say they have already voted in this year 's election , either by absentee ballot or early voting opportunities in their state , as well as those who say they plan to vote at some point before Election Day .
Technology can be creepy .
Remember that scene from the 2002 film " Minority Report " ?
John Anderton , played by Tom Cruise , walks through a hallway of digital screens that recognize him and shout advertisements : " John Anderton !
You could use a Guinness right about now . "
Something like that may not be too far off as digital billboards become more popular with advertisers .
Research firm PQ Media predicted today that the market for digital out - of - home media in the U.S. would grow 11.2 % to $ 2.43 billion this year .
Globally , it 's expected to expand 14.5 % from 2007 to 2012 .
That makes digital billboards one of the fastest - growing advertising mediums around .
Companies are jostling to provide ways to make these digital screens even more effective .
That includes TruMedia Technologies , a Florida company with research offices in Israel ( company motto : " Every Face Counts " ) .
TruMedia provides cameras and software for retail locations so the stores can show different on - screen ads depending on the gender and age of the person watching .
The company says it soon will be able to also play different ads based on the race of the person watching .
Dr. Vicki Rabenou , chief measurement officer at TruMedia , presented the technology at the WebbyConnect conference in Dana Point on Friday .
Here 's how she says it works :
A device placed on , say , a supermarket shelf scans the face of the person standing in front of it .
It determines whether the person is a man or a woman and sends that information to a digital screen nearby .
The screen will play an ad for women 's razors if a woman is watching , Jeeps if a man is watching , or Gap if both a man and woman are watching .
" People are not even aware that they are being watched and monitored , " Rabenou said .
The video analytics software to do this was developed for the Israeli homeland security department .
It can determine , by facial clues , the gender and age of the faces it scans .
By next year , the company says , the software will be able to ascertain ethnicity as well .
The device can also track how long people stand in front of a retail display , determining whether the display is clear .
In an Israeli trial , it helped advertisers realize that a lot of men were buying Pampers on Thursday nights , so the company started a promotion that gave free razors to shoppers who bought two packs of Pampers .
Rabenou said sales skyrocketed after the promotion .
" Advertisers will use our systems as a real - life focus group , " she said .
Of course , this may make some people a little concerned about the world turning into " Minority Report . "
Rabenou assured the crowd at WebbyConnect that TruMedia was " fully respectful of audience privacy , " and added that " Big Brother is not watching . "
The company does n't track who specifically is watching the screens or standing in front of the displays , she said , just a person 's gender and , as the technology develops , race and age .
Besides , she said , retailers do n't want to be perceived as spying on their customers , so they 'll be careful how they use the technology .
Still , the parallels with " Minority Report " were n't lost on one audience member , who referenced the movie in a spiel protesting the technology .
" I 'm horrified by what you 're offering , " he said .

BREAKING NEWS !
THERE WILL BE NO ELECTRICITY IF OBAMA IS ELECTED !
Sean Hannity )
Usually Coulter would have been littering our air waves for weeks now , but she has just suddenly appeared .
C&Ler Kevin emails :
Democrats celebrate ( high gas prices ) .
Coulter thinks that " liberals " want us to live like the " Indians " and live in huts and yurts .
And the right wing nutbloggers are trying to say that the MSM has hidden Obama 's January interview from the public , but that 's a lie also as Lee Ward of Wizbang Blue emails me and says :
The interview was publicly released last January - and I wrote about it at that time including an embedded video .
The notion that it was " hidden " and only recently discovered is a bald - faced lie .
And the idea that Obama would try to destroy the coal industry is ludicrous .
By the way , I guess McCain wants to destroy it too .
Hannity 's producers have been pairing her up these last few days as the right is in " smear mode panic " against Obama with former Democratic pollster Pat Caddell for Jimmy Carter .
Pat usually just backs
Hannity whenever there 's a new smear against Obama .
And he 's made a living out of doing just that since 2004 at least .
Who is Pat Caddell ?
Concerned that voting machine breakdowns could cause long lines on Election Day , particularly in minority neighborhoods , several groups filed a lawsuit on Thursday to force Pennsylvania election officials to provide paper ballots when half the machines in a precinct have failed .
The top election official , Secretary of the Commonwealth Pedro A. Cortés , has directed poll workers to provide paper ballots to a precinct only when all of its touch - screen voting machines are broken .
The lawsuit was filed in Philadelphia by the Pennsylvania N.A.A.C.P. ; the Election Reform Network , a nonpartisan group ; and a coalition of individual voters .
It asks a federal judge to declare Mr. Cortés ’s directive unconstitutional on the grounds that it puts an undue burden on residents who may have to wait hours to vote .
Mr. Cortés said that current safeguards should ensure an efficient election and that forcing a change could confuse poll workers who had already been trained .
Apparently the number of undecideds has dropped quite a bit since the two party conventions to about 7 % , but seven percent is still a large enough section of the population to make a huge difference in the upcoming election , so I 've decided to write up a number of reasons why independents and undecided voters should go for Barack Obama and Joe Biden this time around instead of John McCain and Sarah Palin .
Politically I 'm mostly fiscally conservative in that I do n't believe in running a deficit , and that in most cases the government should be smaller .
I do think that universals ( health care , education for example ) should be completely funded though because this increases productivity : not having to worry about health care and being able to go back to school at any time removes a large stumbling block to a nation 's productivity , as without universal health care a person 's or a family 's plans can be disrupted at any time by a chance accident , and without universal education it can take a long time to save up enough to go to or go back to college , and this makes retraining harder than it should be .
If a person has gone to college for four years for example and later on realizes that the labour market is harder than expected and he or she needs another year or two to get the job originally wanted , it 's almost impossible to go back when post - secondary education is so expensive and this person has to pay student loans off , so this will often result in people working below their education , spending years and years just making a little and paying off student loans when all they need is another two or so years in college to get the position they should be working in .
All of this ends up being a burden to the country in the end .
On the other hand , fiscal conservatism is very important , and I do n't think the government should be involved in funding unnecessary areas that regular people and the free market already do on their own : funding cultural events , propping up private companies to keep them from going bankrupt , etc .
My favourite politician from recent times from where I 'm from ( Calgary , Canada ) was Preston Manning , and anyone who knows who he is knows he was a true fiscal conservative : he started a party in the late 1980s based on fiscal responsibility and grassroots democracy , and getting rid of government waste .
His party believed for example that the pensions
MPs received were a waste of taxpayer money because they paid much more than a job in the private sector would , and so party members protested for a number of years by refusing to take any pension whatsoever , calling it a " gold - plated pension plan " .
( Later they merged with another party , the name changed and this policy disappeared . )
They also railed against the unelected Canadian Senate ( it 's still unelected ) and anything else they perceived to be waste .
One Senator for example only came to work some three times or so a year , spending most of his time at his house in sunny Mexico instead .
They called him " Senator Siesta " when they brought the issue to light , embarrassed the ruling government and eventually he was suspended and then resigned .
This is the type of conservatism I like .
So in short , I 'm an independent myself .
If I were American I would be either a Democrat - or Libertarian - leaning one , but would have no problem voting for the GOP if the candidate were the right one .
Now to the main text .
Here are the reasons why independent and undecided voters should vote for Obama this year and not McCain .
Reason # 1 : After selecting VP candidates the McCain - Palin ticket has emerged as the risky option , while Obama - Biden is a safe bet .
The reason for this is quite simple : the role that a president and a vice president plays .
The Obama - Biden ticket is a relatively less experienced candidate backed by an extremely experienced vice president , whereas McCain - Palin is an experienced candidate backed by an unexperienced VP .
In the event of the death of the president the vice president immediately becomes president , and if this were McCain ( who is much older and has a history of health problems ) the country would be heading into a very uncertain period with a sudden President Palin , whereas if it were Obama the U.S. would have a President Biden , which would be no problem given his experience and knowledge of foreign affairs .
Because of this there 's no reason to compare Obama and Palin in terms of experience , because the two positions are very different .
If the two positions were switched and Biden had won the nomination while Barack Obama only got a few thousand votes , it would be irresponsible for Biden to choose Barack Obama as his VP , because Barack Obama would have still been a largely unvetted candidate that would be a step away from the presidency .
Obama has also said that he chose Biden in order to have somebody that would be able to challenge his decisions and point out anything he may miss as a person , whereas McCain definitely has not chosen Palin to get advice from her on foreign affairs or anything else , except perhaps energy policy .
This is also the reason why Palin is generally avoiding hard questions from the media for the time being , because she needs time to brush up on McCain 's positions Obama has also said that he chose Biden in order to have somebody that would be able to challenge his decisions and point out anything he may miss as a person , whereas McCain definitely has not chosen Palin to get advice from her on foreign affairs or anything else , except perhaps energy policy .
This is also the reason why Palin is generally avoiding hard questions from the media for the time being , because she needs time to brush up on McCain 's positions in order to not make a mistake in front of the media .
makes the point a bit better than I could :
The pick is also the first presidential - level decision a candidate has to make .
You learn a lot about the candidate .
And with Obama and McCain , we have two men who have never been executives - just legislators , book - writers and celebrities .
So the decision is the first time we can compare the two men on a presidential decision level .
In Joe Biden , Obama revealed his core temperamental conservatism .
It was a safe choice of someone deeply versed in foreign policy , and with roots that connected to the working class white ethnics he needed .
It was n't flashy ; and was even a little underwhelming ; but it was highly professional .
What we have learned about John McCain from his selection of Sarah Palin is that he is as impulsive and reckless a decision - maker as George W. Bush ... so last week , McCain picked someone he had only met once before .
I repeat : he picked someone he had only met once before .
His vetting chief sat Palin down for a face - to - face interview the Wednesday before last .
It 's very hard to overstate how nutty and irresponsible this is .
Would any corporate chieftain pick a number two on those grounds and not be dismissed by his board for recklessness ?
In short : an Obama - Biden ticket is a stable one , whereas McCain - Palin is a bit of a gamble .
The former gives a relatively clear idea of what the next four years are going to be like ; the latter is a roll of the dice .
This article here makes the point a bit better than I could :
In short : an Obama - Biden ticket is a stable one , whereas McCain - Palin is a bit of a gamble .
The former gives a relatively clear idea of what the next four years are going to be like ; the latter is a roll of the dice .
Reason # 2 : McCain and Palin have recently gone from simple stretching the truth into actual full - out lying .
Stretching the truth is a part of politics , and most everybody does it to a certain extent .
Stretching the truth is actually just an extension of showing a difference between oneself and one 's opponent , and does n't necessarily mean that a politician is dishonest .
An example of stretching the truth on both sides :
* " 100 years in Iraq " - McCain said back in the primaries that he would n't mind if the U.S. were to stay in Iraq for 100 years ... as long as there were no military casualties .
McCain was making a point at the time that if Iraq were to become a country like the present Japan or Korea that there would be no reason to leave the country straight away .
Merely saying " John McCain wants to spend the next 100 years in Iraq " therefore is stretching the truth .
* " Barack Obama is opposed to offshore drilling " - this is stretching the truth because though Obama is generally opposed to offshore drilling , he has left it open as a possibility .
The two examples above are certainly stretching the truth , but they are both based on truth : that Barack Obama plans to leave Iraq faster than McCain does , and McCain is more in favour of offshore drilling than Barack Obama is .
People can figure out the nuances of their positions themselves if they feel so inclined .
It 's perhaps a bit dishonest , but also part and parcel of presenting oneself to the public as the better candidate .
However , recently the McCain - Palin camp has decided to go from stretching the truth into straight - out lying .
This should be offensive to voters .
One example is Palin 's speech where she said the following : Listening to [ Obama ] speak , it 's easy to forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or even a reform , not even in the state senate .
something .
Well , that 's just a lie .
It 's also quite odd that they thought they could get away with a statement like that , since saying that " not a single ( something ) exists " need only be disproven by a single example .
I believe McCain also said in his speech to the convention or on the stump the next day that Barack Obama has never worked with Republicans to pass a bill , and that 's a lie too , as Obama has .
The difference between stretching the truth and telling a lie is that when you hear someone stretching the truth about someone you agree with your first reaction is to think " Well , that 's not what they meant ... " whereas when you hear someone telling a complete lie your reaction is a much simpler " Uh , no .
That 's just wrong . "
In the second case there 's no explanation required except a demonstration that the statement is a lie , whereas the first carries at least a bit of acknowledgment that the statement is based on Reason # 3 : The GOP needs to renew .
A McCain victory would reinforce the idea among the Republican Party that tactics as usual are successful and need to continue .
A loss , however , drives a political party out into the wilderness for a while where they generally nurse their wounds for a bit , regroup , focus on policy and appealing to average voters .
This is one reason why a lot of Republicans were so excited in 1994
This is an especially valid reason because it 's something beyond McCain 's control , even if we were to assume that he is the maverick reformer he claims to be .
Anyone who paid attention to the GOP convention has probably noticed that it was full of cheap attacks on Barack Obama , and very short on policy .
The largest reason for the focus on negative attacks and little policy is because it works ; for the past eight years this has largely been successful , and it has become a habit .
A McCain victory this year would mean a reaffirmation of this policy , and will mean that we will see it again for the next four years as well .
McCain was not even able ( or willing ) to keep the negative attacks out of his own nomination , so there 's little reason to take it on faith that he will suddenly change upon becoming president .
A loss , however , drives a political party out into the wilderness for a while where they generally nurse their wounds for a bit , regroup , focus on policy and appealing to average voters .
This is one reason why a lot of Republicans were so excited in 1994 when they took control of Congress and the Senate , because they had done well in promoting their ideas to average voters , and this resulted in Bill Clinton 's declaration of " the era of big government is over " , a shrinking of government and pretty good financial policy for the next few years .
The GOP of 2008 bears almost no resemblance to the GOP of 1994 , and I think both Democrats and Republicans would like to see it return to a party like the one it was 14 years ago .
To do that , however , they need to lose this year .
By the way , there 's one other related danger here if McCain wins .
The Democrats went with John Kerry as their candidate in 2004 based on the idea that military and electability would be the way to go , and that did n't work .
This year they 're going with Barack Obama who is campaigning on the idea of change in Washington .
Well , if military service and electability does n't work , and change and grassroots organization does n't work , the party may come to conclude that the hard , cold reality is that the only way to win in an election is to be as negative as possible , to focus on character alone ( building up the character of one 's own candidate , knocking down the character of the other ) , and avoid issues .
A McCain victory could end up bringing about an even more negative campaign in 2012 from both parties as a result of this .
Reason # 4 : Neither party has a monopoly on energy policy , and energy independence comes about from average citizens and municipalities as much as the federal government .
The other thing to note here is that energy independence really has as much to do with average people and grassroots activity as with government .
This is the point that Barack Obama made when he talked about proper tire pressure that was lost in a flurry of media attention and negative ads : that the government can actually do a lot simply by drawing attention to what the average individual should do .
This includes proper tire pressure , simply removing junk from your car ( = extra weight , more fuel ) , car pooling , buying a bike , all that .
For example , proper tire pressure alone has
The Bush Administration estimates that expanded offshore drilling could increase oil production by 200,000 bbl. per day by 2030 .
We use about 20 million bbl .
per day , so that would meet about 1 % of our demand two decades from now .
Meanwhile , efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 % , and regular maintenance can add another 4 % .
Many drivers already follow their advice , but if everyone did , we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points .
In other words : Obama is right .
Most pollution is emitted from cities as well , so it 's actually municipal government upon which should be exerted the most pressure .
Take a look at
There has been a lot of talk about energy lately thanks to high oil prices and terrorism , and both parties are giving it a lot of attention as well .
The Democratic and the Republican parties have somewhat different attitudes on how best to achieve energy independence , but the good thing is that both of them seem to be willing to take up parts of the other party 's platform if it would be good for the country .
Obama has said he would be willing to look into nuclear power and limited offshore drilling ; the GOP has said it would invest in alternative energy .
The truth of the matter is that a solution for energy independence will take a comprehensive plan , and either party will have to use part of the other party 's platform if they are serious .
The other thing to note here is that energy independence really has as much to do with average people and grassroots activity as with government .

The reason for this is quite simple : the role that a president and a vice president plays .
The Obama - Biden ticket is a relatively less experienced candidate backed by an extremely experienced vice president , whereas McCain - Palin is an experienced candidate backed by an unexperienced VP .
In the event of the death of the president the vice president immediately becomes president , and if this were McCain ( who is much older and has a history of health problems ) the country would be heading into a very uncertain period with a sudden President Palin , whereas if it were Obama the U.S. would have a President Biden , which would be no problem given his experience and knowledge of foreign affairs .
Because of this there 's no reason to compare Obama and Palin in terms of experience , because the two positions are very different .
If the two positions were switched and Biden had won the nomination while Barack Obama only got a few thousand votes , it would be irresponsible for Biden to choose Barack Obama as his VP , because Barack Obama would have still been a largely unvetted candidate that would be a step away from the presidency .
A bit on my political views in case anyone is curious ( skip down two paragraphs or so to the main text if it 's irrelevant ) :
The reason I 've chosen to write this is because there seems to be way too much attention paid to individual events and tiny one - day stories .
That 's fine for keeping track of the horse race of the election and it's very addictive to watch , but there 's a bit of a lack of articles with the focus on the election as a whole , what the candidates are like , and what they would be like as president .
I think it 's possible that a large number of people are still undecided because it's so hard to find information presented in a manner that does n't turn off voters that are n't already convinced - negative personal attacks and information that has nothing to do with how the country will be run after 2009 .
If you fix the cities , do you fix the problem ?
With 50 percent of the entire human race currently living in cities and responsible for emitting up to 80 percent of all global carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions every year , they certainly do n't seem a bad place to start .
Reason # 5 : Passive - aggressive sarcasm , too much focus on character and little on issues from the McCain camp is a warning sign on what the next four years would be like .
" I guess a small - town mayor is sort of like a community organizer , except that you have actual responsibilities "
Reason # 6 : The fight against terrorism .
winning hearts and minds
The late Tim Russert : Would you pledge to the American people that Iran would not build a nuclear bomb on your watch ?
Joe Biden : I would pledge to keep us safe .
If you told me , Tim , and this is not , this is complicated stuff .
We talk about this in isolation .
The fact of the matter is that the Iranians may get 2.6 kilograms of highly enriched uranium .
The Pakistanis have hundreds , thousands of kilograms of highly enriched uranium .
If by attacking Iran to stop them from getting 2.6 kilograms of highly enriched uranium the government of Pakistan falls , who has missiles already deployed , with nuclear weapons on them that can already reach Israel , already reach India , then that 's a bad bargain .
Presidents make wise decisions informed not by a vacuum in which they operate , ( but ) by the situation they find themselves in the world .
I will do all in my power to stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons , but I will never take my eye off the ball .
What is the greatest threat to the United States of America ?
2.6 kilograms of highly enriched uranium in Tehran , or an out - of - control Pakistan ?
It 's not close .
After going mano - a- mano with Obama on television , I am also persuaded that he is a sincere guy — that he wants the best for all Americans .
He 's an ideologue , but not a blind one .
He understands that his story is incredible , and , I have come to believe , he is grateful to the American system for allowing it happen .
Reason # 7 : An Obama presidency would have a positive influence on democracy around the world .
He became famous for making extremely bizzare claims , such as that he had the IQ of 430 , or that he possessed supernatural powers and can teleport or heal the sick with his power .
In addition , he claimed that he was a secret adviser of South Korea 's former military ruler , president Park Chung Hee and said that he would like to marry Park Geun Hye , his daughter .
He was recently accused of defrauding his party members and defaming Park Geun Hye .
During the elections ,
Huh had spread a photo of himself , allegedly taken with U.S. President George W. Bush .
The photo was later proven to be doctored .
So in fact , energy independence is something that needs to be done on the personal and municipal level , and the federal government can help out as well .
Energy independence is possible only if average citizens are willing to make an effort .
The federal government can help out through national programs and raising national awareness ( imagine the president holding a press conference every week instructing people what to do to reduce their energy consumption , a tactic that costs nothing and ends up being an important part of an overall plan ) .
On this issue then the two parties are actually not that relevant .
Energy independence is n't something that the federal government alone is going to bring about .
The former characteristic is unpresidential and wears thin very quickly ( Palin's ) , the latter is a bluff disguising a lack of real planning .
How far can you go on sarcasm and appeals to character ?
It may look good over a four - day convention , but imagine this going on for the next four years , a sarcastic and spiteful vice - president and a president who believes that one 's own character and a gut instinct is enough to get the country through just about anything .
Be vary wary when you see this coming from a candidate .
Note : McCain 's speech at the Republican National Convention also contained twice the number of personal references as Obama 's did .
This constant focus on his own personal story and interpretation of the world is another red flag .
The fight against terrorism is a complex and multi-pronged one , and needs to be resolved through both military strength as well as intelligence gathering and cultural influence .
Even the Bush administration anknowledges this with their " " tactic , so it 's not any sort of limp - wristed liberal idea that terrorism is fought through diplomatic might as well as military .
Joe Biden made the very good point during a Democratic primary debate ( video here , go about 1:44 in ) about how decisions on national security are not made in a vacuum :
The United States needs an administration that understands the complexities involved in the fight against terrorism .
The argument could be made that McCain understands these as well after all his years of experience , but remember the first point about how a McCain administration includes an inexperienced VP to take power should anything happen to the President ( and the VP takes control in the event of a surgery as well , not just death , so it 's very realistic that we could see Palin taking over for a week or two ) , and also an Obama - Biden administration would be no pushover in terms of terrorism and foreign policy , so here as well the safe choice is Obama - Biden .
Also , even Bill O'Reilly is convinced that Obama is tough on foreign policy :
This reason does n't have so much to do with Obama being half black , so much as the fact that he was an unknown until 2004 and has been able to get to this point in so short a time .
To give one example of how this positive influence would work , let 's take South Korea where I live .
The last presidential election ( 2007 ) was one of the least inspiring presidential elections the country has ever witnesed , ten old men ( or was it twelve ? ) that were n't able to excite voters at all , resulting in the lowest voter turnout ever .
The person that won was the former mayor of Seoul and a bit of a Mitt Romney - type businessman , the guy in second was all about labour and unions , the rest were boring , and one was just hilarious
Reason # 8 : Admit it , you 'd find Barack Obama being elected far more interesting than John McCain .
The stark contrast between the whiz - bang Clinton years and the dreary Bush years is familiar because it is so recent .
But while it is extreme , it is not atypical .
Data for the whole period from 1948 to 2007 , during which Republicans occupied the White House for 34 years and Democrats for 26 , show average annual growth of real gross national product of 1.64 percent per capita under Republican presidents versus 2.78 percent under Democrats .
That 1.14 - point difference , if maintained for eight years , would yield 9.33 percent more income per person , which is a lot more than almost anyone can expect from a tax cut .
He also planned to give everybody in the country that got married a huge sum of money ( I think it was something like $ 200,000 ) and wanted to move the UN ( yes , the whole UN ) to the Panmunjeom , which is the militarized border between North and South Korea .
So that 's the state of democracy here in South Korea .
There are also physical fights in the National Assembly ( the House ) , and there 's an even stronger revulsion for politicians here than in North America .
Japan is pretty dry and boring too , and so are a lot of countries .
A McCain presidency would further cement the notion that one becomes president by spending decades in government and compromising one 's views to suit one 's base until finally the chance comes .
An Obama presidency would show the opposite , that a person with enough intelligence , ambition and a message that appeals to the average person can become president if the people make it happen , and I suspect this would make the difference in a lot of countries in convincing some really good potential candidates to make a go for it as well , people that perhaps never would have thought it possible before .
Okay , maybe this is n't the most persuasive reason for some , but I see a lot more of the United States in a person like Barack Obama than John McCain , because the United States is a country that is willing to go with candidates like Ronald Reagon ( the former actor ) , Jesse Ventura ( the former wrestler ) , and Arnold Schwarzenegger ( the Austrian former bodybuilder and actor ) .
On the other hand , John McCain 's story as the son of an admiral that was in the military and eventually became a politican is actually a pretty common one , and can be found in just about every country around the world .
The other three above and Barack Obama , however , are candidates that just would n't happen in a lot of countries , but can happen in the United States .
So those are some of the main reasons I believe independent and undecided voters should go for Barack Obama instead of John McCain this November 4th .
Here 's hoping that enough voters on election day will avoid the personality - centrism and uncertainty of a McCain - Palin ticket and instead cast a vote for the stability and long - term vision that the Obama - Biden ticket represents .
Oh , and by the way ( last point , I promise ) , the economy over the past 50 years has grown faster under a Democratic administration than a Republican one .
Keep that in mind as well when making the choice .
Game Of Life in 3 Lines of Code
Seeing Jop Wielens ' implementation of Conway 's Game of Life I wondered if I might be able to figure out a way how to run the whole game entirely with Flash 's bitmapData methods .
It turns out that it works , and it even works pretty fast .
And at its core it just needs 3 lines of code :
calculationMap.applyFilter ( gameMap , rect , origin , neighbourBlur ) ; calculationMap.draw ( gameMap , null , colorAdd , " add " ) ; gameMap.paletteMap ( calculationMap , rect , origin , zero , zero , rules ) ;
Of course a few objects have to get initialized once , but then it 's really just these 3 lines that do all the work .

The Financial Times reports that the freeze on depositor withdrawals at Russian bank Globex is leading to high levels of withdrawals at other Russian banks , which does n’t qualify as being a run ….. yet .
From the Financial Times ( hat tip reader Michael ) :
Globex on Wednesday banned depositors from withdrawing their money as confidence in the Russian banking system began to show signs of evaporating .
Globex , a mid-sized retail bank with assets of $ 4bn ( €2.95bn , £ 2.32bn ) , is the first Russian bank to experience a run on deposits during the crisis .
It lost 13 per cent of its deposits last month , according to Maxim Raskosnov , an analyst at Renaissance capital , and a further 15 per cent this month according to Emilya Alieva , Globex ’s vice - president .
At least a dozen other Russian banks have reported a sharp rise in withdrawals and account closures .
An economist with a leading western bank in Moscow said Globex was probably the first in what could be a number of bank panics , if the government did not take concerted action soon .
“ I think there are a large number of small and medium sized banks that are in the same situation , ” she said .
Despite a Kremlin promise of $ 200bn in relief funds – $ 87bn this week – the fall - out of a stock market plunge and the global credit crunch appears to be worse than anticipated , analysts say .
So far , the crunch has not affected the living standards of ordinary Russians , but a rash of bank failures could .
Banks across Russia have faced a rise in outflows as depositors have begun to lose trust in all but the biggest state banks , VTB and Sberbank , which have received most of the government ’s liquidity support .
Tatyana Sadovskaya , the director of a branch of Khnati Mansisk Bank in the city of Nizhnevartovsk , on Wednesday told Interfax news agency that in response to rumours of her bank ’s insolvency : “ People have formed long lines at cashiers and at bankomats , people are taking their deposits and closing their accounts . ”

Michael 's Dispatches Success in Iraq
Details Published : Monday , 14 July 2008 17:16
14 July 2008
The war continues to abate in Iraq .
Violence is still present , but , of course , Iraq was a relatively violent place long before Coalition forces moved in .
I would go so far as to say that barring any major and unexpected developments ( like an Israeli air strike on Iran and the retaliations that would follow ) , a fair - minded person could say with reasonable certainty that the war has ended .
A new and better nation is growing legs .
What 's left is messy politics that likely will be punctuated by low - level violence and the occasional spectacular attack .
Yet , the will of the Iraqi people has changed , and the Iraqi military has dramatically improved , so those spectacular attacks are diminishing along with the regular violence .
Now it 's time to rebuild the country , and create a pluralistic , stable and peaceful Iraq .
That will be long , hard work .
But by my estimation , the Iraq War is over .
We won .
Which means the Iraqi people won .
I wish I could say the same for Afghanistan .
But that war we clearly are losing : I am preparing to go there and see the situation for myself .
My friends and contacts who have a good understanding of Afghanistan are , to a man , pessimistic about the current situation .
Interestingly , however , every one of them believes that Afghanistan can be turned into a success .
They all say we need to change our approach , but in the long - term Afghanistan can stand on its own .
The sources range from four - stars to civilians from the United States , Great Britain and other places .
A couple years ago , some of these sources believed that defeat was imminent in Iraq .
They were nearly right about Iraq , although some of them knew far less about Iraq than they do about Afghanistan .
But it 's clear that hard days are ahead in Afghanistan .
We just lost nine of our soldiers in a single firefight , where the enemy entered a base and nearly overran it .
The news from Afghanistan is reason for pessimism .
For some more optimistic news , please look at these statistics from Iraq , and remember that if we could turn things around in that country , we might be able to do the same in Afghanistan .

Row at holy shrine in Jerusalem sees police having to break up mass brawl between two sets of Christian monks
Ever seen a holy war close up ?
Take a look at this bizarre video of a brawl between Armenian and Greek Orthodox monks in what is supposed to be one of Christianity 's most sacred places .
The monks take the bible 's exhortation to " fight the good fight " all too literally .
As shocked worshippers look on in horror , the monks kick and punch each other , knocking down tapestries and decorations .
One or two of the monks seem to have a handy right hook .
The fight took place in Jerusalem 's Church of the Holy Sepulchre , which Christians believe marks the site of Jesus ' crucifixion , burial and resurrection .
The Greeks say the Armenians interfered with their right to access a particular part of the church , while the Armenians accuse the Greeks of disrupting their celebrations of the 4th century discovery of the cross believed to have been used to crucify Jesus .
But the reasons for the brawl hardly matter – it's an extraordinary sight which becomes even more chaotic as the Israeli police intervene to try to break up the fight .
Two monks , one from each side , were detained .
An Israeli version of the film posted on Youtube has already attracted more than 10,000 hits – plus the holy war degenerates even further , with Christian commentators accusing the Israelis of exacerbating the divisions between Armenians and Greeks by posting the video on the site .
Expert Says Solar Energy Can Meet All World ’s Energy Demands
September 8th , 2008 by Joshua S Hill
When it really comes down to it , you have to wonder why someone has n’t come out with this sort of declaration before now .
I mean , there ’s a giant flaming ball of gas in our skies 50 % of the time , and we have the technology to turn it into energy .
So it really comes as no surprise that Daniel Lincot , the chairman of the five - day European Photovoltaic Solar Energy conference held in Valencia which wrapped up this past Friday , has made it known that he believes solar power has the potential to meet the planets entire energy demands .
“ The solar energy resource is enormous , and distributed all over the world , in all countries and also oceans , ” said Lincot .
“ There is thus an enormous resource available from photovoltaics , which can be used everywhere , and can in principle cover all the world energy demand from a renewable , safe and clean source . ”
In his spare time not chairing an industry gathering , Lincot is the research director of the Paris - based Institute for Research and Development of Photovoltaic Energy .
Lincot also noted that , at the moment , solar energy has only made a “ negligible ” contribution to total energy supply .
Apparently , for the year 2007 , the total surface area covered by photovoltaic solar panels was only 40 square kilometers .
Compare this to the fact that a country like France or Germany would need 5,000 square kilometers , and you can see how far behind we really are .
The gathering in Valenica was attended by more than 3,500 experts and 715 sector firms , billing itself as the largest photovoltaic conversion of solar energy conference ever .

He has a multifaceted approach that would give banks a choice .
Under the first option , the government would strictly regulate compensation formulas .
Under the second , banks could pay their executives whatever they like  provided the banks set aside more capital .
In other words , banks that cling to their free - wheeling ways would have to pay some sort of price .
For Mr. Rajan , this is an either - or proposition .
If banks pursue current compensation policies  what might be described as the “ no - responsibility ” system , given the trouble we ’re in  that ’s fine .
But if that happens , “ the government should levy more capital requirements against the bank , ” he said .
Requiring banks to have higher capital requirements would reduce the risk that executives will make stupid decisions that imperil the firm and , possibly , the nation ’s financial health .
How much extra capital ?
That depends .
If banks spread out executives ’ pay over , say , four years , giving their executives an incentive to make smart decisions for the long haul , the banks would be allowed to set aside a bit less additional capital .
Ditto if they included claw - back provisions and required executives to reinvest a substantial portion of their income in their companies so they had some skin in the game .
“ We need to make people a little more worried about the future , ” Mr. Rajan said .
The way things are now , executives are encouraged to take big risks because they get paid based on the immediate fees generated .
They have little incentive to worry about what might happen to the balance sheet later .
Mr. Rajan said he was unimpressed by efforts to pay executives partially in stock .
Owning shares in the entire company does n’t tie bankers ’ compensation directly to the decisions they make within their own units .
“ Stock compensation does n’t do it because it ’s too broad , ” he said .
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Contact : media@dcaclu.org
WASHINGTON - The American Civil Liberties Union today denounced a classified FBI intelligence memorandum , obtained by the New York Times , which gives police detailed instructions on how to target and monitor lawful political demonstrations under the rubric of fighting terrorism .
" " Attorney General Ashcroft has dismissed critics of the Justice Department 's tactics as ' hysterical ' and has even said that such criticism aids the terrorists , " " said Anthony D. Romero , ACLU Executive Director .
" " But this bulletin confirms that the federal government is targeting innocent Americans engaged in nothing more than lawful protest and dissent .
The American people deserve an explanation for what is clearly a return to the days of J. Edgar Hoover 's spying tactics . " "
According to a front - page story in today 's New York Times , the memorandum was circulated last month to local law enforcement agencies around the country in advance of mass marches and rallies in Washington , DC and San Francisco against the U.S. occupation in Iraq .
The memorandum , the Times reports , details how protesters have sometimes used " " training camps " " to rehearse for demonstrations , the Internet to raise money and gas masks to defend against tear gas .
It describes lawful activities like recruiting demonstrators , as well as illegal activities like using fake documentation to get into a secured site .
" " It is troubling that the FBI is advocating spying on peaceful protesters , but even protesters who engage in civil disobedience or other disruptive acts should not be treated like potential terrorists , " " Romero said .
Of particular concern is one section warning law enforcement about protesters ' use of videotaping as an " " intimidation " " technique .
Most mainstream demonstrators often use videotape during protests to document law enforcement activity and , more importantly , deter police from acting outside the law .
Citing no specific intelligence of suspected unlawful activity by the protesters , the memorandum describes , in detail , protest tactics and strategies that should be tracked by law enforcement officials including the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces ( JTTF ) .
While saying that the FBI possesses no information about any planned unlawful activity , the bulletin urges local law enforcement " " to be alert to these possible indicators of protest activity and report any potentially illegal acts " " to federal authorities .
Importantly , the ACLU said that it had already seen proof that peaceful activities were being monitored by the JTTF .
Documents recently obtained by the ACLU of Colorado as part of its " " Spy Files " " lawsuit against Denver police confirmed that the local JTTF has been collecting information about peaceful protest activities that have nothing to do with terrorism or any other criminal activity .
News of the classified bulletin also comes on the heels of an ACLU lawsuit against the Secret Service for the continuing practice of allowing pro-Bush protesters to remain visible to cameras during presidential appearances , and corralling anti-Bush protesters into pens or designated areas far from the media .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A group of 16 leading telecoms and IT companies is uniting to promote mobile broadband in a marketing initiative worth more than $ 1 billion over the next year under the auspices of the GSM Association .
The companies -- which include Vodafone , Microsoft and Asustek -- aim to make it simpler for consumers to identify laptops that have built - in access to the Internet via high - speed , next - generation HSPA and LTE networks .
According to research commissioned by the GSMA and Microsoft and carried out by Pyramid Research , there is demand for $ 50 billion worth of such notebooks this year .
“ We definitely expect to see several hundred thousand in the shops by Christmas time , ” Mike O’Hara , the GSMA ’s chief marketing officer , told Reuters by telephone .
The group said the move also could pave the way to connect devices from MP3 music players to refrigerators and cars to the Internet in future .
The partners will label laptop computers that meet their standards for mobile broadband access with a new service mark that identifies laptops ready for mobile broadband connection “ out of the box . ”
Many in the telecoms and computer industries believe that most people in the world will have their first and perhaps only experience of the Internet via a mobile device .
“ While there will always be a place for WiFi connectivity , the great benefit of mobile broadband might be that it liberates the user from the spatial tyranny of the so - called ‘ hotspot , ’ ” Shiv K. Bakhshi , director of mobility research at IT research firm IDC , said in a GSMA statement released on Tuesday .
The other partners in the initiative are 3 , a unit Hutchison Whampoa Ltd Dell , ECS , Ericsson , Gemalto , Lenovo , Orange , a unit of France Telecom SA , Qualcomm , Telefonica Europe , T - Mobile and Toshiba .
General Ward said it was a " myth " to think the US wanted big bases
The head of the new US military command for Africa ( Africom ) has told the BBC it has " no hidden agenda " .
General William
Ward said the command would not be used to gain control of African natural resources such as oil .
He also dismissed fears that the US intended to build large military bases on the continent .
Only one country , Liberia , has offered to host Africom , which is coming into full operation at its headquarters in the German city of Stuttgart .
General Ward said the location of the headquarters , for its 1,300 military and civilian personnel , was less of a concern , given the size of the African continent .
We will do those things in partnership with our African friends
General William Ward
US Africa command battles sceptics
Your views :
An ulterior motive ?
Send us your comments
The BBC's Adam Mynott says the creation of Africom is a recognition by the US that Africa and security issues on the continent are now a priority .
It reflects concerns about tackling Islamist extremism , securing oil supplies , and countering Chinese influence in Africa , he says .
But its creation has been met with considerable scepticism , our correspondent says .
However General Ward said Africom did not intend to help the US get control of more of Africa 's oil and other resources .
" There is no hidden agenda .
It is about working with the African nations to help them build their capacity , " the general told the BBC's World Today programme .
He said it was a " myth " and " absolutely not the case " that the command was going to build big bases in Africa .
" We will do those things in partnership with our African friends , " he said .
" Where we bring in , for instance , trainers or other forms of military support and assistance there , they are only so long as is required to conduct the specific training that we 've been asked to do or to conduct the specific activities . "

This story about Norm Coleman ’s refusal to answer a very basic question about whether a donor bought suits for him is getting more bizarre by the day — and getting more attention .
It ’s not a hard question .
We first wrote about this on Monday .
The fact that it ’s still an issue says that something is very wrong at the Coleman campaign :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VySnpLoaUrI]
Norm Coleman is smarmy .
I ’ve despised the guy since the 2002 election when he won the seat in 2002 after the tragic death of Paul Wellstone .
The right wing noise machine went crazy after Wellstone ’s memorial service and turned that into a negative against the Democrats .
That was one of the last times the right wing noise machine went unchallenged .
Norm Coleman was never a worthy successor to Paul Wellstone .
And , his sleaziness makes him unworthy of being a U.S. Senator .
Recent polls show Al Franken has moved into the lead .
This latest Coleman scandal can only make things worse for the Republican .

( NOTE FROM JOHN : Seems some right - wingers are already out there saying that the Frontiersman is n’t a real paper , and that this is a Web site pretending to be a news site in order to attack Palin .
Well , there ’s this new thing out there .
It ’s called “ the Google . ”
If one uses it one would find that the Frontiersman is the local Wasilla paper , and has been around since 1947 .
This article was published in the year 2000 , so it was n’t a swipe at Palin at all – that was 8 years before she was chosen for VP .
It just so happens that the article inadvertently gives us a rather nasty window into Sarah Palin and the priorities of her city government . )
I could n’t even believe this article , it ’s so creepy and out there .
But in fact , Palin was mayor of Wasilla , Alaska from 1996 to 2002 .
And according to an Alaskan news article in the local Wasilla paper in the year 2000 , the City of Wasilla , under Mayor Palin , charged rape victims for their own forensic tests .
Most Alaskan municipalities picked up the tab themselves , but not Wasilla , the article notes .
You see , the city of Wasilla , the article notes , did n’t want to “ burden ” taxpayers with having to support victims of rape .
Yes , they were more interested in lowering taxes .
It would have cost the city between $ 5,000 and $ 14,000 a year to pay for the rape victims ’ police medical exams .
And if the City of Wasilla , circa the year 2000 , wants to go there in terms of balancing rape vs , burdening taxpayers , you should know that each and every Alaskan gets a check from the state government each year , it contains their portion of that year ’s oil revenues .
The latest check , I read , was for over $ 2,000 .
I think the citizens of Wasilla had the money .
From the Frontiersman :
The federal government is sending each of us a $ 600 rebate .
If we spend that money at Wal - Mart , the money goes to China .
If we spend it on gasoline it goes to the Arabs .
If we buy a computer it will go to India .
If we purchase fruit and vegetables it will go to Mexico , Honduras and Guatemala .
If we purchase a good car it will go to Germany .
If we purchase useless crap it will go to Taiwan and none of it will help the American economy .
The only way to keep that money here at home is to spend it on prostitutes and beer , since these are the only products still produced in US .
I ’ve been doing my part .

Google Chrome uses a library called Skia , which is also the graphics engine behind Google 's Android mobile OS .
The two projects share code that implements WebKit 's porting API in terms of Skia .
Google Chrome also uses Skia to render parts of the user interface such as the toolbar and tab strip .
I 'm going to talk about some of the history that led us to choose Skia , as well as how our graphics layer works .
WebKit is designed to work on multiple operating systems .
It abstracts platform - specific functions into the " port , " which an embedder application such as Google Chrome implements specifically for their system .
This relatively clean abstraction has helped WebKit to be adopted on a wide variety of devices and systems .
One of the parts of the port we had to consider when developing Google Chrome was the graphics layer , which is responsible for rendering text , images , and other graphics to the screen .
Which graphics library ?
One question that people often ask is , why not use OpenGL or DirectX for accelerated rendering ?
First , on Windows , we use a sandbox that prevents us from displaying windows from our renderer processes .
The image data must be transferred to the main browser process before it can be drawn to the screen , which limits the possible approaches we can take .
If the images needs to be read off the video card only to be copied back to the video card in another process , it is usually not worthwhile using accelerated rendering in the first place .
Second , drawing graphics is actually a very small percentage of the time we spend rendering a page .
Most of the time is spent in WebKit computing where things will be placed , what styles to apply to them , and using system routines to draw text .
Accelerated 3D graphics would not give us enough overall improvement in speed to balance out the extra work and compatibility problems that we would encounter .
If we are n't going to be using OpenGL or DirectX , what about other graphics libraries ?
We considered a number of options when we first started work on our Windows port of WebKit :
Windows GDI : GDI is the basic , low - level graphics API in Microsoft Windows .
It is used to draw buttons , window controls , and dialog boxes for every Windows application , so we know that it 's tested and works well .
However , it has relatively basic capabilities .
Although most web pages can be drawn using only these basic primitives , parts of < canvas > or SVG would need to be implemented separately , either using a different graphics library , or our own custom code .
GDI +: GDI + is a more advanced graphics API provided on newer versions of Windows .
Its API is cleaner and it supports most 2D graphics operations you could think to use .
However , we had concerns about GDI + using device independent metrics , which means that text and letter spacing might look different in Google Chrome than in other Windows applications ( which measure and draw text tailored to the screen device ) .
Additionally , at the time we were making the decision , Microsoft was recommending developers use newer graphics APIs in Windows , so we were n't sure how much longer GDI + would be supported and maintained .
Cairo : Cairo is an open - source 2D graphics library .
It is successfully used in Firefox 3 , and the Windows port of WebKit at that time already had a partially complete graphics implementation for WebKit .
Cairo is also cross-platform , a key advantage over GDI and GDI + when building a cross-platform browser .
We ended up choosing Skia over these options because it is cross-platform ( meaning our work would n't have to be duplicated when porting to other systems ) , because there was already a high - quality WebKit port using it created for Android 's browser , and because we had in - house expertise .
The latter point is critical because we expected to ( and did ) need additional features added to the graphics library as well as some bugs fixed .
So far , we 've been very happy with our choice .
Skia has proved to be effective at handling all the graphics operations we 've needed , has been fast enough despite being software - only , and we 've gotten great support from the Skia team .
Thanks !
System - specific features
Android has the advantage of controlling the entire operating system graphics layer .
Skia 's font layer implements all text rendering for the Android system , so all text looks consistent .
However , we wanted to match the host OS 's look and feel .
This means using native text rendering routines so that , for example , we can get ClearType on Windows .
To solve this problem , we create a wrapper around Skia 's SkDevice ( an object representing a low - level drawing surface ) which we call PlatformDevice .
The object is both a bitmap in main memory that Skia can draw into , and a " Device Independent Bitmap " that the Windows GDI layer can draw into .
Lines , images , and patters are all drawn by Skia into this bitmap , while text is drawn directly by Windows .
As part of our porting efforts , we are currently working on creating similar abstractions for OS X and Linux .

Dr Pepper 's recent publicity stunt in which the soda manufacturer offered to give every American ( with a few exceptions ) a free soft drink if Guns N ' Roses managed to release its long - awaited Chinese Democracy album by the end of 2008 was an unmitigated success in terms of attracting attention for the brand .
Apparently , Guns N' Roses had nothing to do with it , and now the band 's lawyer Alan Gutman has taken the soda manufacturer to task for a " shoddy " promotion he says fooled fans and ripped off the band 's image .
Gutman send a letter to Dr Pepper Snapple Group president and CEO Larry Young describing the giveaway as an " unmitigated disaster which defrauded consumers " and claims Dr Pepper " brazenly violated [ their ] clients ' rights , " according to Billboard .
Gutman demanded that Dr Pepper extend the giveaway and print a full - page apology in several of the nation 's prominent newspapers .
And , of course , he wants damages for Axl Rose and company in return for " the unauthorized use and abuse of their publicity and intellectual property right . "
After Dr Pepper 's servers crashed on Sunday after the GNR album wenton sale and the giveaway commenced , the company extended theregistration – originally scheduled to end Sunday at midnight – until6 pm on Monday night .
During that time , Americans could enter somepersonal information in exchange for a coupon for a 20 - ounce soda ,
which Dr Pepper said would arrive in 4 - 6 weeks .
Gutman claims that notonly did Dr Pepper use GNR 's intellectual property without permission ,
but also that the botched nature of the giveaway reflected poorly on theband .
Anyone who goes to the site now looking for their free soda due to Chinese Democracy
being released is greeted by the normal front page of DrPepper.com ,
which contains no visible mention of the high - profile giveaway .
If youdid n't register for your soda in the first two days the album was onsale , you 're out of luck , unless Gutman succeeds in forcing DR Pepperto extend the deadline again .
We 've asked Dr Pepper whether ithas a response to GNR 's accusations via both instant message ande- mail , but it has yet to respond .
Update ( 4:21 pm EST ) : A Dr Pepper spokesman says he will have a response for us soon .

Cuba is limiting how much basic fruits and vegetables people can buy at farmers ’ markets , irritating some customers but ensuring there ’s enough — barely — to go around .
The lines are long and some foods are scarce , but because the government has maintained and even increased rations in some areas , Cubans who initially worried about getting enough to eat now seem confident they wo n’t go hungry despite the destruction of 30 percent of the island ’s crops by hurricanes Gustav and Ike last month .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ Of the little there is , there is some for everyone , ” 65 - year - old Mercedes Grimau said as queued up behind more than 50 people to buy lettuce , limited to two pounds per person .
“ I ’m not afraid that I will be left without food , but it ’s a pain to think about all the work we are going to have to go through , ” Grimau added .
“ Two or three months ago the farmers markets were well - stocked . ”
Cuba ’s government regularly stockpiles beans and other basics , and Economics Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez said authorities are ready to increase the $ 2 billion they already spend on food imports annually .
The world credit crisis wo n’t affect much of those imports because U.S. law forces communist Cuba to use cash to purchase American farm goods .
But imports from other countries bought with credit could become more difficult or expensive .
The government is delivering all items distributed each month on the universal ration that provides Cubans with up to two weeks of food — including eggs , beans , rice and potatoes — at very low cost .
In some hard - hit provinces , extra food has been added .
But the rest of the food Cubans supplement their diets with at supply - and - demand farmers markets and government produce stands has dwindled , prompting the government to limit consumer purchases and cap prices on items including rice , beans , root crops and fresh greens .
Rodriguez has sought to dispel speculation about a replay of the desperate early 1990s , when shelves were bare and people survived for weeks on one small meal daily .
Cubans who lived through deprivation after the Soviet Union ’s collapse say the current food situation does n’t come close .

Its like the took some KDE , mixed it with the windows taskbar and added a flavor of the osx dock nothing new here .
I witnessed the Great Gummi Project ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/pheadlessg/sets/999174/) a few years ago , and was inspired .
It was a grandiose project , do n't get me wrong , but I figured I could do better .
Here is my attempt .
Start out with a bag of the very best gummis , Black Forest , of course .
I 've tried this before ( on a much smaller scale ) with knock - off gummis , and it just was n't the same .
You 'll also need honey bear containers .
A Google search for " honey bear containers " will get you hooked up with a honey supply supplier .
You 'll probably have to buy more bears than you need , but that just means more huge gummis !
Here I 've taken them out of the bag and put the lids on .
There they stand , like Terra Cotta Soldiers awaiting their grisly loads .
The whole process is pretty simple , if a bit time consuming .
Here 's the entire contents of a 5 pound bag of Gummi Bears .
Kind of mesmerizing , is n't it ?
The next step is to start sorting .
Once again , not too high on the difficulty scale , but it 's a time - waster .
With the party already struggling to generate enthusiasm for its brand , Republican strategists fear that an outpouring of public anger generated by Congress 's struggle to pass a rescue package for the financial industry may contribute to a disaster at the polls for the GOP in November .
" The crisis has affected the entire ticket , " said Jan van Lohuizen , a Republican consultant who handled the polling for President Bush 's reelection campaign .
" The worse the state 's economy , the greater the impact . "
Republicans are trying to defend at least 18 House seats in Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Florida , economic trouble spots that double as election battlegrounds .
Rising unemployment , the meltdown in the housing market , and a credit crunch besieging consumers and manufacturers alike were factors in Sen.
John McCain 's decision Thursday to pull campaign resources out of Michigan .
The McCain campaign 's exit from the state leaves a pair of vulnerable Republicans , Reps . Tim Walberg and Joe Knollenberg , with a weakened party infrastructure heading into Nov. 4 .
The pessimism in the GOP ranks reflects a striking shift in momentum in the four weeks since the Republican National Convention , when Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin made her national debut and rallied conservatives , helping to fuel the perception that longer - shot Democratic targets were drifting out of reach .
" If you turn the clock back two or two and half weeks , you could make a plausible argument that if a couple of things go our way we will lose three to four Senate races , " said one Republican strategist .
" Now we will lose six to eight . "
Polling in most Senate races over the past 14 days has shown a five - point decline for the Republican candidate , the strategist said .
The picture in the House is similar .
The generic ballot test -- a traditional measure of broad voter attitudes -- has also moved decisively in Democrats ' direction in recent days .
The latest NBC - Wall Street Journal and Associated Press polls showed voters favoring a generic Democratic candidate for Congress over a generic Republican by 13 points , while a recent Time magazine poll gave Democrats a 46 percent to 36 percent edge .
GOP operatives said the party 's declining fortunes are rooted in a series of events over the past two weeks , including McCain 's decision to suspend his campaign in order to help broker a deal on the rescue plan and Republican opposition that doomed the bill in a House vote on Monday .
Those incidents helped reinforce voter impressions that Washington is broken and that Republicans bear the brunt of the blame , the party insiders said .
In the most recent Washington Post - ABC News national poll , more than half of all voters said they were " very concerned " that the failure of the first bailout vote would cause a " severe economic decline . "
By a ratio of 2 to 1 , they blamed the legislations ' defeat on Republicans .
Neil Newhouse , a partner in the Republican polling firm Public Opinion Strategies , echoed van Lohuizen 's sentiment .
" The bailout crisis has had a corrosive effect on the national political environment , and that impacts not just John McCain , but GOP candidates up and down the ticket , " he said .
Our good friends and allies at People For the American Way -- or , more precisely , at the People For American Way Voters Alliance ( their PAC ) -- have been talking with us about how to best support a group of strong progressive leaders and help them get elected to Congress this November .
You wo n't find anyone from the Republican wing of the Democratic Party on their list of endorsed candidates , all solid progressives .
Many are familiar toreaders , like Darcy Burner , Alan Grayson , Dennis Shulman , Vic Wulsin , Larry Kissell , Annette Taddeo .
They just announced a competition , similar to the one we did at Blue America a few weeks ago .
PFAW members , bloggers , activists , concerned citizens ... anyone who cares about the direction our country is headed , get to vote on an ActBlue page specially created for this event .
The candidate who raises the most will get a check from the People For American Way Voters Alliance .
This has been an effective way to help candidates finance their campaigns against corporate - backed Republican incumbents .
They have n't officially launched the contest yet but when I woke up this morning I saw that over $ 7,000 had been collected overnight .
Gary Peters , a solid progressive who has just pulled ahead of the odious rubber stamp Joe Knollenberg in Michigan 's 9th CD , is off to a strong lead and Judy Feder ( D - VA ) is in second place .
I can already see Russ Warner 's and Debbie Cook 's California supporters stirring .
Jump in and see if there 's someone you want to help -- and in this contest you can vote for as many candidates as you want and as many times as you want to !
It is n't enough to elect Obama in November .
It is n't enough to elect Democratic majorities either .
It 's crucial that we elect committed progressives who will fight -- fight smart and fight hard -- for working families and who will stand up to the special interests .
That is not , alas , synonymous with today 's Democratic Party .
There are more than a few horribly reactionary Democrats in Congress , like Blue Dog Chris Carney ( PA ) who is all too often virtually indistinguishable from a fear - mongering , bigoted Republican .
This contest is n't about MORE Democrats .
It 's about BETTER Democrats .
Today ' sreports that GOP strategists foresee an even worse catastrophe for Republicans at the polls this November than has been indicated in the mainstream media .
And the Democratic opponents to those two reactionary rubber stamps , are Mark Schauer and Gary Peters , both well - tested progressives , the kinds of Democrats who have already shown how hard and how effectively they will battle against the special interests and for ordinary , everyday Americans .
Mark and Gary are two of the progressives the PFAW Voters Alliance endorsed and included in the contest .
Theis pointing out how the GOP is fretting over vulnerable seats held by rubber stamp Republican incumbents in Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Florida .
And the Republicans should fret .
Aside from the progressives challenging Knollenberg and Walberg , the PFAW Voters Alliance is hoping to assist several others on this list ( like opponents of Florida wingnuts , Ileana Ros-Lehtinen , Ric Keller and Adam Putnam , respectively Annette Taddeo , Alan Grayson and Doug Tudor ) .
Even with sentiment as powerfully arrayed against Republicans as it is , progressive challengers still have to overcome gigantic funding disparities .
In almost every single race , the Republican is massively better financed -- by the special interests they serve -- than the progressives ( who seek to serve ordinary American families ) .
Let me point out some examples in the races the PFAW Voters Alliance is involved with : FL - 12 : Republican Adam Putnam raised $ 1,431,300 , mostly from PACs , and Doug Tudor , the progressive has raised $ 64,985 .
CA - 26 : Republican David Dreier , like Putnam a big PAC - man , has $ 1,903,654 on hand ( having already spent $ 1,348,731 to lie about his voting record ) , while Russ Warner has $ 124,761 on hand .
CA - 46 : Dana Rohrabacher , the Taliban 's best friend in Congress , has $ 387,950 on hand while his progressive opponent , Huntington Beach Mayor Debbie Cook , has $ 97,392.NC-08 : Robin
Hayes owns more gas and oil stock than any other member of Congress and he's one of the wealthiest members of the House -- and that is reflected in his anti-family votes -- and his campaign , having already spent $ 1,221,161 , is sitting on another $ 1,174,366 to deploy against Larry Kissell , an ex-mill worker who teaches history in high school , who has $ 231,583 on hand .
There 's only one way we can get representatives in Washington who representinterests and not the special interests that finance the Republican Party ( and the Blue Dogs ) and that is by chipping in what we can afford .
Even $ 5 and $ 10 contributions , when given by enough regular people , mount up fast -- and powerfully .
One last time , please consider giving what you can today to the congressional candidate of your choice in the PFAW Voters Alliance competition .

Physics may be the furthest thing from the minds of the presidential candidates right now , but a solid grasp of the science behind some of the latest headlines will be critical for the winner .
Physics has a history of intersecting with politics in ways both large and small , from the creation of the atomic bomb to nuclear meltdowns to terrorist methods .
And now , with more specialized , high - tech issues to tackle than ever before , it is increasingly important that world leaders have an understanding of the underlying scientific concepts .
But that ’s not necessarily the case , says UC Berkeley physicist Richard Muller , author of the book Physics for Future Presidents .
For example , he argues that some terrorist threats , like dirty bombs , are overrated , while others , the low - tech stuff like natural gas bombs , receive little attention .
" I do not have a sense from the campaigns that the candidates really know this stuff , " Muller told Wired.com .
" And I do n’t expect them to .
In the past , it ’s been the secret knowledge of the scientists who say , ' Pick me as your science adviser , and I ’ll tell you what to do . "
But Muller wants to change that with his non-partisan take on issues like global warming , energy , nuclear weapons , and space .
He demurred on who he wants to see elected , or thinks will be .
All that matters to him is that whoever wins brings the right approach to their policy decisions .
" What you have to do is give the president a knowledge base , so they can make knowledge - based decisions . "
Muller said .
" I say those things that I hope will be heard . "
In this Q & A , Muller discusses dirty bombs , space robotics and clean coal .
Wired.com :
Do either one of the candidates have the book ?
Muller : I know it is within arm ’s length for each of them .
I ’ve gotten it to people who are close to them and see the candidates regularly .
The people who have it really like the book , too .
They will give it to the winner after the election .
Wired :
How likely is it that either one of the candidates will take the time to understand physics , or any other scientific discipline ?
Muller :
It depends on how strong the recommendation they get is .
This is a subject that is central for what they ’ll be doing .
They know the world is high tech and that their policy decisions will have a high tech component .
I tried to write a book with the voice that would address them at the level of providing knowledge .
. .
I do n’t want to give them my opinions .
At the end of every part of the book , I have two pages of advice .
But mostly I wanted to inform them to the level where they can make informed decisions .
They have to understand the threat of terrorism , what ’s going on with global warming .
In my book , I did that in a way that ’s clear .
I ’ve never found anybody who has said , “ I did n’t understand that . ”
Never have I said anything that is unintelligible to an educated person whether they are an English major or a lawyer .
Wired :
If you could sit the candidates down and make them understand the physics of three issues , what would they be ?
Muller : Let ’s begin with terrorism .
In terrorism , the fact is that gasoline has enormous energy .
It has 15 times the energy of TNT .
What that means to me is that a likely terrorist attack is going to be like the
World Trade Center where the damage was done by the fuel not the planes .
Beware of the low tech .
In space , the glory of the last 40 years for NASA has been in robotics .
Most scientists dread the thought that they have to have their instruments on a manned flight .
For the extra cost of putting them on a manned flight , they could build 2 robots , the instrument itself and a backup .
Let ’s do as much robotics as possible before sending humans .
Wired :
Is it just the cost of manned operations that is the problem ?
Muller :
No , most instruments work better when there are not humans walking around and shaking them .
But it ’s also the cost that it has to be so utterly safe for humans .
Wired :
And the third physics issue for presidents ?
Muller : Global warming .
There is a consensus that global warming is real .
There has not been much so far , but it ’s going to get much , much worse .
The thing I would tell the president is that the global warming , according to the global consensus — that ’s the IPCC
scientists , who won the Nobel Prize — the global warming of the future is going to come from the developing world .
It ’s the exploding economies of China and India and Asia that are going to be responsible for the CO2 .
This causes a political problem because they are poor and have a low standard of living and should n’t have to pay for emissions cuts .
So , the only way this is going to work is that we pay the expense of them cutting back .
If all we do is set an example , the example we ’ll have set is that once you ’re a wealthy nation , you can cut back on CO2 .
If that ’s the example , they will wait until they are wealthy and then they ’ll cut back and it ’ll be too late .
Of course , if either one of the candidates said , we have to send
$ 100 billion to China , they ’d lose .
But after the election maybe they can talk about that .
Doing feel - good things in the U.S. is fine .
Going to biofuels is good for energy independence .
Going to solar and nuclear is also good for energy independence and also good for global warming .
But the U.S .
is going to contribute less than 1 degree of warming to future warming .
The future is primarily going to come from China .
Their economy is growing at 10 percent a year .
And their carbon footprint is growing even faster , 10 or 12 percent per year .
The developing world is taking off .
The OECD countries [ a group of wealthier nations ] are now contributing much less than one - half of the carbon dioxide .
The non-OECD countries are growing and growing in their energy use .
And we have to be happy about that .
It ’s a good thing because it means their standard of living is getting better .
It ’s even a good thing for population control to have people who are happy and healthy .
Wired :
Of the technologies to mitigate global warming , which do you think is most important ?
Muller : Clean coal is probably the most important .
The public does n’t understand about clean coal .
They think it ’s an oxymoron .
But coal is so abundant in China and India and it is so cheap that we have to capture the CO2 and pump it underground .
Wired :
But some geologists and other scientists have questioned whether carbon dioxide sequestration might be too difficult .
Muller :
It ’s difficult in the same way that the Apollo mission was difficult .
I think there are technological solutions to all the problems that sequestration presents .
But also , if you are going to be technologically pessimistic about clean coal , you also have to be technologically pessimistic on solar , on wind , on batteries , and on other solutions .
The problems of coal are relatively straightforward .
Sure , there will be problems .
But beware of a bias towards some technologies over others .
Wired :
But not all technologies advance at the same rate , so there could be reasons for supporting one type of technology over another .
Muller : Of course .
The IPPC made a major study of sequestration .
One issue was , if we do the sequestration , will it work ?
We ’re talking about burying it in deep brines under land .
The thing is we ’ll know within a few years whether it will work .
We need to try it very rapidly , so if it ’s not going to work , we ’ll know right away .
And there are wonderful other things going on .
Wind is expanding very rapidly .
Batteries are being developed .
And batteries are really the hope for reducing emissions from automobiles , but they are not here yet .
The Tesla roadster has 1000 pounds of expensive batteries .
It ’s nice to establish the name of the Tesla but these batteries are notorious for their calendar life .
We really have to get cheaper batteries and batteries that can be recharged more often .
There is a lot more work that has to be done in batteries .
And in the meantime , those of us who are wealthy can drive Teslas .
This is I think what people forget .
If you ’re going to spend a billion dollars , you can do it far more effectively in China to cut back their emissions than you can to buy some expensive technology in the United States .
Wired :
Let ’s get back to the fun questions .
You present a scenario on your website that you are the president and a terrorist has planted a dirty bomb in midtown Manhattan , but let ’s say it ’s in
Chicago .
Muller :
Well , the key issue with a dirty bomb is that it is extremely difficult to make a dirty bomb that will leave any bodies . .
.
The main effect is cancer , not radiation illness .
The president needs to educate the public about radioactivity to let them know that when the dirty bomb spreads , in the worst parts of the city , the cancer rate is probably 20 percent and it might go up to 21
percent .
You multiply it out over a lot of people , and that ’s how you get a large number of deaths .
And what people are scared of is a large number of deaths , but they will not be observed .
They will be lost in the statistical noise .
The president needs to inform the public that radioactivity is not as frightening as it might seem .
Personally
I ’d rather see a dirty bomb than another 9/11 .
Jose Padilla , the street thug , he was going to make a dirty bomb for al Qaeda .
I cover this in my book that it came out during the deposition that they said , “ Forget the dirty bomb , rent several apartments in Chicago and explode them with natural gas . ”
What scares me is that that shows that al Qaeda understands the limitations of the dirty bomb much better than we do .
We classify them as a weapon of mass destruction and that ’s the wrong scale .

The British National Party has lost its membership list - the whole thing has been published online .
The list includes names , addresses , phone numbers and email addresses of all members up to September 2008 .
It also includes some people 's ages , especially those under 18 - the BNP offers family membership for £ 40 .
Many entries also contain more personal comments about jobs or hobbies .
That 's how we know that that BNP members include receptionists , district nurses , amateur historians , pagans , line dancers and a male witch .
Members have unsurprisingly reacted with outrage .
One commenter said : " I 'm also on the list , what the f#ck is going on ?
I could lose my job . "
Another : " The most shocking thing is some of the comments by the names !
God help anyone who is in the army , the pison [ sic ] service , health care , police officer or a teacher . "
Several professions in the UK are expected to refrain from party political activities .
More outraged racists rightwingers here .
Various senior BNP figures are being blamed on blogs for the leak .
A spokesman for the BNP was unaware of the leak but said : " It would n't surprise me if someone has done this , but they 'll be in trouble , not just under the Data Protection Act but also for contempt of court - there 's an ongoing court case . "
UKIP recently rejected overtures from the BNP suggesting an electoral pact .
Meanwhile , UKIP 's most famous ex-member , Robert Kilroy Silk is currently disporting himself on I'm a Celebrity ... while collecting his MEP salary of course .
Tip of the hat to antifascist blog Lancaster Unity for the tip - off . ®

A word to readers :
Please refrain from attempts to post links to the BNP list in the comments section .
Thank you .
Brand called Sachs ' mobile four times during his show The BBC has apologised to actor Andrew Sachs for the " unacceptable and offensive " content of calls made to him by Russell Brand during a radio show .
The Fawlty Towers star was called four times during a prank on Brand 's BBC Radio 2 show on 18 October .
The actor 's agent said Sachs was " very upset " after Brand and guest Jonathan Ross left lewd messages about the actor 's granddaughter on his voicemail .
Brand himself apologised for the offence on his latest show .
He said " you mus n't swear on someone 's answer phone " , but added it was " funny " .
A BBC Radio 2 spokeswoman said : " We have received a letter of a complaint from Mr Sachs ' agent and would like to sincerely apologise to Mr Sachs for the offence caused .
" We recognise that some of the content broadcast was unacceptable and offensive .
She added : " We are reviewing how this came about and are responding to Mr Sachs personally .
We also apologise to listeners for any offence caused . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement Sachs , who played Manuel in Fawlty Towers , was expected to be a guest on the programme , but was unable to appear due to unforeseen circumstances .
Obscene comments Brand and Ross went on to leave a series of messages on the 78 - year - old 's voicemail during the two - hour radio show , which included obscene comments about Sachs ' 23 - year - old granddaughter .
In the first message , Ross suddenly swore and said Brand had slept with her .
He then apologised and said he " got excited " .
Later in the programme , Brand said the only way to rectify the incident was to make another call - but caused further offence after he suggested Sachs might kill himself because of the previous message 's revelations .
A third call saw Brand and Ross singing an apology to the actor .
Brand sang : " I 'd like to apologise for the terrible attacks , Andrew Sachs .
I said some things I did n't have oughta [ sic ] , like I had sex with your granddaughter . "
During the fourth call , Brand said : " Now when I watch Fawlty Towers I think I 'm going to think I 've hurt his feelings . "
Andrew Sachs was unable to answer Brand 's calls A BBC spokeswoman said the programme had received two complaints related to Ross 's swearing - rather than the content of the phone calls - before details of the incident were publicised in a Sunday newspaper .
A further 1585 further complaints have arrived since .
Sachs ' agent , Meg Poole , has written a letter to Radio 2 controller Lesley Douglas asking for an unreserved apology .
Ms Poole told BBC
News that the actor had passed on his mobile phone number to Brand 's production team " in good faith " , which the presenter used to contact him during the show .
She added that the actor did not hear the programme , but listened to a recording and was " offended very much indeed " by its content .
Talk show host and Radio 2 presenter Jonathan Ross has now sent a personal apology to the actor and it is understood Brand is planning to do the same .
Earlier this year , Brand apologised for making a hoax call to the police during a stage show in Northampton .
He rang a police line in front of an audience and said he may have spotted a man who was responsible for a series of assaults .
Brand later said he was " devastated by the possibility " that he " may have offended vulnerable people " .
The 33 - year - old star , who hosted the MTV Music Awards in Los Angeles last month , has been a regular presenter on Radio 2 for almost two years .

Recipe courtesy of chef Wolfgang Puck .
SERVINGS
8 to 12
INGREDIENTS
8 ounces bittersweet chocolate , broken into small pieces
1/4 pound ( 1 stick ) unsalted butter , cut into small pieces
5 large eggs , separated
2/3 cup sugar
Pinch salt
Confectioners ' sugar , for garnish
Unsweetened whipped cream , for garnish
Fresh berries , for garnish
PREPARATION
1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Butter and flour a 10 - inch round cake pan and line bottom with a piece of parchment paper , using pan as a guide to cut out paper .
2. Bring a pan of water or bottom of double boiler to boil .
Reduce heat to maintain a fair simmer .
In top half of double boiler , or in a heatproof bowl set over but not touching water , melt chocolate and butter together , stirring occasionally .
Set chocolate - butter mixture aside .
3 . In a mixing bowl , put egg yolks and all but 3 tablespoons sugar .
Whisk until sugar has dissolved and yolks are smooth .
Whisking continuously , slowly pour in melted chocolate until thoroughly combined .
4 . Put egg whites and salt in a clean bowl .
With electric mixer on medium speed , beat egg whites until soft peaks form when beaters are lifted out .
Gradually sprinkle and beat in remaining sugar , and continue to beat until egg whites form stiff but not dry - looking peaks when beaters are lifted out .
5 . Stir a dollop of egg whites into chocolate mixture to lighten .
Then , 1/3 at a time , gently fold chocolate mixture into egg whites just until thoroughly combined .
Pour mixture into prepared cake pan .
6 . Bake cake until looks firm and set but a wooden toothpick inserted into center still comes out slightly moist , about 45 minutes .
Immediately turn cake out onto cooling rack by using pot holders or oven gloves to hold rack securely on top of pan , and then invert them together and lift off pan .
Peel off parchment paper .
As cake cools , its center will sink and crack , but do not worry .
7. Before serving , put some confectioners ' sugar in a fine - meshed sieve held over cake , and tap sieve to dust cake with sugar .
Cut cake into wedges and serve with unsweetened whipped cream or berries .

Their research paper is to be published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Wednesday 17 September and it is the first time that evidence has emerged of the association between higher BPA levels and disease in adults .
BPA is a controversial chemical commonly used in food and drink containers .
It has previously caused concerns over health risks to babies , as it is present in some baby 's bottles .
BPA is used in polycarbonate plastic products such as refillable drinks containers , compact disks , some plastic eating utensils and many other products in everyday use .
It is one of the world 's highest production volume chemicals , with over 2.2 million tonnes ( 6.4 billion pounds ) produced in 2003 , with an annual growth in demand of between six and 10 per cent each year .
Many previous studies in laboratory animals have suggested that BPA is safe , but some laboratory studies have raised doubts .
Experiments in which mice and rats were exposed to BPA have shown that higher doses of the chemical can lead to liver damage , insulin resistance , diabetes and obesity .
The laboratory animal evidence is complicated and controversial .
Some scientists believe that BPA can disrupt the work done by hormones , especially oestrogen , but the full biological effects of BPA in humans is far from clear .
The research team analysed information from the US government 's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) 2003 - 2004 , the only large - scale data available on BPA concentrations excreted in urine .
The research team analysed the results for the 1455 adults aged between 18 and 74 years old for whom measures were available .
This study group is representative of the general population of the USA .
The analysis found that the 25 per cent of the population with the highest BPA levels were more than twice as likely to have heart disease and / or diabetes , compared to the 25 per cent with the lowest BPA levels .
Higher BPA levels were also associated with clinically abnormal liver enzyme concentrations .
While this study has identified a statistical association between BPA and adult diseases for the first time , much more research is needed .
Future work needs to exclude the small possibility that the association is due to some other unstudied factor , or that people with these diseases somehow become more exposed to BPA .
It is also unclear whether the liver enzyme changes are linked to liver damage .
Professor David Melzer , Professor of Epidemiology and Public Health at the Peninsula Medical School ( Exeter , UK ) , who led the team commented : " Our study has revealed , for the first time , an association between raised BPA loads and two common diseases in adults .
At the moment we can't be absolutely sure that BPA is the direct cause of the extra cases of heart disease and diabetes : if it is , some cases of these serious conditions could be prevented by reducing BPA exposure .
This is therefore an exciting finding , but it is also just the first step in understanding the role of BPA . "
He emphasised that this new possible link does not detract from the existing health advice to people on how to prevent heart disease and diabetes .
Professor Melzer also praised the NHANES study and the US Division of Environmental Health Laboratory Sciences , National Center for Environmental Health , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , who released these data for analysis by researchers .
Tamara Galloway , Professor of eco-toxicology from the School of Biosciences , the University of Exeter , added : " Our results illustrate how important human bio-monitoring programmes such as NHANES are in providing high quality information on the extent of human exposure to common chemicals such as BPA , allowing us to explore the relationship between exposure and health outcomes more fully .

' The Empire Strikes Back ' Strikes a Bland Note
By VINCENT CANBY
Confession :
When I went to see " The Empire Strikes Back " I found myself glancing at my watch almost as often as I did when I was sitting through a truly terrible movie called " The Island . "
The Empire Strikes Back " is not a truly terrible movie .
It 's a nice movie .
It 's not , by any means , as nice as " Star Wars . "
It 's not as fresh and funny and surprising and witty , but it is nice and inoffensive and , in a way that no one associated with it need be ashamed of , it 's also silly .
Attending to it is a lot like reading the middle of a comic book .
It is amusing in fitful patches but you 're likely to find more beauty , suspense , discipline , craft and art when watching a New York harbor pilot bring the Queen Elizabeth 2 into her Hudson River berth , which is what " The Empire Strikes Back " most reminds me of .
It 's a big , expensive , time - consuming , essentially mechanical operation .
Gone from " The Empire Strikes Back " are those associations that so enchanted us in " Star Wars , " reminders of everything from the Passion of Jesus and the stories of Beowulf and King Arthur to those of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn , the Oz books , Buck Rogers and Peanuts .
Strictly speaking , " The Empire Strikes Back " is n't even a complete narrative .
It has no beginning or end , being simply another chapter in a serial that appears to be continuing not onward and upward but sideways .
How , then , to review it ?
The fact that I am here at this minute facing a reproachful typewriter and attempting to get a fix on " The Empire Strikes Back " is , perhaps , proof of something I 've been suspecting for some time now .
That is , that there is more nonsense being written , spoken and rumored about movies today than about any of the other so - called popular arts except rock music .
The Force is with us , indeed , and a lot of it is hot air .
Ordinarily when one reviews a movie one attempts to tell a little something about the story .
It 's a measure of my mixed feelings about " The Empire Strikes Back " that I 'm not at all sure that I understand the plot .
That was actually one of the more charming conceits of " Star Wars , " which began with a long , intensely complicated message about who was doing what to whom in the galactic confrontations we were about to witness and which , when we did see them , looked sort of like a game of neighborhood hide - and - seek at the Hayden Planetarium .
One did n't worry about its politics .
One only had to distinguish the good persons from the bad .
This is pretty much the way one is supposed to feel about " The Empire Strikes Back , " but one 's impulse to know , to understand , cannot be arrested indefinitely without doing psychic damage or , worse , without risking boredom .
This much about " The Empire Strikes Back " I do understand :
When the movie begins , Han Solo ( Harrison Ford ) and Princess Leia ( Carrie Fisher ) and their gang are hanging out on a cold , snowy planet where soldiers ride patrols on animals that look like ostrich - kangaroos , where there are white - furred animals that are not polar bears and where Luke Skywalker ( Mark Hamill ) almost freezes to death .
Under the command of Darth Vader , the forces of the Empire attack , employing planes , missiles and some awfully inefficient tanks that have the shape of armor - plated camels .
Somehow Han Solo and Princess Leia escape .
At that point Luke Skywalker flies off to find Yoda , a guru who will teach him more about the Force , Yoda being the successor to Ben ( Obi - Wan ) Kenobi ( Alec Guinness ) , the " Star Wars " guru who was immolated in that movie but whose shade turns up from time to time in the new movie for what looks to have been about three weeks of work .
As Han Solo and Princess Leia wrestle with the forces of darkness and those of a new character played by Billy Dee Williams , an unreliable fellow who has future sainthood written all over him , Luke Skywalker finds his guru , Yoda , a small , delightful , Muppet - like troll created and operated by Frank Oz of the Muppet Show .
Eventually these two stories come together for still another blazing display of special effects that , after approximately two hours , leave Han Solo , Leia and Luke no better off than they were at the beginning .
I 'm not as bothered by the film 's lack of resolution as I am about my suspicion that I really do n't care .
After one has one 's fill of the special effects and after one identifies the source of the facetious banter that passes for wit between Han Solo and Leia ( it 's straight out of B - picture comedies of the 30's ) , there is n't a great deal for the eye or the mind to focus on .
Ford , as cheerfully nondescript as one could wish a comic strip hero to be , and Miss Fisher , as sexlessly pretty as the base of a porcelain lamp , become ( is it rude to say ? ) tiresome .
One finally looks around them , even through them , at the decor .
If Miss Fisher does much more of this sort of thing , she 's going to wind up with the Vera Hruba Ralston Lifetime Achievement Award .
The other performers are no better or worse , being similarly limited by the not - super material .
Hamill may one day become a real movie star , an identifiable personality , but right now it 's difficult to remember what he looks like .
Even the appeal of those immensely popular robots , C - 3PO and R2 - D2 , starts to run out .
In this context it's no wonder that Oz 's contribution , the rubbery little Yoda with the pointy ears and his old - man 's frieze of wispy hair , is the hit of the movie .
But even he can be taken only in small doses , possibly because the lines of wisdom he must speak sound as if they should be sung to a tune by Jimmy Van Heusen .
I 'm also puzzled by the praise that some of my colleagues have heaped on the work of Irvin Kershner , whom Lucas , who directed " Star Wars " and who is the executive producer of this one , hired to direct " The Empire Strikes Back . "
Perhaps my colleagues have information denied to those of us who have to judge the movie by what is on the screen .
Did Kershner oversee the screenplay , too ?
Did he do the special effects ?
After working tirelessly with Miss Fisher to get those special nuances of utter blandness , did he edit the film ?
Who , exactly , did what in this movie ?
I cannot tell , and even a certain knowledge of Kershner 's past work ( " Eyes of Laura Mars , " " The Return of a Man Called Horse , " " Loving " ) gives me no hints about the extent of his contributions to this movie .
" The Empire Strikes Back " is about as personal as a Christmas card from a bank .
I assume that Lucas supervised the entire production and made the major decisions or , at least , approved of them .
It looks like a movie that was directed at a distance .
At this point the adventures of Luke , Leia and Han Solo appear to be a self - sustaining organism , beyond criticism except on a corporate level .
I am getting frustrated by the number of people calling any HTTP - based interface a REST API .
Today ’s example is the SocialSite REST API .
That is RPC .
It screams RPC .
There is so much coupling on display that it should be given an X rating .
What needs to be done to make the REST architectural style clear on the notion that hypertext is a constraint ?
In other words , if the engine of application state ( and hence the API ) is not being driven by hypertext , then it cannot be RESTful and cannot be a REST API .
Period .
Is there some broken manual somewhere that needs to be fixed ?
API designers , please note the following rules before calling your creation a REST API :
A REST API should not be dependent on any single communication protocol , though its successful mapping to a given protocol may be dependent on the availability of metadata , choice of methods , etc .
In general , any protocol element that uses a URI for identification must allow any URI scheme to be used for the sake of that identification .
[ Failure here implies that identification is not separated from interaction . ]
A REST API should not contain any changes to the communication protocols aside from filling - out or fixing the details of underspecified bits of standard protocols , such as HTTP ’s PATCH method or Link header field .
Workarounds for broken implementations ( such as those browsers stupid enough to believe that HTML defines HTTP ’s method set ) should be defined separately , or at least in appendices , with an expectation that the workaround will eventually be obsolete .
[ Failure here implies that the resource interfaces are object - specific , not generic . ]
A REST API should spend almost all of its descriptive effort in defining the media type(s ) used for representing resources and driving application state , or in defining extended relation names and / or hypertext - enabled mark - up for existing standard media types .
Any effort spent describing what methods to use on what URIs of interest should be entirely defined within the scope of the processing rules for a media type ( and , in most cases , already defined by existing media types ) .
[ Failure here implies that out - of - band information is driving interaction instead of hypertext . ]
A REST API must not define fixed resource names or hierarchies ( an obvious coupling of client and server ) .
Servers must have the freedom to control their own namespace .
Instead , allow servers to instruct clients on how to construct appropriate URIs , such as is done in HTML forms and URI templates , by defining those instructions within media types and link relations .
[ Failure here implies that clients are assuming a resource structure due to out - of band information , such as a domain - specific standard , which is the data - oriented equivalent to RPC ’s functional coupling ] .
A REST API should never have “ typed ” resources that are significant to the client .
Specification authors may use resource types for describing server implementation behind the interface , but those types must be irrelevant and invisible to the client .

New voters in S.C. could help Obama
GREENVILLE , S.C.  Former Democratic National Committee chairman Don Fowler is n't ready to bet money on Barack Obama winning the Palmetto State in the Nov. 4 presidential election .
But Fowler , chairman of Columbia - based Fowler Communications , said a confluence of factors makes it possible that this stronghold of Deep South conservatism could fall from the ranks of the GOP for the first time since Jimmy Carter in 1976 and for only the second since John F. Kennedy in 1960 .
His arguments include :
• More Democrats turned out for their presidential primary in January than Republicans did for theirs , 529,000 to 443,000 , according to South Carolina Election Commission figures .
That has never happened before , according to commission spokesman Chris Whitmire .
• The Obama campaign , energized by an overwhelming victory in the state primary , has been very active in registering new voters here .
Even with a purge of 300,000 inactive voters from the rolls last fall , the total number of voters registered in the state grew by 2.2 % , including a 2.6 % increase in non-white voters , and more than 20,000 new young voters , according to the Election Commission .
• Obama campaigned heavily in South Carolina , which held the first primary in the South .
He drew big crowds , particularly of young people .
About 29,000 people came to see him with Oprah Winfrey in Columbia .

Although John McCain won the state 's Republican primary , Fowler said the Arizona senator was criticized by many GOP voters as too liberal on such issues as immigration .
That perception has been altered by McCain 's selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to run as vice president , said former governor Jim Edwards , who was elected in 1974 and was the first Republican governor of South Carolina since Reconstruction .
Edwards supported Mitt Romney during the primary , and he said he was disappointed when McCain did n't pick the former Massachusetts governor as his running mate .
Still , Edwards said he thinks McCain " knocked a home run " when he chose Palin as his running mate .
" I had no idea McCain would ever have the courage to pick someone like that , a female , particularly from Alaska , " Edwards said .
" I have n't seen this kind of excitement in the Republican Party since Ronald Reagan . "
State GOP chairman Katon Dawson said his party is n't taking the state for granted , but he said he believes South Carolina voters will never go for " the most liberal Democrat ticket we 've faced in a long time . "
Dawson said Republicans in the state are " going to work as if we were one vote behind .
We 're going to talk about the issues that matter to South Carolina , the issues that make the two parties different and the issues that make the campaigns different . "
According to the latest Rasmussen Reports poll released Sept. 20 , McCain was leading Obama 51 % to 45 % .
Among Obama supporters , 84 % said they are supporting him " with enthusiasm , " while 63 % of McCain supporters said they are enthusiastic about him .
George W. Bush won the state both in 2000 and 2004 with 57 % and 58 % of the vote , respectively .
People like Jil Littlejohn , 29 , an accountant and co-chair of the Young Democrats of Greenville County , are working across the state to try to give Obama an edge .
" South Carolina has definitely had an influx of younger people and transplants , and it 's going to be important that we reach those voters and get them to come out to the polls , " she said .
For some McCain supporters in Greenville , S.C. , it 's not so much a matter of being for him as it is being against Obama — and sticking to the party line .
Byron Beckham , 36 , an unemployed heavy mechanical worker , said he does n't blame the economic problems on the GOP and will remain a straight - ticket Republican .
" The main problem I have with Democratic government is they tax us to death and put the money in the pockets of people that do n't need it , " he said .
Obama supporters see current economic conditions as ample reason to support the Obama - Joe Biden ticket .
" Truly it 's the worst times I have ever seen since my existence on this planet , " said Greg Johnson , owner of O.J's Diner .
He blames Bush for the high gas prices .
" Our prices are going through the roof because of that . "
Oliver Durham , 69 , a retired loading dock worker who now runs an exterminating business , believes Bush 's economic philosophy has been proved wrong .
" The economy can never be built from the top down , " he said .
" Bush said he 'll give the top 2 % of people a tax break so they can create some jobs .
Where are the jobs ?
All our jobs have gone overseas . "
An Obama victory is still a long shot at best , according to Larry Sabato , director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia .
" If Obama even comes close in South Carolina , we 'll have an early election night and a substantial Democratic victory for the presidency , " he said .
Barnett reports for The Greenville ( S.C. ) News .
During the Automotive crisis that has erupted in the last few weeks , many false narratives are being implanted by the right wing thugs that helped push our economy off the cliff .
Eric Boehlert tackles this latest smear that our media is ignoring .
Do n't you think it would be important for our media to actually do some in depth reporting on this issue instead of reciting misleading , conservative talking points ?
Indeed , that $ 70 - an - hour meme , actively promoted by the anti-union conservative media , has ricocheted around the traditional press as well as the political landscape , where it was picked up by congressional critics last week during hearings and used to argue against aiding GM , Ford , and Chrysler .
But what 's obvious to me is that it 's harmful to public discourse when the press , on such a central issue facing our country , fails to clearly state the facts and instead perpetuates misinformation with sloppy reporting -- reporting that seems to hold blue - collar workers to a different standard than their white - collar counterparts .
But having the media echo conservative misinformation and bandy about urban - myth salary figures about allegedly high - on - the - hog GM workers does not constitute a careful review of the facts .
Question :
Is the press just being sloppy on this issue of supposedly pampered autoworkers , or are there other elements in play ?
Because honestly , I 've had trouble escaping the not - very - subtle elitist , get - a - load - of - this tone that has run through the media 's misinformation on the topic ; i.e. , " These autoworkers get paid that ? ! "
Answer :
No , they do n't , so please stop reporting it .
( And why has the press been so reticent to note that Big Three autoworkers recently made significant concessions to management ? )
Make no mistake :
The $ 70 - an - hour claim represents a classic case of conservative misinformation .
It 's also a very dangerous one .
The falsehood about autoworkers is being spread at a crucial time , when a make - or - break public debate is taking place , a debate that could affect millions of American workers ... read on
- He took every opportunity to identify areas where he and John McCain actually agreed on approaches .
( " I agree with John ... " might have seemed an over - used trope in the first debate .
This time , very selectively , it helped in the control - the - center strategy . )
- He took most opportunities to remain calm , to stay above the fray , to seem amused rather than frazzled , not to take personal offense .
As mentioned earlier , he was not quite as perfectly self - contained as in earlier performances .
But compared with McCain , he was the one -- in a good sense -- who had taken Prozac , while McCain seemed to be in a ' roid rage .
And because of this general self - possession -- realizing , for instance , that there was only upside in being gracious about Sarah Palin -- when he decided to bear down , as in the breathtaking " At your running mate 's rallies , when someone mentions my name they say ' Terrorist ' and ' Kill him , ' " it was the more powerful .
If you go down the same list , you can see that McCain did just about the opposite on every one of the counts .
His most effective rhetorical line was that if Obama wanted to run against President Bush , he could have done so four years ago .
( For that matter , so could McCain . )
But that was undercut , according to the logic above , by emphasizing tactics over issues , by emphasizing partisan division over conciliation , by body - language contempt for his opponent , and by a demeanor that reinforced the short - tempered and dyspeptic impression from the previous debates .
Whatever the instant polls said , however you lined up the debating flow , the person who was already ahead had a plan that could gain him more support , and the one who was behind played to the base .
Concluding points :
- This format is the winner , compared with all the others we have seen .
Forces a kind of personal engagement -- though the fact that this was the third and final round probably made a difference too .
Clarifying discussion of actual substance , from health care to abortion , and rawly - honest seeming exchange about the excesses of the campaign .
- Bob Schieffer was a winner , raising provocative issues without being mindlessly horse - race oriented or too obsessed with time .
His questions about dirty campaign tactics and about Sarah Palin were exemplary in this regard .
- McCain did not help himself with a number of lapses and minor gaffes , from the nature of Trig Palin 's disability to the policy of the DC schools .
Nor his Tourette 's - like perseveration with the dreaded " overhead projector " in Chicago and hyperbole about Ayers and ACORN , which is allegedly " destroying the fabric of our democracy . "
- I love America .
In what other country would the finalists for the presidency have the extended " Joe the Plumber " exchanges ?
On the other hand , I do n't want ever to hear about Joe the Plumber again .
Convicted penny - stock spammer Eddie Davidson walked away from a federal minimum - security prison camp in Colorado on Sunday , the U.S. Department of Justice said Tuesday .
Davidson , 35 , had been serving 21 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to criminal spam charges in December .
He is now considered an escapee and is being pursued by U.S. marshals , with help from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation , the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and local police .
He earned millions of dollars between 2003 and 2006 by operating a spamming operation , called Power Promoters , out of his home .
He would change the header information in his messages to make it appear as if they had come from legitimate companies such as AOL and then send them out to hundreds of thousands of addresses .
Davidson sent the messages on behalf of an unnamed Houston company , court filings state .
He was asked to promote about 19 penny - stock companies , including one called Advanced Power Line Technologies in 2006 and 2007 .
He would earn fees based on the trading volume of the stocks he was promoting .
The business was lucrative : The Houston company paid Davidson about US $ 1.4 million for his services , court documents state .
Between 2003 and 2006 , when his primary source of income was spam , bank account deposits into Davidson 's account totalled about $ 3.5 million .
Davidson , of Bennett , Colorado , had been incarcerated at the Florence Federal Correctional Complex , about 45 miles south of Colorado Springs .
Across the country , cities are passing new laws to allow backyard chickens .
Cities across the country have shown new leniency in the urban chicken arena .
Ann Arbor , Michigan , South Portland , Maine and Fort Collins Colorado , have all voted in the past year to allow backyard chickens .
They join the growing number of U.S. cities to make legal the raising of poultry in the backyard .
Illegal or not , city chicken flocks are more popular than ever .
“ It ’s no longer something kinky or interesting , ” said Jac Smit , president of the Urban Agriculture Network .
“ The ‘ chicken underground ’ has really spread so widely and has so much support . ”
Though some worry that backyard chickens might carry and transmit avian flu , advocates of urban chicken farming claim that farming poultry on a small scale presents less of a risk of disease than large - scale production .
Some cities , however , are less concerned about disease , than they are about noise , and nuisance , and have put limits of the number of roosters one household can keep in their yard .
Making backyard chickens legal is a good move for cities interested in reducing their ecological footprint .
Urban chickens provide a local source of eggs , meat and manure .
And do n’t worry .
If you ’re squeamish about chopping off chicken heads , there ’s a new business popping up in mobile slaughterhouses .
“ It ’s no longer huge slaughterhouses doing millions [ of birds ] , ” Smit said , “ It ’s a guy driving around on a truck , visiting neighborhood to neighborhood , ” “ And it ’s not chickens only … .
Duck , turkey , and quail are particularly attractive . ”
What ’s your city ’s ruling on chickens ?

WHEN I first stuck my head above the parapet to say I did n't believe what we were being told about global warming , I had no idea what the consequences would be .
I am a scientist and I have to follow the directions of science , but when I see that the truth is being covered up I have to voice my opinions .
According to official data , in every year since 1998 , world temperatures have been getting colder , and in 2002 Arctic ice actually increased .
Why , then , do we not hear about that ?
The sad fact is that since I said I did n't believe human beings caused global warming , I 've not been allowed to make a television program .
{ snip }
I 've seen evidence , which I believe , that says there has not been a rise in global temperature since 1998 , despite the increase in carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere .
This makes me think the global warmers are telling lies : CO2 is not the driver .
The idiot fringe has accused me of being like a Holocaust denier , which is ludicrous .
Climate change is all about cycles .
It 's a natural thing and has always happened .
When the Romans lived in Britain they were growing very good red grapes and making wine on the borders of Scotland .
It was evidently a lot warmer .
{ snip }
There 's no proof , it 's just projections , and if you look at the models people such as Gore use , you can see they cherry - pick the ones that support their beliefs .
To date , the way the so - called Greens and the BBC , the Royal Society and even political parties have handled this smacks of McCarthyism at its worst .
The Australian
Yes , the lakes in Africa are drying up .
But that 's not global warming .
They 're drying up for the very simple reason that most of them have dams around them .
{ snip }
The thing that annoys me most is that there are genuine environmental problems that desperately require attention .
I 'm still an environmentalist , I 'm still a Green and I 'm still campaigning to stop the destruction of the biodiversity of the world .
{ snip }
Mother nature will balance things out , but not if we interfere by destroying rainforests and overfishing the seas .
That is where the real environmental catastrophe could occur .
My view : who cares .
It 's clear we 're committing ecocide in many ways .
Carbon may be the least of our worries regarding pollutants .
The real killer is that we 're taking up space animals need for our housing , farming , infrastructure , etc .
The only solution : fewer people .
That 's why people love global warming .
It 's a surrogate for actual action on the human - caused changes to our world , and an easier one : buy green products !
buy carbon credits !
Be trendy !

Stephen Harper continued his party 's focus on anti-crime proposals Tuesday , saying a re-elected Conservative government would amend the Criminal Code to ensure serious indictable crimes are not eligible for conditional house arrest sentences .
Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion attacked Harper 's plan at a town hall event at the University of British Columbia on Tuesday night , saying Harper 's proposal would cost Canadian taxpayers $ 2.2 billion .
" You will have more crowded jails than ever , " Dion said .
" People will leave these jails one day , and the number of re-offending crimes will go up , and Canada will not be safer . "
" This strategy failed the United States .
It will fail in Canada , " Dion said .
Harper 's announcement comes a day after the Conservative leader 's pledge that young people 14 and over convicted of crimes such as manslaughter , murder or aggravated assault would face tougher sentences , and no longer have their identities protected .
Speaking in Saskatchewan , Harper said his government 's past attempts to end house arrest were thwarted by the Liberals , NDP and the Bloc Québécois during the last session of Parliament .
" Unlike the opposition parties , we do n’t believe that house arrest is a suitable punishment for those who commit these kinds of crimes , and Canadians do n’t believe it , either , " Harper said during an appearance in Saskatoon while campaigning for the Oct. 14 federal election .
The Conservatives say more than 11,150 criminals were serving conditional sentences in 2006 , including 2,791 convicted of violent crimes .
Measures ' restore balance ' : Harper
Harper said crimes the Conservatives would make ineligible for house arrest include :
Serious property crimes , such as robbery , auto theft , breaking and entering , and arson .
Weapons offences , such as possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose .
Serious vehicular crimes , such as impaired driving causing bodily harm or death .
Drug trafficking , kidnapping and trafficking in persons .
When asked how many new jail cells would be needed , Harper said the number is " not enormous " and the cost would be " small and manageable . "
Harper also dismissed questions by reporters over concerns by some criminologists and police who say the Tories ' previously announced measures are heavy - handed and would n't make Canada any safer .
" Yes , we believe they 're wrong , " Harper said .
" We 're listening to ordinary people , not people who work in ivory towers , but people who actually work on the street and deal with crime on a day - to - day basis . "
Studies in the U.S. have shown that the states with the toughest prison sentences had the least success in driving down crime rates in the 1990s .
One result of longer sentences is costlier prisons that absorb resources that could otherwise be spent on more police officers or crime - prevention programs .
Harper , who has acknowledged that crime rates have fallen in many areas in recent years , said his party is pursuing the measures " to restore balance to a system that had been getting progressively more unbalanced for over 30 years .
" Our party believes that the foundation of our criminal justice system should not be the welfare of criminals , but rather , the protection of honest , hard - working citizens and their families , " he said .
" We believe that offenders do have rights , but they also have responsibilities , and that victims also have rights . "

The next version of Ubuntu 's free Linux operating system , dubbed " Intrepid Ibex , " is due out Oct. 30 , but the beta release is up for grabs .
Although the desktop has n't been reshaped , the features tweaked just a little bit , and most of the work focused on compatibility and usability ( not that those are bad things , by any means ) , there are still some neat new tools and tweaks that are worth checking out .
Read on for our picture - filled take on the new Ubuntu .

Installation and boot - up
The basics of putting a live CD in your drive , trying the desktop or installing the system are basically the same as with Hardy Heron , with a few welcome differences .
The most confusing / imposing part of the process , the partition editor , shows you a graphical view of what you 're doing , thereby explaining what each option does a lot better .
Advertisement
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Ibex also supports importing browser data , backgrounds , music and pictures from Windows XP and , new to this version , Vista .
Once you 've installed the system and booted up , you might notice a new setting in the multi- boot menu : " Last successful boot . "
That 's an indication that Ubuntu keeps track of which Linux kernels actually work for your system , and lets it delete old ones and prevent them from cluttering up the boot menu .
Desktop changes
There 's a chance , however small , that Ubuntu 8.10 might just get the graphical overhaul that was promised for 8.04 .
Ibex uses a slightly updated version of the brown / orange - centered " Human " theme — status bars glow , a few icons were changed , and buttons have a warm glow .
Other than that , the desktop is a pretty familiar affair :
Advertisement
What you will notice around your desktop are the improvements to Nautilus , the baked - in file browser and desktop manager .
Tabbed browsing is the biggie , but there 's also easy - eject icons placed in the sidebar for hot - plugged drives and partitions , and the built - in encrypted private directory .
Advertisement
A lot of tweaks have been made to Ubuntu 's network manager , which was more than a little finicky with certain wireless cards and non-standard set -ups .
It now handles 3G and cellular connections better , does n't freak out at having multiple connections ( e.g. wireless and wired ) , and contains many other fixes .
I particularly like the " Auto Linksys " mode , which is great for traveling or setting up at less - tech - inclined spots .
( Edit : Turns out 8.10 's " Auto " mode can actually be set to any router SSID it finds ; " Auto HomeRouter , " for example . )

External monitors and graphics in general have gotten a good bit of attention , and , at least in the case of my ThinkPad / LCD combo , I got a kind - of - working setup right from boot - up .
In general , Ubuntu has worked at killing off the need to ever have to manually hack around in the archaic xorg .
conf file — the entirety of my Ibex file is thumbnailed at right ( Edit : Taken from the VirtualBox install I did for boot - up screenshots , but the copy on my hard - installed Ibex is nearly identical ) .
Having said that , I still had to manually tweak the resolution on my LCD monitor , and a logout / reboot messed my taskbars some , but I could easily drag and drop windows between screens .
Unfortunately , that 's only just below par for a modern OS , so let 's hope a great settings tool gets written or revamped soon .
Advertisement
Finally , the administration window for enabling proprietary devices — NVidia graphics cards , wireless chips without open - source drivers and the like — has gotten a bit more explanatory as to what it 's doing , and offers a choice of drivers for those experiencing bugs .
Not sure if I enjoy seeing this much imposing text to just get 3D desktop effects working .

Other good things
Here 's a few of Ubuntu 8.10 's other highlights :
" Guest " log - in : If a friend / significant other / shoulder - peeker wants to check their Facebook page , and you 're afraid of what curious hands can do to your system , you can log out , boot into " Guest , " and the user can't change any settings or alter / access files .
( So , why was n't this here before ? )

Your take
If you 've been using the 8.10 alphas all along , or were hoping for more , we 'd like to hear your take .
Tell us what 's good and still not quite gravy in Intrepid Ibex in the comments .
Every morning for a year , Rob Vincent walked into a clinic on the edge of Vancouver 's roughest neighborhood , rolled up his sleeves and injected pharmaceutical heroin .
Each time , Mr. Vincent played the role of guinea pig in a controversial , three - year , government - funded experiment that supporters hope will change the face of addiction treatment in this picturesque but drug - riddled western port city .
The findings of the North American Opiate Medication Initiative , or NAOMI , were released here on Oct. 17 and the results , researchers say , are " remarkable . "
" Heroin - assisted treatment ( HAT ) is very safe when done properly , " Dr. Martin Schechter , NAOMI 's principal investigator , said at a news conference held to announce the findings .
" Our results show it to be very effective . "
The study is the latest effort made by a city with a history of employing often counterintuitive methods of tackling its drug problem .
But while advocates tout the study 's results , critics say the efforts amount to nothing more than a band - aid solution and a dangerous step toward legalizing drugs .
Fluctuating levels of local and federal support could either undergird or derail the effort here , and , with heroin demand increasing worldwide , it 's a debate other nations are monitoring .
How does the treatment work ?
HAT targets chronic addicts who have repeatedly tried but failed to kick the addiction that consumes their lives and devours taxpayer dollars through hospital trips and policing costs .
Instead , they are given controlled doses of heroin in a supervised clinic .
Researchers believed it would allow addicts to reduce their overall drug use , participate in less crime , and stay in treatment longer .
" This is a group , frankly , that society has written off as being beyond help , " says Dr. Schechter , the director of the University of British Columbia 's School of Population and Public Health .
Vincent , the drug user , says that he tried to quit heroin seven or eight times before entering the NAOMI study .
But he was always pulled back by the persistent cravings that left him ill .
" It 's not something that I would wish on anybody , " says Vincent .
With doses of heroin given three times a day at the clinic , Vincent stopped spending his days and nights trawling for his next hit .
For the first time in years , he found part - time work , unloading shipping containers down at the city 's port .
" I was actually able to live a normal life , " says Vincent .
A majority of participants had comparable results , NAOMI researchers found .
After 12 months in the study , illicit heroin use fell by almost 70 percent .
The number of days participants said they spent being involved in " illegal activity " was halved , as was the reported amount of money spent on drugs .
And 88 percent of those treated with heroin remained in treatment for at least one year .
In a climate where the thought of prescribing heroin to addicts might make the federal government queasy , proponents still see offering the drug in a range of treatment programs as a realistic option .
" Many people believe that we need a different approach , " says Vancouver Mayor Sam Sullivan , who wants to see a clinic set up " tomorrow . "
Vancouver is home to a concentrated and very visible addiction problem that has shamed and confounded successive governments .
One local advocacy group estimates there are 5,000 injection drug users living in the 12 - block neighborhood locals used to call skid row : the Downtown Eastside .
And with Vancouver set to become a specimen under the international microscope of the 2010 Winter Olympics , there is an added urgency to address the problem .
" I think that once the citizens realize how much crime is going down , how much the load on our health services is going down , how much cheaper it is for everyone , that there 's going to be a demand for this kind of program , " Mr. Sullivan says .
Critics decry slippery slope
Yet others see the study 's results as another wobbly step in the wrong direction .
" Giving drugs as a method of treatment is a bunch of nonsense , " says Al Arsenault , a 27 - year veteran of the Vancouver Police Department , now retired .
" These guys just do n't get it .
Drug addicts need the cure , not the poison . "
Mr. Arsenault said he agrees with addiction specialists that a small group of addicts will not quit drugs .
But he argues the focus should instead be on increasing treatment options for all drug users , not prescribing drugs to the chronic abusers .
" What they 're doing is they want to legalize drugs , when there 's not enough treatment centers available , " Arsenault says .
" That 's totally backwards .
" You do n't start there , substituting one drug for another to keep them chemically addled in the corner , " he says .
But the study 's researchers remain confident in their findings .
" Based on the evidence , " says Schechter , " we could apply and we will apply to have heroin licensed . "
Is your Omega - 3 fish oil supplement any good - or a load of old codswallop ?
Fish oil supplements on test :
Are they value for money or good for your health ?
We have been told to take more of it , and there 's strong evidence that Omega 3 really is crucial for our brains , hearts and immune systems .
We do n't need any more convincing , it seems - keen to improve our brainpower , we now spend £ 60 million a year on Omega 3 pills .
But according to an expert , many people may be wasting their money , because they end up with supplements providing little or no benefit .
Dr Alex Richardson , of the charity Food & Behaviour Research , and one of the world 's leading researchers into Omega 3 , says the poor quality of many supplements is a concern .
' There are different kinds of Omega 3 - not all of which have the same health benefits , ' she says .
One of the main problems , she explains , is that supplements often contain little , if any , EPA ( eicosapentaenoic acid ) and DHA ( docosahexaenoic acid ) - the most important forms of Omega 3 .
' What 's more , at the moment there is no official recommended daily allowance of Omega 3 . '
So taking a pill to boost your brainpower and health is far from straightforward .
Dr Richardson believes this confusion is ' disastrous - because consuming more of the vital Omega 3 fats found in fish and seafood is probably the single most important dietary change that most people could make to improve their health ' .
' It 's well - known that Omega 3s are important for staving off heart attacks and strokes , and are good for eyesight and inflammatory conditions such as arthritis .
But it 's less well - known that EPA and DHA are crucial for brain function and mental well - being .
' However , surveys show that nine out of ten Britons do n't get the minimum they need to maintain a healthy heart ( around 500 mg / day ) , let alone to support optimal brain and immune system functioning ( 1000 mg / day ) . '
The best way to get nutrients is from food ; for Omega 3s , this means everyone should eat two to four portions of fish a week , one of them oily .
But if this is n't possible , taking a supplement is the next best option , says Dr Richardson .
So if you do resort to an Omega - 3 pill , how can you make sure you find ones that make a difference ?
' In the absence of an official recommended daily amount , start by choosing products that contain EPA and DHA , ' says Dr Richardson .
' This usually means fish oils .
Vegetarian Omega 3 supplements usually contain none at all : instead , they are made with linseed or flax oil , which provide a different form of Omega 3 . '
They 're not a complete waste of money , she adds , but vegetarians would be better off taking ones containing DHA from algae .
Next , ignore any doses suggested on the packet , and focus on the small print to find out how much EPA and DHA combined the product provides .
' A good target for mental well - being and performance is 1000 mg per day , ' she says .
And to get this amount , you may well need to take more than the manufacturer 's suggested dose .
How they compare ...
Do n't waste your money :
And do n't bother splashing out on the more expensive combination supplements containing Omega 3 , 6 and 9 .
Our bodies produce our own Omega 9 - and it is also found in nuts , seeds , avocados and olive oil .
And as for Omega 6 , found in vegetable oils , meat , eggs and dairy , we should be trying to reduce rather than boost it - a diet low in Omega 3 and high in Omega 6 is linked to a range of conditions , including heart disease , depression , allergies and cancer .
To help you make the best choice we asked Dr Richardson to assess 14 leading brands of Omega - 3 supplements .
She then rated them according to a number of criteria , including the quality of the oil and other factors affecting ease of absorption , for instance .
There are three types of fish oils .
The first are the most expensive : ' ultra - refined ' oils , which have the lowest possible levels pollutants such as mercury and lead .
The oil is also highly concentrated , and the refining process removes the compounds responsible for the ' fishy ' taste and gastric discomfort some pills can cause .
The next are ' concentrates ' .
These do n't provide as much EPA and DHA per gram as the ultra - refined , but they do give you more than basic oils .
Some fishy taste may remain , as well as some level of pollutants - they are not as pure as the ultra -refined .
Safe to take :
However , all products are required to comply with EU legislation on food safety and pollution , so levels should n't pose a health risk .
Finally , there are the ' basic ' , no -frills oils - typically supermarket brands .
Overall , Dr Richardson found the very best are the ultra - refined oils , such as Omega Swirl .
And although these usually cost more initially , when you look at how much you 'd need to spend on them a month to get the optimal Omega 3 dose , these oils can be much better value for money than the cheaper pills .
Price is not always a good guide , for example , the Seven Seas Triomega supplement has some of the lowest levels of EPA and DHA in our survey , but it is actually the most expensive .
Commenting on our findings , the Health Food Manufacturers '
Association said : ' Although no formal RDA exists , an intake of between 500 and 600 mg per day EPA plus DHA would be the typical recommendation and it is true that some supplements provide less than this amount .
The HFMA is in the process of preparing a recommendation for an Omega - 3 RDA at the moment . '
Anyone taking blood - thinning medications should consult their doctor before boosting their fish oils intake .

My strip - search trauma at Dubai airport by Lily ... and her showbiz pals Agy and Rhys
Some of Britain ’s best - known stars – including singer Lily Allen and supermodel Agyness Deyn – were subjected to intimate strip - searches on their way to the lavish launch of the world ’s most expensive resort in Dubai .
Actor Rhys Ifans and Ms Deyn ’s rock - star boyfriend Albert Hammond Jnr were also among more than 100 guests examined by Dubai Customs officials to ensure they were not smuggling drugs into the country .
Ms Allen said she was left ‘ terrified ’ by her ordeal , while Ms Deyn said she found her treatment ‘ traumatic ’ .
All smiles : Lily Allen enjoyed herself at the Aquaventure water park in Atlantis but the airport strip search was no laughing matter
The United Arab Emirates has a strict anti-drugs policy .
Earlier this year British tourist Keith Brown was jailed for four years after a microscopic speck of cannabis was found on the sole of his shoe .
Officials targeted guests heading to the £ 20 million four - day bash at the Atlantis resort last week , including many who have reputations for heavy partying .
Ms Allen , for instance , has openly admitted to taking drugs since the age of 13 .
She told The Mail on Sunday she was subjected to an hour - long search at Dubai airport on Wednesday night .
The 23 - year - old said : ‘ I was strip - searched , which was so nice as soon as you arrive .
I knew I did n’t have anything on me so I was n’t worried .
I was n’t paranoid , just terrified .
‘ It was at the airport and took more than an hour .
It was really scary as they did n’t tell you what they were doing , they just said , “ Take off trousers ” and I was like , “ Ahhh help ” . ’
Resort launch : Agyness Deyn ( left ) , seen here with Natalie Imbruglia at the grand opening of Atlantis in Dubai , and her boyfriend Albert Hammond Jr ( behind Natalie Imbruglia ) were subjected to humiliating strip searches
Ms Deyn , 25 , said : ‘ Both Albert and I were strip - searched .
It was really traumatic .
It was n’t the best experience in the world but it is their culture and you just have to respect it . ’
Mr Ifans , who once said he lived ‘ Don Juan moments of sex , drugs and drink for maybe months , seasons , years even ’ did not wish to speak about his experience .
But one of his travel companions said : ‘ Rhys quivered to jelly as soon as the officers approached him .
He was beside himself with worry .
They made him strip bare and poked him about with plastic gloves .
‘ He had to hold his private parts out of the way while an officer did a thorough inspection .
After nearly two hours of being interrogated and molested he was told to put his clothes back on and go on his way .
‘ He was very scared and at one point was close to tears as he honestly thought he was going to be banged up .
It ’s really put the wind up him .
It will be the only thing he will remember about the trip – he tells everyone he comes into contact with .
‘ Normally he ’s a jokey guy but this has been no laughing matter for him . ’
Other guests at the four - day extravaganza to open the £ 1 billion resort included Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood , film stars Wesley Snipes and Lindsay Lohan , and singers Kylie Minogue and Shirley Bassey .
Organisers did fear that Dubai ’s strict laws would cause a problem for guests , and issued them all with a leaflet warning of the dangers of bringing drugs into the country .
‘ It ’s been very embarrassing for the organisers , ’ said one insider .
‘ They got celebrities for the publicity , and in return the stars were promised they would be treated like royalty .
Many of them feel very shaken and violated by the strip searches .
It ’s ruined their trip .’.
The cognitive science journal Cortex has just released a special issue on the neuropsychology of paranormal experiences and belief , and contains a fantastic article on hallucinations induced by the Ganzfeld procedure .
The Ganzfeld procedure exposes the participant to ‘ unstructured ’ sensations usually by placing half ping - pong balls over the eyes so they can only see diffuse white light and by playing white noise through headphones .
It is probably best known for its uses in parapsychology experiments , but it is also used to induce hallucinations and sensory distortions which are much more likely to occur in the absence of clearly defined sensory experiences .
The article reviews the sorts of hallucinations reported in during these experiments and discusses what electrophysiology ( EEG or ‘ brain wave ’ ) studies tell us about what happens in the cortex when these perceptual distortions kick off .
Some of the descriptions of hallucinations are really quite striking :
“ For quite a long time , there was nothing except a green - greyish fog .
It was really boring , I thought , ‘ah , what a non-sense experiment ! ’
Then , for an indefinite period of time , I was ‘ off ’ , like completely absent - minded .
Then , all of sudden , I saw a hand holding a piece of chalk and writing on a black - board something like a mathematical formula .
The vision was very clear , but it stayed only for few seconds and disappeared again .
The image did not fill up the entire visual field , it was just like a ‘ window ’ into that foggy stuff . ” “ an urban scenery , like an empty avenue after a rain , large areas covered with water , and the city sky - line reflected in the water surface like in a mirror . ” “ a clearing in a forest [ Lichtung ] , a place bathed in bright sun-shine , and the trunks of trees around .
A feeling of a tranquile summer afternoon in a forest , so quiet , so peaceful .
And then , suddenly , a young woman passed by on a bicycle , very fast , she crossed the visual field from the right to the left , with her blond long hair waving in the air .
The image of the entire scene was very clear , with many details , and yes , the colours were very vivid . ”
“ I can see his face , still , it ’s very expressive … [ I could see ] only the horse that comes as if out of clouds .
A white horse that jumped over me . ”
“ A friend of mine and I , we were inside a cave .
We made a fire .
There was a creek flowing under our feet , and we were on a stone .
She had fallen into the creek , and she had to wait to have her things dried .
Then she said to me : ‘ Hey , move on , we should go now ’ . ”
“ It was like running a bob sleigh on an uneven runway right down … [ There ] was snow or maybe water running down …
I could hear music , there was music coming from the left side below . ”
“ In the right side of the visual field , a manikin suddenly appeared .
He was all in black , had a long narrow head , fairly broad shoulders , very long arms and a relatively small trunk … .
He approached me , stretching out his hands , very long , very big , like a bowl , and he stayed so for a while , and then he went back to where he came from , slowly . ”
You can simulate the Ganzfeld procedure in your own home by taping two half ping - pong balls over your eyes and listing to the radio tuned to static in an evenly lighted room .
The other articles in the special issue are also fascinating , and range from a study finding greater body asymmetry is related to higher levels of unusual beliefs – likely reflecting asymmetrical brain development , to an experiment looking at the cognitive psychology of people who believe they ’ve been abducted by aliens .
Needless to say , there ’s many more fascinating studies and Cortex has the advantage of not only being a leading neuropsychology journal but also making its material freely available as open - access articles .
Enjoy !

' They ask me where hip - hop is goin ' , it 's Chica - goan , " said Common on a 2005 track , " Chi City " , dedicated to his home town .
Three years later and one has the feeling that the rapper 's prognosis was correct .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Last month , amid the opulence of London 's Somerset House , fellow Chicagoan Lupe Fiasco told his audience that " I 'm from a city in the Midwest , best city in the whole , wide , wide world " .
The previous day , Common had been in London , promoting his album Invincible Summer .
Meanwhile , on an airfield outside Stratford - upon - Avon , preparations were being made for the headline performance of Kanye West at Britain 's premier dance - music festival , Global Gathering .
Fiasco , clad in neck - tie and waistcoat , revealed he had been named by Esquire as one of the 10 best - dressed men in the world .
West , the son of an English professor , is a masterful rap producer who dresses preppily .
And Common , though still able to reach out to the streets , now provides the subtle backing to many a middle - class dinner party .
Back in the Windy City , The Cool Kids , a duo comprising of Antoine " Mikey Rocks " Reed and Evan " Chuck Inglish " Ingersoll , are tipped by Rolling Stone as one of the 10 artists to watch , following the release of their album When Fish Ride Bicycles .
Inspired by old skool rap legends Eric B & Rakim but also taking in styles from the West Coast and the Southern states , The Cool Kids are at the forefront of a new wave of Chicago rap artists that also includes Kid Sista , Flosstradamus and Kidz in the Hall .
Together , they are straddling genres and introducing new audiences to hip - hop .
This is something different from the harder , angrier sound of so much other rap music .
Though these Chicagoans are all lyricists capable of giving the listener a sharp reality check , they are just as likely to bring a smile to your face .
And though it is not a movement as such , these artists collaborate in their work – with West as the hub , guesting on the tracks of Common , Lupe Fiasco and Kid Sista alike .
As a result , Chicago is now a hip - hop hot spot .
It has been a long process , this creation of a bastion of rap in a city long regarded by the hip - hop establishment as flyover space in a game fought out between the East and West coasts .
Born in the South Bronx , galvanised by Compton , hip - hop has historically been associated with New York and Los Angeles .
That 's not to say that Chicago does n't have a fine musical tradition .
This is the city , after all , of Curtis Mayfield and The Impressions .
During the Sixties and Seventies , the city had its own distinctive Chicago Soul sound , shaped by record labels such as Vee - Jay , Chess Records and OKeh .
Gospel - influenced singers such as Mayfield and Jerry Butler gave a foretaste of the classy tone of recent Chicago rap .
Yet when the Eighties arrived and disco faded away , New York block parties gave birth to hip - hop , while Chicago headed off in an altogether different direction .
At a club called The Warehouse , DJ Frankie Knuckles began fusing disco beats with European electronica and the club gave its name to another genre , house music .
During the next decade , the city 's identity would be defined by house artists such as Steve " Silk " Hurley and Ten City .
None of this was particularly helpful to Chi - town 's fledgling rap community .
Ironically , it was a track that brilliantly analysed the history of hip - hop itself that enabled Common ( then Common Sense ) to break through and put down a corner stone for the future of Chicago rap .
" She was old school when I was just a shorty , never knew throughout my life she would be there for me , " Common rhymed on 1994's " I Used to Love H.E.R. " , using an extended metaphor that compared rap to a girl that he had fallen for when he was 10 years old .
The track , since referred to by hip - hop pioneer Kool Mo Dee as " one of the most conceptual records ever " , charted how the object of his affections moved from East Coast to West Coast , and became increasingly aggressive in attitude and vocabulary .
" Talkin ' about poppin ' glocks , servin ' rocks and hittin ' switches , now she 's a gangster rollin ' with gangsta bitches . "
Chicago rap was on the map .
Born Lonnie Rashied Lynn , Common , 36 , has become a celebrity in America , appearing in several films , including last year 's American Gangster , and Wanted , starring James McAvoy and Angelina Jolie .
The rapper emerged from the underground with his 2000 album Like Water for Chocolate .
The stand out track was " 6th Sense " , which echoed the battle - cry of ( Chicago - born , New York - raised ) poet and musician Gil Scott - Heron , with its opening line : " The revolution will not be televised , the revolution is here . "
Kool Mo Dee , writing in 2003 , said Common was " absolutely the most poetic emcee in the game today " .
That does not mean he has no edge .
Last year 's Finding Forever , his Grammy - winning seventh album , includes " Southside " and " Start the Show " ( both with West as producer and guest rapper ) , tracks in which Common pays tribute to his Chicago neighbourhood , name - checking the city 's notorious street gangs , such as the Black Disciples / Folks and the Blackstones , as well as James Baldwin .
A more sophisticated gangsta rap , you could say .
West 's roots are a long way from the gangs .
His father was a former Black Panther but Kanye , 31 , was raised by his mother Donda , an English professor at Chicago State University , in the affluent south - west Chicago suburb of Oak Lawn .
Yet he could reasonably claim to be the most influential figure in rap today .
An early disciple of Jay -Z , West 's extraordinary production skills were prominent on the Brooklyn rapper 's classic Blueprint album .
When West was nearly killed in a road accident , he used the incident to give himself some danger , making his breakthrough solo record " Through the Wire " with his jaw still grilled in place after surgery .
The track was one of a string of hits from West 's debut album The College Dropout , which reached No 2 on the Billboard top 200 .
Not only did the album 's use of West 's teddy - bear cartoon alter ego show his aptitude for marketing and willingness to challenge rap 's macho conventions , he also showed he could rhyme as well as produce .
The second single , " All Falls Down " , featuring Syleena Johnson , contained an inspired attack on the materialism so prevalent in hip - hop , and in society generally : " It seems we living the American dream , but the people highest up got the lowest self - esteem , the prettiest people do the ugliest things , for the road to riches and diamond rings . "
The album also featured an extended mix of " Slow Jamz " , a US No 1 single on which West guested ( alongside the actor Jamie Foxx ) for the Chicago rapper Twista , who in 1992 earned a Guinness World Record for having uttered 597 syllables in 55.12 seconds .
As his career has progressed , West has incorporated a broader fan base .
His second album , Late Registration , went to No 1 in the Billboard chart .
The huge crossover hit " Diamonds from Sierra Leone " sampled Shirley Bassey and featured his mentor , Jay - Z .
A later single , " Touch the Sky " , embraced Chicago old and new by sampling Mayfield 's epic " Move On Up " and giving a platform to upcoming rapper Fiasco .
The live show in support of the album included a 17 - piece all - female string orchestra and a spectacular video backdrop that starred , among others , Pamela Anderson .
West is no ordinary rap star and , despite his earlier criticism of high living , has frequently drawn criticism for his considerable ego .
Who better to be a figurehead for the Windy City , a term derived from the supposed braggadocio of its residents as well as its climate ?
Except that West , according to the lyrics of " Everything I Am " , where he notes that " I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah " ( a reference to her the New Jersey rapper 's Oscar - nominated appearance in the film musical ) , complains he is not always loved on his hometown 's toughest streets .
" People talk so much shit about me at barber shops , they forget to get their haircut .
OK , fair enough , the streets is flarin ' up , ' cause they want gun talk , or I do n't wear enough baggy clothes , " he says , before observing that " just last year Chicago had over 600 caskets .
Man , killing 's some whack shit . "
West 's appearance at Global Gathering , alongside international house DJ stars such as Roger Sanchez and Erick Morillo , perhaps shows that Chicago rap and the Chicago house heritage , a musical genre uplifting and positive in feel , are not mutually exclusive .
And now the third prong of this Chicago trident , Fiasco , 26 , is coming through .
One of nine children , his real name is Wasalu Muhammad Jaco and , in contrast to the stereotype of a rapper puffing on a fat blunt and swigging from a 40 - ounce beer bottle , he is a Muslim who does n't smoke or drink .
He burst onto the scene with " Kick , Push " , a skateboarding anthem from 2006's Lupe Fiasco 's Food & Liquor , which grouped him with skater icon Pharrell Williams , who contributed to the album .
Elements of Fiasco 's rapping style , laidback but sometimes speeded up , have been compared to Twista , and both are from the Westside of Chicago , home to many of the city 's migrants from the sleepier Southern states .
His second release , Lupe Fiasco's
The Cool , helped him get a slot this summer at Glastonbury 's Jazz World stage , where he responded to criticisms of Jay - Z's star billing by telling the crowd : " I want to prove all the critics wrong , I want them to see that hip - hop definitely has a place in this world " , before giving a triumphant performance .
Chicago is breathing life into hip - hop .
And now Barack Obama , who was a community worker for the Southside of Chicago , as well as a parishioner of the Trinity United Church of Christ , which Common attended , has the Democratic presidential nomination .
Last month , as he stood on a patch of dance floor in Bureau , a members - only Soho bar , Common ran through the tracks on his new album and explained how Obama had influenced him .
He said the track " Changes " had been inspired by " Hey Young World " , a 1989 song by London - born rapper Slick Rick that acknowledged some of the bad stuff in life but told listeners to party and advised them , optimistically , that " the world is yours " .
The production for " Changes " was similarly upbeat and hopeful .
" If Obama gets elected , " said Common , " then this could be his inauguration song . "
WASHINGTON ( IPS ) - A group of hard - line United States neo-conservatives and former Israeli diplomats , among others , are behind the mass distribution , ahead of the November US presidential election , of a controversial DVD that critics have denounced as Islamophobic .
The group , the Endowment for Middle East Truth ( EMET ) , is working with another organization called the Clarion Fund , which produced the 60 - minute video and is itself tied closely to an Israeli organization called Aish Hatorah .
The Fund is currently distributing some 28 million copies of the DVD through newspaper inserts in key electoral “ swing ” states — states like Michigan , Ohio , and Florida that , according to recent polling , could go either way in November ’s presidential election .
According to Delaware incorporation papers , the Clarion Fund is based at the same New York address as Aish Hatorah , a self - described “ apolitical ” group dedicated to educating Jews about their heritage .
The Clarion Fund ’s street address as listed on the group ’s website and a DVD mailer for the film is apparently not a physical address , but rather a “ virtual address ” that goes to a post office box in New York City .
Critics allege that the movie Obsession is “ hate propaganda ” which paints Muslims as violent extremists and , among other things , explicitly compares the threat posed by radical Islam to that of Nazi Germany in the 1930s .
At least two major metropolitan newspapers solicited to insert the paid advertisement into their product have refused to do so because of a perceived bias in the film .
“ Despite the perilous state of American newspapers , the St. Louis Post - Dispatch advertising department took an ethical stand and refused to distribute the DVD of a film that for two years has troubled American Muslims , ” wrote Tim Townsend , a reporter at Missouri ’s most influential newspaper earlier this month after it rejected the ad .
While the initial press reports about the mass distribution focused on the Clarion Fund ’s financing role , it was EMET that organized and oversaw the distribution , EMET ’s spokesman , Ari Morgenstern , told IPS .
Morgenstern , a former press officer for the Israeli embassy here , said he contacted IPS at the Clarion Fund ’s request .
EMET , according to a recent press release , is “ a non-partisan , non-profit organization dedicated to policy research and analysis on democracy and the Middle East . ”
According to filings made in compliance with the organization ’s tax - exempt 501 ( c ) 3 status , “ the organization hosts seminars , debates and educational films featuring Middle East experts in order to educate policy makers and the public at large on the common threats facing Israel and the United States . ”
Morgenstern told IPS that EMET was “ partnered with the Clarion Fund ” on what he called the “ Obsession Project ” which he identified as “ an initiative of EMET . ”
He declined to name the Project ’s donors .
A spokesman for the Clarion Fund , Gregory Ross , has also refused to name the Fund ’s donors , whose identity remains a mystery .
Morgenstern also declined to specify the cost of the DVD distribution , but did say , “ it costs a great deal — it ’s a multi- million - dollar effort . ”
Outside experts have estimated the cost of the operation , including reproduction and distribution , at between $ 15 million and $ 50 million .
Like hard - line neo-conservatives , EMET opposes any land concessions to Palestinians and takes other hard - line positions identified with Israel ’s right - wing Likud Party and the “ Settler Lobby ” there .
EMET ’s website says , “ We regard ourselves as ‘ intellectual revolutionaries . ’ ”
The group ’s acronym , EMET , mirrors the name of a predecessor to the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies , which was called Emet .
The word means “ truth ” in Hebrew .
Two weeks ago , EMET sponsored a seminar series on Capitol Hill named for the controversial multi-billionaire casino and hotel magnate Sheldon Adelson , a major donor to right - wing Zionist organizations in the US ; the far - right lobby group , Freedom ’s Watch ; and the Republican Jewish Coalition ( RJC ) , whose efforts to persuade Jewish voters that Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama is aligned with radical anti-Israel forces in the Islamic world have drawn strong criticism from the mainstream Jewish press here .
EMET ’s board of advisers includes a list of familiar neo-conservative figures , as well as three former Israeli diplomats , including a former deputy chief of mission in Israel ’s Washington embassy .
The group is headed by Sarah Stern , who began her activism on Israeli issues in opposition to the 1993 Oslo Accords between Israel and Palestinians .
She made a career out of her activism in the far - right Zionist Organization of America ( ZOA ) as its national policy coordinator from 1998 through 2004 .
Notable members of the advisory board include prominent hard - line neo-conservatives , including former American Ambassador to the UN the late Jeane Kirkpatrick ; Daniel Pipes of the Middle East Forum ; and the Hudson Institute ’s Meyrav Wurmser , the Israeli - born spouse of Vice President Dick Cheney ’s former top Middle East adviser , David Wurmser .
Other prominent neo-conservative members of the board include Center for Security Policy ( CSP ) president Frank Gaffney ; former CIA chief James Woolsey ; and Heritage Foundation fellows Ariel Cohen and Nina Shea , who has also served for years on the quasi - governmental US Commission for International Religious Freedom .
The US - born and - educated hard - line deputy managing editor of The Jerusalem Post and senior fellow for Middle Eastern Affairs at Gaffney ’s CSP , Caroline Glick , is also an adviser .
Glick , Pipes , and Walid Shoebat , a “ reformed ” terrorist and EMET adviser , are all featured as experts in Obsession .
Also among the top names of listed advisers to EMET are three Israeli diplomats .
Two of them , Ambassadors Yossi Ben Aharon and Yoram Ettinger , were among the three Israeli ambassadors whom then - Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin referred to as “ the Three Musketeers ” when they lobbied Washington in opposition to the Oslo accords .
Indeed , Stern began her career at the behest of three unnamed Israeli diplomats who were based in Washington under Rabin ’s predecessor , Yitzhak Shamir , according to EMET ’s website .
Ettinger was at one time the chairman of special projects and is still listed as a contributing expert at the Ariel Centre for Policy Research , a hard - line Likudist Israeli think tank that opposes the peace process .
Ben Aharon was the director general — effectively the chief of staff — of Shamir ’s office .
The third Israeli ambassador , Lenny Ben-David , was appointed by Likud prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to serve as the deputy chief of mission — second in command — at the Israeli embassy in Washington from 1997 until 2000 .
Ben -David had also held senior positions at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee for 25 years and is now a consultant and lobbyist .
But EMET is not the only group involved in the Obsession controversy to have direct ties to Israel .
The Clarion Fund has also been criticized for initially denying its ties to the Israel ’s Aish Hatorah , which were first disclosed publicly by an IPS investigation last year .
Honestreporting.com , an organization set up by Aish Hatorah and also a client of Ben-David , admitted to IPS that it had aided the production of the film .
The Clarion Fund and Aish Hatorah are headed by twin Israeli - Canadian brothers Raphael and Ephraim Shore , respectively .
The two groups appear to be connected as Clarion is incorporated in Delaware to the New York offices of Aish Hatorah .
“ It seems that the Clarion Fund , from what we can tell , is just a virtual organization that is a front for Aish Hatorah , ” Ibrahim Hooper , spokesman for the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) , told IPS .
“ They do n’t have staff , they do n’t have a physical address .
Nothing . ”
Little is known about the shadowy Clarion Fund , which is listed with the New York Secretary of State ’s office as a “ foreign not - for - profit foundation . ”
The group has rejected requests for information about its donors .
IPS has , however , uncovered one donor to the Clarion Fund , the Mamiye Foundation , which gave it 25,000 dollars in August of 2007 , according to tax filings .
Four Mamiyes , Charles M. , Charles D. , Hyman and Abraham , are listed as trustees on the forms .
According to filings with the New York Secretary of State , a contact listed for a Mamiye company is also the same man listed as a contact and counsel for the Clarion Fund — Eli D. Greenberg of the law firm Wolf , Haldenstein , Adler , Freeman and Herz .
Foreign nationals and companies , and domestic tax - exempt 501 ( c ) 3 non-profits are prohibited by federal election law from attempting to sway US elections at any level through either contributions to campaigns or advocacy .
Morgenstern , EMET ’s spokesman , said that the DVD distribution only went to “ swing states ” because media attention is focused there , and EMET is hoping to spark a public debate about the threats posed by ” radical Islam . ”
But CAIR has filed a complaint asking the Federal Election Commission to review the actions of the Clarion Fund both as a foreign entity and as a non-profit .
The complaint by Nadhira Al - Khalili , CAIR ’s legal counsel , asked that both charges be investigated .

The picture we Alaskans and the rest of America have of Governor Palin is becoming clearer by the day .
It ’s now widely known that the Governor of Alaska went on a $ 150,000 shopping spree courtesy of the Republican National Committee .
$ 150,000 !
That ’ll buy a lot of blouses .
Certainly , the GOP has the right to dress their candidate up anyway they like .
However , it flies in the face of the faux image they ’re trying to project of Sarah the Hockey Mom appealing to Joe Six Pack or more recently , Joe The Lying Unlicensed Plumber who votes against his own best interests .
In early October , before the infamous and excessive shopping spree was public fodder , I ran into a radio friend of mine who is famously good friends with Governor Palin .
Wanting to keep the conversation positive , I mentioned how cool it must be for the governor to have all of this exposure and new found world wide fame .
I told him I was most envious of the new wardrobe Palin has ; I mean , as the Republican Vice - Presidential Candidate , it must be an awesome perk .
Certainly the GOP will spend a few thousand bucks to dress up their new golden girl .
My friend said no , not at all .
He told me the McCain Campaign offered , but , in true Maverick Fashion , Sarah declined .
He said she told them she had plenty of clothes for the next several weeks of non -stop campaigning .
Hhhhmmmm .
We know Sarah Palin loves gifts .
Free is a very good price my friend .
Sarah put herself and her daughter up in a posh $ 700 a night New York hotel on Alaska ’s dime .
She took 300 + days of per diem while working from her home .
She flew her family around the state and the Lower 48 on “ state business ” and expensed $ 20,000 + , again courtesy of the State of Alaska - even though her family was not invited and it was certainly not state business .
Apparently , this clear and transparent governor accepted $ 25,000 of gifts - most of them from multinational mining interests and she has n’t even been in office 2 years .
A good portion of those gifts were from mining interests representing The Pebble Partnership .
Those interests represent a trifecta of foreign owned multinational corporations ; Northern Dynasty , Rio Tinto and Anglo American .
These corporations hold the leases to the proposed Pebble Mine .
This copper and gold mine has deposits worth an estimated $ 500 billion dollars .
It will be one of the largest open pit mines in the world and precariously sit at the headwaters of the largest wild salmon fishery on the planet , Bristol Bay , in one of the largest seismic and volcanic zones on earth .
This mining gift discovery by Outside Media provides a glimpse into Palin ’s motivations last August when she unethically and controversially “ took her governor ’s hat off ” and told Alaskan ’s she was going to vote no on ballot measure 4 .
Her sound bite speak , which we now know is just about the only way the governor can communicate in public , now seems like a well orchestrated multi media campaign .
Especially in light of the revelation that the lobbyist for the Pebble Partnership , Wendy Chamberlain , is friendly enough with the governor that she took Palin ’s daughter Willow on a family vacation to Mexico .
The week before the state wide election on Tuesday , August 26th , Palin called a press conference .
At the conclusion , during the question and answer part , someone asked Palin how she would vote on Ballot Measure 4 - the clean water initiative .
Palin responded , “ Let me take my governor ’s hat off just for a minute here and tell you , personally , Prop 4 — I vote no on that .
I have all the confidence in the world that the DEC ( Department of Environmental Conservation ) and our DNR ( Department of Natural Resources ) have great , very stringent regulations and policies already in place , ” Palin said .
“ We ’re going to make sure that mines operate only safely , soundly . ”
At that time , Palin had an approval rating of nearly 90 % .
The next morning and every day until the election , Alaskans were bombarded with a print , radio and direct mail campaign showing Governor Palin , herself a sometime commercial fisherman , holding a Bristol Bay Salmon and reassuring Alaskans everything would be fine and that we did n’t need stronger regulations because stringent regulations were already in place ; if only that were true .
Truth be told , Palin has her unpopular predecessor , Frank Murkowski to thank for her popularity .
A vegemite sandwich would be wildly popular following the arrogant and secretive Murkowski Administration .
One of Republican Governor Frank Murkowski’s more unpopular decisions was Executive Order 107 .
With one swipe of the pen , Murkowski collapsed the Habitat Division from the Department of Fish & Game into the Department of Natural Resources .
Habitat Biologist were charged with insuring that proposed leases from the Department of Natural Resources ( on behalf of the oil and mining industries ) met stringent environmental standards .
Habitat approved 99 % of the DNR leases .
After EO 107 , the fox , DNR , was charged with guarding the henshouse ( Habitat ) .
In addition , mixing zones were created that allowed industry to pollute salmon spawning streams .
To Palin ’s credit , after intense public pressure , she moved Habitat back to Fish & Game .
She did not , however , eliminate “ mixing zones ” .
After lobbying the legislature to change the laws to no avail , Alaskans for Clean Water wrote Ballot Prop 4 , the Clean Water Initiative .
This initiative restored the environmental regulations to Pre Murkowski standards .
With the conviction of Ted Steven on seven felony counts , Sarah Palin was asked how she would cast her ballot .
Q : So will you cast your ballot for Ted Stevens and are you encouraging others to do so ? [… ]
PALIN : I ’ve never told people who I have voted for before because I see that as a very precious freedom in our country .
Free and fair and uh – elections allow us to cast a secret ballot behind the voting booth curtain so that ’s the way I ’m going to keep it .
She lied .
Again .
She has told people how she would vote .
Being a fisherman is something you are , not something you do .
Governor Palin ’s disregard for the lives of so many Alaskans can be put on a long list of self serving decisions .
Bigger still is her “ dodging ” the question about how she would vote for Senator Stevens .
It was n’t a dodge , it was a lie .
America needs change .
Alaska needs change .
- video encodings still in process -
Goebbels gives a master class in propaganda , avoiding all the facts .
A lesson in media control for all would be dictators .

Apples are an all - American success story - each of us eats more than 19 pounds of them annually .
Thanks to fruit - breeding research , we 're able to enjoy more productive , healthy , and flavorful new varieties every year .
And we 're collecting and preserving the world 's bounty of apple genestock , so that the apples of tomorrow may be even sweeter crunchier , and better than ever .
Think about the quality of the apples you buy at the supermarket :
They may have been stored for as long as 9 months but you can bet they 'll remain crisp , thanks to controlled - atmosphere - storage methods devised by ARS .
Never before have growers had a better chance against pests and diseases in the apple orchard , thanks to new , nonchemical biocontrols .
ARS scientists have toiled to harness naturally occurring yeasts and bacteria and turn them against apples ' enemies .
We 've even worked on bashless bagging - packaging systems that are used by wholesalers to bring you apples without bruises .

What would you do if someone called you up and offered you some free cash ?
Bite off their hand ?
Or say no , in case they were actually after your money ?
At the start of October the directory enquiries service 118 118 ran a promotion where it gave away £ 118 to randomly picked callers .
But it was flummoxed when a large proportion of winners simply did n't want the money .
Every person who called the service was entered into the " draw " to win £ 118 .
The promotion was advertised on a number of commercial radio stations , but because of licensing laws the company was not allowed to tell callers they were being entered to win .
Instead , lucky winners were promptly called back by 118 118 .
They were told they had won the money , and if they wanted it they were asked to give their name and address for a cheque to be sent in the post .
Of the 288 selected winners , 89 refused the money - mostly , it seems , because they were worried they were in danger of becoming a victim of a scam .
With scams costing millions every year and fraudsters inventing new and varied ways of ripping off consumers every day , should 118 118 be surprised that people were so reluctant to take up the offer of free cash ?
We 're always warning people not to give out their personal details to unsolicited callers , so should legitimate companies ask people to do just that ?
Would you have been suspicious ?

I made a trip to Costco to buy business supplies last week .
While browsing the software , I spotted the latest version of Quicken .
I picked up the box and looked at the list of new features .
I felt that urge creep upon me — the urge to spend .
“ Maybe the Mac version is out , too , ” I thought .
“ I should stop by Fry 's to check . ”
Then I thought of the $ 50 it would cost to upgrade .
I thought how Quicken 2004 has served me well for three years .
I began to have doubts .
“ I 'll use the 30 - day rule , ” I told myself .
“ If I still want this next month , I 'll buy it . ”

How to Track Your Spending ( and why you should )
The 30 - day Rule is a Simple Method to Control Impulse Spending .
Here 's how it works :
Whenever you feel the urge to splurge — whether it's for new shoes , a new videogame , or a new car — force yourself to stop .
If you 're already holding the item , put it back .
Leave the store .
When you get home , take a piece of paper and write down the name of the item , the store where you found it , and the price .
Also write down the date .
Now post this note someplace obvious : a calendar , the fridge , a bulletin board .
( I use a text file on my computer . )
For the next thirty days , think whether you really want the item , but do not buy it .
If , at the end of a month , the urge is still there , then consider purchasing it .
( But do not use credit to do so . )
That 's all there is to it .
But it 's surprisingly effective .
The 30 - day rule works especially well because you are n't actually denying yourself — you 're simply delaying gratification .
This rule has another advantage : it gives you a chance to research the item you want to purchase .
This can save you from grief .

How to Cure a Spending Hangover
For example , after returning from my Costco trip last week , I checked the reviews on Amazon .
Quicken 2007 for Mac gets 1 - 1/2 stars !
Yikes !
Still , I added it to my wishlist .
A month from now , if I still feel I need it , I may allow myself to buy it .
I began using the 30 - day rule about two years ago .
I do n't always remember to follow it , but when I do , it works well .
Sometimes my urge to spend is gone by the time I get home .
Sometimes the urge grows stronger for a week or two , but then subsides completely .
It 's rare that I decide I need something after 30 days of waiting .
The website of a local California Republican party has posted a message openly calling for the torture of Barack Obama , while reporting as fact a slew of long - ago debunked smears targeting the Democratic presidential candidate .
The Sacramento County Republican Party called for Obama 's torture .
Image : Sacramento County Republican Party
The Sacramento County Republican Partyhosted a graphic this week comparing Obama to Osama bin Laden , with the caption " The only difference between Obama and Osama is BS , " * The Sacramento Bee * reports .
The text of the graphic adds , " Waterboard Barack Obama . "
That image was removed Tuesday in response to inquiries from the newspaper , but the site continues to report false claims , quotes and images about Obama , including the assertion that he snubbed troops on a visit to the Middle East , and that he refuses to say the Pledge of Allegiance .
E-mail smears have targeted Obama 's patriotism since his presidential run began , but the Sacramento website appears to be the first case of the smears being openly adopted by an official GOP organization .
The attacks come as polling shows voters growing increasingly impatient with the perceived negative tone of Obama rival John McCain 's campaign , following attacks seeking to link Obama to a former 1960 's radical .
Hitting the patriotism button is a time - honored political tactic to undermine support for the other side among Republican party professionals , says Stefan Forbes , a moviemaker who recently completed
" Boogieman : The Lee Atwater Story , " a film that documents such tactics .
" But this time around , it may be that the global meltdown might overcome that , and that 's the interesting thing , " says Forbes .
The party site bolsters its false claim that Obama refuses to say the Pledge of Allegiance with an equally false quote attributed to the candidate .
" I do n't want to be perceived as taking sides .
There are a lot of people in the world to whom the American flag is a symbol of oppression .
And the anthem itself conveys a war - like message . "
The text is actually from a satirical column that ran in The Arizona Conservative , according tourban legend mythbusters Snopes.com .
Other fallacious " primary evidence " the site presents includes two fabricated quotes attributed to Obama 's book The Audacity of Hope , and a report from a U.S. intelligence officer claiming that Obama blew off soldiers when he visited the troops at the Bagram Airforce base in
Afghanistan .
That letter was debunked by the New York Daily News , which reported in July that the letter 's author admitted that the " information that was put out in my e-mail was wrong . "
A photo hosted on the site depicts Obama holding a telephone receiver to his ear backwards .
" When you are faking a pose for a photo - op , you 'd think he can at least get the phone turned in the right direction ! , " the caption reads .
The image is an altered version of a genuine photo in which Obama is seen using the phone properly .
Craig MacGlashan , the chairman of the Sacramento Republican County Party , is responsible for the site .
MacGlashan , a lawyer , was n't answering phone calls on Wednesday , according to his receptionist , and he did n't respond to a a voice mail inquiry .
Obama and McCain are squaring off Wednesday night in their third and final presidential debate before the November 4 election .
US lawmaker slams McCain camp for stoking hatred Agence France - Presse
Published : Saturday October 11 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  Democratic lawmaker John Lewis on Saturday said Republican White House contender John McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin were " sowing the seeds of hatred and division " with incendiary rhetoric against rival Barack Obama .
" As public figures with the power to influence and persuade , Senator McCain and ( Alaska ) Governor Palin are playing with fire , and if they are not careful , that fire will consume us all , " Lewis said in a statement on Politico.com a day after McCain tried to tone down his campaign 's attacks against his rival .
Lewis , a US civil rights icon , said the Republicans " are sowing the seeds of hatred and division , and there is no need for this hostility in our political discourse . "
He suggested the attacks on Obama were reminiscent of the late segregationist Alabama governor and presidential candidate George Wallace , whose fiery rhetoric in 1963 was blamed for a church bombing in Birmingham , Alabama , that killed four little girls .
" What I am seeing reminds me too much of another destructive period in American history , " Lewis said .
" George Wallace never threw a bomb , he never fired a gun , but he created the climate and the conditions that encouraged vicious attacks against innocent Americans who were simply trying to exercise their constitutional rights .
" Because of this atmosphere of hate , four little girls were killed on Sunday morning when a church was bombed in Birmingham , Alabama . "
McCain on Friday called on his backers to tone it down , after crowds at his rallies have become increasing inflammatory , shouting out " terrorist " and " liar " when Obama is mentioned .
At one Florida rally , someone even shouted " kill him . "
The Arizona senator said Lewis statement " represent a character attack against Governor Sarah Palin and me that is shocking and beyond the pale . "
He said Lewis ' comparison between criticism of Obama 's record and Wallace 's segregationist policies " unacceptable and has no place in this campaign . "
McCain called on Obama " to immediately and personally repudiate these outrageous and divisive comments that are so clearly designed to shut down debate 24 days before the election . "
Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton said , in turn , that while the Illinois senator " does not believe " in the comparison , " Lewis was right to condemn some of the hateful rhetoric that John McCain himself personally rebuked . "
Burton also called Palin 's recent derisive comment -- " palling around with terrorists " -- about Obama 's relation with 1960s radical Bill Ayers " baseless and profoundly irresponsible . "
Barack Obama ’s first appointment , that of Chicago Congressman Rahm Emanuel as his chief of staff , is quite frankly unsettling and suggests that voters who had hoped for real change in Washington will be disappointed .
There should also be some concern on the part of Americans who believe that a close and continuing relationship with a foreign government might disqualify one for high office in the United States .
Emanuel , far from serving as a neutral gateway to the president , has some very strong views on foreign policy , particularly regarding the Middle East , views that are closer to those of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney than they are to the millions of voters who thought that Obama would put an end to " wars of choice . "
And Obama appears to share at least some of those views , though he might be driven primarily by unwillingness to antagonize Israel ’s numerous cheerleaders in the Democratic Party .
During the presidential campaign Obama refused to meet with American Muslims , and on a fact - finding trip to the Middle East last summer he spent several days in Israel but only 45 minutes with Palestinian leaders .
More recently , Obama did not respond to a congratulatory letter from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the only world leader to be snubbed in that fashion .
In his first press conference on Nov. 7 , Obama , who has promised to do " everything in his power " to denuclearize Iran , reiterated that Iran ’s development of a nuclear weapon would be unacceptable , a position adhering closely to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) line .
There are also reports that Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni has already called Vice President - elect Joe Biden to tell him that even talking to Iran would be a sign of weakness , a signal that Israel might be willing to unleash its all - powerful lobby against the Obama administration if it is perceived as going too far .
The extremely partisan and foul - mouthed Emanuel , who has the reputation of a junkyard dog , is a retread from the Clinton White House , where he served in two senior advisory positions after demonstrating his expertise in fundraising during the 1992 presidential campaign .
Though born in Chicago , he was an Israeli citizen through his father until he , according to his own account , renounced his dual citizenship when he turned 18 .
When the United States went to war with Iraq in 1991 the 31 - year - old Emanuel rushed off to join the colors , though the colors in this case were the blue and white flag of Israel .
He claims that he was a civilian volunteer in the Israeli army who was assigned the task of " rust - proofing brakes " on military vehicles , an assertion that has been questioned because his father ’s background suggests that he would likely have been offered something much more important .
Emanuel ’s father , an Israeli physician , was a member of the terrorist group Irgun in the 1940s .
Irgun was responsible for blowing up the King David Hotel and ethnically cleansing much of Palestine through selective massacres of Arab civilians .
In an interview in the Jerusalem Post , Dr. Benjamin Emanuel said he was convinced that his son ’s appointment as White House chief of staff would be good for Israel .
" Obviously he will influence the president to be pro-Israel , " he was quoted as saying .
" Why would n’t he be ?
What is he , an Arab ?
He ’s not going to clean the floors of the White House . "
Commenting on his father ’s statement , Rahm Emanuel noted that Obama does not need his influence to “ orientate his policy toward Israel . ”
Other Israelis and prominent American supporters of Israel also see Emanuel as their man in the White House .
The respected Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz hailed his appointment , describing him unambiguously as an Israeli .
William Daroff of the United Jewish Communities also praised Emanuel , describing him as " a good friend of Israel , coming from good Irgun stock . "
Ira Forman , head of the National Jewish Democratic Council , welcomed the appointment , saying , “ It ’s just another indication that despite the attempts to imply that Obama would somehow appoint the wrong person or listen to the wrong people when it comes to the U.S. - Israel relationship that was never true , ” an indication that some will actually expect Emanuel to act on behalf of Israel when the chips are down .
Emanuel left the Clinton administration in 1998 and went to work for Bruce Wasserstein , a major Democratic donor and head of the Chicago investment bank Wasserstein Perella .
He made $ 18 million in a little over two years .
He was deliberately placed in a position where he could exploit his White House connections , which he did , to obtain a nest egg to finance his political career .
In 2000 he was named by Clinton to the board of Freddie Mac , where he earned an additional $ 260,000 but was later criticized for not taking his oversight responsibility seriously .
In 2002 , he was elected to Congress , where he was noted for his ability to attract large political contributions .
Emanuel soon moved into a leadership position , eventually becoming chairman of the Democratic Caucus in January 2007 , the fourth - ranking Democrat in Congress .
In Congress , Emanuel has been a consistent and vocal pro-Israel hardliner , particularly close to right - wing politicians such as Ariel Sharon and Bibi Netanyahu , sometimes even more so than President Bush .
In June 2003 he signed a congressional letter criticizing Bush for being weak in his support of Israel .
The letter , signed by 34 Democrats , stated , " We were deeply dismayed to hear your criticism of Israel for fighting acts of terror . "
The letter supported Israel ’s policy of assassinating Palestinian political leaders because it " was clearly justified as an application of Israel ’s right to self - defense . "
Not surprisingly , Emanuel has always been in favor of the Iraq war , and he supports an aggressive policy toward Iran .
In his 2006 book with the pretentious title The Plan : Big Ideas for America he advocates increasing the size of the U.S. Army by 100,000 soldiers and creating a domestic spying organization like Britain ’s MI5 .
More recently , he has supported mandatory paramilitary national service for all Americans between the ages of 18 and 25 .
Emanuel has always expressed intense hostility toward antiwar Democrats .
When , in November 2005 , Congressman Jack Murtha made his proposal for withdrawal from Iraq , Emanuel quickly declared that “ Jack Murtha went out and spoke for Jack Murtha . ”
In late 2005 and early 2006 , Emanuel played a key role as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) in lining up candidates to run against the Republicans for congressional seats in November 2006 .
Out of 22 candidates vetted and supported financially by Emanuel , 20 were pro-war , despite the fact that the Democratic Party base was not .
Antiwar candidates were routinely denied funding and support from his DCCC .
Only eight of Emanuel ’s candidates won , a percentage considerably lower than the success rate for other Democrats , possibly because voters had a hard time embracing their pro-war positions .
In a June 2006 congressional debate on Iraq policy , Emanuel made his own views clear , declaring , “ The debate today is about whether the American people want to stay the course with an administration and a Congress that has walked away from its obligations or pursue a real strategy for success in the war on terror .
Democrats are determined to take the fight to the enemy . ”
In his speech , Emanuel fully embraced the questionable " War on Terror " concept and aligned himself far to the right of the Democratic Party base , which , at the time , was 60 percent in favor of immediate withdrawal from Iraq .
In July 2006 , Emanuel was one of several congressmen who called for the cancellation of an impending speech before Congress by visiting Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki because Maliki had called Israel ’s bombing of Lebanon " aggression . "
Emanuel was joined by his close friend and DSCC counterpart Sen. Charles Schumer , who asked ; “ Which side is he on when it comes to the war on terror ? ” Emanuel described the Lebanese and Palestinian governments as " totalitarian entities with militias and terrorists acting as democracies " in a subsequent speech on July 19 regarding a House resolution supporting Israel ’s bombing , which produced thousands of civilian casualties .
On March 12 , 2007 , the Democratic Party leadership announced that it would separate the issue of Iran from consideration of funding measures for the troop surge in neighboring Iraq .
Opponents of a possible military action against Iran had sought specific language in the appropriation that would deny funding for any military operations outside Iraq without prior congressional approval .
The proposal had seemed reasonable enough , given the Bush administration ’s track record on the use of force , but apparently it was not acceptable to Emanuel .
AIPAC mobilized immediately and began an intensive lobbying campaign against the proposal , instructing its supporters to call and write Congress , adding that it is best to telephone just after lunch , when there are more staffers available to answer the phone .
Emanuel organized resistance to the measure from inside the House of Representatives and promised AIPAC early in the process that the offensive language would be dropped .
The Democratic Party subsequently held a number of closed - door meetings on the issue and decided that the prohibition would not be included in the funding measure because of " possible impact on Israel . "
During the summer of 2008 , Emanuel was a key player in the marginalization and humiliation of former president Jimmy Carter , whose book Palestine : Peace Not Apartheid had outraged Israel ’s supporters .
Carter was not allowed to speak at the Democratic National Convention , an unprecedented snub toward a former president and a further indication , if one was needed , that in American politics it is possible to do or say nearly anything as long as one does not criticize Israel .
And now Emanuel is the president ’s chief of staff , one of the most powerful positions in the White House .
Perhaps there is a limit to the mischief that he will be able to do ; at this point one can only adopt a wait - and - see policy .
One thing is certain , however .
If the subject is Israel , Emanuel knows very clearly where his loyalty lies .

Human - cow hybrid embryos made in lab
UK researchers say they have created embryos and stem cells using human cells and the egg cells of cows .
But they say such experiments will not lead to hybrid human - animal babies , or even to direct medical therapies .
Dr Lyle Armstrong of Newcastle University presented preliminary data on his work to Israel 's parliament last week .
It has not been reviewed by other experts in the field , the university says , but the researchers intend to have their work peer - reviewed .
The researchers say they have hollowed out the egg cells of cattle , inserted human DNA to create a growing embryo , and then taken it apart to get embryonic stem cells .
There is no possibility of creating a human that is part- animal , according to the researchers .
They say the animal egg only acts as a shell for the human DNA .
They add the hybrid embryos will not be implanted and by law that any that are created have to be destroyed at 14 days .
Stepping stone to other research
Other experts say such work would only be an interim step aimed at understanding the biology of embryonic stem cells , the body 's ultimate master cells that can give rise to all of the other cells and tissues .
" If the team can produce cells which will survive in culture it will open the door to a better understanding of disease processes without having to use precious human eggs , " says Professor John Burn , head of the university 's Institute of Human Genetics .
" Cells grown using animal eggs cannot be used to treat patients on safety grounds but they will help bring nearer the day when new stem cell therapies are available . "
Scientists hope to use stem cells to create a new field of so - called regenerative medicine .
Doctors hope for eventual treatments for spinal cord injuries , diseases such as diabetes and even cancer .
Opponents of human embryonic stem cell research object to the destruction of human embryos and say even the tiniest embryo must be treated with dignity .
Ethics of creating hybrids
" This is one of the most controversial ethical issues in all of cloning and stem cell research , " says US researcher Dr Arthur Caplan , director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania .
Caplan notes many people may be disgusted or frightened by such work .
" In my view there is no risk of making monsters this way .
The biology will not work .
Nor is that the intent of any of these experiments anyway , so I do n't think that fear is justified , " he says .
" I come down on the side that says if you can make great gains by making embryo hybrids in preventing premature death and understanding disease then a limited amount of such research is morally justifiable . "
Dr David King , of the UK watchdog Human Genetics Alert , disagrees .
" Even if stem cells were ever to be produced , like cloned animals , they would have so many errors of their metabolism that they would produce completely misleading data , " he told the BBC .
Newcastle University says Armstrong was granted a licence by the UK's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to use animal eggs in such research .
Caplan notes the US government does not regulate such work .
President George Bush has vetoed several bills that would regulate the field because they would also all permit work on human embryos .
Dr Robert Lanza of Massachusetts - based Advanced Cell Technology says his company tried , but failed , to create stem cells in a similar way in the late 1990s .
Chimeras
When two species are mixed together the result is called a chimera .
While some are fanciful - a centaur , for example - others exist , such as sheep spliced with human genes that produce human proteins in their milk .
Many researchers are trying to do this to understand the secrets of stem cells and revolutionise medicine .
In 2004 , Chinese researchers said they had created embryos by putting human DNA into a rabbit cell .
Experts are pursuing various ways to create stem cells .
Several teams say they have re-programmed ordinary skin cells to act like human embryonic stem cells , but stress that many different approaches need to continue before anyone fully understands how to regenerate human tissue and organs .
What is it that prevents America from righting herself ?
Stupid , blind , unthinking patriotism — willful idiots yelling “ We ’re number one ! ” while ignoring all evidence to the contrary .
Read
That Americas now have shorter lives than Bosnians , that our democracy is only slightly better than the Czech Republic ’s , that we have more people in prison per capita than any other country in the world , and that a child born in Slovakia is more likely to survive than in America is pathetic .

And Palin called Todd :
John Verrilli , the news director for KDKA in Pittsburgh , told TPM Election Central that McCain 's Pennsylvania campaign communications director gave one of his reporters a detailed version of the attack that included a claim that the alleged attacker said , " You 're with the McCain campaign ?

Verrilli also told TPM that the McCain spokesperson had claimed that the " B " stood for Barack .
( CNN ) -- " Californication " star David Duchovny made headlines for voluntarily entering rehab last week .
But it was n't for drugs or alcohol .
It was for another dependency , one that affects millions of Americans but is seldom discussed : sex addiction .
While sex can be healthy for a relationship , some people develop an addiction to porn , affairs , and other behaviors .
Sex addiction , also called compulsive sexual behavior , is like a gambling compulsion or alcoholism :
It 's about devoting your free time to a behavior that you cannot stop , even if you damage relationships or prompt other negative consequences .
That could mean extensively using pornography , having affairs , sleeping with prostitutes , and masturbating excessively , to the point where such behaviors get out of control .
If you think it 's just about primal desire , think again .
For many addicts , sex becomes a way to numb out painful feelings , kill time or stop feeling lonely , says Kelly McDaniel , licensed professional counselor in San Antonio , Texas , and author of " Ready to Heal : Women Facing Love , Sex and Relationship Addiction . "
" Most people I talk to get to the point where they do n't even like sex , " said McDaniel , who has no connection to David Duchovny and did not speculate about his specific situation .
Who are sex addicts ?
Sex addiction is estimated to affect 3 to 6 percent of adults in the United States , according to the Mayo Clinic , but the American Psychiatric Association has not classified the condition in its diagnostic handbook .
Sexhelp.com , run by psychologist Patrick Carnes , provides an online test to help people determine if they have a problem .
The Internet , providing endless opportunities for porn- watching and cybersex , has fueled a surge in cases of sex addiction , experts say .
" We 're seeing it with epidemic proportions now , particularly with regards to cybersex , " said Mark Schwartz , psychologist and former director of the Masters and Johnson Institute in St. Louis , Missouri .
" There is n't a week that goes by where I do n't get two calls " about sex addiction .

Therapists have recently seen more women with the condition in connection with Internet porn , which has become a " gender - neutral " addiction , McDaniel said .
Before , female sex addicts generally tended to have affairs or become sex workers , she said .
Experts acknowledge that people who have affairs or use pornography are not necessarily sex addicts .
Such pastimes form an addiction when they generate negative consequences for a person 's relationships , take over free time and become impossible to quit .
Where does it come from ?
About 80 percent of sex addiction cases have sexual abuse or emotional trauma in their backgrounds , said Doug Weiss , therapist and executive director of the Heart to Heart Counseling Center .
Schwartz also noted that huge numbers of people coming forward as sex addicts have been abused , assaulted or raped .
" When you have abuse in your background , you 're less likely to trust people , [ and ] you 're more likely to turn to something like sex addiction as a manifestation , " Schwartz said .
Feelings of neglect as a child -- whether from divorced parents or parents who both worked and did n't spend a lot of time with their kids -- may also lead to sex addiction , Schwartz said .
Research into the neuroscience of sex addiction has not been conclusive , the Mayo Clinic said .
Naturally occurring chemicals in the brain such as dopamine and serotonin do contribute to sexual functioning , but it 's not clear how they are related to sex addiction .
McDaniel said these two chemicals are lower in the brains of children who have suffered abuse , which may explain why some of them use their own bodies -- or , in other cases , food -- to increase dopamine and serotonin levels .
A lot of teenagers develop their sexuality with pornography , and then find that relational sex is n't as satisfying , Weiss said .
Porn gives them a " very strong chemical hit , " and alters ways of thinking about sex , somewhat like the classic " ring the bell , feed the dog " stimulus - response mechanism .
Addicts thus learn to become sexually attached to objects , and have trouble getting the same kind of satisfaction from sex in a relationship , he said .
For many people , especially women , sex addiction occurs in tandem with another problem such as an eating disorder , drug or alcohol addiction , McDaniel said .
How does treatment work ?
A good treatment center will review the reasons why the addiction has come about , along with the brain chemistry of it , McDaniel said .
A premier rehabilitation facility would have a combination of individual and group therapy , 12 - step support , and possibly psychiatric medications such as antidepressant medications if necessary .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Compulsive sexual behavior
The 12 - step programs , which have components that parallel Alcoholics Anonymous , are the most widely used form of treatment , said Sam Alibrando , therapist and consultant in Pasadena , California .
They involve having a sponsor and being available for others in the group at any time .
Anecdotally , however , they work less well than AA because sex is harder to give up , said Alibrando , author of " Follow the Yellow Brick Road : How to Change for the Better When Life Gives You Its Worst . "
" Treatment is long - term , and it's not easy , " McDaniel said .
" I really recommend that a woman or a man find someone who 's trained and understands that sex addiction is a brain disease and does not further the shame that comes with this disease . "
Unlike drugs or alcohol , the goal of sex addiction therapy is usually not abstinence , but rather learning to have sex in a relationship , experts say .
Similarly , someone who recovers from an overeating disorder does not stop eating entirely but learns how to manage diet .
Marriage counseling often becomes part of the treatment , Weiss says .
The goals of recovery vary for different people , says Alibrando .
He 's currently treating a couple in which the wife cannot tolerate her husband even looking at other women .
On the other end of the spectrum , he has treated couples in which a woman will buy her boyfriend pornography .
" The spectrum is so wide in terms of where people draw the line , " says Alibrando .
Some recovering addicts join support groups requiring that members only have sex with their partners , even prohibiting masturbation .
What 's after recovery ?
Weiss considers himself a former sex addict , having recognized his problem in his early 20s .
Women were n't making him happy ; he was using pornography and felt " in conflict " about it .
Now , he runs a resource Web site for recovery at sexaddict.com , along with three - day intensive workshops to jump - start recovery for sex addicts .
Weiss said he 's proud of Duchovny for voluntarily seeking help , apparently without prodding from press reports or lawsuits .
" This kind of person who decides to get recovery for themselves without getting exposed " is " likely to get better , " he said .
" People who voluntarily get better have a much better chance of staying well . "
Are Gun Shows Dangerous ?
Every time the subject of guns comes up , whether on this blog or elsewhere ( see here , here , and here for a few examples ) , the resultant discussion is predictably passionate .
I am guessing that passionate gun discussions are taking place all over the country today with the news that an 8 - year - old boy accidentally shot and killed himself over the weekend at a gun show in Massachusetts .
Every element of this incident — the age of the victim , the controls in place at the gun show , the fact that the gun was an Uzi — will surely be analyzed for many days to come .
But it might be worth taking a step back from this single tragic incident and asking a broader question : are gun shows themselves dangerous ?
That ’s the question posed in a new working paper by Mark Duggan , Randi Hjalmarsson , and Brian A. Jacob ( abstract here , PDF here ) .
The paper is called “ The Effect of Gun Shows on Gun-Related Deaths : Evidence From California and Texas . ”
And here is the abstract :
Thousands of gun shows take place in the U.S. each year .
Gun control advocates argue that because sales at gun shows are much less regulated than other sales , such shows make it easier for potential criminals to obtain a gun .
Similarly , one might be concerned that gun shows would exacerbate suicide rates by providing individuals considering suicide with a more lethal means of ending their lives .
On the other hand , proponents argue that gun shows are innocuous , since potential criminals can acquire guns quite easily through other black market sales or theft .
In this paper , we use data from Gun and Knife Show Calendar combined with vital statistics data to examine the effect of gun shows .
We find no evidence that gun shows lead to substantial increases in either gun homicides or suicides .
In addition , tighter regulation of gun shows does not appear to reduce the number of firearms - related deaths .
Duggan in particular has done a lot of gun research , some of which suggests that more guns generally equal more crime , not less .
So it is an interesting twist , to say the very least , that gun shows themselves do not seem to exact a societal cost .
The family and friends of the 8 - year - old boy will of course take no solace in this conclusion .
But it is a good reminder that when something tragic ( and anomalous ) spurts up in the daily news , we should n’t rush to instantly paint it as representative of the larger picture .

I frequently get this question about unit or acceptance testing :
If sending e-mail or some other sort of notifications is required by the business process , do we test this and how ?
This arrived again yesterday from a reader , in the following form :
… and one component of our application is email notifications ( pretty straightforward stuff ) .
This occurs on registration , forgot password , etc .
I am having a tricky time thing about how to test to make sure these email notifications actually arrive .
Is it common practice to use the same tool to login to a dummy email account on gmail to make sure the message makes it there ?
This seems like a hack , and I ’m curious if you ’ve ever had to deal with a similiar situation .
First of all , I regard sending e-mail synchronously from the web request as a very bad practice .
Talking to an external system can slow down your business processing ( and unit testing ) and makes the whole process more error - prone as the DNS or MX transport to the external system might time - out .
This might cause problems even when the e-mail server is local , since some e-mail servers try to verify the recipient address or server before confirming that the message is accepted .
This is especially important if you are working in a transactional context eg you should only send an e-mail if the registration transaction is successful , but you do n’t really know that until the whole thing commits .
If the database commit fails , you ca n’t really revoke the message .
If you send the message after committing , then there is a chance that the system will die in between and you ’ll commit without sending a message .
What I tend to do is use a queue ( MSMQ / ActiveMQ / JMS or whatever is available for your platform ) and just enqueue the correct message there during the business process .
You can then use a mock queue for unit testing and verify that the correct message is queued .
On the other side of the queue , you can have one or more queue processors that pick up the messages and ship them off to the mail server , resend in case of failure etc .
That remains a tricky part to test , but you can write an integration test that posts a message to the queue , wait a minute and then check the e-mail mailbox with an automated script .
This can run overnight , so you do n’t have to run it all the time .
This way you split the functionality into something that is likely to change and should be tested frequently ( business process and mail content ) and something that is unlikely to change at all after you first write it and can be regression - tested overnight ( SMTP message delivery ) .
The first part is nice and quick to test because you can run everything on a developer box with a mock queue and check it from a unit testing tool .

When US movie producer Michael Moore announced that his new movie “ Slacker Uprising ” would be available for free download over the internet , he was forced by US copyright law to add a caveat – that it would only be available to residents of the United States and Canada .
Anyone outside of those countries would get a big “ SORRY ! ” sign and politely told to sod off .
But he chose to use BitTorrent for the movie ’s download and once one US or Canadian person had downloaded it , it was then extremely simple for anyone , anywhere to download it too .
This has led to accusations that Moore deliberately thumbed his nose up at the US copyright law , knowing full well that by using BitTorrent , he could circumvent the US / Canada only rule .
“ I only own the US and Canadian rights ” said Moore , “ so my hands are tied .
But this is the 21st century .
What are ‘ geographical rights ’ ?
I ’ll say it for the hundredth time :
If I buy a book and read it , and then give you the book to read , I have broken no laws .
Why is that not true for all media ? ”
So I think basically what he ’s saying is that he knew pretty much what would eventually happen to that torrent file and he chose to turn a blind eye to it .
Moore is a big supporter of people who illegally download his movies as he feels that the main thing is that his ideas get around and people think about what he says in his movies .
Losing the money from the illegal downloads does n’t seem to bother him that much which makes you wonder how he can afford to be so blase about box office takings .
So when will he be doing a movie about illegal downloading , the restrictive copyright laws , the RIAA and the movie industry in the USA ?
That would be a great Michael Moore movie .
What do you think ?
Maybe we should get a petition going !

I 've just acquired the single most beautiful book I 've ever owned .
It 's called ABC3D , and it is an unbelievably witty and well - made pop -up ABC book , produced by Marion Bataille .
It 's one of those books that could only be a book — there 's no way this could be an ebook or a movie ( though the little video above gives you an idea of the thing , it 's a poor substitute ) or an audiobook or whatever .
This is the apotheosis of book , something you have to put between covers to really , really appreciate .

The Princeton Election Consortium published an article a few weeks back discussing the diminishing effect of race in our elections ; its pretty much a must read .
Within the article a graph appears tracing the evolution of racial bias in public polling , the results were surprising .
Based on the chart African American candidates have just recently started over performing relative to election polling .
This information is all very interesting , but there is no data on the Bradley Effect for a National campaign ; it is impossible to tell how race will impact the 2008 Presidential Election .
It is thus plausible to assume , for the sake of comparison , that the Bradley Effect is real and will affect Obama .
I 've taken the liberty to include a racial bias coefficient into the projection algorithm for a little experiment .
The Princeton graph provides a ceiling ( or floor , depending on how you look at it ) for racially induced bias in public polling at around 5 % .
I 've taken that 5 % and incorporated it into the algorithm as follows :
Obama 's Projection :
I calculate his projection and then subtract 5 % of it to arrive at his adjusted projection .
McCain's Projection :
I start by figuring out the number of undecided voters in at the end of the initial projection ; this is done by subtracting 100 from McCain 's and Obama 's initial projection .
I then add this number to McCain 's projection along with 5 % of Obama 's initial projection to arrive at McCain 's adjusted projection .
The English version of all this reads as follows : I assume that 5 % of Obama 's support is racially tinged so I add it to McCain 's total while subtracting it from Obama's .
I then also assume that all the currently undecided voters , 5 % are racist and as a result will vote for McCain .
The result of this application can be seen in the map below :
If the Bradley Effect manifests itself in the upcoming election , Obama would still win .
While I was messing around with the math I wondered what the outcome would be if all currently undecided voters suddenly moved to McCain en masse :
A tie ?
But this year a tie goes to the African American .
In the event of a tie the decision rests within the House of Representatives .
Each state 's delegation receives one votes .
Based up upon the current and probable makeup of the 111th Congress , Barack Obama would almost assuredly become the 44th President .
How Can Britney Do It Again and Do It Right ?
Celebrities weigh in on how scandal - scarred Spears can shine at MTV's VMAs .
Sept. 5 , 2008  -- Forget " Entourage " and the NFL .
If you 're going to watch TV this Sunday night , watch Britney Spears .
Her appearance at this year 's MTV's Video Music Awards is arguably the most - anticipated television event since , well , her appearance at last year 's MTV Video Music Awards , in which she flailed her limbs , mumbled her " Gimme More " lyrics and confirmed that she was a fallen pop superstar .
Spears has a lot to prove .
While her life has been on the upswing in recent months -- she put an end to her child custody drama , started work on a new album and is up for three awards at Sunday 's ceremony -- reports that she started drinking at age 13 , lost her virginity at 14 , and segued into drugs at 15 , according to leaks from her mom 's upcoming memoir , have cast her in a less - than - favorable light once again .
How is she going to open the VMAs ?
We do n't know , and judging from 2007 's ill - planned performance , it stands to reason that she may not either .
So to give the girl some advice , ABCNews.com reached out to a panel of experts .
Kathy Griffin
Comedian , star of Bravo 's " My Life on the D - List "
" Brit should open the show in the exact same glittery bikini as last year , but hold out the waistband like Jared from the Subway ads showing her stunning weight loss .
Clean hair extensions .
And lip - synch her way back into our hearts .
As long as she gets through it seemingly sober , it 's on !
Party with Fiddy , Diddy and all the other ' iddys .
No panties required .
Good luck , my pop princess . "
Margaret Cho
Comedian , star of VH1's new " The Cho Sho "
" She should perform , do something new , be so amazing that she leaves us all breathless and in love , like she used to .
After the VMAs , she should start doing a lot of charity work , like when Angelina Jolie was all about the land mines . "
Michael Musto
Village Voice culture critic
" Even if she just stands there eating something from Chuck E. Cheese , Britney will fare better than last year .
If she 's smart , she 'll make a snappy joke about her '07 debacle and thereby clear all tension in the room .
She can then go on to be the star we love and possibly even be the queen of the night , if she ironically ends up winning the big awards . "
" I also feel she should unveil a radical image change to show how she 's matured and grown .
A Sarah Palin schoolmarm - from - the - tundra look would definitely get her some renewed attention ( but not with a gun ) . "
Lizzie Post
Great - granddaughter of etiquette guru Emily Post , author of " How Do You Work This Life Thing ? "
" She 's shown the world that she can be outrageous .
She 's done the kiss with Madonna , she 's done the big snake .
Now 's the time to simply show she 's the girl who can come out , deliver lines , host professionally and get off the stage .
" Now would be the perfect time for her to show a very simple , a very positive and a very professional side of herself .
She should n't joke too much about what she 's been through .
If MTV 's writers throw in jokes about her recent troubles , she herself should take them with a grain of salt .
When she 's onstage , she should give a smile and a wink , acknowledge her past but show she 's happy to be here now . "
Ted Casablanca

" If she asked my advice , I 'd tell her to stay home .
It 's too soon .
She needs a standout , comeback performance .
And if you ask me , this is n't it .
It 's too closely associated with that disastrous performance a year ago , and she 's not back in top form yet .
An ' Oh hey , b*tch is here ! ' is not going to cut it . "
But maybe I can make use of this too :
The Federal Reserve and Treasury Department on Tuesday unveiled a plan to pump $ 800 billion into the struggling U.S. economy in an attempt to jumpstart lending by banks to consumers and small businesses .
The government hopes that these initiatives will enable more money to flow to consumers in the form of loans than has occurred so far in previous bailout plans .
One program will make $ 200 billion available from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to holders of securities backed by consumer debt , such as credit cards , car loans and student loans .
Hey , my wife has a small business .
I wonder if she can qualify for $ 100 M or so ?
I might not need that lottery bailout ticket I bought at 7 - 11 anymore !
So , it appears that the TreasFed are desperately trying to improve consumer confidence in the run-up to the holiday season .
But it ’s not going to work .
You know why ?
To that end , government officials said that they would not set up the $ 200 billion consumer lending program until February .
So officials could n’t say if the mere announcement of the program would cause lenders to make more credit available to consumers in time for the holiday shopping season .
Paulson described the $ 200 billion consumer lending program as a first step , one that could be expanded later to include different kinds of debt , including assets backed by commercial real estate mortgages and business debt .
As you know , the government announcing that it is going to do something often has the effect of doing something .
I.e. the passage of a tax cut that wo n’t take place for 1 - 2 years ( or the non-extension of a tax cut that is temporary ) tells the market what to expect moving forward , and they act on the expectations of future reality .
Unfortunately , in this case they can only act on uncertainty , not expectation of reality .
The TreasFed already burst that expectation :
The larger part of the new program is geared toward ending the mortgage crisis , which was the original intent of the bank bailout plan proposed in September and signed into law in October .
That plan , known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP , was quickly dropped for one in which Treasury instead made direct capital investments in banks in return for the government receiving preferred shares in the institutions getting funds .
We know that they ’re going to change their minds as they see fit .
So we cannot plan our holiday purchases based upon interventions the government MIGHT make to debt markets in February .
We simply have no level of trust that those interventions will be made * .
Is there any other way to spin this than that they simply do n’t know what they ’re doing ?
* By the way , this is not an acceptance that these interventions SHOULD be made .
But the only thing worse than government intervention is the expectation that government will intervene but without knowledge of their plans .
When government — not the market — crowns winners and losers , you prefer to wait until you know the outcome before you place your bets .
DK :
Probably the best way to start is by having you summarize what you learned from your study .
AS : I think a major finding that developed as we analyzed the results of the one thousand questionnaires was the deep involvement of the men .
Eighty - four percent of the men felt that they had been a full partner in resolving an unwanted and ill - timed pregnancy .
That 's contrary to the impression one gets from the media or from feminist literature which continues to exaggerate this as a solo challenge , as something that the woman alone wrestles with and decides .
A second major finding was the anxiety and the high level of personal distress that men reported .
An overwhelming proportion of them had thoughts about the fetus , had dreamed about the child that would not be and anticipated misgivings after the abortion .
Ninety - eight percent said that if they could help it , they would never , ever find themselves in this situation again .
Another finding was that the single greatest concern of the men was with the well being of their sex partner .
Men in the waiting room are well know to clinic personnel for the frequency with which they jump up out of their seats to inquire about the well - being of their partner .
We asked men if they would like to accompany their partner through the procedure or be with them in the recovery room .
We found that a large percentage of the men would have opted to do so .
Clinics tell us there is no interest in this ; that the guys are basically coat holders and drivers .
So we get this enormous incongruity between clinic practice , and the wishes of one half of the couple that have come to the clinic that day for help .
DK : If , as you pointed out , this can be a matter of great distress to men and a traumatic episode in their lives , why has this issue remained invisible ?.
AS : I think there is one , single , overriding explanation .
That is the haste with which the matter is perceived to be a potential power struggle , as a potential front in the eternal battle of the sexes .
Its perceived as a zero sum situation .
Feminist , happily not all , but many of them , are ideologically intent on keeping this a non-subject .
My argument is that this is shortsighted and an example of counter productive thinking .
The progress we can make in gender relations is not going to come through repression of difficult subjects , its going to come through their airing .
Women should know this through the history of modern feminism .
Friedan , Steinman and others helped legitimize and make common currency many problems that confront women ; problem that previously had been perpetuated by their avoidance .
DK : The other half of this question concerns men ; they could collectively address this problem and seek some changes .
Why have we heard so little from them ?
AS : Well , I 've attended two or three of the national men's meetings and some regional meetings .
The turn - out for a work - shop I would run as a discussion group at these meetings was very , very small .
There are several explanations .
First this is a taboo topic .
This is n't one that men talk about very readily .
It 's very rare that men tell one another of their involvement in an abortion .
Its a repressed topic that lacks trendy acceptance .
Also a vast number of guys have never really thought about this .
When your father gives that incredibly awkward , best effort at sex education this subject is often not part of it .
This is not something a large number of guys have any familiarity with , its terra incognita and they do n't have many thoughts on the subject .
That 's why one of the largest shocks that sexually active young men encounter is the shock that comes from hearing their sex partner say " The test is back and we 're pregnant and I 'm going to have an abortion . "
I call this the longest run-on sentence in the English language and one of the most painful .
It brings information at the start of the sentence , brings a decision near the end , but it usually ends with the equivalent of a question mark because it's a test and a probe .
She want 's to know " what do you think ? "
Now the guy has just been hit with a lightening bolt and what he thinks is " I 've just been hit with a lightening bolt ! ! "
But usually the response is " Whatever you want . "
DK
The family planning services and abortion providers are in a position to bring awareness and support to men who are in this situation .
They do n't seem to be doing much either .
AS : The best of them send the message with the female to the male that they , the counselor , are available should the male want help .
The best of the Planned Parenthood clinics invite the male to sit about a foot behind the female in the office while the female is up close to the counselor and gets attention .
This abortion counselor is a staff person being paid for time and expertise .
Third party insurance companies cover the woman , but the male would have to come up with money of his own .
There are no insurance companies , that I 'm aware of , that cover a male for abortion counseling and males might be reluctant to draw on them anyway given this taboo .
In any case it 's not seen as a revenue stream for the counselors .
Also the counselors feel they have a full case load just handling the women .
What if we were to multiply the case load with having men out there ?
I once encouraged a clinic in the Philadelphia suburb to invite men in from the waiting room for counseling on Saturday mornings .
They had anticipated that maybe one out of four men would take advantage of the offer .
They had anticipated that the average male would take no more than the forty - five minutes max that they allocated to women .
They were wrong on both counts .
Close to one hundred percent of the guys signed up for the session .
What with weeping and telling their stories , catharsis , and the rest , many of the males required an hour or more before they could return to the waiting room .
After about three months the experiment was ended ; it created a budget problem .
DK : Do you think it 's a factor that these services would rather not even have the problem of the impact of abortion on men brought up ?
AS : It 's a combination .
It 's not a matter of either / or .
Along with the notion that they would have to expand their staff they would have to bring some males on staff .
Ninety - eight percent of all the clinic counselors in America are female .
I argue that males in the waiting room might want to chose the gender of their counselors .
DK : Since just about everybody seems to have agreed not to talk about the impact of abortion on men why should we bring it up at all ?
What do you see as the possible harmful effects of ignoring this subject and continuing to allow men to go through this experience unprocessed ?
AS : I think that what 's harmful can be found first in the numbers .
We 've got about thirty - five percent of the women as abortion repeaters and perhaps twenty - five percent of the men .
So we 're not doing well at preventing repeat occurrences of an act that everyone finds repugnant and painful .
That 's number one .
Number two is that we 're groping , both genders , toward more sanity , more care , more love in gender relations .
We 're groping toward more honesty .
We 're exploring what do we mean by manhood ?
What is the manly way ?
My contention is that taking something as solemn as the termination of a pregnancy and making it an invisible non-event for the male partner is not a contribution towards clarifying manhood .
Manhood is a matter of rights and responsibilities .
DK : You mention in your book that men who do n't deal with their feelings about an abortion may have a hard time maintaining relationships in the future .
AS : Yes , we 're worried but we do n't have enough good research on this .
It 's speculative .
We did interview at a six month interval a small number of the men .
We find that guys that have not ventilated , have not processed the experience have at a level of their psyche , a feeling of second class citizenship .
They were not a full partner in the matter .
So there is a lack of resolution , a seething discontent .
Also a sense that the next time this happens or something like it happens , such as some family planning decision , they are not going to be given a role .
So they become reluctant to trust and reluctant to commit .
I would speculate that some of the male 's notorious reluctance to commit may have as a component guys who have failed to work through a prior abortion experience .
DK : A problem of self esteem ?
AS : I think so .
And I think this is all a grievous policy mistake on the part of people who should know better .
The pro-choice men and women are not pro-abortion .
Nobody 's pro-abortion who has any smarts or a heart .
So the pro-choice group should be vigorous in its effort to involve adult men .
DK : So what needs to happen to see this whole situation improved .
What type of reforms are in order ?
AS : We need reforms from many angles .
One reform would be exactly this kind of media attention to the subject , taking the subject out of the closet .
It needs to be aired out in a constructive way .
We also need educational reform .
I think in the junior high schools and high schools professional sex educators need to legitimize the discussion of constructive male involvement in abortion decision making .
The third thing is a reform in the clinics .
I urge the clinics to thoroughly revamp their approach to the male partner .
If they cannot always offer counseling , and I wish they would , at the very least take advantage of the three hour wait to invite the guys in for contraception education to see if they can reduce this twenty - five percent repeater rate .
I also urge the insurance companies and other third party payers to revamp their policies to give a bonus if the male partner will show up for counseling .
If the abortion is going to cost the insurance company three hundred dollars let there be some incentive towards prevention .
It could eventually save the companies some money .
Another reform I would suggest is a reform aimed at the clergy and the mental health profession .
I would like them to advertise on clinic walls to offer their services as specialist in abortion counseling .
Last point of all pertains to the men's movement .
The men's movement could reserve maybe a page in each issue of their publications and newsletters , and reserve a spot in every local , regional and national meeting for the processing by male participants in abortion of what it is that they 've gone through .
What did we learn and how do we grow from the experience ?
I maintain that through the grieving process and through the separation from the child that might have been a man can come out stronger and healthier .
It 's not an unmitigated tragedy ; it 's a tragic event but our obligation to the fetus that wo n't be brought to term is to make something loving and caring of the experience .
DK : You recently stated that you supported spousal notification as had been passed in Pennsylvania and consequently overturned by the Supreme Court last summer .
Why did you favor notification ?
AS : My stand is a principled stand .
In principle I want the twosome responsible for the biological fact of conception to resolve the fate of the fetus .
It 's my notion that men should help sweat the decision .
Starting from that principle I would go even farther .
I would like the law to notify the unwed male .
I make no distinction in this matter between married and unwed .
If you are a co-partner in the beginning of life I think you should be a co-partner in its ending , in its resolution .
DK : One reason men avoid dealing with abortions is their reluctance to get involved a situation where they are powerless .
It seems to me that spousal notification was an according of a right without going all the way to spousal consent .
Without this fundamental right - to - know men have no reproductive rights whatsoever .
AS : Women say " It compromises my decision making .
If I do n't want them to know , it 's my body and I wo n't tell them . "
My argument is that your body has in fact been altered by the product of two party behavior , a product that has genetic inheritance from a guy that just might care to petition for its bringing to term .
You make the final decision , but to pretend that what has changed your body is the product of your own wish fullness is manifestly false .
So I would like you to hear out the husband .
Its not just notification of course , its also the idea that the husband can then plead .

Appalachia is supposed to be a one of Barack Obama ’s biggest weak spots .
But judging from a surprise work stoppage at the Blacksville No. 2 coal mine in West Virginia , Mr. Obama evidently has some pockets of support there .
Last Monday more than 440 members of the United Mine Workers of America took the day off , halting production at the Blacksville mine .
The union declared it a Memorial Day , largely to protest what union officials said was an anti-Obama ad that the National Rifle Association was filming at the mine .
Phil Smith , the union ’s communications director , said that the mine ’s owner , Consol Energy , allowed the film crew to go on the property , and that the crew asked several miners : “ How do you feel about having your Second Amendment rights taken away if Obama becomes president . ”
Word spread to several miners who supported Senator Obama , someone called union headquarters in Virginia , and soon Cecil Roberts , the president of the parent union , declared a Memorial Day ( which is allowed under the contract ) to protest the NRA ’s filming ( and to show support for Mr. Obama ) .
“ This was a surprise visit , ” said Eric Greathouse , safety chairman of UMWA Local 1702 , in an interview on WBOY , a television station in Clarksburg W.Va .
“ A lot of the miners felt that this was a direct slap in the face of the union because they were trying to coerce our people into saying things against Barack Obama . ”
The parent union has endorsed Mr. Obama , asserting that he would be better than Senator John McCain for the nation ’s workers and labor unions .
Andrew Arulanandam , the N.R.A. ’s director of public affairs , said that the film crew had been welcomed to the site .
They interviewed a few people and left without incident .
“ Union members are the backbone of the N.R.A. ’s membership , ” Mr. Arulanandam said .
He said the protest “ is clearly mischief driven by the Obama campaign . ”
Thomas F. Hoffman , Consol ’s senior vice president for external affairs , said the company meant no harm by letting the N.R.A. crew film at the mine .
He said that an N.R.A. film crew had interviewed some miners at Blacksville No. 2 several years ago without any problems .
But the company , based in Canonsburg , Pa. , was surprised by the work stoppage .
“ We were disappointed that the whole thing came out the way it came out , ” Mr. Hoffman said .
Mr. Hoffman said that Consol asked the N.R.A. not to use any of the interviews done at Blacksville in any future ads , and he said the N.R.A. had agreed .
He said the union went ahead with its work stoppage even though it had been informed that the interviews would not be used .
Mr. Smith , the union spokesman , said the work stoppage was justified .
“ Our members were a little concerned about being led down a garden path , ” he said .
“ We were upset that the company allowed the N.R.A. to come on its property and try to use our members for political purposes knowing we had already endorsed Obama and a lot of our members had already endorsed Obama . ”
Cigarette maker Philip Morris has developed an inhaler that could deliver a nicotine mist deep into the lungs , giving smokers a satisfying dose of the addictive drug without the carcinogens , gases and toxic metals that make tobacco smoke so dangerous .
Cloaked in secrecy , the device was invented nearly a dozen years ago at a time the tobacco industry was vigorously denying that nicotine was addictive , internal company documents show .
It was part of an effort by the top cigarette maker to explore the possibility of offering a “ clean ” form of nicotine to those who ca n’t or wo n’t quit .
A nicotine inhaler probably would draw a mixed response , similar to the debate over offering clean needles to heroin users .
Though some health professionals might object to any product that sustains nicotine dependence , many others say “ clean ” nicotine could be a powerful weapon in the fight against tobacco - related diseases .
For reasons Philip Morris declines to discuss , the project appears to have stalled .
The company has been aggressively courting pharmaceutical companies to use the inhaler for therapeutic drugs , but its future as a cigarette alternative is a mystery .

“ For competitive reasons , we do not comment on our future business plans , ” said Peggy Roberts , senior director of communications for Philip Morris USA , which is part of Altria Group Inc .
For Philip Morris , a nicotine inhaler would pose clear risks .
The company controls 50 % of the U.S. cigarette market on the strength of its Marlboro brand , the world ’s most popular cigarette .
An alternative product , if successful , could cannibalize Philip Morris ’ existing business -- and possibly create a new public relations headache .
Mitch Zeller , a former Food and Drug Administration official , said some might accuse the company “ of getting smokers at both ends ” and “ keeping the customer in the franchise in a very clever way . ”
Unlike cigarettes , which are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration , a tobacco - free nicotine product would face a long and costly government review , with uncertain results .

Yet , as it strives to improve its tattered image , Philip Morris could benefit by appearing to be part of the solution , some observers said .
“ The cigarette manufacturers do n’t want to kill their customers , ” said Kenneth Warner , dean of the University of Michigan School of Public Health .
“ That ’s simply an unfortunate side effect of use of the product . ”
“ If they can come up with a substitute that would capture the same - size market , they ’d love it , ” Warner said .
It would “ save them a lot of legal fees ” and “ they ’d feel more virtuous . ”
Since admitting the dangers of smoking a few years ago , Philip Morris has publicly pledged to lower the risks .

As Michael Szymanczyk , the company ’s chief executive , told a group of financial analysts in 2002 , “ Our scientists are working with a single - minded focus on finding ways to reduce a smoker ’s exposure to potentially harmful constituents in tobacco smoke . ”
Yet the company and its rivals often have been accused of holding back safety advances to avoid undermining their existing products .
It ’s a charge echoed by the Justice Department in its racketeering case against the tobacco industry in Washington .
Tobacco companies have denied the claim , citing major investments in potentially less risky products such as Philip Morris ’ Accord and R.J. Reynolds ’
Eclipse , both designed to heat , rather than burn , tobacco .
But William A. Farone , former director of applied research at Philip Morris , said the company had a long history of exploring promising developments such as the nicotine inhaler -- then getting cold feet .
“ They always worried in the ultimate about losing the damn gold mine they have , ” said Farone , who was fired in 1984 for what the company said was insubordination .

Now , Chrysalis Technologies Inc. , a tiny Philip Morris subsidiary , is trying to sell the inhaler as an alternative to injections for a variety of medications , including pain remedies and treatments for emphysema , a disease caused by smoking .
Last January , for example , Chrysalis touted the hand - held device , called Aria , at a drug - delivery conference in San Diego .
Brooks Adams , director of business development for Chrysalis , described it as a “ compact , easy - to - use portable inhaler ” with “ high lung - dosing potential , ” according to a copy of his presentation .
Nicotine is a mild stimulant that helps some people to focus and relax when under stress .
Although a crucial part of a deadly product , nicotine by itself is not very bad for most people , experts say .
It does increase the heart rate and could harm people with an existing cardiac condition .
For others , however , the effect is similar to mild exercise , said Dr. Neal Benowitz , a nicotine expert and professor of medicine , psychiatry and biopharmaceutical sciences at UC San Francisco .

Existing nicotine replacement products -- patches , gum and inhalers sold to help smokers quit -- are designed not to be addictive .
They do not deliver the same satisfying dose of nicotine as cigarettes , and many who try them relapse into smoking .
But if the most stubbornly addicted were to trade cigarettes for regular use of a nicotine inhaler , “ the health benefits would be enormous , ” Benowitz said .
Writing in the journal Tobacco Control in 2003 , Walton Sumner , an associate professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis , said “ clean nicotine inhalers might improve public health as much as any feasible tobacco control effort . ”
Some in the tobacco industry have long shared that opinion .
In a memo written in 1972 , R.J. Reynolds scientist Claude E. Teague Jr. posed this question :
“ If our business is fundamentally that of supplying nicotine ... why is it really necessary that allegedly harmful ‘ tar ’ accompany that nicotine ?
Advertisement
“ There should be some simpler , ‘ cleaner , ’ more efficient and direct way to provide the desired nicotine dosage ... free of allegedly harmful combustion products . ”
By the time Farone left Philip Morris in 1984 , the company was already investigating new ideas for delivering nicotine , the former director of applied research said .
He recalled an experiment in which company scientists mixed a solution of nicotine , water and propylene glycol , put it in a pressurized sprayer , and gave it to him to try .
Internal documents show that research over the next several years led to the invention in January 1994 of the “ capillary aerosol generator , ” the inhaler ’s technical name .
The documents are available under terms of the 1998 legal settlements between state attorneys general and the tobacco industry .
Cigarette makers agreed to make internal records public , and they now appear on websites such as www.legacy.library.ucsf.edu at UC San Francisco .
References to the device appear in numerous memos , minutes and briefings spanning a decade .

The invention was the most ambitious piece of what Philip Morris dubbed its “ Ideal Smoke ” program , an effort to develop less toxic , commercially viable products .
The Accord device , which delivers about as much tar as an ultra - low - tar cigarette , is an “ Ideal Smoke ” concept ; it is being test - marketed in Richmond , Va. , and Japan .
According to a 1991 company document , an ideal inhaler would be designed to deliver a “ controllable and sufficient nicotine concentration . ”
A 1992 document cites research to determine the amount of nicotine solution needed in the inhaler “ to give a nicotine response relative to specific cigarette deliveries . ”
Another memo that year reflects the thinking behind the work .
“ The primary reason ” people smoke “ is to deliver nicotine into their bodies , ” the memo says .
New forms of nicotine could “ replace or transform the worldwide cigarette business as we know it . ”
The inhaler had to be capable of producing minute particles of nicotine the way a cigarette does .
Success was finally achieved “ in producing aerosols similar to tobacco smoke , ” another memo says .
“ Particularly exciting is the very small aerosol particle size and the higher efficiency for delivery ... to the deep lung . ”

In a second phase of work , dubbed Project Leap , scientists and executives began to study the suitability of the inhaler as a consumer product .
“ Attributes : does not contain tobacco ” but “ delivers nicotine , ” a May 1994 document says .
Smoking involves the rituals of lighting up and inhaling and exhaling smoke , and it ’s unclear whether research had progressed to the point of gauging the willingness of smokers to give up those routines .
But the project collided with an unprecedented wave of legal attacks in 1994 -- all based on claims that tobacco companies consciously had sought to addict consumers .
In response , Philip Morris publicly denied what documents showed was a basic premise of Project Leap : that nicotine was addictive and the main reason people smoked .
First , the FDA stunned the industry in February 1994 , declaring its intent to regulate tobacco products as drug delivery devices .
( The effort failed when the industry took a successful challenge to the Supreme Court . )

March brought the filing of the Castano case -- a nationwide class - action suit on behalf of allegedly addicted smokers .
And in April tobacco chief executives , including Philip Morris ’ president at the time , William Campbell , testified under oath before Congress that nicotine was n’t addictive .
Research on the inhaler shows that inside Philip Morris , “ it was a given that nicotine was addictive , ” said Mitch Zeller , the FDA ’s director of tobacco programs at the time the agency launched its attack .
Had word of the research leaked out , “ it would have exposed the hypocrisy of all of their public statements at the time about nicotine , ” Zeller said .
Whether to avoid that risk or for some other reason , documents suggest the company ’s focus changed .
A December 1994 memo describes plans to fund research at Virginia Commonwealth University on using the device “ for applications in the pharmaceutical industry . ”

That research is continuing at Virginia Commonwealth , which , like Philip Morris , is based in Richmond .
According to the university ’s figures , Chrysalis since 2000 has given $ 11 million to a team headed by Peter R. Byron , an aerosol expert who is chairman of the school ’s department of pharmaceutics .
Byron said that he could not discuss details of the work but that it did not involve nicotine .
Even so , a company document from 2001 shows the original idea was still alive .
It ’s a list of research plans , including a study on whether the inhaler “ can be developed into a reduced - harm product . ”
Oct. 25 , 2008  -- Fumiko Satake , a 29 - year - old Tokyo wife , picked up one bunch of green bananas at a supermarket in downtown Tokyo -- not because she preferred unripe bananas , but because that was all she could get her hands on .
" I came to the store early today so that I could get bananas , " Satake sighed .
" And there are hardly any here .
It has been this way for the past few months . "
The banana has long been a fruit of choice for many Japanese .
In 2007 , the Japanese consumed 970,000 tons of bananas .
But a new diet has swept across the nation and become the culprit for the sudden spike in banana consumption , and a shortage at grocery stores .
" My husband has lost about six pounds since he started the morning banana diet a few months ago , " Satake said .
" I am not sure how much the fruit did for me , but my husband has been following this diet and he needs his bananas . "
The morning banana diet debuted on a few TV shows over the past six months .
During one program that aired in September , a Japanese singer said she lost roughly 15 pounds in one and a half months on the banana diet .
The basic instructions are simple .
Eat as many bananas as you want in the morning with room - temperature water .
Enjoy a regular lunch and dinner ( but finish dinner before 8 p.m. ) and try to go to bed before midnight .
You could snack in between meals ( not right after each meal ) and even have alcohol -- as long as it's in moderation .
" I never imagined my posting on the Internet could change so many peoples ' lives , " said Hitoshi Watanabe , a 31 - year - old former employee at a printing company in Tokyo .
Watanabe managed to lose 38 pounds by using the diet regimen that his wife , Sumiko designed for him .
" I started to gain weight as I started to work full time after college , " Watanabe said .
" I guess a combination of overtime , late dinner , lack of exercise and stress all contributed to my weight gain . "
Watanabe tried to exercise and lost a few pounds , but then hit a plateau .
" I did not know what else to do , " he said .
A Diet Easy to Live With
Sumiko , a 31 - year - old pharmacist , studied preventive medicine and came up with the method for her then - boyfriend .
" I just wanted something that would not torture me , " said Watanabe .
" Bananas are rich in vitamins and minerals , but low in calories .
They also contain properties which fight the build - up of acids .
They are readily available and reasonably priced .
And you do not need any utensils to eat them .
It is just so easy and I thought I could give it a try . "
Watanabe lost four pounds in the first month and kept losing similar amounts each month until he lost a total of 38 pounds in less than one year .
" I did not know losing weight could be this easy , " Watanabe said .
" So , I just wanted to share this with other people . "
That was when he put the banana diet information on mixi , the largest social networking service in Japan , where registered users can access information both from computers and cell phones .
" I did not know so many people would show an interest .
The response was just overwhelming . "
Watanabe certainly did not mean to create a banana shortage all over Japan , but that is exactly what the nation experienced .
Akihiro Takenaka , a produce manager of a Tokyo supermarket , Ozeki , said the demands for bananas are still high and the supply simply cannot catch up .
" I have been in the produce business for almost 20 years and I have never seen this kind of phenomenon , " said Takenaka .
" We usually purchase 15 cases of bananas every day , but we have not been able to secure that amount for the past few months .
We are lucky if we get five cases . "
Hiromi Otaki of Dole Japan Co. , the top banana importer to Japan , said the company has increased imports by 25 to 27 percent in the last few months .
" Summer and winter are tough seasons to sell bananas , " said Otaki .
" Summer has been especially a tough time for us , but this past summer was just incredible . "
Morning Banana Diet Hits Fad Status
Japanese have gone through their share of diet fads -- from apple and cocoa to fermented beans .
When one item is taken up by the media , Japanese rush to stores and empty the shelves .
What makes the banana diet stand above the rest is its longevity .
" This fad started early this year and might have peaked this summer , fall , " said Miwa Tamura , a national registered dietitian .
" But there are still a lot of people who follow this method . "
Roughly 2,400 people have signed up to access Watanabe 's site .
Many of them post a " diary " to show their progress .
" One man has kept writing in for more than 700 days so far , " Watanabe said .
" He had lost about 19 kg ( 41 pounds ) so far . "
Watanabe encourages people to start a " buddy " system to help monitor each other 's progress .
" I had my wife to help me , but being on a diet by yourself can be a lonely thing , " said Watanabe .
" I recommend people record their progress and share that with people . "
Losing weight was not the only fruit of Watanabe 's labor .
The banana diet plan was so appreciated , Watanabe had a few book offers .
Four books came out this year alone -- more than 900,000 copies sold so far .
His first book has been translated and sold in Korea and Taiwan .
Watanabe said the book will soon be sold in a few more Asian countries .
Although Watanabe hopes the banana diet can be as life - changing for others as it was for him , he warns that eating bananas alone will not directly lead to weight reduction .
" People tend to focus just on bananas and forget other things I mention , such as finishing dinner before eight or going to bed before midnight , " Watanabe said .
" These help your body and mind to rest , which is also important for weight management .
You will need to create an environment where body and mind can be released from stress .
Weight reduction also means stress reduction .
Bananas are not your magic wand , but they could help you .
They did for me . "

Besides the nasty Ubuntu bug , which I was unable to do anything meaningful with , yesterday I also found a small bug in Ruby ’s YAML package :
irb ( main ) : 004:0 >
YAML :: load ( ' 1900-01-01T00:00:00+00:00 ') ArgumentError : time out of range
The problem is that the YAML implementation that Ruby is using , called “ syck ” interprets that kind of date as something that it should make a Time for :
else if ( strcmp ( type_id , " timestamp#iso8601 " ) == 0 ) { obj = rb_syck_mktime ( n->data.str->ptr , n->data.str->len ) ;
So I did a little bit of hacking on the C code , and made it create a DateTime object instead .
My fix works , although I ’m not sure it ’s the best possible way of tackling the problem .
The patch is attached to the bug report here :

This matters because my Rails text fixtures had some dates in them that were quite old , and this was causing problems .

Info on MO as included in this report : https://bradblog.com/?p=6559
Hi Brad , Just wanted to let you know that Missourians for Honest Elections is in the process of confirming five separate reports of vote flipping --- from Democrat to Republican --- on the iVotronic machines that are the only means the Board of Elections is providing for in - person absentee voting at its headquarters in Maplewood [ St. Louis County , MO ] .
-- Cynthia Richards
Working to get more details , confirm on those , but buried with reports coming from all over , including vote flips in Houston on Hart InterCivic machines and in Nevada on Sequoia machines .
Doing my best to keep up here

thanx 4 the resource , Brad .
( i know u r swamped )
will still try 2 access this info later as Missourians for Honest Elections is down temporarily .
as an election judge in Jackson Co. , Mo. i've been told that " no electronic devices , except for the ones provided by the election board " ( i.e. a pager , cell phone & pda ) are allowed in the polling places in our county .
also that as judges , we are to ask that all voters put away their cell phones or other devices upon entering to vote .
i was assured that this is because of causing a disruption at the polls ( being noisy & causing confusion ) or possible electioneering - nothing else .
it will be hard 4 anyone 2 video their voting experience once inside .

One of the benefits of digital devises is that they requires little or no calibration .

I 'd expect no less from my " friend " Charlene Davis in Jackson County , MO .
( She is , after all , the one who helped arrest a voter for attempting to vote with a perfectly legal non-Photo ID in the recent primary !
And the one who ran to Fox " News " with the bullshit about being buried by fraudulent ACORN voter registrations a week or so ago , even though ACORN had n't done any registration work in Kansas City since August ! )
I can only hope that folks stand up for themselves , and the privacy of their own ballot , to shoot any such incidents that they have .
It 's for your country .
I have video taped my own voting experience out here in Los Angeles , and when the computer printed 4 out of 12 of my votes incorrectly , it was that cell phone video that helped the Registrar to determine what had gone wrong with the computer voting system .
It 's certainly allowed in CA , and OH SoS Jennifer Brunner told me personally that it was allowed in OH , as well .
Have n't check on that point with the MO SoS , however .
Hope you will !
( Do n't trust Charleton Davis ! )

BH - Happy to splain .
" Calibration " is needed , as I understand it , essentially , to tell the computer which candidate is under which part of the screen .
To map the touch - sensitive layer to the graphic display .
As to plugging in cartridges , after an election has already been programmed , well that 's just frickin ' insane , ought to be illegal , and just one of the reasons I 'm furious that the Democrats are sitting back and doing absolutely nothing about this issue , and allowing both election officials and voting company employees to access these election - programmed machines in this way .
It 's insane , knowing how easy it is to game these systems in precisely that way .

I do n't like how they use the terminology .
To me that would be loading a setup or job parameters or a patch plan .
And being in the digital domain it should never have to be done again unless of memory failure , election change or static and if it did screw up it should change some check sum value and display an error message .

It 's all in the programming !
My Grandson - in - law , who is an expert programmer , says , " Give me five minutes alone with ANY of these machines , and I 'll elect Mickey Mouse to any office in the land ! "
He also says " I do n't even have to touch the machines !
The mischief can be done remotely ! "
( I HOPE he 's full of prunes , but having seen some of the things he can do , I suspect that the truth is even worse than he says . )
There are LOTS of Hackers out there who like to exploit " Weaknesses " in the system - and when the machines are originally programmed to be vulnerable to ONE type of hacking , other types become easier .
We might wake up on Nov. 5 to find that Nader won the election !

I am a software test engineer ( 15 + yrs ) in Seattle ; I have worked for MS and every major software producer in this area - the world 's center of software development .
Here is the bottom line : the functions associated with the voting process are utilized every day on any commercial website you care to visit .
Every single time you click , " OK " vs. " Cancel " , this technology is applied successfully .
The notion that there is some mystery about how to properly test and ship simple software like this is beyond plainly ridiculous - it takes a special desire to screw up a simple program like a vote catcher .
This entire hubbub is blatant voter fraud and every American ought to do all they can to go after these criminals .

As a West Virginia resident who voted early , I can assure that I have been on top of this problem .
After the problems in Jackson , Putnam , and Ohio Counties were reported last week , I spoke with the Secretary of State 's office requesting that she order all county clerk's to recallibrate the machines daily during early voting .
The Secretary graciously issued such an order .
Now , in Ohio County , the Clerk has taken it upon herself to personally recallibrate the machines each day .
Furthermore , they are provided pencils with erasers to each and every voter who comes into to vote early .
And , by using the eraser tip , the votes seem to be more accurate .
The clerk ensured me that these pencils will also be available to all voters next Tuesday at each voting precinct .
Unfortunately , the Secretary of State has not yet ordered all county clerks in WV to follow the same method .
So , I just spoke with the Elections Division in Charleston , and requested that the Secretary order pencils be provided to all voters in all counties .
I have never been wary or suspicious of Secretary Ireland , and even after this , I have no reason to doubt her judgment .
I also believe that the Secretary will take my advice .
Worry not , friends , I will stay on top of this story .

This is insane .
As a designer of industrial control computers , I was intrigued by HAVA , thinking ( in 2002 ) I would build the better voting mousetrap , until I heard Diebold was gonna do it and they 'd undoubtedly beat my time - to - market .
Man , if I knew then what I know now I 'd be filthy rich and we would n't need to be here .
Anyway , the use of the word " calibration " is misleading .
The ONLY component that would need that would be the touch - sensitive part of the screen , to align it physically with what it was reading logically .
If the " straight - party " button works , the ONLY way the wrong candidate could then be auto - selected would be by a bug or , um , " feature " .
Now , if " calibration " really means " configuration " , it would be easy for the " straight - party " selection to be told that Nader is a Democrat ( for example ) and would be a big certification hole , too , not related to any firmware problem or certification .

On the ESS machines , the serial number is at the bottom of the machine ( facing you if you 're voting ) on the left hand side .
Ours start with a " V " followed by 7 numbers .
ASK TO VOTE PAPER !!!!
The poll workers have been told to NOT inform voters they have this option - why , I do n't know , I think it 's terribly wrong to not fully inform voters of every option .
But please do n't yell at the poll workers ( that would be me ) .
We are trying to do everything we can to make this election run smoothly , and we are just as concerned as you are if the machines are not running properly .
Poll workers are there to help , not hinder your vote .
You can be assertive without being snotty about it .

Option 2 : The Democrats are idiots who are going to roll over and play dead .
They think they can beat election fraud with massive numbers , and a " ground game , " not realizing that many of their " massive numbers " have already been purged from the voting rolls or will have their ballots " spoiled , " or will have their massive number of votes " flipped . "

Well , if they can make ATMs that do n't need to be ' recalibrated ' all the time , I 'd think they can make voting machines that do n't need to be constantly recalibrated .
I had to calibrate my Nintendo DS once ..
Once .
I had to calibrate my Nintendo Wi once .. once ( my nephew decided to recalibrate once , but did n't need to , it did n't help his game .. lol ) .
If they can make a machine that gives you exactly what you press when it 's banking , they certainly can do the same with voting .
Since something bad is happening during voting but not with ATMs , we should presume intentional misconduct .

Note :
When those who study election integrity speak out regarding the insanity of using DRE's for something as innately vital as elections we are not being " luddites " or " hysterics " ... we often tend to be geeks ourselves , in fact .
But no amount of simple , elegant coding ( which is ignoring the fact that the manufacturers actually have a vested interest in producing the exact opposite ) no amount of " clean code " can override the fatal flaw of e-voting : Computers work out their inevitable bugs ( and malware etc is found ) by comparing the actual inputs with the actual outputs to see if they match the expected outputs .
Even ATM 's screw up and get infected etc.etc ... but a wise customer will have their bank statements and receipts ( input and output ) handy and the bank then makes the problem go away .
But the ballot needs to be secret , and the voter should not be able to prove how they voted .
This is to protect us from voters selling their votes and to protect the voter from coercion .
( it 's not a good idea having the people you 're voting out of office or voting to have reregulated know exactly how you voted . )
So the input of " vote " needs to be secret and in DRE's this input is deliberately lost , and the voter does not , can not , have the slightest clue as to what the machine has actually done with the input ... and any so - called " paper trail " is merely an after - the - fact justification as untrustworthy as the machine that printed it .
This is not " luddism " ... this is the simple acknowledgment that the tokens representing information that are used by the computer at the time the vote is taken are imperceptible by the voter ... and after the vote count the computer can easily be made to lie like a rug all day long about what it did with that vote .
Computers are simple , trusting things and are easily gamed by the smartest artificial intelligences on the planet : Humans .
There is no escaping this simple fact : secure elections and e-voting are flatly incompatible and always have been .
Paper ballots with proper ballot controls made the coexistence of both ballot secrecy and ballot authentication possible ... not because they are " crude " or " primitive " concepts but because they keep the tokens of voter interaction at a macroscopic level were those keen humans can keep a handle on them ... especially useful as we are the ones constantly competing to game the system anyway .
And paper ballots just turned out to be some appropriate tokens for the voting interaction , is all .
Now is usually the time when some trusting soul unthinkingly screams " ENCRYPTION WILL SAVE US ALL " and leaps into the fray .... but I need to close out this particular comment and get a beer before I continue .
Feel free to leap though ... punji sticks are standing by and I shall return for cleanup ...

People , this is standard Windows CE .
They use standard calibration tables where offsets are used to adjust physical registered touches to the logic screen inputs .
Read this comment over and over again :
https://bradblog.com/?p=6576#comment-370063
When you select Straight Ticket , we have to assume the touchscreen goes into it 's software and selects all candidates .
It does not register fake touches to pretend you voted in a certain way .
There is NO WAY calibration can be blamed for Nader being selected under straight ticket .
If I had to guess , this machine is hacked to make it look like Obama would get chosen and then McKinney or someone showed up and screwed up the selection .
I would guess the GOP has framed Obama with broken touchscreens .

Electronic voting systems are not infallible .
What if there is software that flips behind the screen ( or a delayed flipping action ) , which looks OK to the voter , but in theory flips during the process of transmitting ?
Regular quality checks of machines in rotation , in each voting station would be a good idea to allay the fears of voters .

I 'd have to guess that the " wrong selections " showing up are n't malicious , but really bad machines .
Think about it .
If you wanted to " steal votes " , would you really give them a chance to see it on the screen ?
They would simply look at all the current totals and keep their guy ( the Repub ) slightly ahead , only in the back ground where you can't see it .
Votes come in slowly , and there 's a fairly even match between D and R..
Every now and then a vote is put under R instead of where it went , but you never see that .
It 's just an increment of one of several variables ..
Simply wrap it around the submission logic and do it after the " commit vote " button is pushed ( or whatever confirmation button is pressed at the end ) .
Making it so you can _clearly_ see the flip would still potentially require code , so why risk drawing attention to yourself ?
Of course , either way .. seeing these problems demands public access to the source ..
If no intentional code is found , the machines are listed as junk for not being able to register touches properly .
Either way , we win ..

I am originally from Ohio , and when I heard about this , I realized that the same thing had happened to me in the 2004 election , and then to my grandparents in the 2006 election .
These machines were made by Diebold .
I unfortunately at the time thought that it was just me , but I was very upset , and was n't sure what to do .
I had to hit the Democratic candidate three times before it would work .
And the same had happened to my grandparents in 2006 with the senate seat of DeWine up against Sherrod Brown .
When the 2006 election occurred -- the precinct that I had voted in had changed their voting machines to something else .
I wanted to know who they were made by , and while they do make a record of the votes made on the machine with a reciept printing on the side ( you can watch it record as you hit the buttons ) , I still have an issue with the electronic machines .
I will vote in Pennsylvania this year because I recently moved for a job here , but the problem is n't nearly as new as everyone would like to believe .

There is no way in hell that ANYBODY should be " recalibrating " machines during the election .

The machine " paper trail " ONLY RECORDS HOW THE MACHINE RECORDED THE VOTE .
It does NOT NECESSARILY RECORD HOW THE VOTE WAS ACTUALLY CAST .
There should be a detailed printed receipt of the votes cast for the voter .
I can go to an ATM and get a detailed accurate receipt .
I can go into a regional convenience store and enter an order into a dre for multiple products .

Out of hundreds of options , I have never gotten a printed receipt of my order that did not show my order exactly as I entered it for products , sizes and numbers .
If a deli dre can do it , why can't the state operated voting machines do the same ?

Actually , to be a bit more precise there , Tom , the " paper trail " does not necessarily record how the machine recorded the vote .
The paper trail can say one thing , and the machine can say another .
There should be a detailed printed receipt of the votes cast for the voter .
If you mean a " receipt " that you can take home with you , then no , you do n't want that .
That would lead to vote buying / selling .
And that 's why this business is very different from an ATM or deli transaction .
We have a secret ballot , so it needs to be accurate , and transparent as far as the ability to assure that it was counted as the voter intended .
Printing out ballots or " paper trails " is no substitute for a hand - marked paper ballot which we know reflects the intent of the voter .
Computer printed ballots can be flipped without the voter noticing ( see Rice U.'s study where two - thirds of voters who bothered to check their summary at the end , did n't notice vote flips . )

TomaHawk ,
What actual good would having a printed receipt do ?
Unless all the voters got together and reconciled them all with the vote totals like checks and deposit tickets with a bank statement , the receipt does n't mean much in the big scheme of who won , does it ?
We know that what 's printed out does n't necessarily match how the vote was counted .

if it wasnt the hillsborough numbers then it must of been my theory about the programs having a pre determined result and any vote that moves the number past that result cannot be accepted by the machine ... at least not w/o an internal override ( which prob has a physical tag also but it happens so fast peops havent noticed it ) when jeanie dean caught them on camera in florida doing an override because memory cards would not load into the counter , i believe it was because the machine couldnt accept those numbers as it already had as many obama votes as it needed for its pre determined result the only chamce the dems have to win this presidential election is to physically know the precincts , street by street , voter by voter i say this because if the vote is flipped in pa to give mccain the win there , there will be a physical tag ( an impossibble number ) and finding it will be of the utmost urgency its hard to be hopeful with the neo cons controling everything but obama was smart enough to know he had to win the caucuses to win the nomination so i am hopeful he is smart enough to know the presidential election will have to be won in states with paper ballots and / or dem govs and sos

If the vote flipping is happening by chance just as many machines should be flipping votes from D to R as from R to D .

They have had at least 4 years to replace these intrinsically porous and highly undependable voting machines .
The fact that they have n't done so speaks to conspiracy by those who want the vote to be hackable .
In 2006 I asked one of the ancient poll watchers ( assistants or whatever the title for those who direct you to the machines etc. is )
Why do they still use these machines when they have been proven to be flawed ?
He said it would cost too much money to change them .
I know he was just talking out of his ass , but it pissed me off just the same .
Paper ballots should n't cost more money .
I would think they would be cheaper .
Besides , even if it did cost more money , it would be worth it to know that the elections are believable .
No , the reason that these machines are still in use may become painfully clear in the next few days .
This country really needs a revolution .
The corruption runs deep on both sides .
I will vote for Obama , but I do n't expect any significant changes .
He has already capitulated on FISA and retroactive telecom immunity , faith based initiatives , the BAILOUT THEFT , and he still buys in to the OBL Al CIAda myth .
He wants to do more war , just not in Iraq .
My only hope for him is if he gets the mandate of a landslide victory and his feet are held to the fire on real issues .
Maybe he would then respond to the people 's wishes .
Cynthia McKinney is my first choice , but I am not going to give McInsane a chance by voting for an alternative candidate this time .

The only way you can legitimately use one of these machines in a real election is to use them to print out a PAPER BALLOT so you can SEE who you voted for .
Then each voter hands the PRINTED BALLOT to a security guard who places it into the LOCKED BALLOT BOX which [at the beginning of the voting day ] was ceremoniously opened and shown to the audience of citizens & video - taped for the record to prove it 's empty .
At the end of the voting day , the votes are hand - counted by citizens in plain view of the citizens who wish to gather for the event .
All video - taped for the record .
It 's the only way .
The states have been SCAMMED .
The machines are worthless and they have to know it .
In my state of GA , SOS Cathy Cox gave $ 54 MILLION Dollars to Diebold and put their EVIL BLACKBOXES in EVERY Precinct .
The cost of EACH VOTE is somewhere around $ 50 .
The Voting Machine Companies went across the country hiring outgoing Secretaries of State to lobby for them .
You see how that works .

Reading down all the comments in this sequence is an education .
They touch on most of the things vote activists have come to understand in the last six years or so .
There is a poignancy to humans when they want machines to do their bidding .
As the architect of and integrator of a technical system , I can remember standing by a client who'd been trained in its use as he demonstrated it to a third party who was unfamiliar with the system .
I stood in a kind of awe at the degree of mixed - up information my client was confidently communicating to the new person .
He knew how to work the controls , but his interpretations of what the system was " telling him " were way off .
This is the flaw at the heart of the idea known as " train the trainer " .
Clerk Jeff Waybright ( star of Video 2 , Jackson County , WV ) reminds me of my old client .
He 's well - meaning , somewhat experienced , and expressive of the dangers inherent in a little learning .
As long as the vendor 's tech is hovering over and standing by , each Election Official can come on like a technical whiz - kid .
This can engender a kind of smug , inside - dopester attitude .
Something found in the wild among Elections staff , as well as in the presentation of self practiced by Chief Election officials .
Here in Colorado , this malady of the human - machine relationship seems to have hit about half of the County Clerks .
They meet in secret , resist audits and other scrutiny , yet imperiously certify elections .
They would be the first to tell you that they could not run an election without their machines .
Machines and vendors and fraud and 24×7 poor quality everything is bad enough --- just look at what machine - culture instills in the humans in charge of voting in our democracy .

One way to avoid this is have the voters use the voting machine AND record a paper ballot .
The total of paper ballots for each representative for each precint , should tally the electronic voting figure for the precinct .
Once that validation is done , the vote count can be independently transmitted by two parties to the State vote counting officials .

Errrr ...
If the paper ballot is the check on the evm ( and it must be , see my comment # 20 above ) and if the evm can not be relied upon to check the paper ballot ( and it cannot , see my comment # 20 above ) then exactly what is the evm doing there in the first place ?
Besides propping up a CEO 's salary , I mean ?
I get this one a lot as well ...
Even optical scanners can be hacked .
Bradblog , blackboxvoting etc etc all have the reports , studies , videos etc etc .
The only thing that allows optical scanners to be considered over evms at all is the threat of a manual paper ballot count
Think about that for a moment ...
But that ballot vs evm concept also leads to the lie that is usually the last refuge of the evm shill : the lie that the disabled require evms to vote privately , securely and independently ... and that therefore everybody must use evms .
And it is and always has been a lie .
Always known to be a lie .
The fatal flaws in e-voting were pointed out almost as soon as the concept was proposed .
Those who honestly believe and repeat that lie are simply unaware of how thoroughly it 's been debunked .
When diabetic retinopathy took my sight I became unable to vote privately , securely and independently .
I must rely on somebody to interpret my ballot and guide my marking of the ballot ... and whether that guide is someone I know and trust or whoever last touched the code in an evm does n't really matter , does it ?
Technology cannot ( currently ) give me back what I lost ... and using my loss as an excuse to disenfranchise millions makes me very angry .
Last does n't really segue well from the rest of the comment ... time for another monograph , perhaps ?

Unfortunately , we have become a nation requiring instant gratification , results before midnight of election day .
It was only a century ago that it took days to count the votes and get them to the state election board .
I 'd be happy to wait a few days for results if it means an honestly conducted election .
Each year , the various ballots seem to grow with more offices and a lot of referendums and such .
Takes so much more time to hand count each question .
Maybe the publication of the the secondary stuff can wait a couple of days before the counts for them are finished .

" Apologies , Zap . " Ack ! do n't apologize !
Neither because you 're unaware of sundry disabled statistics nor because I 'm too lazy too learn Braille So , in your opinion , what would be the best way for a visually impaired person to cast his / her vote without relying on a sighted person OR DRE ?
First a coda to the Braille question : Something that I did not mention was that because of ballot secrecy : Braille ballots should not be used , because they would stand out from standard voter - marked ballots and identify the voter with their ballot .
The only solution to that would be to mark all ballots with Braille and print ... i.e. mark all ballots with a language most people can't understand and can't map to the printed portion of the ballot without machine interpretation .
As for we the disabled casting votes ?
pragmatism must rule .
A variety of solutions are available via ballot marking devices , but at some point the ballot must be verified by the voter ... and as of yet for the blind that requires machine interpretation .
The question is : is it worth the risk ?
I think so .
But denying the existence of that risk just because that never - to - be - sufficiently - damned HAVA law mandates impossibilities on the behalf of the disabled electronic voting CEOs is dangerously stupid .
Resources and other viewpoints on disabled voting access are out there but perhaps you can start with Noel Runyan 's work with existing evms that claim to provide access for the disabled ... and his personal experiences with just how miserably these billion - dollar boondoggles fail at what was supposed to be a prime justification for their existence .

As reported on Computerworld , this video of the Jackson County clerk is edited .
Here is the full video .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc9Gd5g3DFY
At the end , when Jeff Waybright changed the vote to straight Republican and Ralph Nader remained selected , that is just what should have happened , according to his earlier explanation .
He said , earlier in the video , that if you make a separate selection and then change your straight - party vote , it will not change the separate selection .
So , this clip is unfortunately misleading .
HOWEVER , what struck me about watching the entire uncut version was that when Mr. Waybright deliberately miscalibrated the touch screen , it was then very difficult to even select the ballot .
It was also very difficult to cancel the ballot .
AND , the miscalibration was apparent in every selection he made on every single screen .
Yet voters are saying that their touches record correctly in most cases , but flip in just one or a few .
This video casts strong doubt on the idea that a miscalibration would affect only one or two races .
It also casts doubt on the idea that a miscalibration would cause a voter to have to touch the desired candidate several times to correct the flipped vote .
Not only that , the poll worker should notice a calibration problem when attempting to select the correct ballot for the voter .
Why are we not hearing about that ?
For me , the uncut video casts strong doubt on the idea that miscalibration is the cause of the vote - flipping voters are reporting on the iVotronic .

The evms are used for quick transmission of voting reults , however they should only be used after validation by paper ballot .
The ' dual voting system ' , as I may call it serves to counter - check one another , so that paper ballots cannot be fiddled with either .
That way people planning electoral voting fraud , have to think twice , before commiting it .
Where the paper ballot numbers do not match the evms ' , there is definitely an anamoly .
The cost for the ' dual voting system ' is justified by the price voters are ready to pay for unadultrated democracy , i.e. the true voice of the people being heard .

" The ' dual voting system ' , as I may call it serves to counter - check one another , so that paper ballots cannot be fiddled with either . "
But you have yet to explain , given the extremely disproportionate vulnerabilities of evm's compared to paper , just how the evm 's could be used to " verify " anything , and you have yet to explain just what they would be doing still being anywhere near an election .
Ballot security is gained by paying proper attention to ballot control and access .
There are actually a variety of standards already existent for doing exactly that .
They work ... if followed .
What you'd be unintentionally recreating by adding evm's to the mix would be just another version of " e- voting 's last refuge " which is always different and yet is always the same : " We can't have made such a colossal screwup .
We can 't ... we just can't live without evms .
Why ?
... because ! "
You would n't even be adding expense and complexity to the electoral process with no gain in security ... instead you'd be adding expense , complexity and massive security vulnerabilities to the electoral process .
Someone flips a few bits , the machines howl " Danger ! Danger !
Something is wrong somewhere ! " and the entire election is thrown into chaos on behalf of the vulnerable , and unneeded , evms .

' Dual voting system ' is just another means to assure the public that there is less chance for vote recording fraud .
The method or technology used , whether telephone , evm or ballot paper , then becomes irrelevant , because there is a counter check in place .
The weakness of each system fades into the background , when there is a second alternative to check its accuracy .
In that way the public wins .

A line at the bottom of page says : “ To ensure the privacy of your vote , your identity is not recorded on the voter access card or in the voting station .
Only the votes will be recorded .
No one can know how you voted . ”
I called my local registrar and asked about the voter access card .
The person who answered said the card just “ unlocks ” the machine .
So , I said , if that ’s the case , if the card is just a key that “ unlocks ” the machine , then once I ’ve been validated by a poll worker – ie , via my driver ’s license or other document – I should be able to switch cards with another person who ’s also been validated by a poll worker .
No , she said , you have to use the card you ’ve been given .
Why , if it ’s just a “ key ” , then two validated people should be able to exchange keys , unless it stores something particular to the person holding it .
Does it , I asked her ?
Yes , she said , it stores your name and address .
Does it store your vote as well , I asked her ?
Can it store a vote ?
No , she said , it does n’t store your vote , only your personal information .
THIS BLATANTLY CONTRADICTS WHAT'S ON THE STATE WEBSITE AND , BY DEFINITION , IMPLIES A SYSTEM CAPABLE OF CONNECTING A PERSON’S IDENTITY TO THEIR VOTE .
The machine pictured on the sos.georgia.gov looks like the Diebold AccuVote TS pictured here :
http://votingmachines.pr...ce.asp?resourceID=276#IV
I called the Georgia Secretary of State Elections Division at 404-656-2871 and found out that the machines used in my precint are made by Premier .
I found the Premierelections contact website ---
http://www.premierelections.com/contact_us.html -- and called the Sales / Service Request line at 866-224-1792 .
I asked about the voter access card and the person who answered said she was n’t sure .
She referred me to the help desk .
I called them at 866-307-7689 .
I asked the person who answered if the card stores anything besides the holder ’s name and address .
He said I would have to ask my local election commission .
I then asked him what it was possible to store on these cards , what kind of meta - data was used in the software .
Again , he told me to contact my local election board or the Georgia Secretary of State ’s office .
I said who better to tell me about the capabilities of the product than the help desk of the company who made it ?
I was only asking for a general technical spec .
His answer to every question was the same and sounded like he was instructed to take the Fifth : we ca n’t disclose that ; contact the secretary of state ’s office .
WHAT’S WRONG WITH THE STATEMENTS OF THE REGISTRAR AND PREMIER AND WHAT THOSE STATEMENTS IMPLY ?
SOMEONE WITH LEGAL RESOURCES , POWER , AND INTEGRITY MUST INVESTIGATE THIS .

“ It ’s hilarious .
It ’s like McCain is trying to copy her , but he ’s using a busted Xerox machine , ” said one of Clinton ’s top campaign advisers .
McCain talks economy with Hillary
On Sept. 24 , Hillary Rodham Clinton received a surprise phone call from the man she ’s often denounced as an economic know - nothing : John McCain .
This was no social call , even though Clinton likes McCain enough to keep his photo on the wall of her Senate office .
The GOP nominee had already chatted with Bill Clinton about the mortgage crisis and wanted to pick the senator ’s brain about her new proposal to have the federal government buy up bad mortgages and renegotiate terms more favorable to homeowners on verge of default .
Advertisement
“ McCain said he had been motivated by it , he was very complimentary about what she had proposed and wanted to know more , ” said a person with knowledge of the call .
Clinton responded coolly .
“ She did n’t engage him , she just said , ‘ Thank you ’ and heard him out . ”
Three weeks later , at the town hall debate in Nashville , Tenn. , McCain rolled out a $ 300 billion anti-foreclosure plan that ’s similar , if not identical , to Clinton ’s — and subsequently credited the concept “ to a suggestion that Sen.
Hillary Clinton made not that long ago . ”
Clinton dropped out of the race four months ago , but her presence looms large at tonight ’s final McCain - Obama debate being held , appropriately enough , in her adopted state of New York .
Clinton was arguably the first candidate in either party to grasp the transformative political effect of the economic crisis , and her onetime rivals have been borrowing — liberally — from her policy and rhetorical playbooks .
“ Everything in this election is being washed away by this stock market and economic stuff ... and she was the one who came out first with specific policies to deal with this , so she ’s clearly having an influence on both of them , ” said Peter Brown , assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute .
“ The reason why she ’s so influential is because we never had a primary candidate who won 18 million votes , ” said former Bill Clinton adviser Paul Begala , who likened the former first lady ’s impact to that of third - party candidate Ross Perot in 1992 .
“ Bill Clinton had to adjust his message to appeal to Perot ’s voters , and [ McCain and Obama ] have to do the same thing with her , ” he added .
“ The way you get her voters is not to suck up to her but to carry her message and her programs .
...
That ’s why Obama ’s a more natural fit . ”
Clinton aides , speaking on condition of anonymity , said she is still smarting over her loss , but is gratified Obama and McCain have carried parts of her agenda .
And they say she ’s downright tickled that McCain , a lifelong crusader against government spending , is getting in touch with his inner Hillary to woo her white , working - class base and female voters not sold on Obama .
“ It ’s hilarious .
It ’s like McCain is trying to copy her , but he ’s using a busted Xerox machine , ” said one of Clinton ’s top campaign advisers .
“ We were out in front on the economy .
She was the first one to really pay attention to people ’s anxieties , and both Obama and McCain have been playing catch - up ever since . ”
The McCain campaign says the call to Clinton is just further proof that the GOP nominee is a president who can work across party lines .
“ The fact the fact that they were talking in the midst of a heated campaign like this , shows it ’s not just rhetoric John McCain gives when he talks about working across the aisle , ” said spokesman Brian Rogers .
“ Obviously , Sen. Clinton is going to be a major force in the Senate in the future , and they have had a long friendship . ”
An Obama spokesman had no comment .
Presidential nominees have a long history of appropriating ideas from rivals .
Bill Clinton ’s decision to focus on the middle class and fiscal responsibility sharpened after facing former Massachusetts Sen.
Paul Tsongas in the primaries .
Perot ’s candidacy , with its focus on balancing the budget , pushed the former president further in that direction .
For her part , even Hillary Clinton “ adopted some of John Edwards ’ populist themes ” when the former North Carolina senator dropped out of the primaries in early 2008 , Begala said .
It ’s not surprising that Obama , who shares Clinton ’s basic liberal - moderate worldview , would , in turn , adopt her ideas .
But the extent to which he ’s incorporated specific Clinton policy proposals is striking .
On Monday , Obama told a crowd in hard - hit Toledo , Ohio , that he wanted to impose a 90 - day freeze on foreclosures by banks that partake in the $ 700 billion rescue plan .
When Clinton proposed a package that contained a similar measure in January , Obama nixed it .
At the time , his staff posted news stories denouncing the freeze on his campaign Web site , including a Fortune magazine story that tagged it “ perhaps the dumbest solution to the current mortgage mess . ”
Health care was also a major flashpoint between Clinton and Obama during the primary , but Obama has moved closer to Clinton on this issue , as well .
During the primary debates , Clinton repeatedly hammered the Illinois senator , accusing him of refusing to sign on to her commitment to “ universal ” coverage , claiming Obama ’s plan would deny benefits to 15 million Americans .
In July , Obama reversed course and signed onto Clinton ’s proposal to grant health insurance tax credits for small business owners , telling a national Hispanic group that the “ idea [ was ] championed by my friend Hillary Clinton , who has been leading the way in our battle to insure every American . ”
The copycat claims are nothing new .
During the primaries , Clinton ’s staff circulated a memo enumerating what they believed to be Obama rip - offs , including his apparent adoption of her plan to create millions of “ green - collar ” jobs and Clinton ’s proposal for a national infrastructure bank .
“ Sen . Obama has clearly followed us on an entire range of issues , " Neera Tanden , then Clinton 's policy director , told Newsday in April .
“ It raises a fundamental question : If Sen . Obama can't propose his own major policies during the campaign , how is he going to do it as president ? "
Tanden now works for Obama ’s policy team in Chicago .
With news of David Tennant 's resignation as Doctor Who 's eponymous timelord still making grown fans weep , the aftermath is beginning to be felt around the internet :
Who are the frontrunners for the role of replacement ?
What made Tennant almost change his mind ?
And what storyline has possibly been killed as a result of Tennant 's departure ?
We 've got some answers for you - or , at least , what some people are claiming are the answers .
Rich Johnston - the man who broke the " Paterson Joseph is the new Doctor " rumor before Tennant had officially announced he was leaving - continues his streak of Who rumors in this week 's edition of his Lying In The Gutters column , claiming that the reasons that Tennant has been giving for deciding to leave are n't exactly true :
So was David Tennant 's leaving the show all down to his need to move on ?
A now or never thing ?
Not quite .
He had been in negotiations with the BBC for a fifth , even a sixth full series , but wanted another 2009 - lite Doctor Who break in 2011 , a film pursued , and money above the current BBC wage cap .
It did n't happen .

Something that did give Tennant reason to rethink his leaving , according to Tennant himself , was the appointment of Steven Moffat as new showrunner :
I had a meeting with Steven Moffat and in a way that 's been the most difficult bit because I 'm such a big fan of his .
He told me some of his ideas for what 's coming up in the show and it 's going to be so good .
When I finally thought I 'd made a decision suddenly I was tempted to change my mind again .
Advertisement
Those ideas include a storyarc that will either have to be reworked considerably , or junked entirely , according to Johnston :
The one bigger casualty , as well as casting for The Doctor sooner than expected , has been an arc in Series Five for the River Song character , revealed in Series 4 as the Doctor 's possible future wife .
Arc plans are being rewritten , but the new team has plenty of time ...
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
As well as Paterson Joseph , Johnston claims that Sean Pertwee and Marc Warren are in the running to take over the Tardis in 2010 , which may make this comment more understandable :
I have it on veeeeery good authority that the next Doctor has already been chosen .
It 's an interesting new direction , and the choice ( assuming no changes of heart ) will probably surprise - and divide - many .
The name I 've heard is n't Paterson Joseph .
Or John Simm .
Or James Nesbitt .

Most advice on buying clothes says to put your money into separates because two or three tops and a couple of skirts and pants which all will interchange will give you a wider variety of looks .
However , most of this advice applies only to slender people overlooking the way ( a ) skirts and tops of different colors chop short people in the middle , making them look six inches shorter , and ( b ) the horizontal line at the waist causes the eye to meander leisurely across just where , if you ’re overweight , you do n’t want any lingering glances .
A dress , which is one unbroken line from top to bottom , is the most slimming garment made .
A belt should , of course , be the same material as the dress .
In a sea of separates , only two American designers have made names for themselves in affordable day dresses : Albert Nipon and Diane Von Furstenberg .
The princess line , a flared dress style , with bodice and skirt cut out of the same piece with no waistband or belt .
The nicest ones loosely follow curves of the body , flaring into the gentle aline skirt .
Probably the most flattering cut ever devised for women who need to lose twenty pounds .
The style does n’t look good on thin women , who need the horizontal line of a belt or waistband .
Designer Pauline Trigere is the designer most famous for princess - line dresses .
The Smock dress a very comfortable dress flowing downward from a square or round Victorian - type yoke often trimmed in ruffles .
Smock dresses tend to be made in romantic fabrics such as cotton calico or challis , or flowery cotton prints .
They often have high ruffled collars , crochet edging , and white collars or cuffs .
A very comfy dress .
Buy them amply enough to be cool but not so voluminous as to look sloppy .
Wear with low - cut shoes such as Mary Janes , and opaque stockings –oxfords or moccasins would be too heavy .
High heels too dressy .
Bare sandals are fine .
A tent dress , no -waistband dress that falls gracefully down the torso and flares out at hip level .
A flattering style for the overweight .
A jumper , one - piece , sleeveless dress with a low scoop neck or square - cut neck , which can be worn with a blouse or without .
Because of their long , unbroken lines , jumpers are terrific for short people , and for over - weight and big - busted women .
Empire dress , low - cut dress gathered under the bosom .
The style dates from the period of the Napoleonic Empire , 1804 - 1814 , and was worn by the Empress Josephine .
You should be reasonably slender to wear this one ; anybody with a large bust will look top - heavy .
Halter Neck dresses have been around ever since Marilyn Monroe wore a white crepe one in The Seven Year Itch .
With its deep V - neck and vertical lines , it ’s a terrific look for women with broad shoulders or heavy bosom , not so flattering to thin women , unless you happen to have a pretty back .
Chemise , straight - lined , unbelted dress .
( Also called a chemisier . )
The chemise was the dress worn by flappers of the 1920s , along with their headache bands and raccoon coats , and reappeared in 1957 as the despised sack dress , inspiring the hit rock ‘ n ’ roll record “ No Chemise Please . ”
Men have never liked the shapelessness of the chemise , but the style is a favorite among women who like to dress for health .
“ The chemise is the most comfortable dress for women today , ” says designer Mollie Parnis .
“ It ’s easy to move around in and entirely non-constricting . ”
Buy any chemise only in soft , floating fabrics ; a stiff fabric does n’t move with the body , is n’t at all sexy , and is the sack dress all over again .
Chemises are particularly nice for the swaybacked , but not so flattering to large - breasted women , who look bulky in them .
I hope this article will help you in choosing the right dress and style for your body .
Each September , Montreal , Quebec closes Ste -Catherine street , one of the busiest streets in the city , to hold the “ a day without my car ” event .
As the name implies , no motorized circulation is allowed on the street during this day , and a bunch of vendors present green - transport alternatives to cars .
This year , “ L’école Polytechnique de Montréal , ” a branch of “ L’ Université de Montréal ” related to engineering , was presenting their solar car , named Esteban IV .
The Esteban Project was inaugurated in 1998 when a bunch of engineering students decided to design and build up a solar car prototype to participate in the 2001 edition of the American Solar Challenge .
Unfortunately , due to electrical failures , the Esteban team did not qualify to make it to the start up line .
Now , ten years later , the vehicle is on its fourth revision , and is much more effective than the initial version .
Weighing 300 kg ( 661 lbs ) and covered with eight square meters ( ~86 Sq. Feet ) of monocrystalline solar cells , Esteban IV is powered by a 5000 - watt lithium - ion polymer battery .
Its external shell is made from Kevlar , carbon and glass fibers , and its tubular structure from aluminum .
Currently , the vehicle can reach a top speed of 110 km ( 68 mph ) per hour , but according to what I was told by the spokesperson that was there , the ideal cruise speed should be around 65 to 70 km ( 40 to 43.5 m ph ) per hour .
At that speed , on days where the sun is shining bright , the car could go on indefinitely , consuming all the energy it produces , no more , no less .
On cloudy days , the car , running partly on solar and battery power , can be propelled for around four consecutive hours .
The Esteban team is looking to improve their vehicle further by replacing various parts to lighten up its load , namely the steering wheel and steering wheel ’s shaft , which are currently made from steel .
[ Haskell - cafe ] Announce : FieldTrip library ( functional 3D ) and mailing list
FieldTrip [ 1 ] is a library for functional 3D graphics .
It is intended for building static , animated , and interactive 3D geometry , efficient enough for real - time synthesis and display .
Since FieldTrip is functional , one describes what models are , not how to render them ( being rather than doing ) .
Surfaces are described as functions from 2D space to 3D space .
As such , they are intrinsically curved rather than faceted .
Surface rendering tessellates adaptively , caching tessellations in an efficient , infinite data structure ( from the MemoTrie library ) for reuse .
Surface normals are computed automatically and exactly , using the derivative tools in the vector - space library .
For animation or interaction , FieldTrip can be used with the Reactive [ 2 ] library for functional reactive programming ( and possibly other animation frameworks ) .
By design , FieldTrip is completely orthogonal to any formulation or implementation of FRP .
The reactive - fieldtrip [ 3 ] library links Reactive and FieldTrip .
FieldTrip now has a mailing list [ 4 ] and a feature / bug tracker [ 5 ] . [ 1 ]

The Beatles ' music is not currently available to download legally
Sir Paul talks about side project The Fireman and the future Sir Paul McCartney has said he wants The Beatles ' catalogue to appear on Apple 's iTunes store , but that negotiations have currently " stalled " .
" We 'd like to do it , " Sir Paul told BBC News .
" We are very for it , we 've been pushing it .
But there are a couple of sticking points , I understand . "
He said " heavy negotiations " were going on with their former record label EMI .
" EMI want something we 're not prepared to give 'em .
It 's between EMI and The Beatles I think - what else is new ? "
The band 's music is not currently available to download legally .
" Last word I got back was it 's stalled at the moment , " Sir Paul said .
" But I really hope it will happen because I think it should . "
EMI , which owns the Beatles recordings , must agree a deal with Apple Corps , the company set up by the band to look after their classic catalogue .
The various parties involved have been unable to reach agreement but we really hope everyone can make progress soon
EMI
An EMI spokesperson said : " We have been working hard to secure agreement with Apple Corps to make the Beatles ' legendary recording catalogue available to fans in digital form .
" Unfortunately the various parties involved have been unable to reach agreement but we really hope everyone can make progress soon . "
Sir Paul was speaking as he launched a new album under the name The Fireman , his collaboration with producer Youth .
The album , Electric Arguments , has seen the former Beatle take an experimental twist and has garnered glowing reviews .
It was released on Monday and , along with solo work by all four members of the legendary British band , is available to buy on iTunes .
The vast majority of major acts have now signed up to sell their songs on iTunes , with only AC / DC , Kid Rock and Garth Brooks also holding out .
There were hopes that Beatles songs would become available after Apple Inc - which owns the download store - ended a trademark dispute with Apple Corps last year .

Ruby 1.9.0 - 5 Released
On Friday the 3rd , Ruby 1.9.0 - 5 was released by Yuki Sonoda , after the last delays , related to miniunit , were fixed by Ryan Davis .
This release also marks the feature freeze for the upcoming version 1.9.1 . ( see the changelog for detailed information ) .
JRuby Not Going to Support 1.8.7
Marcin Mielżyński , one of the JRuby committers , proposed to drop support for Ruby 1.8.7 in JRuby :
Most 1.8.7 features that came from 1.9.1 are to make transition from 1.8 to 1.9 series easier .
Majority of them is just a copy ( with minor changes to match 1.8.x api ) , but there is a lot of tricky examples that behave differently under 1.9.x , 1.8.6 and 1.8.7 [...] it does n't make sense to port all the behavior from 1.9.x to 1.8.7 since it would end up 1.9. x just without yarv and all the fancy syntax features ( well , and encoding support of course ) .
Thomas Enebo and Charles Nutter agreed and added , that users should switch directly to 1.9 rather then writing code that only works in 1.8.7 ( support for Ruby 1.9 in JRuby can be enabled with -- 1.9 ) .
Charles also posted their decision to the Ruby - core mailinglist . , but no discussion has started yet .
Procs for Case Equality Testing
Ruby uses the ===-operator to compare the different cases in a case - statement .
Ruby 1.9's
Proc class just recently got a ===-method , basically just an alias for the call - method used to invoke the Proc .
Now , this means that one can use a Proc object in a case - statement ; it will get the case - argument as parameter .
This trick was discovered by Aimred , who added the method themselves , before Matz integrated it into Ruby 1.9 .
Dave Thomas shows an even more sophisticated application , using currying to create several Procs to check for the day of the week .
DAVID RISING

October 6 , 2008
BERLIN ( AP ) — Germany ’s governing coalition partners want to change the constitution to allow for military deployment within the country if needed to combat terrorism , officials said Monday .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The proposal would allow use of the military only if police are overwhelmed and cannot properly respond to a situation themselves .
“ It is not to be used generally , but only in very specific cases , ” Interior Ministry spokeswoman Daniela - Alexandra Pietsch said .
The center - left Social Democratic Party — which makes up half of Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s coalition — had been opposed to the proposal but agreed late Sunday after working out an agreement that includes strict guidelines for domestic deployment .
“ We ’re talking only about emergency help , ” Social Democrat parliamentary leader Peter Struck said .
For example , the navy could be called to help in a situation where police maritime patrols were not sufficient , he said .
The proposal will now go to Merkel ’s Cabinet and then to parliament for approval .
Given Germany ’s militaristic past , many are hesitant to expand the role of soldiers domestically .
Currently , the German military can be deployed within the country only in times of war , or to help with emergencies or natural disasters .
Following the announcement of the new proposal , opposition Left Party lawmaker Petra Pau accused the government of seeking to violate a constitutionally dictated division “ between army , police and secret services . ”

SETI : Figuring Out the Beacon Builders
Several interesting papers on SETI have appeared in recent days , among them Gregory , James and Dominic Benford ’s attempt to place SETI in the context of economics .
Equally useful is Duncan Forgan ’s new look at the Drake Equation , presenting a way to estimate the distribution of the crucial parameters .
I ’ll bypass the Forgan paper temporarily because I ’ve asked Marc Millis to tackle it as soon as he gets back from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , where he ’s gone to attend a workshop .
Forgan ’s study has direct bearing on a Tau Zero initiative we hope to have in place by the end of the year and thus is a natural for Marc to write up .
But back to the Benfords , who have offered up twin papers ( as seems reasonable for the brothers ) , one on SETI ( with Gregory as principal author ) and the other on its METI offshoot ( transmitting messages rather than listening for them ) .
James Benford is lead author on the latter .
This work is so rich that I wo n’t try to encapsulate it in a single post , but rather draw on the ideas here over the course of a few ( perhaps non-consecutive ) days .
In any case , I do n’t want to be rushed in these discussions , where the issues are as large as the distances involved , and our philosophical approach may be as significant as our technology .
And the two papers should be read in connection with each other in any case , for the analysis in the METI paper is directly relevant to developing the argument of the SETI discussion .
We ’re close to the 50th anniversary of the Project Ozma attempts , and in SETI ’s first half - century we have found no clear detections in our search of nearby stars .
But over the course of the decades , our initial SETI assumptions have been challenged .
We ’ve gone from a Sagan - esque optimism that the galaxy is aswarm with civilizations to a far more measured ( and surely more realistic ) view that takes into account factors like the galactic habitable zone , and the sheer difficulty facing living things on the long evolutionary road toward intelligence .
Image : The spiral galaxy M74 ( NGC 628 ) , perhaps the home of technological civilizations that , like us , are trying to figure out whether they are alone .
Credit : GMOS / Gemini North Observatory .
The Benfords — Jim at Microwave Sciences , Gregory at the University of California ’s Irvine campus , and Dominic ( Jim ’s son ) at NASA GSFC — believe that advanced societies , if they are to be found , ought most likely to exist toward the galactic center , and probably at distances of over a thousand light years .
We ’re thus talking , in all likelihood , about interstellar beacons rather than targeted transmissions when it comes to SETI .
And if beacons are indeed at play , what can we say about their costs , and do our own standards of terrestrial cost have any application in an ETI context ?
The message here is that any SETI search has to make assumptions about the beacon builders , and if we can determine something about the economics of the situation , we may learn how to target our searches more effectively .
Here ’s the essence of the argument about ETI :
We assume that if they are social beings interested in a SETI conversation or passing on their heritage , they will know about tradeoffs between social goods , and thus , in whatever guise it takes , cost .
But what if we suppose , for example , that aliens have very low cost labor , i. e. , slaves ?
With a finite number of slaves , you can use them to do a finite number of tasks .
And so you pick and choose by assigning value to the tasks , balancing the equivalent value of the labor used to prosecute those tasks .
So choices are still made on the basis of available labor .
The only case where labor has no value is where labor has no limit .
That might be if aliens may live forever or have limitless armies of self - replicating automata , but such labor costs something , because resources , materials and energy , are not free .
Our point is that all SETI search strategies must assume something about the beacon builder , and that cost may drive some alien attempts at interstellar communication .
SETI always seems to come with a built - in willingness to think the best of extraterrestrial cultures .
If an alien civilization is sending out a message , it must be doing so out of altruism .
The Benfords , though , are interested in exploring motivations from a different angle .
They ’d like to relate them to the only case of a technological civilization we know of , ourselves , and speculate based on human history .
From that perspective , there are two reasons for sending out messages across vast time scales .
Think about what people do .
You can go to the Tower of London and explore the chambers where famous prisoners like Thomas More were kept .
Invariably , on the walls , you ’ll find graffiti , names written into the stone .
People have an apparently robust need to engage in one - way communication , putting a note in a bottle and throwing it .
Indeed , the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft are examples of the impulse .
Is it likely that any of these tiny vessels will ever be intercepted ?
Yet putting our names , our stories , our music and our pictures on board outgoing vehicles is a method that resonates .
We have a need to encapsulate who we are .
A second reason is the drive to communicate the optimum things about our culture , what Matthew Arnold called “ … the best that has been thought and said in the world . ”
Here the Benfords cite time capsules and monuments as examples of our need to propagate our culture .
The contemplation of a legacy is involved here , especially in a scenario where human lifetimes are rising .
Here again the communication can be one - way .
The statue of King Alfred my wife and I admired in Winchester some years back was not built to impress people within a tight time frame , but to stand as a monument that would reach future generations .
So imagine scenarios like this : A civilization with an ability to plan over millennial time scales foresees problems that are beyond its capabilities .
A SETI beacon might encapsulate a call for information and help — send us everything you have on stellar warming …
Here ’s another : A civilization in its death throes decides to send out an announcement of its existence .
We were here and are no longer , but as long as this message endures , so in a sense do we .
And let ’s not discount sheer pride of the sort that could keep a beacon in operation long after the beings that built it were gone .
Robotically maintained , it might boast of achievements set against the backdrop of the ruin that may eventually attend all technological cultures .
Or perhaps we ’ll run into interstellar proselytes , out to convert the galaxy to a particular set of beliefs by placing their highest values into their outgoing signal .
High powered signals may even be unintentional , such as the signatures of planetary radars that scan for asteroids , or perhaps the industrial activities of a space - faring civilization that boosts payloads deep into its system using beamed power .
Beam - driven sail expeditions might leave such a signature ( recall Niven and Pournelle ’s The Mote in God ’s Eye ) .
These activities seem more likely to be detected than the far fainter signatures of isotropic radio and television broadcasts , and would carry the unmistakable message of a working technology .

Does the best SETI strategy involve listening for directed messages from nearby stars ?
Or do we concentrate on short burst transmissions from deep in the galactic plane ?

Given all these motivations — and we do n’t know how to choose between them — microwaves seem to be the best carriers of a civilization ’s message , if only because interstellar absorption is minimal at those wavelengths .
Can we make any guesses based upon cost and perceived value about how such a culture would proceed with a microwave beacon ?
If so , our conclusions would have a material impact on how we conduct the SETI search .
From the paper again :
… even altruistic Beacon builders will have to contend with other competing altruistic causes , just as humans do .
They will confront arguments that the response time for SETI is millennia , and that anyway , advanced societies leak plenty of microwaves etc. into deep space already .
We take up these issues below .
It seems clear that for a Beacon builder , only by minimizing cost / benefit will their effort succeed .
This is parsimony , meaning ‘ less is better ’ a concept of frugality , economy .
Philosophers use this term for Occam ’s Razor , but here we mean the press of economic demands in any society that contemplates long term projects like SETI .
On Earth , advocates of METI will also face economic constraints .
The Benfords believe that evolution will always seek for economy of effort .
Their analysis is bracing stuff and it calls into question a SETI strategy that is not optimized for short bursts of pulsed microwaves and the observation times necessary to see repeat events .
Another question is inevitable — have we inadvertently picked up such signals already and dismissed them ?
More on this in coming days .
The paper , “ Cost Optimized Interstellar Beacons : SETI , ” is available online .
We ’ll look at “ Cost Optimized Interstellar Beacons : METI , ” available here , tomorrow .
The House has blocked diverting any new water from the Great Lakes and forces bordering states to adhere to new conservation standards .
In a 390 - 25 vote , the House approved a measure on Tuesday that will increase protection of the Great Lakes region .
It will prohibit any new diversions of the water to other places , and require states that border the lakes to adhere to new conservation standards .
Together , the five Great Lakes account for 20 percent of the world ’s supply of fresh surface water .
Known as the Great Lakes Compact , it was a decade in the making and focuses on longstanding fears that water - starved states or even other countries could tap into the lakes , deplete them , and do long - term damage to the basin ’s natural environment and economy .
The compact has already been passed by the Senate and is headed now to the White House , where President Bush is expected to sign it into law .
“ Keeping the water in the basin is critical , ” said Christy Leavitt , a clean - water advocate at Environment America , a coalition of state groups .
“ But so is requiring all the Great Lakes states to develop conservation and efficiency programs .
There is tremendous opportunity in efficiency to save water and the compact will help us reach the potential that ’s out there . ”
Before it reached Congress , the states bordering the lakes had to approve the compact , agreeing to certain common goals .
The last state to approve , Michigan , did so only in July , following Illinois , Indiana , Minnesota , New York , Ohio , Wisconsin and Pennsylvania .
“ It shows that our national leaders understand that conserving water is vital for the economy , ” said Cameron Davis , the chief executive of the Alliance for the Great Lakes .
“ It signals to the rest of the would that water , the oil of the century , is a global imperative . ”
The Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec , which also border the lakes , have adopted a nearly identical document .
Under the measure , water generally would not be allowed to be diverted from the basin except under rare circumstances .
In addition to a bottled - water exemption , an exception has been made for so - called straddling communities that lie on the basin ’s borders , among other negotiated concessions based largely on whether diverted water could be restored to the lakes .

Britain has the highest level of problem drug use and the second highest level of drug related deaths in Europe , according to a report by the independent UK Drug Policy Commission .
There has also been a 68 percent increase in the number of recorded drug offences in the last ten years according to the Home Office .
Shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve attacked the government , saying : " No amount of Home Office spin on this year 's figures can hide the fact that class A drug use and drug crime have risen under this government . "
" The reason is simple - mixed messages on drugs and a failure to take real action . "
Since 2003 , the amount of cocaine seized has dropped by 53 per cent , and the amount of heroin seized has dropped 46 per cent since 2001 .
The price of cocaine per gram fell from £ 71 to £ 45 in 2007 and the cost of heroin per gram from £ 74 to around £ 45 .
The cost of drug - related crime in England and Wales is estimated at £ 13 billion .
The age of a third Chinese gymnast is in doubt , making half of China 's women 's gymnastics team possibly too young to compete in the Olympics .
Yang Yilin was born Aug. 26 , 1993 , according to 2004 , 2005 and 2006 registration lists previously posted on the General Administration of Sport of China 's website .
Yang is a medal favourite in the all - around and uneven bars , but the previously listed birth date would make her 15 at the end of August , below the minimum age of 16 .
Yang 's birth date on the 2007 registration list , however , is stated as Aug. 26 , 1992 , making her eligible .
The ages of two other Chinese gymnasts are also in doubt :
He Kexin , a gold - medal favourite on uneven bars , and Jiang Yuyuan .
International Gymnastics Federation secretary general Andrei Gueisbuhler said he was unable to comment on Yang 's case without seeing written records .
" If I do n't have written proof of something ... we have to take for granted the passports that we 've seen and have been checked by the IOC are OK , " Gueisbuhler said .
Officials with the Chinese Gymnastics Association say that they have applied for passports for all of the athletes , and that photocopies of He and Jiang 's passports , issued in July 2007 and March 2006 , indicate they are both over 16 .
" The International Gymnastics Federation strictly verified their passports and confirmed that their ages met the age rules for participating in the world championship , World Cup and Olympics , " the association said in a statement .
The International Olympic Committee was in contact with the federation and Chinese officials regarding the age issue , IOC president Jacques Rogge said Saturday .
" The IOC relies on the international federations , who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes , " Rogge said .
" It 's not the task of the IOC to check every one of the 10,000 athletes . "
The all - around gold medal is expected to be a competition between two countries : the United States and China .
Yang and He were expected to be big contributors for the Chinese , both having scored 17s on the uneven bars this season .
The only member of the American team to score a 17 is Nastia Liukin .
In the gymnastics team finals , three team members compete in each event and all three scores count towards the total .
Troy Polamalu is usually soft - spoken off the field , hard - hitting on it .
The recent rash of fines leveled at his Pittsburgh Steelers teammates has caused him to take a shot at the NFL , however .
The Steelers safety suggested Wednesday that the NFL is leveling fines for hits more for its own interest than that of the players .
" I think regarding the evolution of football , it 's becoming more and more flag football , two - hand touch , " Polamalu said .
" We 've really lost the essence of what real American football is about .
I think it 's probably all about money .
They 're not really concerned about safety . "
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell called Polamalu 's comments " very disappointing ' ' on " Sportsline with Steve Davis " on WBAL 1090 in Baltimore .
The Steelers have asked the NFL to clarify why Hines Ward , one of the league 's best blocking wide receivers , was fined $ 15,000 the past two games for unnecessary roughness despite not being penalized .
Ward was fined $ 10,000 following the Steelers ' 26 - 21 win at Jacksonville on Oct. 5 , a week after drawing a $ 5,000 fine for a play in which he stepped over Baltimore cornerback Corey Ivy on Sept. 29 .
Ward did not draw a penalty on either play .
... As Jesus was waiting for the rest of the world to realize that he had returned ...

Although there 's a ton of cash or liquidity sloshing through the system , banks want to hoard it rather than lend it
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Robert Peston 's blog in full " There 's a certain degree of panic selling in Tokyo but the sentiment 's different from last week , " Takashi Ushio , head of the investment strategy division at Marusan Securities , was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency .
" Last week people were panicking over the financial system , nobody really knew what would happen .
But now it 's the real economy . "
Yutaka Miura , senior strategist at Shinko Securities Co Ltd , said investors were particularly unnerved by a 1.2 % fall in the value of US retail sales between August and September .
" It really confirmed a severe slowdown in the US economy , " he told the Associated Press news agency .
BBC business editor Robert Peston said that despite recent actions by central banks to help the banking sector , banks were still not lending to each other at anything like a normal rate of interest relative to official rates .
This was worrying as it meant banks were unlikely to lend money at better rates to consumers and businesses .

UPDATED WITH MCCAIN STATEMENT AND OBAMA REACTION
Civil rights icon and Georgia congressman John Lewis is accusing John McCain and Sarah Palin of stoking hate , likening the atmosphere at Republican campaign events to those featuring George Wallace , the segregationist former governor of Alabama and presidential candidate .
McCain 's campaign has responded with a statement in the candidate 's name , urging Barack Obama to repudiate Lewis 's comments .
" What I am seeing reminds me too much of another destructive period in American history , " Lewis said in a statement issued today for Politico 's Arena forum .
" Sen. McCain and Gov. Palin are sowing the seeds of hatred and division , and there is no need for this hostility in our political discourse . "
Lewis did n't accuse McCain of imitating Wallace , but suggested there were similarities .
" George Wallace never threw a bomb , " Lewis noted .
" He never fired a gun , but he created the climate and the conditions that encouraged vicious attacks against innocent Americans who were simply trying to exercise their constitutional rights .
Because of this atmosphere of hate , four little girls were killed on Sunday morning when a church was bombed in Birmingham , Alabama . "
Lewis 's sharp words may be dismissed as those of a partisan Democrat in a campaign season .
But the former head of SNCC and hero of Selma is somebody who McCain has lavished praise upon over the years , including admiring him in a book on courage and bravery and repeatedly invoking Lewis 's name in public appearances .
Appearing with Barack Obama at a forum at Rick Warren 's Saddleback Church in August , McCain included Lewis as one of " three wise men " he would consult as president .
" He can teach us all a lot about the meaning of courage and commitment to causes greater than our self - interest , " McCain said of Lewis .
Now , Lewis is castigating McCain in the harshest of terms .
“ As public figures with the power to influence and persuade , Sen. McCain and Gov. Palin are playing with fire , and if they are not careful , that fire will consume us all , " Lewis said today .
" They are playing a very dangerous game that disregards the value of the political process and cheapens our entire democracy .
We can do better .
The American people deserve better . ”
McCain responded with disappointment , but also a challenge to Obama .
" I am saddened that John Lewis , a man I 've always admired , would make such a brazen and baseless attack on my character and the character of the thousands of hardworking Americans who come to our events to cheer for the kind of reform that will put America on the right track , " the GOP nominee said in a statement this afternoon .
He added : " I call on Senator Obama to immediately and personally repudiate these outrageous and divisive comments that are so clearly designed to shut down debate 24 days before the election .
Our country must return to the important debate about the path forward for America . ”
Obama 's campaign distanced themselves from Lewis 's Wallace language but took a shot at Palin for some of her tough charges of late .
“ Senator Obama does not believe that John McCain or his policy criticism is in any way comparable to George Wallace or his segregationist policies , " said Obama spokesman Bill Burton .
" But John Lewis was right to condemn some of the hateful rhetoric that John McCain himself personally rebuked just last night , as well as the baseless and profoundly irresponsible charges from his own running mate that the Democratic nominee for President of the United States ‘ pals around with terrorists . ’
" As Barack Obama has said himself , the last thing we need from either party is the kind of angry , divisive rhetoric that tears us apart at a time of crisis when we desperately need to come together .
That is the kind of campaign Senator Obama will continue to run in the weeks ahead , ”

Leaders of EU countries plan to use the global financial crisis as an excuse to renege on climate change commitments , according to sources close to energy negotiations in Brussels .
Papers seen by the Guardian suggest the EU council , which meets next week , propose dropping the previous commitment to an automatic increase in emissions cuts if the world gets a major climate change agreement next year .
It also intends to allow countries to avoid having to cut their own emissions by letting them purchase a large proportion of reductions from overseas .
The current EU target of a 20 % reduction in emissions by 2020 will automatically increase to 30 % if a global deal is signed .
But the papers show that the EU is seeking a completely new legislative process if the EU target is to go over 20 % .
This effectively shelves the move to 30 % and would take many years to complete .
The commission justifies its proposals by saying that EU countries paying for emissions cuts would transfer up to € 42bn ( £ 33 bn ) to developing and other countries from 2008 - 2020 .
It also wants a change in the auctioning of pollution allowances for power companies , which could lead to windfall profits estimated at up to € 15bn .
Last night environmental groups said the moves could allow countries such as Britain to build a new generation of coal power stations without fear of exceeding their legally binding emission targets .
" By simply buying cheap projects in developing countries , the EU will avoid making the type of transformations needed in our domestic economy needed to avoid dangerous climate change , " said Tom Picken , head of international climate at Friends of the Earth .
" We are on the verge of losing an ambitious climate package .
It sends the wrong signal to developing countries — it appears that developed countries are not willing to adopt domestic emission reduction targets , " said a WWF spokeswoman .
The moves come as energy ministers prepare to meet in Luxembourg on Friday in advance of the heads of state meeting next week , where the climate change and energy package of measures will be addressed .
New British climate change and energy secretary , Ed Miliband , will attend .
Last week , it emerged that Poland , Greece , Hungary , Slovakia , Romania and Bulgaria had opposed the whole package .
In separate developments Britain , Italy and others were accused of trying to water down commitments for renewable energy .
News of the European political leaders ' moves comes as senior business figures and government advisers are urging politicians not to use the current financial crisis to abandon crucial investment in clean energy and efficiency to tackle climate change , cut costs and improve security .
On Thursday , Lord Browne of Madingley , the former chief executive of BP , warned " none of what 's happened — however dramatic or distressing — detracts from what remains our most pressing energy challenge : combating climate change . "
Browne , now president of the Royal Academy of Engineering , called for a big political investment in new energy technology to match the US Marshall Plan that rebuilt economies after the second world war .
" What is called for is nothing less than a new generation of political leadership — leadership that transcends the day - to - day tussle of electoral politics and short - term economic cycles , " he said .
Miliband insisted the UK was negotiating the best deal possible .
He added : " Now is not the time to row back on our ambitions in tackling climate change .
Cutting the costs of energy is good for people as it keeps down their fuel bills and it's good for the planet as it reduces dangerous climate change .
" The current economic difficulties make these issues more important , not less .
EU ministers have rightly signed up to achieve 20 % of energy coming from renewable energy sources by 2020 and it is important we show that we are committed to that target . "
· This article was amended on Monday October 13 2008 .
It was the Marshall Plan , not the New Deal as we originally said , which rebuilt economies after the second world war .
This has been corrected .

Wall Street and Private Equity vultures are at it again .
They are aided and abetted by Republican senators and its sponsoring media with well orchestrated campaign to cause the death of the United States ’ biggest employer – General Motors , Ford and Chrysler .
The vultures are interested in causing deliberate bankruptcies so that all the equity and options owned by United Auto Workers in their respective companies be turned worthless , the pension fund liabilities avoided partly or altogether , the health and insurance benefits to retirees reduced to zero , termination benefits also reduced substantially for want of funds , and the companies so stripped off its statutory liabilities be bought over in Bankruptcy Court for a song .
The officials from FED , Treasury , Office of the President , and hosts of senators mainly from Republican Party want to rehearse the events of United Airlines , WorldCom , Bethlehem Steel and lately Lehman Brothers , all of whom were allowed to go bankrupt to the detriment of all its workers and employees
Destroy the United Auto Workers …
REASON , all these companies were partly or majority owned by the Employees or Workers , which acted as “ eyesore ” to the brokers on the Wall Street and predators - Private
Equity firms .
The Courts of United States also favor the predators .
They also award the companies to those vultures by refusing to let the company liquidated compulsorily , but handing over to bond or debenture holders by allowing writing off the entire equity of the company , so that the employees are not left with any power without money .
The whole system sucks – from monetary ( FED & Treasury ) to Political ( Senators and Representatives ) , to Executive ( President ) to Judiciary arm ( Courts ) – all are corrupted by the wily suckers on the Wall Street who use its orchestrated media – in print or television .
Day in and out , you tune in to CNBC , NBC , Fox News , CNN or CBS or read Wall Street Journal , Barron ’s , Business Week , Forbes who all praise such actions in the name of saving the company and enforcing cost savings .
Even today , the questions are asked – why Lehman Brothers were allowed to fail .
Why not Merrill Lynch , Bear Stearns , Morgan Stanley , or even Goldman Sachs ?
What is so common in rest of four and unique in Lehman Brothers ?
The answer is LHB was majority owned by employees .
The employees or workers are treated like disposable diapers in United States , whatever is the outer façade to describe them .
It happened to United Airlines only in recent past …
Why United Airlines was allowed to fail and thrown into bankruptcy court – because it was majority owned by employees .
All of their shareholdings were reduced to ZERO by the bankruptcy court and awarded the company to the debt holders who deliberately bought debts to exercise the control .
The life time savings of all employees were lost in a flash like homes destroyed in Californian wild fires .
The debt holders were given the new equity at most favorable terms and reducing all past equities ( majority owned by workers or employees ) to Zero value .
If the company was still worth , the question arises why UA was not placed by the court on auction block with open and transparent public tender or why was it not sold part by part to realize the best value ?
The stocks owned by employees were reduced to zero and the new stocks awarded to debt holders in exchange of debt soared to as high as $ 49 from just under few cents .
All have been accomplished in the name of free enterprise , freedom , capitalism , efficiency of the capital market , and similar nouns and adjectives .
They invent new names , phrases or synonyms from Roget ’s Thesaurus .
Wall Street Brokers Cheers and Jeers at the Loss of Other People ’s Jobs
Whenever a company merges or taken over by a predator , announcements are made to dismiss the thousands of employees in the name of cost cutting exercise and boosting the profits .
Wall Street Brokers from Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , Smith Barney , Merrill Lynch , UBS and all down the line , applaud such moves and start recommending the respective stocks by shooting them up by 10 % to 50 % in a few days .
While the thousands of laid off employees live sleepless nights , sobbing until dawn how to meet the mortgages or tuition fees of their kids , the irresponsible brokers and investment bankers on the Wall Street go on celebrating in high profile parties hitting wine or champagne glasses with the shouts of “ cheers ” .
They are interviewed on popular channels like CNBC or Bloomberg by Anchors with glee on their faces .
There could not have been better shameless spectacle .
Read every take over in the past or mega merger , you will find the same gimmicks all the time .
Consign the Wall Street Brokers and Investment Bankers to Guantanamo Bay …
It is therefore highly a celebration event that finally the Wall Street brokers saw what they deserved most .
Thousands of Wall Street brokers are now being laid off in worst ever crisis which was their own making .
They now realize how it feels like losing a job – celebrating with wine glass or with full glass of tears of their loved ones .
There should be no sympathy for all these bankers , Investment bankers and brokers – they should be condemned and consigned to Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp .
Osama Bin Laden may have caused pain only once – on 911 .
But these Wall Street brokers , banks and investment banks are the biggest financial terrorists who cause pains every day to every family in United States .
$ 218 Billions charity by Paulson to AIG to help them pay Goldman Sachs , his former company ?
And look at the perfidy of Hank Paulson , Treasury Secretary and Ben Bernanke ( FED Chief ) who have been pouring the billions , even trillions of dollars , into bankrupt banks and brokers for the losses of their offshore arms who never contributed any taxes or employment to the local American Tax Payers .
They never asked or justified why the off shore obligations of banks have suddenly become the liability of domestic Americans who have nothing to do with independent off shore operations of those defunct companies .
And why does Paulson pays $ 89 billions +$ 129 billions to AIG ?
Is it because AIG could repay its dues to Goldman Sachs ( wild guess is $ 20 billions to $ 70 billions ) , a firm of whom he was the President before joining Bush Administration ?
Yet , the President Bush is so blind and complacent that he can not see the naked truth .
Devils ’ Donation to Tax Dodgers and Denial to Domestic Tax Paying Corporations .
They are giving hundreds of billions of dollars to “ Asset Void Banks with no possibility of Repayment ” for the obligations of their off shore operations , the tax dodgers .
Same gang is refusing to pay $ 25 billions to 3 Auto makers – General Motors , Ford , and Chrysler who have been paying billions of dollars of taxes for over 60 years , who have created over 2 million jobs , who have solid assets , who developed thousands of townships , who became the backbone of the American Industrial expansion .
United Auto
Workers may come out in full force to demand full justice and ensure that all the excesses of the past defeating the cause of labor are put to rest .
It is now or never for them .
NO , this stubborn Paulson and Bernanke say .
And the Republican Senators join them – Do not give them $ 25 billions – they are inefficient .
As if AIG , Citigroup , JP Morgan Chase , Bank of America who are recipient of over $ 300 billions were efficient .
If these 3 auto makers fail , and 3 million affected Americans are laid off , it will cost $ 12 Billions per month towards “ unemployment allowances ” that is over $ 144 Billions annually , if we consider the recent extension granted by the President Bush .
Simple arithmetic – lose $ 25 billions now with full guarantee of repayment or lose $ 144 billion in a year without any possibility of repayment towards the unemployment allowance alone , loss of tax income if they were gainfully employed is not even counted .
What would you do , if you were the President of United States ?
The country is on steep decline .
There could be unrest , strong protests , riots , loots , murders , real blood bath on the main streets of United States , if no actions were taken to blunt the attack of the Wall Streeters on the Main Street participants .
Can you imagine what happens when 52000 employees of Citi Group and over 2 million direct or indirect employees of 3
Auto makers are suddenly thrown out on the street in just under 7 days ?
Blue collar workers are normally less tolerant of job losses than white collar employees .
It just defies my common sense – how come these VIPs in the White House are pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into bankrupt off shore operations in the form of 100 % unsecured advance while denying relatively small but fully secured $ 25 billions to America ’s biggest industry at home – Auto Makers ?
The present administration has gone absolutely mad , just mad .

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e8zAWt_TnIPsychologists have used hypnosis to give people the ability to see numbers as colors .
That form of synesthesia is naturally possessed by roughly one in 1,000 people , among them such historical luminaries as physicist Richard Feynman and writer Vladimir Nabokov , who saw " q as browner than k , while s is not the light blue of c , but a curious mixture of azure and mother - of - pearl . "
Observations like these , long dismissed as extravagant fantasy , are now considered a window into the mysteries of perception .
But despite a surge of scientific interest , synesthesia 's mechanisms remain unknown .
Researchers have settled on two possible explanations .
Each begins with a human infant born with connections between different sense - related brain regions .
According to one hypothesis , these are lost during development , with synesthetics somehow hanging on to them or growing new connections .
According to the other , the synesthetic connections merely atrophy , but can be accessed under the right conditions .
The latest findings , published in Psychological Science , support the atrophy explanation — and though caveats remain as to whether hypnosis - induced synesthesia is equivalent to the natural kind , they raise the possibility that the potential for synesthesia is actually quite common .
" The fact that they induced it so quickly means that the brain 's not sprouting new neurons or making new connections , " said Lawrence Marks , a Yale University psychologist and synesthesia researcher who was not involved in the study .
" Maybe the connectivity always exists . "
The researchers , led by Roi Kadosh of University College , London and
Luis Fuentes of Spain 's University of Murcia , put three women and one man under hypnosis , then instructed them to perceive digits in color :
one as red , two as yellow , three as green , and so on .
Upon waking , the subjects found it difficult to find numbers printed in black ink against correspondingly colored backgrounds .
The numbers seemed to blend in — a telltale sign of synesthesia .
When the hypnosis was removed , the ability vanished .
How the synesthesia formed so suddenly is n't clear , but the researchers said that new neural connections are probably not responsible .
" Such new anatomical connections could not arise , become functional , and suddenly degenerate in the short time scale provided by the current experiment , " they wrote .
Instead they suggest that hypnosis broke down neurological barriers between sensory regions .
Marks agreed , but cautioned against extrapolating the findings too broadly :
Many different varieties of synesthesia exist , from seeing emotions to tasting sounds , and may have different neurological and psychological origins .
Further attempts at inducing synesthesia are required , said Marks , who suggested that people may someday be able to synesthetize themselves through hypnosis .
There is , however , a catch .
" In theory , anybody could — but only if they were hypnotizable , " he said .

Weapons contractor Northrop Grumman have announced a breakthrough in battlefield tech with the creation of the world ’s first weaponized solid - state laser .
Called FIRESTRIKE , the ruggedized , high - energy , 15 kW laser powers - up in less than half a second and is fully - developed , ready for action now .
The solid - state electric laser is still less powerful than its chemical counterparts also under development , such as the Advanced Tactical Laser ( ATL ) and Airborne Laser ( ABL ) , but is well ahead in terms of logistical and safety considerations .
The chemical variety rely on large tanks of toxic fuel and emit corrosive gases as a by - product , but solid - state lasers have , up until now , been hindered by their limited strength .
Each FIRESTRIKE unit weighs in at 400lb , which is still a long way from hand - held ray - guns , but a big improvement over previous tech .
One of the best features of the FIRESTRIKE ( apart from its compact box - like size ) , is its scaling ability , where multiple units can be linked together to create a more powerful beam .
This flexibility enables the assembly of a high - power defensive / offensive weapon with rapid tear - down time and easy transportation .

Nate Silver is a must - read .
This is a fascinating nugget :
The CBS poll of undecideds has more confirmatory detail .
Obama went from a +18 on " understanding your needs and problems " before the debate to a +56 (! ) afterward .
And he went from a - 9 on " prepared to be president " to a +21 .
The more it sinks in , the more I think Obama actually knocked it out of the park last night .
He is , in some ways , the inverse McCain .
McCain is all drama and explosions but then ... the air smells like damp , finished fireworks smoke .
Obama seems calm and cautious but then ... you realize he cleaned your clock .
A few more morning after thoughts : the body language matters .
McCain could n't look at Obama as if he is offended by even having to share a stage with him .
But Obama engaged him directly several times .
Check the photo below .
Even when shaking hands , McCain looks away .
This is , in fact , a sign of insecurity .
The presidential factor :
Even Obama 's critics will concede that he was McCain 's equal last night .
For a lot of undecided voters , the big question has always been whether this new and odd - looking guy could look like an American president , whether he passes Middle America 's gut - check on how a president Obama feels in their psyches .
I think Obama passed that test , as Reagan did in 1980 and as Kennedy did in 1960 .
We forget now how both those iconic presidents were regarded as iffy and perhaps not ready for prime time as candidates .
Lastly : the relating to ordinary folks .
It has been Obama 's greatest weakness .

Russian forces were bulldozing a camp at a key checkpoint outside South Ossetia and withdrawing as European Union monitors followed .
" Troops from five ( of six ) posts are already in South Ossetia , and the last column with peacekeepers from the sixth observation post is on its way to Tskhinvali , " Marat Kulakhmetov , commander of Russian peacekeeping forces , was quoted by news agency Interfax as saying in the South Ossetian capital Tskhinvali .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said all of Russia 's forces would quit the security zones extending into Georgia from its rebel regions by midnight Wednesday .
Medvedev shows regard for EU role
Medvedev hailed the role of EU observers in the post conflict zone , speaking at a summit in the French town of Evian .
The Russian President has offered his thanks to the EU for its role in the Georgia crisis
" I want to stress the constructive role of the European Union in finding a peaceful option for overcoming the Caucasus crisis , " he said .
" When other forces in the world were reluctant or incapable of doing this , it was in the European Union that we found a ... responsible and pragmatic partner . "
Moscow has until Friday under an EU - brokered ceasefire to withdraw from the Georgian checkpoints occupied since its brief but violent war with the post -Soviet republic in August .
Russia honored its word : Sarkozy
French President Nicolas Sarkozy paid tribute to the Russian president for keeping his word in promising to pull troops out of the Georgia Proper " buffer zones . "
Sarkozy acknowledged " the withdrawal confirmed by President Medvedev , who in doing so has kept his word , " in a speech to a conference in eastern France , where he was to hold talks with Medvedev .
" Both sides must now refrain from any provocation on the ground , " Sarkozy added .
The Russian withdrawal precedes a peace conference set for Oct. 15 in Geneva , where the broader issue of Georgia 's long - term security is to be debated .
The ceasefire
French President Nicolas Sarkozy says Russia lived up to its word by withdrawing
France , which currently chairs the EU 's six - month rotating presidency , brokered a peace agreement in Moscow on Tuesday , Aug. 12 to end the fierce six - day conflict between Russia and Georgia in the two breakaway Georgian provinces .
Under the terms of the agreement , Moscow was to withdraw most of its forces but leave a military presence in the two breakaway zones .
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili has also accepted Sarkozy 's plan .
Russia insists it will keep nearly 4,000 troops in each of the separatist zones , a plan which the US , EU and NATO have said contravenes the French - brokered ceasefire .
Russian president chastises US
As his country 's troops rolled out of Georgia Proper , Medvedev said Europe 's security system , which was still based around NATO and the US , needed an overhaul , as highlighted by Russia 's war with Georgia .
He proposed a new European security pact that would negate the possibility of any one country having a monopoly on the safety of the continent .
" A desire by the United States to consolidate its global domination led to it missing a historical chance ... to build a truly democratic world order , " Medvedev said .
Amazon.com , eBay ’s main rival in online shopping , invested in Bill Me Later last year and has integrated the payment service into its site .
It is unclear whether that relationship will continue .
Amazon declined to comment on the transaction .
Shares of eBay fell on Monday along with the overall market , dropping $ 1.05 , or 5.5 percent , to $ 17.89 .
Although eBay ’s stock is at a five - year low , Mr. Donahoe said the company ’s strong balance sheet and cash balance have allowed it to take advantage of Bill Me Later ’s declining value in a market that has been rough on all companies in the finance sector .
“ We feel a little like Warren Buffett .
We are a strong company , and at times like this we can move to take advantage of the market environment , ” he said in an interview .
EBay also announced on Monday that it was acquiring the popular Danish classified advertising site DBA.dk and the automotive marketplace BilBasen.dk for $ 390 million , from the Danish media mogul Karsten Ree .
The deal is one of the largest in Denmark ’s history .
A local newspaper reported that the companies had negotiated on and off for four years .
EBay has been steadily building or buying classified Web sites and already owns properties like Kijiji , Gumtree , Marktplaats , LoQuo and mobile .de .
EBay also owns a 25 percent stake in the American online classifieds leader Craigslist , but its interest in buying the firm outright led the companies to sue each other this year .
EBay ’s attempt to stitch together a global network of classified advertising sites is partly intended to create an alternative to its sagging traditional business of auctions .
For the first time on Monday , eBay disclosed some financial information about its classifieds holdings , saying they generated $ 260 million in revenue last year  which it described as three to four times the estimated annual revenue of the closely held Craigslist .
The Denver Zoo is chock full of babies these days .
Two twin red panda cubs , Amaya and Takeo , are now on display and appear quite playful .
Red pandas are classified as endangered , with an estimated population of less than 2,500 mature individuals remaining in the wild .
Their population continues to decline due to habitat fragmentation and hunting .
Who in the world could hunt these little guys ?!
Denver , CO ( October 23 , 2008 ) – Denver Zoo ’s new twin red panda cubs can now be seen in their exhibit , weather permitting .
The new additions , which were born June 29 , have been widely sought after since their last physicals .
They are Amaya , a female , and Takeo , a male .
Amaya and Takeo are quite playful .
Until recently the pair was being nurtured behind the scenes by mother Sophia before growing strong enough to be seen in their outdoor habitat .
Visitors can see the cubs at the zoo ’s 24th annual Boo At The Zoo trick or treat event on October 25 & 26 .
Dress up as your favorite zooper hero and enjoy more than 25 candy stations , while enjoying the wild sites of the zoo – like Amaya and Takeo .
The new pandas were born to red pandas Sophia and He -Ping .
He - Ping , arrived at Denver Zoo late last year from Milwaukee Zoo with his new mate , Sophia , from Mill Mountain Zoo .
The two were paired together under recommendation of the Association of Zoos and Aquarium ’s ( AZA ) Species Survival Plan ( SSP ) which ensures healthy populations and genetic diversity among zoo animals .
Fortunately , the couple has proved to be an excellent match .
The red panda cubs have grown much in only a few months .
When they were born they were covered with cream - colored fur and could fit in the palm of a hand .
Now the twins have their adult markings and look like slightly smaller versions of their parents , resembling red-colored raccoons .
Red pandas are classified as endangered , with an estimated population of less than 2,500 mature individuals remaining in the wild .
Their population continues to decline due to habitat fragmentation and hunting .
Like their larger cousins , these lesser pandas eat primarily bamboo shoots .
At the zoo they also eat special vitamin - fortified biscuits .
Red pandas are well adapted with their thick fur coats to live in the often low temperatures of the mountains of southeastern Asia and are quite comfortable outside during cooler days here in Denver .

A sensitive document detailing a classified computer database of the Canadian government has turned out on the rainy street of the capital city Ottawa , media reports said Friday .
The document is a risk assessment of a classified enforcement database of Environment Canada .
It details a number of the system 's failings and describes how the data could be attacked and corrupted , the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ( CBC ) reported .
The document , with each of its pages marked " Protected B " on the top , was lying on an Ottawa street corner in a rain - stained , tire - marked brown envelope .
It was spotted by a passer - by and turned to CBC .
The database , named National Enforcement Management Information System and Intelligence System ( NEMISIS ) , is used by officers to track and prosecute polluters and environmental law - breakers .
The system provides accurate and timely statistical information and detailed reports on enforcement efforts .
The lost document described in detail how the database could be attacked by industrial hackers and organized crime , as well as environmental activists .
If someone were able to shut the system down , or hack inside and delete or corrupt the information , officers might not be able to prosecute their cases , which would seriously interfere with the enforcement of the law , the risk assessment said .
Documents labeled Protected B must be handled with special care for security reasons and not left lying around for just anyone to see , said Christian Rouillard , an expert on public administration and associate professor at the University of Ottawa 's school of political studies .
Environment Canada spokeswoman Sujata Raisinghani said the department will look into the incident .
" We take document security seriously , " she said .

Bloomberg is reporting Hartford , Prudential , MetLife Credit Swaps Widen to Records .
The cost to protect against a default by Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. , Prudential Financial Inc. and MetLife Inc. rose to record levels on speculation that the turmoil in financial markets may be spreading to insurers .
Credit - default swaps on Hartford jumped 165 basis points to a mid-price of 675 basis points , according to broker Phoenix Partners Group .
Contracts on Prudential rose 125 basis points to 617 basis points , while MetLife climbed 97 basis points to 583 basis points , CMA Datavision prices show .
An increase in the contracts , used to hedge against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness , represents a decline in investor confidence .

Hundreds of youths heading to a political protest jumped BART fare gates Friday morning , catching transit officials off - guard and forcing shutdowns at three East Bay stations that stranded some passengers for more than an hour .
The Fruitvale and Coliseum stations in Oakland and the Richmond station were all closed starting about 9:15 a.m. as young people heading for a rally in San Francisco against enforcement of federal immigration laws evaded fares .
All three stations reopened by 10:30 a.m. , but BART closed the Fruitvale station a second time for nearly an hour starting at 11 a.m. as more youths jumped the gates .
When the station reopened , security officers with dogs stood watch to make sure everyone paid .
In addition to the station closures , some BART trains bound for San Francisco were delayed at the West Oakland station by protesters holding doors open and demanding that Fruitvale be reopened , passengers and BART officials said .
Passengers and protesters said the delays caused anger that almost boiled over into blows at the stations and on the trains .
No injuries were reported in the mass fare - evasion scheme , which took BART officials by surprise .
BART spokesman Linton Johnson said it appeared that the youths had made a coordinated decision to jump the fare gates .
Police detained three people at the Richmond station .
Johnson did not know whether anyone was arrested .
The protesters were heading to a rally at Ferry Park on San Francisco 's Embarcadero , where about 400 people began a noontime march through the Financial District opposing enforcement actions taken by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents .
The youths , many wearing skull makeup , tied up traffic on several streets , but the protest was peaceful .
The protesters marched up Washington Street with a police escort to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service building at 630 Sansome St. Some protesters chained themselves to oil drums designed to block vehicles .
Police decided to wait them out and made no arrests .
BART officers were dispatched to monitor the crowds , and BART was prepared to shut down San Francisco stations if demonstrators tried to hop the fare gates again , Johnson said .
That did n't happen , however , and the evening commute went smoothly .
One of the protest organizers , Sagnicthe Salazar of a youth group called Huaxtex , said the protesters had jumped fare gates because they were organized independently and had no funding .
Outside the Fruitvale station , fuming would - be passengers were forced to wait out the delays before they could get on a train .
" I am on my way to a family emergency and no , I 'm not in a good way right now , " said Lisa Roellig of Oakland , whose mother was in a hospital .
At the rally in Ferry Park , protesters said the BART ride from the East Bay was tense as youths delaying trains argued with commuters and other passengers .
" This was a peaceful protest .
We were not trying to start anything , " said Kenya Ramirez , 17 , who traveled from San Diego for the rally .
" We were just trying to get our message out .
Our message is civil disobedience . "
She said the students had held train doors open at several stations so fare jumpers could get on board .
" The other people were getting upset because they had someplace to go , " Ramirez said .
" We 're doing it for them .
They were being a little selfish . "
In the early days of the War on Terror , back when the United States was only fighting one war , in Afghanistan , Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage made a bold statement : “ Hezbollah may be the ‘ A - Team of terrorists , ' ” Armitage said , referring to the Lebanese - based , Iranian - controlled organization , “ and maybe al - Qaeda is actually the ‘ B ’ - Team . ”
Hezbollah has certainly been killing Americans for longer than al - Qaeda has — beginning in 1983 with the truck bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut which killed 241 Marines .
As recently as June 2006 , Deputy Assistant Secretary of State David Satterfield told reporters that Hezbollah teams were involved in attacking U.S. - led coalition forces in Iraq .
Now , in an alarming new development , the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) has broken apart an international drug smuggling and money laundering ring which links Hezbollah to the Colombian cocaine cartels though a Lebanese operative named Shukri Mahmud Harb .
This is the first time the U.S. has tied a terrorist organization to a major cocaine cartel .
“ The profits from the sale of drugs went to finance Hezbollah , ” says Gladys Sanchez , the chief investigator for the special prosecutor ’s office in Bogotá .
The DEA took the lead on the investigation , which went by the code name Operation Titan .
According to documents unsealed by a federal magistrate in Miami last week , Harb , who lived in Bogotá and went by the alias “ Taliban , ” acted as the money man between the cocaine cartels and the terror organization .
Described as a “ world - class money - launderer , ” Harb ’s illegal financial transactions have spanned the globe — from Latin America to Asia — with a cut being diverted to fund terror .
“ Harb traveled frequently to Syria , Egypt , and Lebanon , and his arrest occurred when he was about to leave Bogotá for Syria , ” the Miami Herald reported last weekend .
Also arrested in Operation Titan were 21 individuals in Colombia and “ 90 others in Panama , Guatemala , Lebanon , Hong Kong , and the United States . ”
According to the Colombian special prosecutor ’s office , investigators analyzed more than 700,000 intercepted phone conversations from 370 tapped cell phone lines .
Two other Middle Eastern men were also charged — a Jordanian named Ali Mohamad Abdul Rahim and a second Lebanese national named Zacaria Hussein Harb .
This new partnership will no doubt raise complications for President - elect Barack Obama in his proposed plans to open diplomatic talks with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
“ Hezbollah in Lebanon is a proxy of Iran , ” says former Middle East CIA operative Robert Baer in his new book , The Devil We Know .
“ It follows to the letter Iranian orders . ”
This means that Iran is co-sponsoring Hezbollah along with the only global organization able to consistently smuggle tons of illegal goods into every single industrialized nation in the world including America — on a daily basis .
Toss the Colombian cocaine cartels ’ newest mode of transport into the mix — stealthy semi-submersible submarines , or “ drug subs ” — and the national security ramifications in the Iran - Hezbollah - Colombia cocaine cartel triumvirate grow exponentially .
Vice President - elect Joe Biden summed up one resulting nightmare scenario just last month .
On the eve of the Senate passing legislation directed against the cartels ’ “ use of submarines to smuggle drugs , ” the senator from Delaware , who spearheaded the bill ( S.3351 ) , said , “ If smugglers can pack tons of illegal drugs into these stealthy vessels , terrorists could carry weapons of mass destruction or other threats into our country the same way . ”
Which is exactly what the terrorists —
‘ A’ - Team and ‘ B ’ - Team members alike — already know .

At least 28 people have been killed by three bombs that exploded just moments apart in the Iraqi capital , Baghdad .
The first two blasts were car bombs and then a suicide bomber detonated his charges in the crowd that had gathered to help , police say .
Another 68 people were injured in the blasts , which took place during morning rush hour in the Shia area of Kasra .
North of Baghdad , in Baquba , a female suicide car bomber attacked a US - allied militia checkpoint , killing six people .
The triple - bomb attack in Baghdad is one of the deadliest in Iraq in several months .
It is unclear how many people were killed and wounded in each of the explosions , police say .
Favoured tactic
Although attacks have decreased in number overall in Iraq in the last year , there has been a string of bombings in Baghdad and elsewhere in recent weeks .
We are fed up with such attacks and we want only to live in peace

In pictures : Baghdad bombings Bombings raise spectre of al - Qaeda
Most of these have targeted police or security forces , government officials or commuters going to work in the morning .
The simultaneous bombs tactic has been much used by Iraqi insurgents since the US - led invasion in 2003 , says the BBC's Andrew North in Baghdad .
There are suspicions that the blasts were an al - Qaeda attempt to re-ignite sectarian conflict in Baghdad , says our correspondent .
Kasra adjoins the mainly - Sunni district of Adhamiya .
A minibus full of schoolgirls was caught in the attack .
Television pictures showed blood on the seats and girls shoes scattered in the wreckage .
Shop fronts were torn apart and debris was strewn across the street .
" We are fed up with such attacks and we want only to live in peace , " said local grocery store owner Ahmed Riyadh .
Baghdad was torn by sectarian strife through 2006 - 7 , but it has since largely subsided as many local militias have joined Awakening Councils set up by the US forces .
Smaller attacks still take place on a daily basis , however .
The suicide car bomber in Baquba , in Diyala province , struck a checkpoint staffed by a local Awakening Council militia .
Six militia members were killed and 14 civilians were wounded , police said .
The US military began transferring control of the Awakening Council militias to the Iraqis on 1 October and on Monday the government started paying the salaries of the Baghdad councils .
The Awakening Council militias , along with the increase in US troop numbers , are credited with the dramatic improvements in security in Iraq since the fierce sectarian violence of 2006 - 7 .

The pure racist hatred John McCain and Sarah Palin inspire at their political rallies is starting to drive some of their frothing supporters over the edge .
You can't see this man 's hood , but rest assured , he 's wearing it on the inside .
These people are so driven by blind hatred that they are no longer able to hide or control it .

Michael Jackson failed to keep £ 4.6 million music deal , says Bahraini prince
Michael Jackson is being sued for £ 4.6 million by an Arab prince for reneging on a recording deal , the High Court has heard .
The reclusive singer is alleged to have accepted the huge sum to sing tracks composed by Sheikh Abdullah Bin Hamad Bin Isa Khalifa .
Jackson claims the money was a gift and he does not owe a penny .
But the sheikh , who is the second son of the king of Bahrain , said the money he spent supporting Jackson 's lavish lifestyle was purely an advance on a music rights deal he agreed with the singer .
Michael Jackson is facing a $ 7,000,000 law suit brought by Sheikh Abdulla Bin Hamad Bin Isa Al - Khalifa , left , who alleges the singer reneged on a recording and entertainment project
In a sworn statement read to the judge Mr Justice Nigel Sweeney , he said : ' I would never pay anybody millions of dollars for nothing in return . '
The collaboration started in 2004 and the pair agreed a deal to release pop songs to raise money for the victims of the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina , the court heard .
But the sheikh claims that the near bankrupt 50 - year - old pop star signed a deal in April 2006 , took the money and later refused to work on the projects .
Among the donations , Jackson 's personal assistant allegedly made a request for 21,000 in 2005 to pay ' utility bills ' at his Neverland ranch - which he has now been forced to sell .

Jackson asked for £ 614,000 through an assistant the following month in April 2005 .
The sheikh also paid Jackson 's £ 1.4 million legal bill for his child molestation trial in May 2005 , and had planned to revive the singer 's ruined career , it was claimed .
Jackson spent time in Bahrain as a guest of the royal family following his acquittal .
Bankim Thanki QC , representing the sheikh , told the High Court that his client was very surprised at the state of Jackson 's finances .
Mr Thanki said that the day after Jackson 's criminal trial ended in California , the star recorded one of the songs which the sheikh wanted released as a charity single to help victims of the Boxing Day tsunami .
Jackson gave up the title on his Neverland ranch last week after falling into default on the $ 24.5 million he owed on the property
Mr Thanki promised the judge that a recording of the song would be played in court during the trial .
' It shows the quality of Sheikh Abdullah 's song writing skills and that of Mr Jackson 's voice , ' he told the judge .
Jackson and the sheikh had begun a ' burgeoning relationship and musical co-operation ' , he added .
Another charity record for the New Orleans victims of Hurricane Katrina was also planned by the pair , it was claimed .
Recent aerial photos of the ranch in Santa Barbara showed it had fallen into disrepair
They even discussed the chances of Jackson moving to Bahrain to ' continue their musical collaboration in a more conducive environment ' .
The sheikh has extensive administrative duties in the kingdom but has ' a substantial interest in music which led him to be introduced to the Jackson family ' , the court was told .
Meanwhile , Jackson 's career was hit hard by the child abuse allegations and was not showing any signs of recovering , despite him being found not guilty in his trial .
Under the terms of the alleged deal struck between the pair , Jackson is said to have agreed to major recording obligations , an autobiography and a musical stage play , along with other rights .
Jackson gave up the title on his Neverland ranch last week after falling into default on the £ 15 million he owed on the Californian estate .
He admits he failed to meet any obligations the sheikh may have expected , but insists there was no legally valid agreement between them .
The hearing , expected to last 12 days , continues .
The latest Top 500 supercomputers list is out , and it represents yet another step in a trend that is changing the complexion of this list from year to year .
No , I 'm not talking about the way that the x86 architecture has taken over the list like kudzu in the past decade , squeezing out classic , special - purpose supercomputer architectures with a combination of high performance and low costs .
Intel and AMD have owned this list for some time , and at this point they can claim a presence in close to 90 percent of the systems on it .
The really new trend — the one that just recently began and that will only accelerate — is the increasing presence of game - oriented hardware on the list .
At the top of the list is IBM's Roadrunner , which first rode the power of the Cell chip to the top spot in June .
Roadrunner epitomizes both trends in that it combines a modified version of the processor used in the PlayStation 3 with AMD 's Opteron .
But the Cell is n't the only coprocessor on the list that has its roots in gaming .
An NVIDIA GPU has finally made its way onto the Top 500 list , in a 170 TFLOP machine based at the Tokyo Institute of Technology .
The TSUBAME was upgraded recently with NVIDIA 's Tesla S1070 , a math coprocessor that 's essentially a specialized version of the same GPU that the company sells to gamers .
Like its gaming sibling , the Telsa is programmable with CUDA , and when paired with a general - purpose processor , it makes for a great , data - parallel , floating - point machine .
The high - performance computing ( HPC ) market is one that NVIDIA , IBM , and AMD / ATI all see as a growth market for repurposed gaming hardware .
Supercomputers typically run workloads with high degrees of data parallelism , and they have an insatiable appetite for bandwidth and floating - point power .
These characteristics are also typical of games , and for good reason — both gaming and supercomputing workloads are essentially simulations .
As I described in this article from March of 2007 ( unfortunately it has " PhysX " in the title , so it often gets skipped over ) , semiconductor manufacturers who want to target the high - margin HPC market must first build up volume with a version of their chip in the larger consumer market .
When a chip ships in enough volume to keep production costs down , the vendor can then jack up the margins on a special version of the product and sell it to HPC customers in academia , government , and industry .
Coprocessors that are specifically designed with HPC in mind are ultimately doomed , since even a fabless vendor can't get high enough volumes in the HPC market alone to justify the astronomically high upfront production costs of developing a modern chip and getting through the point of having an actual mask set made .
( I expect to get a flood of e-mail from stealth mode HPC - only math coprocessor plays offering to explain to me why I 'm wrong .
By all means , fire away , because even if you do n't change my mind , I 'm likely to learn something . )
The US National Security Agency has released a case study showing how to develop zero - defect code in a cost - effective manner .
The researchers of the project conclude that , if adopted widely , the practices advocated in the case study could help make commercial software programs more reliable and less vulnerable .
I examined a small part of the case study 's code , and was not impressed .
The Tokeneer case study involves an NSA - funded project carried out by the U.K. - based Praxis High Integrity Systems and Spre Inc .
The project 's materials , such as requirements , security target , specifications , designs , and proofs , and the code are now available online .
According to an article in the Government Computer News , Tokeneer meets or exceeds the Common Criteria Evaluation Assurance Level ( EAL ) 5 .
A related paper presented at the 1st IEEE International Symposium of Secure Software Engineering concludes that the case study has shown that software - based security products can be built so that they are reliable , verifiable and cost effective against Common Criteria guidelines , thus raising the bar for both procurers and suppliers .
I 'm not the most qualified person to judge the project 's requirements analysis , the formal specification , and formal refinement of the specification .
However , intrigued by the statements regarding the project 's software quality , and based on the legendary reputation of Praxis 's work , I decided to download and have a look at the released code .
I examined one of the largest source code files ( tis_release / code/core/auditlog.adb ) , and in it I found difficult to maintain , error - prone code , a poor naming choice , inconsistent code formatting , and , even , what I think is a logic error ( I sincerely hope somebody proves me wrong on the last one ) .
My judgment criteria are relatively strict , but I think they are commensurate with the extraordinary claims made by the study .
Difficult to Maintain and Error - Prone Code
Here are excerpts of the code used for mapping the number of a log file to its name .
subtype LogFileIndexT is LogFileCountT range 1 .. MaxNumberLogFiles ; subtype FileNameI is Positive range 1 .. 16 ; subtype FileNameT is String ( FileNameI ) ; type LogFileNamesT is array ( LogFileIndexT ) of FileNameT ; LogFileNames : constant LogFileNamesT := LogFileNamesT '( 1 => " ./Log/File01.log " , 2 => " ./Log/File02.log " , 3 => " ./Log/File03.log " , 4 => " ./Log/File04.log " , 5 => " ./Log/File05.log " , 6 => " ./Log/File06.log " , 7 => " ./Log/File07.log " , 8 => " ./Log/File08.log " , 9 => " ./Log/File09.log " , 10 => " ./Log/File10.log " , 11 => " ./Log/File11.log " , 12 => " ./Log/File12.log " , 13 => " ./Log/File13.log " , 14 => " ./Log/File14.log " , 15 => " ./Log/File15.log " , 16 => " ./Log/File16.log " , 17 => " ./Log/File17.log " ) ;
See how more than 20 lines of code are used for what I could express in C or Java with a couple of lines .
like the following .
static String logFileName ( int n ) { Formatter f = new Formatter ( ) ; return f . format ( " ./Log/File%02d.log " , n ) . toString ( ) ; }
There are a number of problems with this part of the study 's code .
First , the code violates the DRY ( do n't repeat yourself ) principle , making it error prone , and difficult to change and maintain .
Each array element initialization must be separately inspected by hand to verify that it matches the corresponding array index .
The code also violates the single point of truth principle .
Each time MaxNumberLogFiles changes , an entry must also be added to or removed from the array initialization .
If the log file name or location changes , it must be changed 17 times , and if the string 's length changes , one must also adjust the magic number 16 appearing in the declaration of FileNameI , which is the length of the filename used for initializing the array .
Finally , the large number of repetitive lines inflates the productivity figure cited in the study ( 10,000 lines of code in 260 person - days , or about 38 lines of code per day ) .
A Poor Name Choice
A data structure named and documented as a list is actually what is commonly called a circular or ring buffer .
------------------------------------------------------------------
-- NextListIndex -- --
Description : --
Returns the next index , wrapping if necessary .
-- -- Implementation Notes : -- None . --
------------------------------------------------------------------ function NextListIndex ( Value : LogFileIndexT ) return LogFileIndexT is Result : LogFileIndexT ; begin if Value = LogFileIndexT ' Last then Result := LogFileIndexT ' First ; else Result := Value + 1 ; end if ; return Result ; end NextListIndex ;
The above 21 lines implement what is commonly written inline using a simple modulo division .
Inconsistent Code Formatting
The code 's developers , despite the development environment they use , seem to have trouble maintaining a consistent formatting style for spacing the code 's elements .
As an example , notice the spacing after LogFiles .
We have cases where there is a space before the bracket , after the bracket , and no space at all .
LogFilesStatus ( Index ) := Free ; LogFiles ( Index ) := The File ; FileH := LogFiles ( I ) ;
A Logic Error ?
A function , SystemFaultOccurred , is documented to return " True exactly when a critical system fault has occurred while attempting to maintain the audit log . "
This matches the corresponding specification ( tis_release / docs/50_2_INFORMED_Design/50_2.pdf p. 43 ) : " The operation SystemFaultOccurred indicates whether or not a critical system fault has occurred whilst writing to the log . "
This is implemented by having a global variable , AuditSystemFault , set very conservatively to true whenever something goes wrong in the system .
Here are the cases in the code where AuditSystem Fault is set .
( OK is a variable set by various system functions . )
AuditSystemFault := AuditSystemFault or not OK ; AuditSystemFault := AuditSystemFault or not OK ; AuditSystemFault := AuditSystemFault or not OK ; AuditSystemFault := AuditSystemFault or not OK ; AuditSystemFault := True ; AuditSystemFault := True ; AuditSystemFault := True ; AuditSystemFault := True ; AuditSystemFault := not OK ;
However , when a log file is deleted the previous value of AuditSystemFault is ANDed instead of ORed with the operation 's result , thus clearing it if the deletion is successful , and failing to set it if the deletion fails , but no fault was detected before .
File .
Delete ( The File => The File , Success => OK ) ; AuditSystemFault := AuditSystemFault and not OK ;
The following table illustrates this strange behavior .
AuditSystemFault OK not OK AuditSystemFault and not OK False False True False False True False False True False True True True True False False
If the implemented behavior is indeed correct ( I doubt it ) , at the very least what looks like a strange divergence from the specification should have been documented in the code .
I found these problems in less than an hour , in the second source code file I looked ( the first was extremely short ) .
At the very least my findings indicate that formal methods are not a substitute or a guarantee of good programming practices .
Are we witnessing the erosion of capitalism , or its salvation ?
That question is swirling around the federal government ’s latest proposed intervention in the private financial markets since Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson announced Friday a plan to take equity stakes in banks as a quick and efficient way to pump them with new capital .
Combined with the government ’s takeover last month of the mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and its huge ownership stake in the crippled insurance company American International Group , the bank plan represents perhaps the largest federal intervention in private enterprise since President Truman ’s attempt to nationalize the steel industry to avert a strike in 1952 -- a move blocked by the Supreme Court .
The idea of taking direct stakes in financial institutions was adopted last week by Britain , which will in effect partly nationalize banks with as much as $ 87 billion in capital infusions and an additional $ 350 billion available for short - term loans .
Some of the country ’s biggest banks have signed up , including Barclays and the Royal Bank of Scotland .

The Italian government has also authorized a recapitalization package to be enacted if the need arises .
Germany , with Europe ’s biggest economy , has resisted such plans , but there were reports Saturday that Chancellor Angela Merkel might unveil a recapitalization plan as early as today .
A consensus seemed to be emerging among leaders of the world ’s top economies meeting Saturday in Washington that whatever economic or political differences existed among them , all countries must act aggressively and in concert in guaranteeing deposits in their banks and pumping government capital into faltering institutions to help ease the global crisis .
A stubborn seize - up of bank lending to businesses , individuals and each other has sharply heightened the prospects of a deep and lengthy recession in the U.S. and abroad .
The fact that devoted supporters of laissez - faire economics are falling in line to bless the aggressive foray into free enterprise by the U.S. government is a sign of the seriousness of the crisis .

“ I ’m against the government owning anything . . . , ” Stanford University finance professor Jonathan Berk said .
“ That said , buying an equity stake may be the cheapest way ” to achieve a banking recovery .
But others believe that scrapping free - market principles in a crisis atmosphere may doom the banking industry to a future of inefficiency .
“ It ’s a move in the wrong direction , both economically and ideologically , ” said Casey B. Mulligan , a conservative economist at the University of Chicago who believes that predictions of an economic meltdown are overblown .
“ Government enterprises do n’t do well , because public management does n’t pay attention to the bottom line . ”
Paulson said the Treasury ’s investments would be in nonvoting stock , an important concession to conservatives and others who might be uneasy about giving government officials more direct sway over management of private institutions .

Whether the Treasury will stay out of management decisions -- or even whether it should leave the institutions in the hands of the executives who turned them into beggars for a federal lifeline -- is one of the greatest uncertainties of the program .
“ I ’ve got big reservations about the government deciding which banks need help and how they should be administered , ” said Bert Ely , an Alexandria , Va. - based banking consultant .
“ We have n’t heard about the strings tied to this program .
This is not going to be free capital . ”
Proponents contend that the new plan is sure to be a more efficient and cheaper solution to the banks ’ ills than the main proposal of the economic rescue package passed by Congress less than two weeks ago .
That arrangement granted Treasury ’s request to spend as much as $ 700 billion to take soured assets , especially mortgages and mortgage - backed securities , off the banks ’ hands .
A little - noticed provision of that plan authorized direct investments in financial institutions of the sort Paulson now plans to pursue .
As the rescue unfolds , the pace of the new program may well outstrip that of the original asset - purchase approach .
Paulson said the government could begin these equity purchases within weeks ; the mortgage securities acquisitions might not begin for a month or more .

Details of the government ’s bank intervention are unclear .
But the Treasury may try to link its investments with parallel capital infusions by private investors , offering to contribute a stake equal to the private capital a bank raises on its own .
In a fundamental way , the Treasury plan contradicts two centuries of American economic orthodoxy .
Americans have always been wary of giving the government a direct role in the banking sector .
These concerns date to the first Treasury secretary , Alexander Hamilton , who founded the nation ’s central bank , the Bank of the United States , in 1791 , but ensured that the government would be a minority stakeholder by contributing only one - fifth of its $ 10 million in capital .
As president , Andrew Jackson , who yielded to no one in his suspicion of bankers , essentially abolished the bank ’s successor in 1832 .
The U.S. went without any central bank until 1913 , when Congress established the Federal Reserve System .
The new institution , however , was a regulatory weakling , rendering it all but powerless to address the Great Depression .
It was a complete overhaul during the New Deal that gave the Fed the almost unlimited monetary and regulatory authority it has been aggressively deploying in the current crisis .
By then the perils of a loss of confidence in the banking system had become all too clear .
The most vivid example was the failure of another Bank of the U.S. , this one a small Depression - era institution with a grandiose name that served mostly Jewish merchants in Lower Manhattan .
When J.P. Morgan rebuffed regulators ’ pleas for a rescue , it collapsed , shattering trust in the nation ’s banks .
The loss of faith helped trigger the Depression .

Similarly , a determination to instill confidence in banks so that they will keep credit flowing underlies the Treasury ’s extraordinary new steps .
“ Nobody . . . believes in the rule of the ‘ free market ’ in a financial crisis , ” UC Berkeley economics professor J. Bradford DeLong wrote on his blog Friday .
DeLong points to the example of Sweden , which nationalized its banks during its financial crisis in 1992 .
After the government disposed of their troubled assets , it refloated them as public companies .
The Treasury ’s plan does not look quite as drastic as Sweden ’s .
Instead , it is designed to conform more to the traditional American aversion to outright ownership .
To many economists and business experts , the key is the nonvoting nature of the equity that Paulson proposes to acquire .

“ It ’s not nationalizing the banks , ” said Peter Morici , a business professor at the University of Maryland and former chief economist for the U.S. International Trade Commission .
“ It would only be nationalizing the banks if we bought warrants , converted them into common stock and started voting the shares . ”
James Barth , senior fellow at the Milken Institute and former chief economist at the Office of Thrift Supervision , contended that the government should take further steps to remain a silent partner in any investment .
“ There ’s no need for the government to change a company ’s directors or vote on anything , ” he said , “ because you have a great backstop : prompt corrective action with federal regulators taking control should things get too bad . ”
Clearly , economic ideologies have taken a back seat to calls for quick action .

“ Many countries have nationalized their banking systems over the years , then reprivatized them and become very strong , ” said Lawrence E. Harris , a finance professor at USC and former chief economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission .
“ The government will undoubtedly want to get out of the business as quickly as it can .
This is certainly not the end of capitalism .
Extraordinary problems require extraordinary solutions . ”

CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) -- Commercial real estate is likely to suffer its worst year since the recession of 1991 - 1992 , an annual study predicts , with property values falling , vacancies rising and developers forced to sit on the sidelines as capital remains scarce and debt markets struggle to right themselves from the credit crisis .
Although all commercial property types will be under pressure , moderately priced apartments and warehouse / industrial buildings will provide the best investment opportunity in the next 12 months , according to the 30th annual PricewaterhouseCoopers - Urban Land Institute " Emerging Trends in Real Estate " study released Tuesday .
" It 's no surprise that 2009 will not be a good year for real estate development or investment .
There is no escaping the minefield of the credit crisis and the broken financial system , " said Stephen Blank , ULI 's senior resident fellow for real estate finance .
" And there is no quick fix . "
Commercial real estate is only at the beginning of its correction , lagging behind housing and stocks , which have already been in a prolonged downturn , according to Blank and Jonathan Miller , partner in the communications firm Miller / Ryan LLC and author of the report .
Property values are likely to fall 15 % to 20 % from their 2007 peaks , Blank said , before the bottom is reached in 2010 .
" You 're looking at an industrywide repricing of assets ... a dramatic drop in value and sharp increases in delinquencies and foreclosures , " Blank said , although foreclosures and delinquencies will rise from what are record lows this year .
As a result , income for commercial - property owners will be under pressure and tenant demand is likely to decline for all categories except apartments , which could continue to benefit from the woes in the for - sale housing market , he said .
" The one saving grace for real estate is that development has been somewhat constrained , so overbuilding wo n't be the problem it was in previous downturns , " Blank said .
Developers , he said , " may as well head to the golf course next year " because there wo n't be money to build much of anything .
Prospects in decline
Of the 50 metropolitan markets tracked in " Emerging Trends , " only two -- Houston and Dallas -- are rated as better opportunities for 2009 than for 2008 .
Those two cities " have been energized by oil , " Miller said , but with crude prices having fallen recently , even their ratings could tumble next year .
Coastal cities rank as the top investment and development markets in this troubled environment , with metro areas sporting 24/7 lifestyles and gateway shipping and transportation faring best .
Suburbs and second - tier cities will bear the brunt of the commercial downturn , Miller predicted .
It will be at least 2011 before markets begin a slow recovery , but things could get much worse before they get better , Blank and Miller believe , depending on the overall economic picture .
" It all depends on the economy , " Miller said .
" And we need a jolt . "
Top 10 regional markets to watch in 2009

The Puget Sound ports are No. 1 among industrials .
San Francisco .
The city ranks first for development and home building , and is a leading " buy " city for apartments and office .
Washington , D.C.
The nation 's capital is the ultimate hold market when the economy struggles : Downtown office vacancies should remain below 10 % , and apartments lease no matter what .
New York .
The Big Apple takes a beating with the Wall Street job losses and office vacancies , but hotels benefit from foreign tourists and the city retains a core of wealthy residents .

Inland Empire homebuilders continue to grapple with the housing collapse .
Houston .
The city stays relatively strong as long as energy stays hot .
Boston .
The job outlook there is more favorable than most cities , with financial district office space tight .
Denver .
A major federal government presence should buffer job losses .

8 - Yr - Old Boy Shoots Self at Gun Show Christopher Bizilj was testing a 9 mm Micro Uzi when he shot and killed himself .
Oct. 27 , 2008  --
With his father and a firearms instructor standing nearby , an 8 - year - old Connecticut boy shot himself in the head with a submachine gun yesterday , killing himself in an accident some say should never have happened .
Christopher Bizilj was testing a 9 mm Micro Uzi at the Westfield Sportsman 's Club in Westfield , Mass . , as part of the Machine Gun Shoot and Firearms Expo , when he shot himself Sunday .
" The firearm instructor prepped the weapon for him , and once it was ready he handed it to the child , " Westfield Police Lt. Hipolito Nunez told ABCNews.com today .
Christopher then pulled the trigger , and the gun 's recoil pulled the barrel upward , causing a round to hit him on the right side of his head , according Nunez .
He was pronounced dead a short time later at Baystate Medical Center in nearby Springfield .
Massachusetts law allows a child to fire a gun with parental consent , so long as there 's an active permit for the gun and a licensed firearm instructor is supervising .
It is unclear whether the gun had a permit or whether the instructor was licensed , but Nunez said Christopher 's father was nearby .
Christopher 's family , including his father , Dr. Charles Bizilj , who is the director of emergency medicine at Johnson Memorial Hospital in Stafford Springs , Conn. , could not be reached for comment .
But according to Ted Oven , a gun retailer and president of the Massachusetts Association of Firearms Dealers , Christopher should have never been allowed to handle a submachine gun on his own .
Oven has shot similar weapons and said the recoil is tough to control even for an adult .
" It requires all my strength , " said Oven , who added that he did not have much experience with the Micro Uzi .
" For an 8 - year - old , it was inappropriate . "
The Micro Uzi , he said , is a tough gun to get a permit for and retails for several thousand dollars .
He was not at the expo when Christopher was shot but said that because the gun is fully automatic , it likely shot off several rounds in a couple of seconds when the boy pulled the trigger .
Information found on Uzitalk.com , an Internet forum dedicated to the Israeli - made submachine guns , described the Micro Uzi as coming on the market in 1986 and having the capability to fire 25 rounds in less than 30 seconds .
The guns , manufactured by Israeli Military Industries Ltd. , are generally designed for military and police use .
' No Permits or Licenses Required '
The flier for the expo advertised that it was " all legal and fun -- no permits or licenses required . "
Targets listed on the flier included pumpkins , vehicles and " other fun stuff we can't print here ! "
The Boston Field Division of the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives is investigating the accident along with the Westfield Police , Massachusetts State Police and the Hampden County District Attorney 's Office .
James McNally , spokesman for the ATF 's Boston division declined to comment until more information was available , but said " it 's been awful . "
Susan Gates , general counsel for the Washington , D.C. - based Children 's Defense Fund , said the shooting in Westfield was a tragic reminder that there is not enough being done in the U.S. to keep guns out of children 's hands .
" It just continues to illustrate why children should not have access to any type of gun , " Gates said .
Most children killed by guns handled them in their homes , and accidents at expos and shooting ranges are much less common , according to Gates .
But even though Massachusetts law , and those of many other states , allow children to shoot weapons in a controlled environment , the Children 's Defense Fund 's policy is that those laws are n't strong enough .
" It is so dangerous , as well seen by this incident , to handle any type of loaded gun , never mind a loaded Uzi , " Gates said .
William Hockla has lived across the street from Biziljs for years and said Christopher was very bright and active .
He heard about the shooting on the radio this morning .
" I was hoping it was n't true , " he said .
He described Charles Bizilj and his wife Suzanne as involved parents who took their two boys camping , fishing and skiing .
" They were very polite , well - groomed , " he said .
" Terrific boys . "
I settled into the corner as the noise lowered and the debate started .
Palin launched into her charm offensive  winking , smiling , dodging questions and speaking in her signature Sarah - phonics , a mash up of sentence fragments and colloquialisms glued together with misplaced also ’s and there ’s  gibberish really .
Everyone in the bar lapped it up .
It was The Sarah Palin Show .
As it became clear that she was n’t going to implode , I started to see the debate instead as The Joe Biden Show .
And , it was good .
Through the booing and hissing , I saw a strong , authoritative , confident and sensitive candidate emerge .
On the whole , he came across as intelligent and relatable ; a real person .
That ’s a quality that often eludes Barack Obama .
Biden ’s job in many ways was to reintroduce himself to Americans .
Palin had stolen the spotlight , and he was campaigning in the shadows .
The media was ignoring him .
Voters did n’t know him .
In a recent New York Times / CBS News poll , 32 percent of Democrats , 38 percent of independents and 41 percent of Republicans said they did n’t know or had no answer when asked to say what they most liked about Biden .
Overview
Barack Obama leads John McCain by a 52 % to 36 % margin in Pew ’s latest nationwide survey of 1,325 registered voters .
This is the fourth consecutive survey that has found support for the Republican candidate edging down .
In contrast , since early October weekly Pew surveys have shown about the same number of respondents saying they back Obama .
When the sample is narrowed to those most likely to vote , Obama leads by 53 % to 38 % .
A breakdown of voting intentions by demographic groups shows that since mid- September , McCain ’s support has declined significantly across most voting blocs .
Currently , McCain holds a statistically significant advantage only among white evangelical Protestants ( aside from Republicans ) .
In addition , Obama runs nearly even with McCain in the so - called red states , all of which George W. Bush won in 2004 .
Just as ominous for the Republican candidate , Obama holds a 53 % to 34 % lead among the sizable minority of voters ( 15 % ) who say they have already voted .
Among those who plan to vote early but have not yet voted ( 16 % of voters ) , 56 % support Obama , while 37 % support McCain .
While Obama ’s support levels have not increased much in recent weeks , a growing percentage of his backers now say they support him strongly .
Currently , 74 % of Obama voters say they support him strongly , up from 65 % in mid-September .
A much smaller majority of McCain backers ( 56 % ) say they support him strongly , which is largely unchanged from mid-September .
The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , conducted Oct. 23 - 26 among 1,500 adults interviewed on landline and cell phones , for the first time includes minor - party candidates Ralph Nader and Bob Barr .
Few voters support either candidate , and their inclusion does not substantially affect the margins of support in the Obama - McCain race .
The survey finds that the proportion of Americans who disapprove of Bush ’s job performance has hit a new high in a Pew survey ( 70 % ) ; just 22 % now approve of the way Bush is handling his job .
Since January , when Bush ’s job rating was already quite low , at 31 % , his approval mark has declined by nine points .
As disapproval of President Bush ’s job performance has edged upward , fewer voters say that McCain would take the country in a different direction from Bush ’s .
Currently , more voters say McCain would continue Bush ’s policies than say he would take the country in a different direction ( 47 % vs. 40 % ) .
Just a week ago ( Oct. 16-19 ) , voters were divided over whether McCain would continue Bush ’s policies or not ( 44 % continue , 45 % take new direction ) .
Favorable ratings for the Republican Party , which rose sharply following the party ’s convention in early September , have declined to about their previous levels .
Currently , 50 % say they have an unfavorable opinion of the GOP , while 40 % express a favorable opinion of the party ; in mid-September , about as many had a favorable opinion of the Republican Party as an unfavorable one ( 47 % favorable vs. 46 % unfavorable ) .
By contrast , a solid majority ( 57 % ) continues to express a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party , while 33 % have an unfavorable impression .
Majorities have expressed positive opinions of the Democratic Party for the past two years ( since October 2006 ) .
Obama - McCain Matchup
Coming out of the party conventions in September , Obama and McCain were running even .
As the campaign enters the final stretch , Obama maintains a solid lead over McCain , with few significant changes since mid-October among key voter groups .
In mid-September ( Sept. 9 - 14 ) , McCain held significant advantages among those earning more than $ 75,000 a year , white evangelical Protestants , whites who have not completed college , and white men .
Today , he maintains a significant advantage only among white evangelical voters , and has lost the lead or seen it shrink in most other categories .
For example , among voters earning $ 75,000 a year or more , McCain held a 53 % to 39 % advantage in the Sept. 9 - 14 survey .
Now , Obama leads by 52 % to 41 % .
After the conventions , McCain held a 52 % to 38 % edge among white voters .
Today , he and Obama are running evenly at 44 % each .
In September , McCain held a 56 % to 34 % advantage among white respondents with some college education .
Now , the candidates tally 46 % each .
Meanwhile , the latest survey shows Obama continuing to dominate among his core support groups .
Nearly seven - in - ten voters younger than 30 ( 68 % ) say they support the Illinois senator , compared to 24 % who say they support McCain .
Among women , Obama leads by 20 points ( 54 % to 34 % ) .
Fewer See McCain Taking ‘ New Direction ’
Since last spring , American voters have been divided over whether McCain would continue President Bush ’s policies or take the country in a new direction , should the Republican nominee become president .
In the current survey , however , a plurality of voters ( 47 % ) say the Republican nominee would continue Bush ’s polices while four - in - ten say McCain would take the country in a new direction .
Independent voters have become substantially more likely to say McCain would continue Bush ’s policies ( 37 % in mid-October , 48 % now ) than to say he would take the country in a new direction ( 50 % in mid-October , 38 % now ) .
By comparison , there have been no significant changes in opinion among Republican voters or Democratic voters :
The vast majority of Republican voters ( 74 % ) say McCain would take the country in a different direction , while nearly as many Democratic voters ( 69 % ) say he would continue Bush ’s policies .
Half of voters say that , if elected , McCain “ would do too much for wealthy Americans . ”
Far fewer – just 17 % – believe that Obama “ would do too much for African Americans ” if he is elected .
These opinions are largely unchanged since mid-September .
Whites who have not completed college are more likely than white college graduates to say that Obama would do too much for blacks ( 24 % vs. 8 % ) .
Nearly half of whites ( 46 % ) who have not finished college say that McCain would do too much for the wealthy .
Among all white voters , 19 % say , if elected , Obama would do too much for blacks ; roughly twice as many ( 39 % ) say that McCain , if he is elected , would do too much for the wealthy .
Who Are The Undecideds ?
A week before the election , nearly one - in ten voters ( 8 % ) remain undecided in their choice for president and there is little to suggest that these voters will move strongly to one candidate or the other on election day .
When undecided voters are asked whether there is a chance they might vote for McCain or for Obama , only 14 % indicate a preference for one candidate over the other ( 7 % for McCain and 7 % for Obama ) .
More than three - quarters ( 78 % ) of the undecideds continue to express uncertainty : about three - in - ten ( 29 % ) say they might vote for either of the two candidates , while almost half ( 49 % ) say that they do not know if there ’s a chance they might vote for either Obama or McCain .
The remaining 8 % say they will vote for neither candidate .
Undecided voters are less educated , less affluent , and somewhat more likely to be female than the average voter .
Nearly half of undecided voters ( 48 % ) s
ay they attend religious services at least weekly , which is same as the proportion of McCain supporters .
Fewer Obama supporters ( 31 % ) say theyattend religious services at least once a week .
On most issues , the positions held by undecided voters fall between those of Obama and McCain supporters , although they are somewhat more similar to McCain supporters on the issue of illegal immigration .
Overall , these voters are more likely than supporters of either candidate to say they do n’t have an opinion about most issues .
Undecided voters do clearly distinguish themselves from supporters of both McCain and Obama in their lower levels of participation and interest in this election , and partisan politics in general .
A majority ( 51 % ) of undecideds do not identify with either the Republican or Democratic parties and fewer than half ( 48 % ) report having voted in the primaries this year ; by contrast , 63 % of both Obama and McCain supporters say they voted in a primary .
Fewer than four - in - ten undecided voters ( 37 % ) say they are following news about the election very closely .
By contrast , majorities of both Obama supporters ( 56 % ) and McCain supporters ( 55 % ) say they are tracking election news very closely .
AJAXWorld A group pushing interoperability between competing AJAX tools and widgets has claimed a wave of certification , although results are far from clear .
The OpenAjax Alliance Monday claimed the " successful interoperability of two key technologies with more than a dozen AJAX products " .
The technologies in question are an Alliance Metadata 1.0 specification that theoretically lets competing AJAX tools share similar capabilities , such as drag - and - drop , while also defining what exactly a mashable widget looks like .
The Alliance was also touting its Hub 1.1 that isolates widgets used in a mashup for greater security and manages communications .
The Hub will be delivered as an open specification and a " commercial - grade " open source reference implementation .
The Alliance Monday named Adobe , Aptana , the Dojo Foundation , the Eclipse Foundation , Google , IBM , ILOG , Lightstreamer , Nexaweb , ProgrammableWeb , SAP , and TIBCO as all having received interoperability awards .
Who and what is certified , though , is uncertain .
Officially it seems just Adobe and Dojo have delivered something tangible .
Adobe said it has used OpenAjax Metadata as Dreamweaver 's native format for defining AJAX widgets while Dojo said " many widgets " in the Dijit project support OpenAjax Metadata .
Pressed by AJAXWorld delegates , though , OpenAjax Alliance leader John Ferraiolo said Adobe and Dojo had released " sample widgets , " indicating what they 'd offered was not as comprehensive as the official release suggested .
Eclipse and IBM committed to " future support " for the metadata specification in their respective JavaScript Development Toolkit ( JSDT ) and the Rational Application Developer ( RAD ) tools .
Lightstreamer and ILOG - in the process of being purchased by IBM - claimed to have " demonstrated compliance " but did n't go into details .
That left Aptana , Google , Nexaweb , ProgrammableWeb , SAP , and Tibco offering platitudes and slaps on the back about their participation in the process , and the merits of openness , without saying what they 'd certified or what their plans were .
It 's the latest curious chapter in the life of an organization that saw a rush of organizations sign up , but seems to stimulate little but apathy on an industry level .
The group 's wishlist of AJAX features for browsers this year only received a surge of interested following our reports of how members were ignoring the project .
Ferraiolo told AJAXWorld Scalable Vector Graphics was the number - one request for browsers on that wishlist , a request he called " a hit " with Alliance member Microsoft .
Looking ahead , Ferraiolo said the Alliance planned more work on communications and security for AJAX - based mashups .
The Alliance will focus next on messaging between widgets and on single sign on for people to log into different AJAX - based services in different domains securely without needing to re-enter different user names and passwords .
He did not put a date on either . ®
Embedding a Python Shell in a Python Script
I am huge of advocate of command - line programs and domain specific languages .
Back when I worked in statistical genetics , there were many fine programs that ran this way , allowing for easily repeatable analysis* , and easy scripting .
Python has some great tools for creating programs driven by mini-languages ( such as the cmd module ) , but they seem to date from a kinder , gentler time when people took what they could get for documentation , and they liked it .
Finding simple examples of how they work is tough **.
I ’m sure in some future post , I ’ll tackle this in more depth , but for now I want to focus on a simpler problem : embedding python shells into python scripts .
Should be trivial , right ?
IDLE exists , and python comes with a bundled interpreter .
Searching for help here fails because “ embedding a python shell ” calls up documentation on how to get a shell in C environments , which is not what I mean at all .
How often has it happened that there is some complex script that one wants to introspect , partway through , maybe after some data structures are created or loaded ?
A typical solution is something like :
if flag : import pdb pdb.set_trace ( )
This is fine and dandy , except that it ’s not always “ debugging ” that one wants to do .
Sometimes one wants to explore data , or gods forbid , enter new code as an experiment .
I read Rick Muller ’s recipe about how to embed a code .
InteractiveConsole into a python script , and I thought I could do a little better .
The following snippet shows how a -- shell command line flag ( read using optparse ) drops the user into a shell , using IPython if it ’s available , or falling back on code .***
#!/usr/bin/python ## filename : cmdDriven.py import sys # some imports , data , and like , so we have something to explore Info = dict ( author = " Gregg Lind " , blog= " Write - Only " ) data1 = set ( range ( 100 ) ) def tickle ( foo , willing =False ) : if willing : return " %s just got tickled " % foo else : return " I do n't think %s would like that so well " % foo if __name__ == " __main__ " : from optparse import OptionParser parser = OptionParser ( ) parser.add_option ('-- shell ' , action = " store_true " , default =False , help = ' get an ( ipython ) shell to explore the data before output ' ) ( options , args ) = parser.parse_args ( ) if options .
shell : try : from IPython .
Shell import IPShellEmbed ipshell = IPShellEmbed ( argv= ['' ] , banner = " hello ! " , exit_msg= " Goodbye " ) ipshell ( ) except ImportError : import code # calling this with globals ensures we can see the environment shell = code .
InteractiveConsole( globals ( ) ) shell.interact ( ) else : sys.exit( " No shell requested " )
One of the nice benefits to this coding pattern is that we can do bash scripting using this quite easily :
$ python cmdDriven.py -- shell << JUNK
> print Info
> print tickle ( " bob " )
> JUNK

This is one of the most creative uses for an iphone I ’ve seen so far .
RjDj is an iphone / ipod app that uses your motion and the sound occurring naturally around you to make music .
The application takes samples through the built - in microphone and uses input from the accelerometer and produces songs .
This is remarkable because it ’s not just a new way of making music – it ’s a whole new music GENRE – “ reactive ” music .
This reactive music even uses a different form of arranging called “ scenes ” which have no definite beginning nor end .
The music is a product of the environment and even the listener themselves .
People who have tried this new app describe it as very addictive and almost like being on some sort of digital pill .
It also can cause mind twisting hearing sensations which affect the listeners sensory perception .
This opens up all sorts of possibilities .
I ’m excited to see what else comes from this .

AP
WITH an investment bank failing , an insurance giant needing a bail - out , the Dow tumbling and panic gripping Wall Street , Barack Obama spoke graciously about his opponent .
“ I certainly do n't fault Senator [ John ] McCain for these problems , ” he said .
He also refrained from blaming him for global warming and Hurricane Ike .
But he did fault Mr McCain for his economic philosophy , “ a philosophy that says even common - sense regulations are unnecessary and unwise , and one that says we should just stick our heads in the sand and ignore economic problems until they spiral into crises . ”
Both candidates doubtless wish to tackle the crisis .
But they cannot , since neither will be in charge until January and the crisis must be tackled immediately .
So each is trying to sound as if he would knock some sense into Wall Street , while tut - tutting that the other fellow supported the policies that got America into this mess in the first place .
Mr Obama has the immense advantage that voters tend to blame the party in the White House for bad news .
His campaign has looked sickly in the past few weeks , since Mr McCain picked Alaska 's Governor Sarah Palin as his running - mate and then surged ahead in the polls .
As the American financial system stumbles , however , Mr Obama is catching up .
A poll of polls by RealClearPolitics.com , a political website , now puts Mr McCain less than a percentage point ahead .
Mr Obama contends that the nightmare on Wall Street was caused by financial deregulation of the sort Mr McCain has long championed .
This is partly true .
Lax oversight did indeed allow financial firms to borrow far more than was prudent to make bets that have now gone sour .
Tougher regulations might have prevented this .
Mr Obama reminded voters in Colorado on September 16th that Mr McCain recently said : “ I 'm always for less regulation . ”
Now the Republican candidate says he favours stricter regulations , though he provides few details .
The Obama campaign also contends that Mr McCain is so rich ( his wife is worth an estimated $ 100 m ) that he does not understand the woes of cash - strapped ordinary Americans .
Mr McCain does not help his case by saying things like “ the fundamentals of our economy are strong ” .
That may be true , depending on how you define “ fundamentals ” , but it does not sound empathetic .
Joe Biden , Mr Obama 's running - mate , scoffed that “ I could walk from here [ St Clair Shores , Michigan ] to Lansing [ about 94 miles , or 151 km ] , and I would n't run into a single person who thought our economy was doing well , unless I ran into John McCain . ”
Mr Obama insinuates that Mr McCain cannot be trusted to deal with the crisis because his strings are pulled by lobbyists , who “ shred consumer protections and distort our economy so it works for the special interests ” .
Or , as Mr Biden put it : “ The very few wealthy and powerful have a seat at the table and everybody else is on the menu . ”
It is true that the financial , insurance and real - estate industries have donated $ 22 m to Mr McCain 's campaign .
But they have given $ 25 m to Mr Obama .
Finally , the Obama campaign suggests that the 72 - year - old Mr McCain is too doddery to understand the doohickeys that modern bankers ( and others ) use .
A campaign ad says he “ does n't know how to use a computer , ca n't send an e-mail ” .
Mr McCain admits that he gets others to call up websites for him .
One reason is that the injuries he sustained as a prisoner of war make it painful for him to type .
Mr McCain 's first response to the crisis was to rage about the “ reckless conduct , corruption and unbridled greed ” that he says caused it .
He fumed that when financial firms collapse , only the bosses seem to escape the consequences .
Under a McCain presidency , he promised , “ we 're not going to tolerate that any more . ”
Mr Obama said that no one should trust Mr McCain 's promise to establish proper oversight of Wall Street because “ he has shown time and again that he does not believe in it ” .
The truth is more confusing .
Mr McCain 's instinct to give markets free rein has always tussled with his Teddy Roosevelt - like suspicion of over - mighty corporations .
The confusion is compounded by his obvious lack of interest in , or knowledge of , the nuts and bolts of finance .
His main concrete proposal this week was to set up a commission to study what caused the current crisis and recommend reforms to prevent another one .
Mr Obama sounded more at ease as he reiterated the principles by which he would regulate the American financial system .
First , he said , any financial institution that can borrow from the government should be subject to stricter government oversight .
Second , he would strengthen capital requirements and demand better disclosure of risks and obligations that firms hide off their balance sheets .
Third , he would streamline regulatory agencies .
Fourth , he would regulate institutions for what they do , not what they are .
For example , mortgages should be subject to the same rules whether offered by a bank or a mortgage - broker .
Fifth , he would crack down on market manipulation .
And sixth , he would establish a process to identify systemic risks before they explode .
Mr McCain 's strongest point this week was one he made only briefly , when he drew attention to the other big factor behind the meltdown : the two government - sponsored mortgage giants , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
These two firms own or guarantee about half the home loans in America .
Until they almost collapsed and had to be ( mostly ) taken over by the government earlier this month , they were a ghastly hybrid .
The government implicitly guaranteed their creditworthiness , enabling them to borrow at below - market rates .
But private shareholders pocketed the profits they made lending this cheap money at higher interest rates .
Fannie and Freddie were supposed to make it easier for creditworthy borrowers to buy homes .
But most of the implicit subsidy went to shareholders .
And since managers knew they could rely on the government to bail them out , they expanded recklessly , contributing to the property bubble that has now burst .
The cost of Fannie 's and Freddie 's bail - out , which could be huge , will be borne by taxpayers .
The blame rests with Democrats and Republicans in Congress , who encouraged Fanny and Freddie to keep growing , not least because the firms lobbied them so lavishly .
Both Mr McCain and Mr Obama said some time ago that trouble was brewing , but they offer different solutions .
Mr McCain argues that both institutions should eventually be disbanded .
Mr Obama thinks they can be reformed , and wants to go on pumping public money into the housing market .
Mr McCain notes that Mr Obama took more donations from Fannie and Freddie than any politician bar the chairman of the committee they answer to .
“ That 's not change , ” he said .
“ That 's what 's broken in Washington . ”

Extreme makeover : computer science edition
L.A. Cicero Siddharth Batra , graduate student in computer science , places the Stanford logo onto a wall of the Hewlett Teaching Center using software that can embed graphics into a video — images , photos or even another video .
Suppose you have a cherished home video , taken at your birthday party .
You 're fond of the video , but your viewing experience is marred by one small , troubling detail .
There in the video , framed and hanging on the living room wall amidst the celebration , is a color photograph of your former significant other .
Bummer .
But what if you could somehow reach inside the video and swap the offending photo for a snapshot of your current love ?
How perfect would that be ?
A group of Stanford University researchers specializing in artificial intelligence have developed software that makes such a switch relatively simple .
The researchers , computer science graduate students Ashutosh Saxena and Siddharth Batra , and Assistant Professor Andrew Ng , see interesting potential for the technology they call ZunaVision .
They say a user of the software can easily plunk an image on almost any planar surface in a video , whether wall , floor or ceiling .
And the embedded images do n't have to be still photos — you can insert a video inside a video .
Here 's the opportunity to sing karaoke side - by - side with your favorite American Idol celebrity and post the video to YouTube .
Or preview a virtual copy of a painting on your wall before you buy .
Or liven up those dull vacation videos .
There is also a potential financial aspect to the technology .
The researchers suggest that anyone with a video camera might earn some spending money by agreeing to have unobtrusive corporate logos placed inside their videos before they are posted online .
The person who shot the video , and the company handling the business arrangements , would be paid per view , in a fashion analogous to Google AdSense , which pays websites to run small ads .
The embedding technology is driven by an algorithm that first analyzes the video , with special attention paid to the section of the scene where the new image will be placed .
The color , texture and lighting of the new image are subtly altered to blend in with the surroundings .
Shadows seen in the original video will be seen in the added image as well .
The result is a photo or video that appears to be an integral part of the original scene , rather than a sticker pasted artificially on the video .
For the algorithm ( " 3D Surface Tracker Technology " ) to produce these realistic results , it also must deal with what researchers call " occluding objects " in the video .
In our birthday video , an " occluding object " might be a partygoer walking in front of the newly hung photo .
The algorithm can handle most such objects by keeping track of which pixels belong to the photo and which belong to the person walking in the foreground ; the photo disappears behind the person walking by and then reappears , just as in the original video .
Camera motion gives the algorithm another item to digest .
As the camera pans and zooms , the portion of the wall containing the embedded object moves and changes shape .
The embedded image must keep up with this shape - shifting geometry , or the video may go one direction while the embedded image goes another .
To prevent such mishaps , the algorithm builds a model , pixel by pixel , of the area of interest in the video .
" If the lighting begins to change with the motion of the video or the sun or the shadows , we keep a belief of what it will look like in the next frame .
This is how we track with very high sub - pixel accuracy , " Batra said .
It 's as if the embedded image makes an educated guess of where the wall is going next , and hurries to keep up .
Other technologies can perform these tricks — witness the spectacular special effects in movies and the virtual first - down lines on televised football games — but the Stanford researchers say the existing systems are expensive , time consuming and require considerable expertise .
Some of the recent Stanford work grew out of an earlier project , Make3D , a website that converts a single still photograph into a brief 3D video .
It works by finding planes in the photo and computing their distance from the camera , relative to each other .
" That means , given a single image , our algorithm can figure out which parts are in the front and which parts are in the background , " said Saxena .
" Now we have extended this technology to videos . "
The researchers realize that their technology will be used in unpredictable ways , but they have some guesses .
" Suppose you 're a student living in a dorm and suppose you want to show it to your parents [ in a video ] .
You can put a nice poster there of Albert Einstein , " Batra said .
" But if you want to show it to your friends , you can have a Playboy poster there . "
A hands - on demonstration of the technology can be seen at http://zunavision.stanford.edu.

PFOX spouts some CRAP , BULL
by Jeremy Hooper
When we first received word that Regina Griggs and her PFOX organization are suing the Washington DC Office of Human Rights " for failing to protect former homosexuals under its sexual orientation anti-discrimination law , " we basically wrote it off as a wacky stunt .
After all , " ex - gay " is not an accepted sexual orientation in any field of study , so it 's absurd to suggest that this group should be a protected class .
And if " ex - gays " are straight - identified , then they , like anyone in possession of any credibly recognized sexual orientation , would fall under a " sexual orientation " classification in the the DC Human Rights Act .
Well , after a brief e-conversation with someone at PFOX ( presumably Regina Griggs ) , we see that the suit is not only wacky -- it 's backers also possess a complete and utter failure to understand sexual orientation law .
Check it out :
This is a lie .
A complete and utter lie .
If anyone is being discriminated against on the basis of their heterosexual orientation , they have just as much right to forth a case !
Heterosexuals do n't typically have as much need to utilize such policies , but it does n't change the fact that they can if needed .
Regina would know this if she would actually listen to to what gays and allies have been saying about sexual orientation protections .
But instead , she and her " pro-family " peeps have dedicated their mental facilities to propagating the lie that gays are in search of " special rights . "
PFOX "s suit ?
P-FLAWED & P-FRIVOLOUS !
Your thoughts
Jeremy , I know there have been cases of hets bringing suit under sexual orientation laws .
Why do n't you email her some citations and links regarding those and see what she says ?
At the very least , it should be worth a chuckle or two .

Good lord I am so annoyed that the anti-gay activists always misunderstand what " sexual orientation " means .
They seem to think that " sexual orientation " is code for " LGBTQ " when it actually applies to straights , gays , asexuals , bisexuals , and lesbians .
I 'm not sure if it applies to Transfolk or not .
On the other hand , when they do understand that it applies to more than gays , they immediately assume it applies to pedophiles , polygamists , zoophiles , and necrophiliacs , but not ( somehow ) to vanilla straight folks .
Posted by : Jason D | Oct 15 , 2008 12:05:39 PM
Jason : Based on my admittedly limited exposure to trans issues , it 's my understanding that transexuality is not a sexual orientation .
The few transfolk I have known still consider their sexual orienation to be gay / lesbian , straight , or bisexual -- which they define based on the gender they identify with , of course .
Like I said , though , this is based on my admittedly limited experiences .
It could be a mistake for me to generalize based on those experiences .

Regina Griggs is a perfect example of why EVERY American needs health insurance ; either she 's out of her meds when she goes pulling these stunts quarterly - or she needs to hurry up and make her first appointment .
Posted by : Scott | Oct 15 , 2008 2:01:47 PM
I think that they should change their name to PFUG ( Parents and Friends of Un - Gays ) !
But on the topic , I think it would be reasonable to request specific citing of cases where UnGays have been beaten and / or left for dead simply because they were UnGay .
And any actual police reports that have been made which detail harassment , intimidation or bullying that any of the UnGays have encountered that was directly related to their sexual identity .
In their case , their " sexual " identity is truly CHOSEN , but even a CHOSEN identity should have equal protections .
If they are being harassed , then they deserve to be protected by legislation , and there is no legitimate reason why the organizations providing protection would single them out as not being protected .
I suspect that they are just lying and pulling a stunt in an attempt to delegitimize the cause of bias related crimes initiatives .

Fox 's Kilmeade :
Why is no one looking for Obama 's drug dealer ?
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday October 20 , 2008
Print This Email
This A dirt - digging article about Cindy McCain which ran in the New York Times on Saturday has outraged the McCain campaign and has struck even critics on the left as pointless and intrusive .
Salon 's Glenn Greenwald described the article as " just generally dissecting her private and emotional sphere for no apparent reason beyond idle voyeurism , " pointing out that the writer had even trolled Facebook in order to contact adolescent classmates of Bridget McCain .
The hosts of Fox and Friends also raked over the Times article on Monday , with Brian Kilmeade suggesting , " Would you say at the very least it 's a little aggressive as compared to , maybe , picking up Barack Obama 's biography ?
...
In there , he talks about buying drugs .
Why not try to find that drug dealer ?
... Why not find out more about one of the Obamas , like Michelle Obama ? "
Kilmeade was echoing Cindy McCain 's attorney , John Dowd , who complained about the forthcoming article in a letter ( pdf ) to the Times earlier this month , writing , " It is worth noting that you have not employed your investigative assets looking into Michelle Obama .
You have not tried to find Barack Obama 's drug dealer that he wrote about in his book . "
Dowd formerly represented John McCain during the Keating 5 scandal in 1990 - 91 and was also Monica Goodling 's attorney last year when she attempted to avoid testifying in the US Attorney scandal .
Steve Doocy agreed with Kilmeade that it seems strange nobody in the media has made any apparent attempt to research Barack Obama 's use of marijuana and cocaine as a teenager in the 1970's .
" Have you heard any stories about any of those people who did drugs with him ? "
Doocy asked .
" Have we heard anything about any of those people ?
Absolutely not . "
As he spoke , a banner on the screen helpfully asked " Need to cancel NY Times ? " and provided an 800 number .
When Doocy raised the issue again with several Fox pundits in a follow - up segment during the next hour , National Review editor Rich Lowry asserted that a double standard must be in effect , because George Bush 's " alleged cocaine use ... was an obsession of the media in 2000 . "
" Barack Obama has come clean and admitted to it , " countered Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky , " whereas George Bush never did . "
Although there was a " two - week frenzy " in the summer of 1999 over Bush 's alleged cocaine use , followed by occasional attempts to raise the issue during the 2000 campaign , it was never seriously examined by the media .
Doocy , for his part , ultimately seemed less interested in media double standards than in prying into Obama 's teen drug escapades .
" Let 's hear from some of those guys who sat around and ate all the brownies , " he urged .

Syria has released footage it says is of U.S. helicopters on their way to an attack inside Syrian on Sunday .
The post headline is taken from NBC's Richard Engel in Baghdad , describing special forces crossing the border into Syria on Sunday , the first time U.S. forces have invaded Syrian territory in all these years occupying Iraq .
The U.S. military , in an officially unofficial leak to the AP , are claiming hot pursuit of Al Qaeda fighters out of Iraq and have said little else about it other than that the U.S. is " taking matters into its own hands " .
Syrian eyewitnesses are claiming that US forces shot and killed seven men and a woman , perhaps even abducting two , while the Syrian government are taking it a step further and alleging children died too .
So far , though , the only funerals that have been held were for the seven dead men , which locals and the Syrian authorities say were simply construction workers ( and which Fox News ' Mike Tobin , pulling faux facts unsupported by evidence or even official U.S. statements out of his ass , says were known Al Qaeda operatives ) .
What is certain among the conflicting reports is that U.S. forces have now ignored international laws and trespassed on sovereign territory in Pakistan and Syria in pursuit of dodgy intelligence , in both cases with reasonably credible reports of civilians wrongly slain .
Technically , these are acts of war and only U.S. military might prevents them becoming so .
We know that Bush has ordered that he must personally approve any incursion into Pakistan , and it seems that he must have done so for this Syrian trespass too , one that is unique in all the time that the U.S. has occupied neighbouring Iraq .
So why ?
Why now ?
Well :
Joshua Landis , an American expert on Syria , commented last night : " The Bush administration must assume that an Obama victory will force Syria to behave nicely in order to win favour with the new administration .
Thus White House analysts may assume that it can have a " freebee " - taking a bit of personal revenge on Syria without the US paying a price . "
There 's also the possibility that this is partly just another attempt at boosting flagging Republican support , since there 's only one hot - head Bush ally running for president who is likely to approve of creating an international incident at such a late stage of the Iraqi occupation .
But it 's a move that is likely to backfire badly in the region .
Arab states , including Iraq , will be angered by this mini-invasion and will point to a continued U.S. prssence in Iraq as destabilizing .
Iran will , of course , back its Syrian ally .
And even Israel wo n't be happy .
As BJ noted , Israel 's been progressing quite well with negotiations involving Syria on Lebanese peace and this incursion will work to derail those negotiations simply because of guilt by association .
Israel also has an election coming up , and a mood of belligerence and instability can only help the hardliners , allies of the neocons who largely steer Bush and McCain 's policy thinking on the region .
It helps the White House , if it is simply after a " freebie " , that all of these incursions are being carried out by U.S. Special Operations forces , which have their own independent command structure ( and an independent budget ) headquartered in the U.S. - allowing Proconsul Petreaus and his subordinates to have some plausible denial of culpability when talking to local officials .
But it 's hardly likely to help long - term strategic planning .
Still , the Bush administration now wants to send thousands more of these troops to Afghanistan , a move that Senator Russ Feingold has said will " only perpetuate a counterproductive game of cat and mouse that has has led to a steep erosion in Afghans ' support for foreign forces . "
These raids are arguably illegal war crimes by international law , destabilizing in and of themselves , counterproductive in the long term , but unlikely to lead to war with either Pakistan or Syria on their own .
However it 's worth thinking about something - Iran appears to be the only possible target nation for such raids that 's been left out so far .
If the Bush administration decide to attempt a " freebie " there , it 's far more doubtful that the blowback will be so containable .
Update : Iran expert Kaveh L Afrasiabi writes at the Asia Times that Iran is spooked .
" The chances are that the US incursion into Syria is a dress rehearsal for action against Iran and the [ Iranian ] Revolutionary Guards [ Corps ] , just as they often portray Israel 's aerial attack on Syrian territory last year as a prelude for an attack on Iran 's nuclear facilities , " said the Tehran political scientist , adding that since the US had already branded Iran 's Guards as terrorists , it had the necessary rationale to do so .
In the event the US indulges in such a gambit , the issue becomes whether it will be a one - shot single incursion or a series of raids and , more important , what will happen should Iran fight back and respond in kind , within Iraq 's territory .
There are serious scenarios for major escalation nested in every micro action and US policymakers would be remiss to focus on their own action without taking into consideration the likely chain reaction that could lead to a regional flare - up .

Faith Hill's First Ever Bikini Photo Shoot
gave herself a special 41st birthday gift this year .
She revved up her exercise routine to three sessions of Pilate 's each week .
That was just the beginning .
She agreed to do a bikini photo shoot for Shape magazine 's December issue .
It is the first time this talented country western musician has posed in a bikini and we must say she 's HOT .
The singer is married to country star Tim McGraw .
He made some disparaging comments about Curb Records , his recording label , after they released another ' greatest hits ' album compilation rather than use any of his new material .
He actually apologized to his fans .
Check out that story here .
Hill is currently working on her 7th studio album which is set to drop in 2009 .
When asked about how she balances a career and her family obligations , she shared that she and Tim never spend more than three consecutive days apart at any given time .
They are the parents of three daughters : Gracie , Maggie and Audrey .
The December issue of Shape will hit newsstands on November 10 , 2008 .

For the general public
Our apologies , but if you are using Browse in version 10.1.1 on XO - 1.5 you may have been directed to this page by mistake .
If so , please go to the 10.1.1 release notes .
The rest of this page relates to version 8.2.0 .
Before you update to this release
If you are in a school or other deployment , make sure you contact your technical support team before updating .
Some deployments have special configurations which will need special steps taken before update .
Your deployment may not yet support this release .
New features in 8.2.0
There is a new Help Activity in this release that includes a full manual on the laptop .
Look for the icon of a Question Mark .
In addition to fixing bugs , we 've added lots of new features to our 8.2 release , including
The new XO manual for release 8.2.0 is available here .
Upgrading from previous releases
For technical details and other upgrade options see olpc-update and Clean - install procedure .
If you run into trouble , see Upgrade troubleshooting , Support FAQ and Support to email our tech support volunteers .
If your XO is connected to the internet
Note that this process may make some of your Activities and the Journal items that depend on them not work - make sure you have backed up any files you want to save !
This process can take more than 30 minutes , much longer if you have a slow internet connection .
Make sure your XO is plugged in , turned on , and connected to the Internet ( you should be able to load http://laptop.org in the Browse Activity ) .
If your XO is not connected to the internet , you will not be able to use this upgrade method .
Open the Terminal Activity .
You can find it by going to the home view ( press the 5th symbol from the left , top row ) , clicking on the little arrow at the bottom right of the screen , and then on the symbol that looks like this one .
In the Terminal Activity , type su - ( lowercase letter 's ' , lowercase letter 'u ' , a space , and a hyphen ) .
Press Enter .
At the " - bash - 3.2 # " prompt type olpc- update 767 .
Press Enter .
You should see text that looks something like this ( sometimes , in addition to the text below , you might get a message about irsync_pristine failing , and that " irsync_dirty " is being tried , this is normal ) :
Downloading contents of build '' {{ : Friends in testing / current image}} '' Updating to version hash '' xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx '' Making clean /versions / updates / xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Trying irsync_pristine update from rsync://updates.laptop.org/'' build-{{:Friends in testing / current image}} '' - Cleaning tree . - Fetching contents .
- Performing incremental rsync .
[ Comment :
Wait a long time !
Could be over an hour depending on your internet connection speed . ]
Verifying update .
Installing update in /versions / {pristine , run} / '' xxxx ' '
6 . At the end of the upgrade , you will either see the words " Installing update in .... " or " Update Succeeded ! " on the screen .
If you see the words " I do n't think you 're connected to the internet . " see the notes below .
7 . Wait for the prompt " - bash - 3.2 # " and type reboot then press Enter to restart your XO .
You will probably hear the little XO tune 2 times , then it will say erasing and a countdown will appear .
Finally it will reboot again , you will hear the tune for a third time .
Now you are ready to go to step 8 .
8 . After your XO reboots , the last step is to download the new versions of Activities .
When the XO boots you will see a bar toward the top of the screen that says " Software Update " and the options being " Cancel " , " Later " and " Check now " .
Before you choose " Check now " to update the activities , you must reconnect your XO to the internet .
You may see the sign - in box appear in home view .
If it does , and it lists your router , you can do it from there .
If it does n't appear or offers the wrong connection , go to the Neighborhood view and connect from there .
Then go back to Home view and then click " Check now " ( it 's ok to leave the home view because when you go back the options should still be there ) .
First the XO will check for any updates and then it asks if you 'd like to install them .
Click " Install selected " to install your newest versions of your activities .
Congratulations , you 've upgraded !
Note :
When upgrading from build 703 or 708 you will not see the Library ( links to science , books , etc links on the left side ) in the Browse home page .
You can re-install the Library as follows : Open the Control Panel and go into Software update .
After it checks for updates , go to " Modify activity groups " and click on the triangle .
Beside " Group URL " type : http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Activities/G1G1 and click the " Add " button .
Click " Refresh " and allow the XO to upload the new updates .
Click on Install selected .
Once it completes , reboot .
If you can browse the Internet ( see step 1 above ) but the olpc - update command returns the error " I do n't think you 're connected to the internet . " , you may need to open TCP port 873 ( rsync ) on your firewall for the outbound connection .
Offline upgrade
You can use another computer that is connected to the internet ( a desktop at home , a computer lab , etc. ) plus a USB storage device ( such as a compatible USB flash drive ) to upgrade your XO .
The way it works is on your non -XO computer you download two files containing the upgrade data , saving them to the USB flash drive ; then you insert the USB flash drive into your XO and trigger its upgrade process .
Note that this process will COMPLETELY erase ALL files on your XO !
Make sure you have backed up any files you want to save !
Plug an empty formatted USB flash drive into the computer that is connected to the internet .
Then , right - click ( Ctrl - click for Mac ) on each of the two URLs below and choose " Save Target As " ( " Save Link As " for Firefox ) .
Save both files to the USB flash drive .
Do not open the files .
http://download.laptop.org/xo-1/custom/g1g1/gg-767-4/fs.zip
( This file contains only instructions for the firmware to update with the following file . )
http://download.laptop.org/xo-1/custom/g1g1/gg-767-4/gg-767-4.img
( This file contains the Sugar platform with the G1G1 2008 set of Activities . )
The first file is about 297 KB , and the second file is quite large ( about 450 MB ) , so they might take a while [ 15 - 20 min. ] to download .
When the download is complete , Eject / Remove the USB flash drive , and unplug it .
After you have finished this step , there should be two files on the USB flash drive , the fs.zip file , and the .img file .
The MD5 checksum for fs.zip is 1bb452e77b7390e00bdd7fdcc7cbc793
The MD5 checksum for gg- 767- 4.img is 3f281dda352d32320879728377b32476
Now , follow the steps below to complete your installation :
Turn off your XO and connect your USB flash drive to it .
Make sure your XO is plugged in .
Hold down all four gamepad keys ( on the right side of the screen , above the power button ) .
While still holding the four gamepad keys , push the power button to turn the XO on .
Keep holding down the four gamepad keys until the message " Release the game key to continue " appears on the screen .
Release the gamepad keys .
If you see a grid of colored boxes on your screen , congratulations !
Your XO is reflashing .
It will take about 10 minutes and your XO will automatically reboot when it is done .
Your XO may reboot twice , playing the little XO tune .
After your XO reboots , the last step is to update to the newest versions of Activities .
When the XO boots you will see a bar toward the top of the screen that says " Software Update " and the options being " Cancel " , " Later " and " Check now " .
Before you choose " Check now " to update the activities , you must reconnect your XO to the internet .
You may see the sign - in box appear in home view .
If it does , and it lists your router , you can do it from there .
If it does n't appear or offers the wrong connection , go to the Neighborhood view and connect from there .
Then go back to Home view and then click " Check now " ( it 's ok to leave the home view because when you go back the options should still be there ) .
First the XO will check for any updates and then it asks if you 'd like to install them .
Click " Install selected " to install the newest versions of your activities .
Congratulations , you 've upgraded !
Now , you should be ready to go .
Have fun !
( If you chose " Later " on the software update , go to the Sugar Control Panel and select the " Software update " when you are ready to install the updates )
Resolved bugs in this release
Many bugs were closed in this release .
A few important ones include :
ticket # 5156 Browse can view Google calendar .
ticket # 5613
The XO name can now accept any characters .
This is important for languages which do not use the ASCII characters .
ticket # 6014
Activities try to save their data when the XO is shut down while an activity is open .
This is better but not complete .
Users should close their activities before shutting down the XO .
ticket # 7480
You can reset your network history in the Network control panel in case you need to remove old configurations .
However , you will need to re-enter all AP passwords after doing this .
For a list of all closed bugs in this release click here .
== Notable open bugs in this release == < nowiki > Insert non-formatted text here </ nowiki >
For the best experience and maximum reliability with the XO we recommend the following best practices :
For all XOs
If you open too many activities ( generally more than 3 ) at once you may experience slow response .
To close activities , use the frame button ( upper right ) , hover over the open activities , and click on close .
In general , you do not need to double click on anything in the XO interface .
It is designed for a single click .
For example , double clicking to launch an activity will cause the XO to launch two instances of the activity which may cause one to fail .
Drag and drop has limited support in this release .
It may work in some cases but it does not work consistently everywhere .
Power save mode is still in development .
In this release it is turned off by default in the control panel .
If you use it and experience problems , please turn it off .
If the XO stops collaborating or stops responding , you can reboot it from the home screen ( hover over the XO in the center ) or hold down the power button for more than 6 seconds .
Ensure that you have unmounted a USB stick before removing it .
Go to the Journal , hover over the USB stick icon and click on ' unmount ' .
Another method to remove a USB stick and avoid corruption is to power down the laptop before removing the USB stick ..
For XOs used in school with many XOs present
Reliable collaboration using the Write activity over mesh or access point networks may not exceed two hours .
If there are a lot of XOs or a lot of wireless traffic ( e.g. many XOs or many access points ) then Write may shut down during collaboration .
In this case you may be able to reconnect Write to the collaboration in the Neighborhood view .
When collaborating over a Mesh ( i.e. XO to XO collaboration with no access point or school server ) you should limit the number of XOs on any channel to 10 .
There are three Mesh channels available ( 1,6 and 11 ) and each should have a maximum of 10 XOs .
More XOs in a channel may cause instability in the collaboration .
Please see the Deployment Support pages for information on collaboration and connectivity in schools or areas that are densely populated with XOs .

The credit crunch and accompanying global recession claimed its most famous sporting victim last night when General Motors , the troubled American carmaker , announced that it was ending its sponsorship deal with the world 's most recognisable athlete , Tiger Woods .
The deal between GM and Woods , said to be worth more than $ 10 m ( £ 6.6 m ) a year to the golfer , had endured for almost a decade and become one of the most visible sponsorship arrangements in sport , not least because Woods ' golf bag had been transformed into an advertisement for Buick , one of the carmaker 's brands .
As part of the deal , the world No1 also took part in television commercials for the budget - priced range of cars - a source of mirth in some circles because Woods is reported to drive a Porsche .
Ironically , during the nine years he has been promoting Buick its sale have reportedly fallen by 58 % - more than any other GM brand .
Senior managers from GM travelled to Washington DC last week to ask Congress for a $ 25 bn ( £ 16.5 bn ) loan in order to stave off the possibility of bankruptcy , although a spokesman for the company said the decision to sever its links with Woods at this time was " purely coincidental " .
He said : " This decision is the result of discussions that started earlier in the year and the timing of this agreement with these other activities is purely coincidental . "
Last week , Buick announced it was also ending its arrangement to provide courtesy cars for players and officials at PGA Tour events in the US .
Woods , who is currently recuperating from knee surgery and is not expected to return to competitive play until next spring , released a statement saying he was proud of his association with the company .
" I have enjoyed being a part of the company 's dramatic product evolution .
We 've had a lot of fun together and I participated in some unique and rewarding activities .
We 've enjoyed a tremendous partnership over the years and we will maintain strong ties , " he said .
Last year Woods also suffered the indignity of losing a sponsorship deal with American Express and yesterday 's announcement will have been a severe blow to his pride .
It will not , however , cause much consternation for his bank manager .
According to Golf Digest magazine , Woods earned more than $ 120 m ( £ 79 m ) in sponsorship deals last year , and he is a constant presence at the top of " world 's richest athlete " lists .

WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
Characters interact socially A couple have divorced after the wife saw the husband having online sex in the virtual world of Second Life .
So how do avatars have sex ?
Wife walks in and finds husband in a compromising position on the sofa with another woman .
Wife feels betrayed .
Wife files for divorce .
Marriage ends .
It 's a familiar scenario in soap operas , but for one married couple it was all too real .
Sort of .
Amy Taylor and David Pollard met in an online chatroom in 2003 , got married and shared their interest in Second Life , a virtual world in which users create avatars to interact with each other .
But the marriage ended after Ms Taylor 's online character saw her husband 's avatar having sex on a sofa with a female prostitute .
THE ANSWER
First characters need to buy genitals Male characters can get aroused and have intercourse with female ones , but graphic depictions are very rudimentary Intercourse is usually represented by an animated sequence
So how do computerised characters have sex ?
" First you need to buy genitals , " says technology journalist Adrian Mars , explaining the process in Second Life .
" You start off with no genitals and then you buy some .
These objects can do all sorts of things .
You can have ones that ejaculate at the right moment .
" But there 's not much in the way of exciting mechanics .
What you see on the screen is what you get and the best you can hope for is a bit of sexual humour , although some people do have intense relationships .
" Obviously the sex is not the same as in real life , but you 're still expressing yourself in a way that would , maybe reasonably , upset a partner . "
Participants can verbally communicate by voice or by typing speech that appears in a bubble above their character .
And although they can use the mouse and keyboard to move their character and pick things up , he says , the on - screen graphic depiction is very rudimentary .
Undressing another character without their consent is not possible .
" You can touch and jiggle about a bit and you can emote and gesture in a way the other person would see .
And you can have intercourse . "
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular feature in the BBC News Magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines Users can make their avatars sit , lie or stand for sex , says Kieron Gillen of gamerzines.com , but the intercourse is usually an animated sequence triggered by a click of the mouse on an interactive " node " , although it depends how they are programmed .
" People customize their avatars with animations and enormous e-phalluses which you can buy .
It 's a player - generated economy and people exchange things they have created - someone builds it , someone buys it and someone puts it into action . "
For people participating in this , he adds , the sexual chat is more important than the avatar having sex , which acts more like a prop to get their imagination going .
And you can forget any notion of sensual touch .
As crude , pixelated representations of humans , avatars can't flex individual muscles , says Gabby Kent , a lecturer in computer games at the University of Teesside .
In Second Life , all the characters are real people somewhere in the world and that 's why there 's always such betrayal felt
Gabby Kent
It would just resemble two clunky - looking characters rubbing their bodies against each other .
These kinds of online worlds are navigated fairly intuitively , she says , so just by clicking on a door could make your avatar walk through it , without the need to move your hand to find the handle .
In a similar way , some games could just have a special sequence cutting in to represent sexual intercourse .
But even those offering the characters more control are unlikely to look very real .
Yet that does n't mean it 's harmless fun .
" In Second Life , all the characters are real people somewhere in the world and that 's why there 's always such betrayal felt , " says Ms Kent .
Antlers
One blogger writing about his experience in Second Life describes the range of male genitalia on offer to buy , including skin colour control , sound , animations , ejaculation , urine and some that are touchable by other players to lead to arousal .
He visited virtual sex shops and sex clubs where he saw people having sex in a number of different ways .
It is only to be expected in a world where players pick every detail of how their avatars will look , says Mr Mars .
" You can design any object .
You can buy your own antlers , for instance .
Sex has become a big thing [ in Second Life ] but I suspect it 's full of teenagers , so that 's no shock . "
Some Second Lifers have been known to misbehave - a US journalist was attacked by flying penises when conducting an interview in his virtual office .
And infidelity is not the only thorny ethical issue thrown up by virtual sexuality - some players have had sex with animals .

Get updates impacting your industry from our GigaOm Research Community
Late last week , my partners and I here at Polaris Ventures hosted a summit for all of our portfolio companies in and around the online advertising sector .
In addition to the some 20 portfolio executives that attended , we brought in a handful of senior industry execs to share their experiences , among them Joe Gillespie , EVP of CBS Interactive CBS / CNET ; Michael Barrett , formerly of Fox Interactive Media ; Carolyn Everson , EVP of MTV Networks ; Scott Kurnit , founder of About.com ; Stewart Bogarty EVP at Universal McCann ; and Polaris entrepreneur - in - residence Brian Grey , who was formerly with Fox Sports Interactive .
Although our meeting had been planned several months ago , the fact that it came on the heels of some highly publicized admonishments by certain VCs to the CEOs of their portfolio companies to slash costs in order to survive the financial crisis provided an interesting backdrop .
In particular , attendees of our summit overwhelmingly agreed that expense cutbacks are only half of the story when it comes to surviving the ad recession — the other half is figuring out how to build revenues .
In no particular order , here are some tips that came out of the meeting :
10 .
Get close to your best customers .
You know who they are .
Be proactive : Double down your efforts to stay close to them and keep them on your customer list .
9 . Figure out how to forecast 2009 .
Get your best sales guys together to figure out who will be spending what .
Which advertisers are going to cut back , which ones will keep spending , which will accelerate to gain share ?
Do n’t forecast from ’08 budgets — build from the bottom up .
And keep revising .
8. Believe in endemics .
If you play in a niche , focus efforts on endemic advertisers that need to be in that niche .
7 . Find brands that are spending to gain share in the downturn .
Yes , most advertisers are pulling back .
But our group of experts have noticed that certain brands are viewing the downturn as an opportunity to gain share of voice , and so are actually spending more .
Go find ‘em .
6 . Turn remnant inventory into premium .
Vanilla ice cream can either be seen as plain ole vanilla ( in other words , remnant ) or , when topped with a cherry and a little whipped cream , part of a sundae ( in other words , premium ) .
The same applies to ad inventory .
One great “ cherry ” is to create events , which advertisers love .
Be creative in crafting events , and then figure out how to recharacterize existing inventory , which ordinarily might be sold as remnant , as part of premium packages around those events .
5 . Start early and aim high .
When selling key sponsors , pitch them early in the creation process so they have a chance to be truly integrated into the program , and aim to get time in with senior execs from both the agency and the client .
4. Remember :
It ’s not about you , it ’s about them .
When pitching an account , remember that it ’s not about your great technology or your brilliant innovation ; it ’s about the brand and their customers .
Create a narrative about how you help them achieve their objectives .
3. ROI , ROI , ROI !
Did I mention ROI ?
An ad recession does n’t so much provoke a flight to quality as it does a flight to what advertisers know works well .
Focus on measuring campaigns to show they work .
2 . Mine your data .
Advertisers love data about what real consumers are doing .
You may not recognize it but you have amazingly rich data about your viewers .
Capture it and share it with your advertisers ( packaged to protect their identity , of course ) .
1 . Hug your stars .
Identify your best people , and make sure they know — and feel — how valuable they truly are .

Barack Obama has held himself out as a bridge builder across even divisive issues .
No topic fits that description more than abortion .
In the final presidential debate Wednesday , Obama had seemingly finished giving his view on abortion when he added these words : Abortion is “ always a tragic situation , ” he said , and we should “ try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth , communicating that sexuality is sacred ... and providing options for adoption and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby .
... Nobody is pro-abortion .
...
We should try to reduce these circumstances . ”
On those words the election may turn .
Some Republicans are telling Catholics that supporting Obama is a sin .
Catholics are instructed not to cast a ballot for an advocate of abortion , but these partisans overstate the church ’s teaching to make an even broader claim :
Namely , that a pro-choice candidate is off - limits too .
Were this true , Obama ’s substantial lead in the polls might be subject to religious preemption among the 25 % to 30 % of voters who are Catholic in such battleground states as Ohio , Pennsylvania , Missouri and Florida .
So can Catholics vote for a pro-choice candidate ?
The answer is yes , but as I found when I publicly endorsed Obama , you ’ve then got “ some ‘ splain ’n ’ to do . ”
It ’s a matter of conscience , but had Obama proclaimed himself to be pro-choice and said nothing more , it would have been problematic .
But there are those additional words about appropriate education as well as adoption and assistance for mothers who choose to keep their baby .
This is not just debate posturing .
It is consistent with Obama ’s successful effort to add language to the Democratic platform affirming the choice of a mother to keep her child by pledging pre- and post-natal care , funded maternity leave and income support for poor women who , studies show , are four times more likely to pursue an abortion absent some tangible assistance .
Some might ask , is n’t John McCain , the self - proclaimed “ pro-lifer , ” still a morally superior choice for Catholics ?
Not necessarily .
McCain ’s commitment , as he stressed in the debate , is to try to reverse Roe vs. Wade .
But Republicans have been after this for decades , and the effort has not saved a single child .
Even if Roe were reversed -- unlikely , in my judgment -- it merely transfers the question to the states , most of which are not expected to ban abortion .
A Catholic serious about preserving life could reasonably find Obama ’s educational and material assistance to mothers the practical , stronger alternative .
Of course , this alternative is less than the absolute legal protection for unborn life sought by the Catholic faith , but it is more than the GOP delivers , or can deliver , with its speculations about judicial vacancies and reconsidered precedents .
And it is reflective of an inescapable truth : While Americans worship
God in differing ways , we are also a nation that seeks a common political ideal .
Pursuit of that goal , too , has shaped Obama ’s campaign , which has sought to lessen the division between red and blue states in order to restore the nation .
Compelled support for one religious view over another , or compelled support for the Supreme Court ’s view , would inevitably leave us divided for years .
The way out is to remember that when there are differences among religious creeds , none is entitled to be given preference in law or policy .
Sometimes the law must simply leave space for the exercise of individual judgment , because our religious or scientific differences of opinion are for the moment too profound to be bridged collectively .
When these differences are great and persistent , as they unfortunately have been on abortion , the common political ideal may consist only of that space .
This does not , of course , leave the right to life undecided or unprotected .
Nor for that matter does the reservation of space for individual determination usurp for Caesar the things that are God ’s , or vice versa .
Rather , it allows this sensitive moral decision to depend on religious freedom and the voice of God as articulated in each individual ’s voluntary embrace of one of many faiths .
Catholics know how to pick presidents .
In the last nine presidential contests , Catholics have been with the popular vote - getter every time .
Where are the Catholics lining up in 2008 ?
A recent Zogby poll has the national Catholic vote as a dead heat within the margin of error .
If Catholic past is prologue , this election will be far closer than general polling suggests , and Obama ’s few additional words in the final debate may prove to be his political salvation .
Douglas W. Kmiec is a law professor and the author of “ Can a Catholic Support Him ?

All star batman and robin the boy wonder
Earlier this week , comic retailers were notified that all copies of All Star Batman And Robin that they receive in this week 's shipments were to be destroyed instead of placed on sale .
No futher explanation was forthcoming - until someone got a hold of a copy , and discovered that a problem with self - censorship had accidentally created a comic too dirty to be sold .
But just how dirty can a Batman comic be ?
Advertisement
Comic Book Resources ' Rich Johnston explained the problem with the latest issue of Sin City creator Frank Miller 's controversial Batman series :
Certain examples of obscene language in the book were , as has happened in the title before , blacked out , sometimes with little bits of the letters sticking out to give a clue as to what they may have been .
Except in the printing process , the lettering was of a richer black that the bars , rendering the blacking out pointless .
Advertisement
He also provided examples of the dialogue that was suddenly legible , including this from the teenaged Batgirl :
Text every friend you 've got , shitheads —
Sell your poison somewhere else .
This arcade belongs to the fucking Batgirl .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
( For fans of the " c " word , do n't worry ; that makes appearances as well . )
It 's hard to work out what the biggest surprise is in this situation :
That they actually put in all those words in the first place as opposed to some placeholders , or that the faulty comics somehow passed the quality control in DC and made it all the way to stores before someone noticed what had gone wrong ?
The real question now , of course , is n't either of those , but how expensive these defective copies will end up on eBay .

Wash Your Mouth Out With Batsoap [ Comic Book Resources ]
Now that Windows 10 Creators Update is finally here , any hope to update to the basic version is completely lost .
Or so , everyone thought .
When Windows 10 was rolled out in 2014 , the deadline for an upgrade was set on 29 July 2016 .
It was meant to encourage people who preferred to stick with Windows 7 or 8 to move on and get 10 .
Unfortunately , not everyone was sold out on Windows 10 , especially because it had some serious problems , including privacy and update concerns .
More , unfortunately , Windows 10 Creators Update is only available to PCs running the basic Windows 10 version , which leaves little hope for those who stuck to their guns and stood by Windows 7 .
Good thing Microsoft offered a workaround to anyone who missed the deadline , deliberately or otherwise , giving them an opportunity to take advantage of the free update .
Otherwise , they would have to pay for a full license .
For a user to update to Windows 10 after the deadline , they must have a valid Windows 7 or 8.1 license .
This is the only and most important requirement .
So , if you ’re running an invalid OS , your hope is likely to be out the window .
The free upgrade to the basic Windows 10 , however , is not available for users running Windows RT , Windows Enterprise , and Windows 8.1 Enterprise , among others .
So even with a window to upgrade to Windows 10 , not everyone will be able to take advantage of it .
Many believe that the reason Microsoft has allowed a free upgrade past the deadline is to boost the response given to the latest Windows 10 Creators Update and to improve the experience of Windows - loyal users .
Besides , if most Windows and Windows - enabled devices will run in Windows 10 in the coming months or years , it is likely that apps and software will be made specifically for the OS , leaving behind other older OS .
So check out the advantages the Windows 10 Creators Update has in store for you .
Over nearly two decades , a serial killer has shot and strangled at least 11 people , often dumping their battered bodies in alleyways of Inglewood and Los Angeles .
Most were black women or girls , the youngest just 14 .
The latest was found last year , shrouded in a garbage bag .
Police have determined through DNA and other evidence that the killings were the work of a single person .
But the DNA does not match any of the millions of genetic profiles of convicted criminals in law enforcement databases , and detectives have few other clues .
Now Los Angeles Police Department investigators want to search the state ’s DNA database again -- not for exact matches but for any profiles similar enough to belong to a parent or sibling .
The hope is that one of those family members might lead detectives to the killer .
This strategy , pioneered in Britain , is poised to become an important crime - fighting tool in the United States .
The Los Angeles case will mark the first major use of California ’s newly approved familial searching policy , the most far - reaching in the nation .
But the idea of scrutinizing families based exclusively on their possible genetic relationship to an unknown suspect makes privacy advocates and legal experts nervous .
They argue that it effectively expands criminal databases to include every offender ’s relatives , a potentially unconstitutional intrusion .
“ There is kind of a queasiness about having the sins of your father come back to haunt you , ” said Stanford University law professor Hank Greely , who supports familial searching despite those concerns .
“ It feels like we ’re holding people responsible for the crimes of their family . ”
Because the technology is n’t perfect , families with no connection to the perpetrator inevitably will be investigated , some scientists and legal experts say .
The FBI and California law enforcement officials long resisted the approach , fearful of inciting legal opposition and a public backlash .
They yielded only after aggressive lobbying by prosecutors , who pointed to some dramatic successes .
In North Carolina , for instance , investigators found a partial match to genetic evidence in a murder - rape case : a man who shared 16 genetic markers with the perpetrator .
He could n’t be the killer -- he ’d have to match on all 26 markers of a typical DNA profile -- but he could be a relative .
Investigators learned the man had a brother who had lived near the crime scene .
They obtained DNA surreptitiously through a discarded cigarette .
When tests linked the brother to the crime scene evidence , he confessed .
A person who had spent 18 years behind bars for the crime was freed .
Similar stories have come from Britain , where investigators have been using more sophisticated tools .
In 158 searches since 2003 , relatives have led authorities to the perpetrators in 18 cases that might never have been solved otherwise , British authorities said .
In 2006 , British police were stymied in their hunt for the “ shoe rapist ” -- a man who collected the shoes of his many rape victims as trophies .
DNA left at the crime scenes did not match anyone in Britain ’s national database .
But a woman whose DNA was in the database because of a drunk driving arrest had a similar genetic profile .
She told authorities about a brother , a South Yorkshire businessman .
In a search of his business , police found dozens of stiletto heels hidden behind a trap door .
In the U.S. , officials are trying to balance the technology ’s promise and perils , pledging to use databases to identify relatives only for serious crimes and when all other leads have been exhausted .
“ If you are going to do familial searches , I think it is important to really reserve them for just the most egregious crimes where there is an ongoing threat to society , ” said population geneticist Dan Krane , an expert on DNA evidence at Wayne State University in Detroit .
But local labs , unrestrained by state and federal policies , are already starting to expand the technology beyond that limited use .
‘ Database creep ’
It took a dogged three - year campaign by a Colorado prosecutor to bring down the barriers to familial searching in the United States .
Denver Dist .
Atty .
Mitchell Morrissey began his effort in 2005 , when investigators came across DNA profiles in law enforcement databases that resembled , but did not match , genetic evidence left behind by three Denver rapists .
Such partial matches were typically ignored by crime labs .
But the similarities tantalized Morrissey .
In each case , the profile shared at least half the genetic markers with that of the rapist , suggesting a possible biological relationship .
Genetic profiles represent a tiny slice of a person ’s genome and are used to distinguish among individuals .
Though unrelated people may share a few genetic markers by chance , parents and children share half .
Siblings share half on average , though the number can vary widely .
Morrissey was determined to follow up on the partial matches to the Denver rapists , but he quickly ran into roadblocks .
The DNA profiles Denver had found belonged to felons in Oregon , Arizona and California .
But the FBI , which controls the national DNA database system , prohibited states from sharing information about people who were not suspected of a crime .
Thomas F. Callaghan , then gatekeeper of the national DNA database , told Morrissey that disclosing information about partial matches might by viewed by the courts as “ database creep , ” a use of the database beyond its original purpose , the prosecutor recalled .
In an interview , Callaghan said the FBI was being “ cautious ” and would have preferred “ some kind of legal or legislative authority ” before proceeding .
A lot was at stake for the FBI .
The bureau had built the national database from 460,000 DNA profiles in 2000 to 2.8 million in 2005 .
In a few short years , the federal government would add people who had been arrested -- but not convicted -- of crimes .
( Now , the database system holds more than 6 million profiles . )
The FBI feared that racing ahead to familial searching could prompt a backlash and endanger database expansion , Morrissey said .
Frustrated , Morrissey decided to go over Callaghan ’s head .
“ Your policy protects murderers and rapists , ” Morrissey wrote in June 2006 to Joseph DiZinno , then Callaghan ’s boss .
One of the rape victims was “ quite assertive , ” Morrissey warned , and might complain to the media that the FBI was blocking the investigation .
A couple of days later , Morrissey went through the pink slips of telephone messages .
One was from Robert Mueller , director of the FBI .
He wanted to help .
A policy reversal
At Mueller ’s order , the FBI lab reversed its earlier position , adopting an interim policy that permitted states to pursue partial matches that turned up during routine database searches .
Such incidental matches , however , were extremely unlikely to be useful .
The FBI software was not designed to find relatives , and a standard search accidentally eliminates more than 99.9 % of relatives while often fingering people whose profiles are similar by pure chance , experts say .
Oregon and Arizona authorities agreed to cooperate with Morrissey .
Additional genetic testing and investigation determined that neither of the profiles belonged to relatives of the rapists .
Undaunted , Morrissey pressed his case in California , where both Atty .
Gen. Bill Lockyer and his successor , Jerry Brown , initially refused to help , even with the FBI ’s new policy .
After being referred to Michael Chamberlain , one of the attorney general ’s legal advisors , Morrissey was blunt : “ I explained to him clearly that was not something we were going to give up on .
If the assailant raped another woman or hurt a child , I was coming straight back to California and I was n’t going to be patient . ”
According to a confidential memorandum Chamberlain wrote to Brown in June 2007 , this was a high - stakes decision for the attorney general .
Cooperating with Morrissey could prompt federal judges to shut down the entire database on constitutional grounds .
Databases “ designed as an investigative scalpel could be used instead as an indiscriminate investigative fishing net , ” he wrote in the memo , which was reviewed by The Times .
Charges of “ racial profiling ” also might ensue , he said , given that minorities are disproportionately represented in DNA databases .
On the other hand , Chamberlain said , if the state failed to pursue a promising partial match -- to a serial killer , for example -- “ lives could be lost as a direct result . ”
Prominent California district attorneys and Los Angeles police and sheriff ’s unions supported Morrissey .
That got the attention of Brown , who has been considering a run for governor in two years .
In April , after several months of deliberation , the attorney general announced the most aggressive form of relative searching in the United States .
In addition to pursuing “ partial matches ” that come up incidentally , the state would try a more technically sophisticated approach that directly targeted relatives .
The policy also addressed concerns of the state ’s lawyers and scientists by including an elaborate system of safeguards , such as entering contracts with police that limit when familial searching can be used and restricting such searches to a database of convicted felons only .
In an interview , Brown said that once the safeguards were in place , the case for familial searching was compelling .
“ We have 2,000 murders in California a year , ” said Brown .
“ That is a lot of killing .
When you see it and see the victims and have to go to the funerals , it is pretty serious stuff . ”
Chasing every lead
California eventually tested the DNA from the felon Morrissey was pursuing , looking at markers on the Y chromosome to determine if he was indeed related to the rapist .
It proved to be another false lead .
Some experts were n’t surprised .
Tracing relatives through incidental partial matches was “ ridiculous ” and “ wasteful , ” said Krane , the Wayne State expert .
Morrissey said he owed it to the victims to chase every lead .
He said he was confident that technology would produce a more accurate method .
Indeed , Denver investigators have already begun experimenting with software designed to identify relatives , looking for genetic profiles that share rare markers .
California ’s Department of Justice will use such a targeted search to identify possible relatives of the Los Angeles serial killer , authorities confirmed .
The state will create a list of possible relatives , ranked in order of genetic similarities .
Then it will cull the possibilities through further genetic testing and by reviewing public records to determine ages , addresses and names of family members .
The most likely leads , if any , will be passed to the LAPD .
State officials put the odds of finding the serial killer through a relative at about one in 10 .
It is precisely the kind of serious crime that state officials ultimately decided would justify a potential constitutional fight .
Morrissey saw the search for relatives of the Denver rapists in similar terms .
“ This is n’t car break - ins , ” he told a “ 60 Minutes ” reporter last year .
Since then , however , Denver investigators tested their new familial software by running DNA from all unsolved crimes through a local database .
Such repositories , often administered by municipal law enforcement agencies , are not subject to the rules that govern state and federal databases .
Without leaving their desks , investigators used the relatives to trace a handful of suspects .
Although Morrissey said he would not oppose broader rules limiting familial searching to the most serious crimes , he did not hesitate to pursue every lead in Denver .
One case may soon yield an arrest .
It began with blood left at the crime scene .
The offense : a car break - in .

Preface To New Edition . [ edit ]
I HAVE been usually credited with being the chief author of the following brochure .
Such , however , is not the case .
" The Legal Subjection of Men " is in great part the work of an Irish barrister and LL.D. of Dublin , who died a few years ago .
That portions here and there are from my pen is true , but for the bulk of the pamphlet I am not directly responsible , as any expert in literary style will probably detect .
I mention the circumstance in writing the few words of preface for the new edition asked of me by the publishers , not with a view to any disclaimer , but simply in the interests of literary truth and accuracy .
For though , as stated , only myself directly responsible for short sections , I none the less , in the main , heartily endorse the whole .
The present edition has been carefully corrected and the Law brought up to date , though the illustrative cases necessarily remain as in the original edition .
There have been few agitations in history which have been characterised by such hard lying and shameless [ V ] perversion of fact as the so - called " Woman 's Move - ment . "
Unfortunately , continually - reiterated assertions in direct contravention with the real state of the case have only too well succeeded .
The public mind has been bull - dozed into assuming the reverse of what actually obtains to represent the truth , and has sym - pathised and given effect to its sympathies on the basis of these false representations .
I need scarcely say that the advocates of " Woman 's Rights " and female suf- frage , whose whole credit is based upon the tissue of falsehood it is the mission of this little work to expose , have done their best to boycott and ignore the exposure .
All honour then to the Twentieth Century Press for originally publishing , and to the New Age Press for having the courage to risk offending certain sections of " advanced " opinion by reprinting , the following unvarnished statement of Law and fact .
VI
E. Belfort Bax .
Preface [ edit ]
IT seemed to the authors of the following pamphlet that the time had fairly come for confronting the false assumptions underlying the conventional whining cant of the Feminist advocate with a plain and unvarnished statement of Law and fact .
The " Woman 's rights " (? ) agitator has succeeded by a system of sheer impudent , brazen , " bluff , " alternately of the whimpering and the shrieking order , in inducing a credulous public to believe that in some mysterious way the female sex is groaning under the weight of the tyranny of him whom they are pleased to term " man the brute . "
The facts show these individuals to be right in one point and only one , namely , that sex - injustice and sex- inequality exist ; for it so happens that the facts further show the said injustice and inequality to exist wholly and solely in favour of women as against men .
In short , they disclose a state of things in which , down to the minutest detail of law and administration , civil and criminal , women are iniquitously privileged at the the expense of men .
As it is , many an unhappy male victim of modern sex- prerogative would doubtless be only delighted to be allowed to partake of a little of the oppression under which he is told unfortunate Woman is groaning , but from any share in which he sees himself to his detriment excluded .
Mr. Hardcastle [ 1 ] found his guest 's new - fashioned shyness bore a strong resemblance to old - fashioned impudence , and our male victim of pro-feminist laws and tribunals may well he excused for failing to distinguish between this new - fashioned oppression and old - fashioned domination .
In conclusion , we would advise the Feminist guild ignore our pamphlet with its tale of infamy .
It is their only chance of gulling their sentimental dupes any longer .
Let the latter once know of our sketch , and their game is up .
For those who have read it , and a retain the vestiges of open mind on the subject , the maundering [ grumbling ] farce of " down - trodden woman and the brute man " will be played out . [ 1 A character in " She Stoops To Conquer " by Oliver Goldsmith , 1773 . ]
THE LEGAL SUBJECTION OF MEN .
_______
The Legend . [ edit ]
JOHN STUART MILL is dead !
but his eloquent wail of the subjection of women is never let die -- it rings in our ears every day .
It is solemn , it is pathetic ; it overflows with the chivalric sentiment which Mill professes to repudiate as out of date , like the clanship and hospitality of the wandering Arab , but which nevertheless , is so strongly developed in the average male .
It has become the gospel of women 's pretended wrongs , and has caused the ingenuous youth of Oxford and Cambridge to blush for their fellow males .
The only objection that the lawyers of the present year of grace can raise to it is that it is really the reverse of legal truth .
But even apart from the late John Stuart Mill , for considerably more than a generation past -- indeed , one may say , more or less from the beginning of the present century -- mankind , in this and some other countries , has had sedulously instilled into its mind the notion that the female sex is labouring under a grievous oppression at the hands of the tyrant male .
In the present day this opinion has acquired the character of an axiom which few people think of disputing .
Every occurrence bearing upon the social or economical relation of the sexes is judged in the light of this fixed idea .
The press in general voices the view of public opinion with the result that the assumption in question is continually being reiterated .
The moral of the injustice exercised by man upon woman is insisted upon with all the devices of rhetoric , and every chance occurrence is eagerly seized upon and pressed into the service to point the moral and adorn the tale of the favourite theory .
No one , as far as we are aware , has seriously set him or herself to proving the theory to have any foundation at all .
Starting with the assumption , the state of things it implies has been deplored , people have tried to explain it , to suggest remedies for it , but tested it has never been .
We all know the story of King Charles II . and the Royal Society ; how the Merry Monarch , shortly after the institution of that learned body , propounded a problem for its solution , to wit , why a dead fish weighed more than a live one ?
Many were the explanations sug - gested , till at length one bold man proposed that they should come back to first principles , and have a dead fish and a live fish respectively placed in the scales before them .
The proposition was received with horror , one member alleging that to doubt the fact amounted to nothing less than high treason .
After much difficulty , however , the bold man got his way ; the matter was put to the test , when , to the utter discomfiture of the loyal members , the alleged fact which they were seeking to explain evinced itself as but a figment of the Royal fancy .
We propose in the following paragraphs to consider whether the matter does not stand similarly only very much " more so " as regards the conventional notion of the legal and social disabilities of women .
In the present paper we shall merely confine ourselves to the legal aspects of the question .
It will not , we think , take us long to convince our - selves that the allegations on this subject which the present generation , at least , has had dinned into its ears from all sides since its infancy , are even on a less favour - able footing as regards accuracy .
Charles II . thought the dead fish weighed heavier than the live one .
The event only proved that they weighed the same -- not that 2 the live one weighed heavier than the dead one .
Our modern women 's righters bewail the alleged legal op - pression of women by men .
The facts show not that neither sex is oppressed as such , but , on the contrary , they disclose a legalised oppression of men by women .
The Facts . [ edit ]
We will in the first place give a short statement of the law of husband and wife , with a view to discovering on which side of the equation does the weight of privilege lie , regarding the marriage contract as it at present exists in this country .
Let us clearly understand what are the exact limita - tions , and what the extraordinary extent of these sex privileges conferred by law .
Rich men are , on account of their wealth , in a more enviable position towards any litigant in the Law Courts than are poor men .
The privilege here is of wealth .
But rich women are enormously better off in the matter of legal privilege than are rich men , and poor women are similarly privileged by law as against men of their own class .
THE LETTER OF THE LAW .
This privilege conferred on women arises in an extraordinary number of cases , for the express letter of the law discriminates in the sharpest possible manner between men and women in the matter of legal right and duty , of civil law advantage and criminal law exemption .
But the letter of the law is supplemented by the bias of tribunals and by the bias of the press , and of public opinion , of which opinion , after all , the action of the tribunals is but the reflection .
Who interprets , enacts .
The unfair incidence of the law , bad enough by itself , is rendered crushing by the made - up minds of judge and jury .
3
BIAS OF TRIBUNALS .
The settled bias of the tribunals in favour of the woman complainant , actuating magistrates , judge and jury , operates in two ways .
In the first place a woman has only to complain against a man , and the tribunal is already convinced of the justice of her claim .
The tribunal is only impartial if the complaint is by one woman against another .
In the next place , no adequate repression of crime or other injury by a woman against a man is even attempted .
BIAS OF PRESS AND PUBLIC OPINION .
This tendency of the tribunals is confirmed and rendered irresistiBle by the action of the press and public opinion .
All injuries to a woman are chronicled with flaring headlines .
Injuries by women to men are laughed at , or worse still , passed over in silence .
The origin of this bias is a subject of deep interest , but not one capable of being discussed within brief limits .
It is , of course , to be found in the history of England for some centuries past -- practically since the Reformation -- in so far as difference in the intensity of the sentiment differentiates England from other European peoples .
It is to be found in the history of Europe and the race for many centuries before the period of the great European upheaval of the 16th century .
It is enough for the present to note that the pro-feminist prejudice exists and is transmuted into positive rules of law , and legal administration by the action of public opinion and the press , Parliament , judges and juries , and crystallised into statutory enactment by an active pro-feminist propaganda of sex- conscious women 's righters .
If anyone thinks the latter factor unimportant , it may be sufficient to remind him of the statutory innovation 4 involving the most flagrant injustice , inasmuch as flagrant inequality , viz .:-- 1 . Summary Court for Separation .
Open to women alone , except in the case of drunkenness ( cf. Licensing Act , 1902 ) .
2 . Action for Slander .
Open to women alone .
3 . Duty of Husband to maintain his wife -- notwith - standing her adultery .
-- This last a triumph of feminine privileges enacted in 1895 !
It is impossible in any distribution of the main out - lines of sex- privilege to avoid occasionally overlapping .
One arrangement of the topics will be convenient .
Let us consider women 's privileges under the head of Matri - monial Law , and the Civil Law generally , and , further , of the Criminal Law .
These privileges arise indirectly from the action of the legislature , but mainly from that of the Courts , and consist of : first , the deliberate introduction of new rules of law and procedure , and , secondly , the retention of some old - world privileges of women , logical enough when women were dependent , but under modern con- ditions engines of tyranny against men .
Matrimonial Privileges Of Women . [ edit ]
1. BREACH OF PROMISE OF MARRIAGE .
The law of George III. , punishing by damages -- usually vindictive damages -- violation of breach of promise of marriage .
The women 's privilege to commit perjury plays a great part in this process .
A woman swears a man promised to marry her .
Judge and jury hold this statement false , and mark the result .
No one suggests that she should be indicted for perjury .
On the contrary , the grateful male litigant , happy to escape , settles £ 3,000 on her ( Gore v . Lord Sudley , 10 June , 1896 ) .
5
Furthermore , by custom of the tribunals creating the Common Law , this action is confined in its benefits to woman .
A man suing in a like case is laughed out of Court .
This may or may not be a just privilege con- ferred on women -- that of breaking their promise free of legal penalty , but it is obviously a privilege conferred by the practice of the Courts on women as such .
The rules of law invalidating contracts obtained by fraud , duress , or undue influence , have no effect as against a woman inducing a man , by subtle device or threats of scandal , to marry her .
An experienced woman of 30 can entrap a boy of 22 into such a promise ; the Court takes no notice of the invalidity from point of view of fair play .
But a man suing a woman of any age would be laughed out of Court .
2. PRIVILEGE TO DEFRAUD UNDER COVER OF PROMISE OF MARRIAGE .
This is , of course , a minor privilege compared with that of exacting damages for breach of promise .
But it is a real privilege , nevertheless .
A man gives valuable property -- jewellery , furniture , or money -- to a woman under an agreement to marry , fraudulently entered into on her part , inasmuch as she has no power to carry out her promise , being already married or preferring some - one else .
The man , in practice ( whatever theory may be ) is not assisted to recover the property , and the magistrate rebukes him for " unmanly " behaviour !
Contrast the other side .
A woman makes a loan to a man whom she knows to he married .
He receives a sentence of five years penal servitude .
3. MAINTENANCE .
As against her husband , the law confers on a woman who has married him the unilateral privilege of main - tenance .
The earlier law made this privilege dependent on her obedience , cohabitation with her husband , and 6 her observance of outwardly decent behaviour .
The present law has set her free from all these restraints .
Since 1857 the Secular Court , which then assumed juris - diction in matrimonial matters , has given up all attempt to enforce obedience , but the most violent methods , in - cluding imprisonment and sequestration of the property of the husband are employed to enforce her claim to maintenance .
By a recent Statute ( the Act of 1884 ) the process of imprisonment to make a wife obey an order to return to her husband was abolished .
By the famous decision in the Jackson Case the husband was prohibited from himself using force to compel her to return .
But the deserted wife by magisterial order can get her desert - ing husband sent to gaol [ jail ] .
And neither legislature nor the Courts , which took away her duties of obedience and cohabitation , ever dreamt of depriving her of her privilege of being maintained by the man whom she can flout and insult with impunity .
As a successful lady litigant ( May , 1896 ) remarked to her husband , " There is no law which compels me to obey or honour you , but there is a law that you must keep me . "
This woman tersely sums up the position .
In the case of a man of property the Courts will expropriate him for the benefit of his wife .
In the case of a wage - earner the Courts from police magistrates to Supreme Court will decree him to be her earning slave , bound to work for her or go to prison .
A wife , no matter if rolling in wealth , is not obliged to contribute a penny to her husband 's support , even if he be incapacitated from work through disease or accident .
The sole exception which the law makes in derision is that if he be actually in such destitution as to go to the workhouse , then the wealthy wife is obliged to pay , not to her hus - band , but the local authorities , the cost of his main - tenance at the exiguous scale usual in such cases .
Even a wife who , against her husband 's wish , leaves his house after assaulting and insulting him can obtain 7 against him an order for restitution of conjugal rights .
This is a mere preliminary to form a basis for a claim for sequestration of his property for her maintenance .
The Act of 1884 forbids the Court to order imprisonment for refusal to obey an order of restitution of conjugal rights , but enables such a refusal to be made a ground for confiscation of the husband 's property in favour of the wife .
No reciprocity here .
Imprisonment before 1884 affected both husband and wife .
Sequestration of property , the husband alone .
Now imprisonment is abolished for the wife , and so the wife goes scot free , while the husband is as much bound as ever in person and in property .
This iniquitous statutory rule is made use of by women who have no wish whatever to return to their husbands .
After overbearing ill - usage and desertion of the husband for years , the wife applies to the Court for an order for restitution , well knowing that her unfortu- nate victim will not obey the order .
Then the robbery of his property is completed by a second order in Court .
But no disobedience to a like order on her part enables her property to be confiscated , or herself to be sent to prison .
4. DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY FREE FROM CONTROL OF HUSBAND .
By the Married Women 's Property Acts a woman has complete control over all property acquired or inherited by her in any way , free from any claim on the part of her husband .
With cynical injustice she is left in possession of all her old claims on her husband 's property , and the latest charter of female privilege , the Statute of 1895 , gives her claims regardless even of her adultery .
8
This matter deserves more attention than it usually receives .
Let us consider the topics in order :--
( a) Source of Women 's Property .
The piteous tales of artistic working women , of wives robbed by their worthless husbands , from the Mrs. Morton of fact to the Miss Trotwood [ 1 ] of fiction , formed the foundation of the claim for a revision of the law .
Liberty for women to retain their own earnings .
Obvious equity here !
But the bulk of women 's property , in 99 out of every 100 cases , is not earned by them at all .
It arises from gift or inheritance from parents , relatives , or even the despised husband .
Whenever there is any earning in the matter it is notoriously earning by some mere man or other .
Nevertheless , under the operation of the law , property is steadily being concentrated into women 's hands .
" Once Stridhan [ Woman 's property ] always Stridhan . " [ 1 Mrs. Morton figures to be Hannah Morton , a successful shopkeeper in Hastings , England .
Miss Trotwood is a character in " David Copperfield " by Charles Dickens . ]
( b) Control through Life .
The wife has absolute and unfettered control over her own property , man-earned though it be , and her person .
This is the new style .
But the gaoler and the broad arrow [ government mark of ownership ] make the husband , her earning slave , to be insulted and jeered with impunity .
This is the old style with a difference .
" All yours is mine , and all mine 's my own . "
Mere man is not worth considering when the material aggrandizement of women is concerned !
( c) Control at death .
By the Married Women 's Property Acts , a woman has complete power of leaving her property away from her husband , by will , even though in his prosperity he gave it to her .
The husband can be prevented from doing so , by the wife 's suing him for maintenance , when his property , or as much of it as judges think fit , is settled on her , and can no longer he disposed of by his 9 will .
Conveyancers aver that the steady tendency for a woman to leave property acquired sfromome man always to a woman .
A silent revolution in succession is being accomplished .
But the man is left under his old burdens of supporting his wife .
( d) Bankrupting Husband for Money Lent .
A wife is privileged to recover judgment against , and bankrupt her husband for any money she may have lent him , and this privilege is no dead letter .
A husband does not lend , but gives money to his wife .
If he were to attempt by legal documents to turn it into a loan , he would discover once again that what is sauce for the goose , is by no means sauce for the gander .
There is no case on record of a husband daring to sue his wife for a loan .
5. DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY FREE FROM CONTROL OF CREDITORS .
Not merely as against the husband , but against her creditors , the married woman is in a position of enviable privilege .
A married woman , even when separated from her husband , and released from all duties towards him or her children , retains her privilege of having her property exempt from seizure for debt .
Technicalities would be tedious , but the following is the practical working of the law .
In legal phraseology , if a married woman enters into a contract , and if ( an important if ) there is no restraint against anticipation in her settlement , then her property , or some of it , may be attached .
As to the restraint against anticipating income , this clause , introduced by Lord Chancellor Thurlow to protect an interesting relative of his against her husband , is practically to be found in every settle - ment , being now useful against the creditor , although no longer needed against the husband .
10
6. VICARIOUS RESPONSIBILITY OF HUSBAND TOWARDS
THIRD PERSONS FOR HIS WIFE'S MISCONDUCT .
The husband is liable , and his wife is not , for all the civil wrongs ( torts ) she may commit .
He has no control over her , but serves as her whipping - boy .
This , though she publicly defames and insults him in every way , and has deserted him .
As Sir Frank Lockwood put it , one has the deep consolation of knowing that if Mrs. Jackson utters slanders Mr. Jackson can be sued .
Under the older English law , when the wife was " sous la verge de son marrye " ( the canon law sub virga viri [ under the rod of the man / husband ] ) , the rule was reasonable enough .
Now , however , it is only an illustration of the pro-feminist bias of the Courts .
Every moth - eaten scrap of privilege , which is in favour of the woman , they retain .
All privileges of the husband , no matter how firmly established , they deny as having ever existed .
Look at the astounding declaration of Lord Halsbury in the Jackson case , that the husband never had the right in English law to restrain his wife ! ! !
7. IMPUNITY FOR CRIMES COMMITTED IN HUSBAND'S PRESENCE .
THE " DOCTRINE OF COERCION "
Again , a pious archæology animates the judges when the woman is to be benefited .
Notwithstanding the revolutionary changes in the law , another old - world privilege of the " woman under the rod " is reserved for the dominating female of to - day .
If her husband is present when she is committing a crime , a married woman is presumed by an intelligent administration of justice to have acted under his coercion .
This is some - times amusing , when , as often happens , the woman is the instigator of the crime .
11
This precious privilege is nominally confined to cases of minor importance , and in special is supposed not to affect murder .
In practice it affects all crimes , and is no dead letter , as illustrative cases can show .
8. FACILITIES FOR DIVORCE .
No man can obtain a divorce except by a terribly expensive process in the High Court at a minimum charge of forty pounds .
This means a denial of justice to the vast bulk of the male population .
Any woman , by the asking for it , can get a summary separation and confiscation of her husband 's property , and an order for her maintenance out af his earnings from the nearest police court .
Recent Statutes confer this privilege .
This process , which costs only a few shillings , the husband has to pay for .
But divorce or no divorce , the wife 's property , where - ever acquired , can not he touched .
There is no question here of interfering with her " earnings " though she be an opera singer with Â £ 40,000 a year .
Similarly with her capitalised property , which , though man-acquired , as usual , can not be touched .
If her property , as well as her husband 's , has been handed over to the trustees of her marriage settlement the Court has some power to make orders as to the income of that property , but in practice uses it only for the benefit of the children .
No matter how flagrant her conduct the wildest dream never suggested that the wife 's " earnings " ( as artist , opera singer , or what not ) no matter how exorbitant , should ever be touched for the benefit even of her children .
That a portion should be sequestrated for the maintenance of the husband -- even though a husband is incapacitated by disease or accident -- of course would be a barbarous suggestion , hardly to be discussed out - side Bedlam [ famous insane asylum . ]
12
But precisely analogous orders as to the hard - earned and miserably stinted wages of the male earner are made with scandalous levity in the Police Court every day .
A working man , earning eighteen or twenty shil - lings a week , is calmly ordered to provide twelve shil - lings a week for life for the keep of a clamorous and malignant shrew .
The denial to the working man of the same facilities for summary separation , through the police court , granted to every brawling wife who chooses to ask for it , simply means that the man is in a state of legal subjection to his wife .
The wife has but to scream and appeal to the nearest policeman , and prison , separation , custody of children , and maintenance , are decreed as matters of course .
A woman can habitually repudiate her duties , neglect her children , pawn her husband 's and children 's clothes , waylay her husband at his work , and disgrace him be - fore his friends , procure his dismissal , assault him , and there is no remedy open to the working man .
To tell him that he can appeal to the Divorce Court at a cost of forty pounds , is a piece of savage and scornful irony .
He might as well be told that he can , if he has the money , promote a private Act of Parliament , at the cost of some thousand pounds .
If goaded by intolerable misery , he so far forgets himself as to strike his torturer , he is sent to gaol , with his condemnation headed A cowardly brute .
The special facilities for women to obtain divorce , separation confiscation of the husband 's property , do not end with the provision of a cheap and expeditious Court for women alone .
If the woman elects to go to the Divorce Division of the High Court , the path is made similarly smooth for her .
Her unfortunate hus - band , who may afterwards be held to be quite guiltless of the lying charges brought against him , is ordered to 13 find money for her solicitors , and has to pay in advance !!
He must also pay her alimony pendente lite [ during the litigation ] .
Then when he is dragged to Court by a heartless and vindictive woman , he finds the scales still more heavily weighted against him .
The rules might be formulated somewhat in this way : --
1. Every woman 's statement complaining of her hus - band is assumed to he true until he conclusively proves it to be false .
The onus probandi [ burden of proof ] is on him and the difficulty he has to face is that of proving a negative .
2 . The slightest harshness or even carelessness of speech or behaviour , no matter under what provocation ( the records of years being searched to find one ) is absolutely final proof of " cruelty " if committed by the husband .
No amount of insolence and brutality -- short of actual attempt to maim -- is cruelty in a wife .
Any - thing she does is a pardonable exhibition of feminine temper .
3 . The husband and his witnesses are prosecuted for perjury on the slightest inaccuracy being discerned in their narration of facts .
Deliberate perjury is passed over if committed by the wife , her paramour , or her witnesses .
4 . No charge , no matter of what infamous crime , falsely made by a wife against a husband , is a ground for his refusing to take her back .
If he should refuse the Court confiscates for her benefit as such of his property or earnings as they think fit .
One result of these instructive rules of practice is to be found in the number of undefended divorce suits .
It is a common saying of the legal profession that multitudes of husbands allow judgments to go against them by default , as they are quite conscious that no man not of absolutely angelic character -- unless he be himself a lawyer -- has any chances before a prejudiced pro- feminist judge and jury .
14
9. ENDOWMENT OF ADULTERESS OUT OF DAMAGES .
Here we come upon a marvellous specimen of judicial legislation , wherein Parliament has not been troubled .
In case of a husband succeeding under the Act of 1895 he will have difficulty in future in getting a divorce from his wife by reason of adultery .
He is entitled to damages from the co-respondent for the injury to him , done in breaking up his home , and exposing him to mental suffering and material loss .
The damages are supposed to he paid to the husband on this basis -- that they were in compensation for his loss .
They are still assessed on this basis , but at the end of the nineteenth century we find the judges creating a legal fiction .
Influenced by the wave of feminist sentimentality , the judges have actually seized on these damages as a fund for endowing the adulteress .
The way this insidious device was introduced was as follows :-- It not unfrequently happened that a husband assented of his own free will to the damages , which in law were his own property , being settled on the children of the marriage .
Sometimes he included his late wife in that dedication of the fund .
This was generous of him , as the woman had obviously forfeited her claims on him .
Now , however , the judge , without consulting parliament , has deprived the injured husband of the merit of generosity .
Without the husband 's consent , in fact , notwithstanding his opposition , the judge will hand over the damages , which in strict law are the husband 's , to such trustees as they think fit , and trans - form the fund into an endowment for the adulteress who has prudently selected a rich man as co-respondent .
To understand the iniquity of this proceeding , let us take the opposite case .
In some American States the wife 's trade union has procured the passing of a law that enables a wife to sue for damages for her husband 's seduction .
What would be thought of the American Courts if they seized on the damages so secured and 15 settled them as a provision on the delinquent husband ?
or ( to add a grotesque completeness to the parallel ) settle them on the husband and his children by his fair seducer ?
Yet a similar piece of monstrous injustice -- to men , though not to women -- is the law of England to - day .
Our pro-feminist judges are presumably indifferent to the fact that the subsidy of the adulteress in this way can have but one result , namely , to " encourager les autres [ to encourage the others ] . "
10 . CUSTODY OF CHILDREN .
It has always in England been laid down as a funda- mental law based on public policy , that the custody of children and their education is a duty incumbent on the father .
It is said to be so fundamental that he is not permitted to waive his exercise of the right by pre- nuptial contract .
( See the Agar v. Ellis Case . )
This rule of the Common Law of England is of course in harmony with the policy of all Europe and Christen - dom , as well as with the historic conditions of the European social organisation , if not with the primal instincts of the race .
Nevertheless , fundamental and necessary as the rule may be , the pro-feminist magistrates and judges of England are bent apparently on ignoring it with a light heart .
They have not merely retained the old rule that the custody of infants of tender years remains with the mother until the child attains the age of seven .
But they go much further than that .
As a matter of course , and without considering in the least the interests of the child , or of society at large , they hand over the custody and education of all the children to the litigant wife , whenever she establishes -- an easy thing to do -- a flimsy and often farcical case of technical " cruelty . "
The victim husband has the privilege of maintaining the children as well as herself out of his property or 16 earnings , and has the added consolation of knowing that they will brought up to detest him .
Even in the extreme case where a deserting wife takes with her the children of the marriage , there is practically no redress for the husband if in narrow circumstances .
The police courts will not interfere .
The divorce court , as already stated , is expensive to the point of prohibi- tion .
In any case the husband has to face a tribunal already prejudiced in favour of the female , and the attendant scandal of a process will probably have no other result than to injure his children and their future prospects in life .
II .
IMPUNITY FOR OFFENCES AGAINST HUSBAND .
The wife in England enjoys either absolute immunity or liability to merely nominal punishment for all offences against her husband committed during marriage .
Con- trast with this the rule as regards offences by the husband towards the wife .
Gaol and public obloquy are his portion .
This matter will be referred to again in considering the criminal law privileges of women in general ( married or unmarried ) as regards trial , sentence , remission of punishment , and gaol - treatment .
It may here he noted that feminine exemption , as specially regards Matri - monial Law , is established in one of the following ways :-- Either by
1 . The text of the law expressly , which discriminates between wife 's offences and husband 's , punishing the latter and leaving unpunished the wife .
For instance , in cases of desertion ; or by
2 . The administrators of the law who have established a rule of practice discriminating in favour of the woman , although nominally the law is the same for both .
For instance , in cases of cruelty , perjury , and bigamy ; or by the fact that 17
3 . Whenever a pecuniary fine is imposed , nominally on the wife , the husband is the vicarious sufferer .
He has to pay .
With this preface let us consider the law and practice as regards a wife 's offences against the husband , in the order of their frequency .
( a) Impunity for Insolence and Insult .
The most elaborate cruelty in the way of insolence and insult is unpunishable by the law when committed by the wife .
The husband remains bound to support his torturer , who may publicly waylay and insult him , harass him at his work , procure his dismissal , libel him by postcards sent to his workshop , or to his club .
If he he a rich man , he can get some tardy redress in the way of palliation ; but he remains liable to divorce and expro- priation at his wife 's behest .
The rod , the cucking school , [ 1 ] the indictment as a scold at the assizes were the methods adopted by the Law of England and sanctioned by the Canon Law , until the present century , to repress such outrages .
Now the feminine noblesse can torture their slaves with impunity .
If the husband retaliates , the magistrate 's order promptly consigns him to gaol and the prisoners ' lash .
[ 1 Cucking stool : " An instrument of punishment no longer in use , consisting of a chair in which the offender was tied and exposed to public derision or ducked in water . "
American Heritage Dictionary . ]
( b) Impunity for Neglect .
The wife may repudiate every one of her duties , may utterly neglect her household , her children , and her husband .
No remedy either in the police court or the divorce court for the husband .
If the husband neglect the wife in this connection -- " neglect " is a very elastic word -- consequences ensue of which the chief are -
(1) The prompt police court separation order , and confiscation of property and wages of hus- band ( enforced by imprisonment ) .
18
(2) This so - called neglect of the husband enables the wife to commit adultery with impunity , yet still she has her claim to maintenance .
( Act of 1895 . )
Neglect on the part of the wife is no legal offence at all .
Neglect on the part of the husband has been con- strued to mean anything of which the wife likes to complain .
For example , an actor who is obliged to remain late at the theatre comes home late .
This is held to be " neglect , " with the usual penal consequences .
What between the upper millstone of " cruelty " and the nether millstone of " neglect " the unfortunate husband can now be condemned alike , if he does something , or if he does nothing -- anything the wife chooses to call so being construed as either " cruelty " or " neglect . "
( c) Impunity for Libel and Slander of Husband .
No lying charge , no matter how gross , by word or writing is punishable if committed by the wife against the husband .
She is free to slander and libel him before servants and strangers , solicitors and pressmen ; accuse him of every crime known to the Old Bailey [ Central Criminal Court ] calendar , and write postcards to his club or to his employer and [ no ] penal consequences ensue as long as she lives in his house .
Her husband cannot leave her without incurring punishment .
If the husband , not to say slanders , but speaks dis - respectfully to his wife before servants or strangers , she is quite entitled to leave his house at once , and claim the usual separation and confiscation order , and deprive him of the custody of the children whom he is bound to support .
( d) Impunity for Waylaying and Procuring Dismissal .
A vindictive wife who courts publicity and scandal has the average respectable man-- unless he be an angel or a lawyer -- at her absolute mercy .
If he be a man of the middle - classes , she can waylay him at his office and 19 destroy his business connection .
She can call at his club and secure his expulsion .
If he be a working man she can interview his employer and secure his prompt dismissal .
She can render him a laughing - stock to all his acquaintances , and at the same time achieve his financial ruin .
The law and its administrators stand idly by .
No remedy for the helpless male .
The " poor woman " ( they are always that ) must have been ill - used ; there is no such thing as savage vindictiveness and recklessness in the female .
( e) Impunity for Violence and Assault .
If a man under any provocation , no matter how galling -- insolence or violence -- strikes a woman , he is sent to hard labour , divorced , and his property con- fiscated , or his earnings hypothecated -- and all this through the prompt instrumentality of the police - court .
A woman may assault , stab , set fire to her husband , and he has no remedy , except to summon her to the police - court , where , if she be fined , he is compelled to pay the fine , and as likely as not is laughed at .
If her crime be revoltingly atrocious , she is perhaps sent to prison -- for one - twentieth part of the time awarded to a male offender for a like offence .
On her being released , her husband , unless he be a rich man , is bound to take her back , and , rich or poor , support her .
The prompt and inexpensive police - court divorce is not for him .
A humane police magistrate actually had to stoop to make terms with a cruel and murderous criminal .
A wife strikes a felon blow at her husband , renders him insensible , and he has to be removed to the hospital .
His face is badly scarred , six stitches having to be put into the wounds .
The magistrate , wishing to prevent murder , binds her over to come up for judgment , if called upon , on condition that she kindly consents to sign a separation deed , permitting her unfortunate hus- 20 hand slave to live apart from her .
The slave of course has to support her all the same .

( f) Impunity for Adultery .
The latest charter of women 's privileges -- the Act of 1895 - - enables a woman to commit adultery with Impunity -- provided she can allege her husband neg - lected her .
As " neglect " usually means that she drove him to the public - house or to his club by over - bearing violence and insolence , the present law means that if a woman has a fancy for adultery , all she need do is to pick a quarrel with her husband about anything she likes , then she can indulge in desertion and adultery with impunity , and claim the usual divorce and confis- cation from a sympathising tribunal .
It is singular that the law on this very offence should be perpetually cited by women 's righters as her chief grievance , next to the absence of the Parliamentary franchise -- and as the standing illustration of the " cruel inequality and injustice as between the woman and the man " of the English law of divorce .
If a woman , we are told , commits adultery , a man can obtain absolute divorce , but if a woman sues she must prove cruelty as well .
Now as to the earlier law , this was the rule , and something could be said to defend it .
It is obvious that if a woman commits adultery she may introduce a bastard child to her husband 's family , and saddle him with a pecuniary burden and them with an onerous relationship which it is unjust should be borne by them [ which would be unjust if borne by them ] .
If a husband has illicit relations , he does not bring home his bastard offspring .
But since 1857 the secular court has practically abolished the discriminations .
Let the wife prove illicit relations by the husband , and she has always had her divorce for the asking .
The reason is simple .
The Courts will hold , to oblige a wife , that 21 anything is cruelty if committed by a husband .
It is cruelty to come home late from his club ; it is cruelty to spend an evening with friends without her company .
It is cruelty to hold her hands if she tries to strike or to bite him .
However , these refinements are no longer necessary to the pro-feminist tribunals of England .
The last charter of feminine privilege ( the Act of 1895 ) has set the balance of express law the other way .
Now a wife can commit adultery with impunity -- if induced by the " neglect " of her husband .
No such excuse for the husband .
(g) Impunity for Desertion .
A woman can have her husband arrested and sent to gaol if he leaves her , even though her own violence and cruelty led to his flight .
The husband gets no assist - ance from the law if his wife deserts him .
The method in which this privilege has been worked out was simple enough .
It consisted in abolishing all the husband 's control over the wife 's actions and property , and , on the other hand , retaining all the wife 's power of legal compulsion on the husband , with added powers .
These changes have practically come in during the period since 1857 , when a secular court for divorce was established .
Under the earlier law , prior to , and long after the Reformation , ecclesiastical censure restrained the deserting wife .
But the secular common law also lent its aid to the husband .
He could prevent her by force from leaving his house , and could bring her back if she had escaped .
More , he had an action for " harbouring " against any of her relations or strangers who assisted her in straying away -- as late as George III .
a husband 's action for damages on this ground was successful .
22
An exception to the general rule , and even this was of doubtful validity , was introduced under Henry VIII .
A wife could be assisted to leave her husband 's house if she were journeying to the Bishop 's Court to seek a separation .
But the latest feminist rulings of the judges have quite swept away such fine distinctions as those of 1857 .
( 1 ) By their fiction of " cruelty " -- anything a husband does being " cruelty " -- they have enabled any woman who likes to leave on a pretended excuse .
( 2 ) By procuring the passing of an Act ( Lord Chancellor Cairns ' Act , 1884 ) the Courts got rid of their theoretical duty of ordering a wife to be imprisoned for refusing to obey an order of restitution of conjugal rights .
Nothing in the way of compulsion by restraint of person or property is to be applied to the wife .
But by a cynical stroke this Act provides that if a husband refuses to obey , his property is to be confiscated .
And , more out - rageous than all , the wife 's power to procure the arrest and imprisonment of the husband by the magistrate 's Court is left untouched .
A case in which the wife of a clergyman caused her husband to be arrested on board a ship going to America , and sentenced to hard labour by alleging his desertion , deserves special notice .
True that the clergy - man , having means , could appeal to a higher Court and have the iniquitous sentence quashed .
But the working man would have had to serve his allotted term in the prison cell .
And no one has ever suggested that this wife should be punished .
( See the case of the Rev. Peter MacDonald Neilson , June , 1894 . )
The notorious Jackson case furnished another pic- ture .
Here a woman is upheld by the Court of Appeal in deserting her husband and condemning him to life - 23 long celibacy .
He has absolutely no remedy against her .
If she commits any civil injury against any one , he can be sued .
If he should live with any other woman , Mrs. Jackson can get a portion of the property confis- cated and settled on herself .
She is not obliged to ask for a divorce , she can still keep him bound by limiting her demand to a judicial separation .
The criticisms which some lawyers have made on this decision are wide of the mark .
It was quite in harmony with the later current of authority , though in violent conflict with the settled Common Law of last century .
Tie the man and let the woman free , is the prevalent judicial theory of to - day .
Though the judges could obtain the passing of Lord Chancellor Cairns '
Act , 1884 , freeing the wife from imprisonment for desertion , there has been no sugges - tion of promoting an Act to enable a man in Mr. Jackson 's position to obtain a divorce .
So enamoured have they become with the new doctrine of feminine predominance in the relation of marriage , that the judges of the House of Lords have actually extended to Scotland their theory of tying the man and letting the woman free .
For over three centuries the law of Scotland has provided that desertion for four years on the part of either spouse is ground for absolute divorce , with right of second marriage .
For all that long period the Act has been found most salutary in effect .
Now the judges in the House of Lords , in the year 1894 , have practically repealed it .
They have refused to grant a Scotch litigant divorce , although his wife has deserted him for over four years , and at the same time abducted his child .
They allege , as the ground for this astonishing " new readings " of the law , that the husband did not really want her to return .
As this can be alleged in every case in which a husband does not slavishly implore a shrew to come back , the result is that when a vindictive woman wants to prevent 24 the man remarrying , she can successfully resist his claim for divorce .
This salutary Act of Scots Parliament has been offered up as a whole burnt offering on the altar of the dominant female .
( h) Impunity to Commit Bigamy .
We now come to a flagrant instance where the law professes to apply impartially to masculine and feminine offenders .
But the feminist administrators of the law have created an undisputed feminine privilege .
Long terms of penal servitude await the male bigamist .
The female is privileged to indulge in this form of deceit and theft with impunity .
For , be it noted , it is almost invariably a desire to obtain economic advantage that impels the woman to this particular crime , the essence of which , of course , is the deceit practised on the innocent party .
In the cases where there is no economic motive and where no deceit is practised on the second spouse ( to use the con- venient terms of the Scottish Law ) no punishment is ever inflicted on the woman , and perhaps none is speci- ally required .
The possession of the " marriage lines " is sought for as a social advantage , though based on the deception of a public official .
But in striking contrast to this practice , the man who contracts a second , i.e. , illegal , alliance , even though he goes through the marriage ceremony solely to please his second partner , and although she is in no way deceived as to his status , may , even though in addition he has been deserted by his first wife , he arrested and sent to prison at the bidding of the woman who deserts him .
This , however , is not the full extent of the privilege .
Men who , from passion , or for whatever motive , deceive the second partner , are severely punished .
That is to say , a woman already deserting her husband , may entangle a man into an alliance with her which he 25 believes to be honourable and legal : may make him the father of her children , and hamper him with the life - long obligation to support these unhappy offspring : may thus brand her own children with the stamp of illegitimacy , may squander his earnings for years , may finish the tale of her favours by involving him in a suit in the divorce court as a co-respondent , and in a prosecution in the criminal courts as an unwilling witness against his chil- dren 's mother , and may do all this with absolute freedom from legal penalty .
Let a man attempt to improve his financial position , nay , let him , even at a pecuniary loss to himself , exercise the least similar deceit on any woman , and the Criminal Courts descend on him with swift retribution .
The following article in a leading London daily news - paper is instructive :--
The sentence of seven years penal servitude passed by the Common Sergeant yesterday upon Charles Baker , who has for many years successfully practised bigamy as a profession , is not one day too long .
Mr. Baker is evidently a person of irresistible fascination to ladies , and but for the rare courage of one of his victims , who had him tracked through both hemispheres , he might in time have bigamously married the residue of our unmarried women possessing suitable dowers .
Quite another sort of bigamist was the cause of an application to Mr. Lane at the South Western Police Court .
This was a young woman , who having married yesterday 's applicant , while her first husband was still living , was strangely purged of her offence by Mr. Justice Hawkins after a day 's imprisonment , on condi- tion that she returned -- not to her legitimate spouse , but to the young man who irregularly succeeded him .
This she did , but not for long , as the same young man had to complain yesterday , that she had , in turn , deserted him , for an old gentleman she used to go after before .
The applicant , like a sensible young man , seemed able to 26 support this with philosophy , but what did raise his ire was her threat to prosecute him if he did not maintain her , against which he sought -- and naturally obtained -- protection .
The fickle young woman is evidently still unconversant with the rules of the game .
Perhaps when she has tried as many husbands as Mr. Baker has married wives , she will know better .
Really it is getting time to mete out equal treatment to masculine and feminine offenders . " -- Daily Chronicle , May 21 , 1896 .
( i) Impunity for False Charges on Oath .
No crime is too abominable to be imputed by a wife , with absolute impunity , against a husband .
More pre- cise details need not be given , as recent instances will occur to the public mind of notorious and infamous ill - usage of a husband in this way by a heartless and vin- dictive woman .
But the Public Prosecutor is silent when the false accusation is brought by one of the privileged sex .
Prosecutions of women for perjury in a divorce suit are unknown .
And , be it observed , this privilege extends to all female friends or hirelings of the wife .
These persons are allowed to accuse , with elaborately - prepared details of corroboration , the husband of the woman litigant of committing adultery with themselves .
They are never punished .
An obliging maiden sister -- to help her married sister to procure divorce and confiscation of property against a troublesome husband -- swears that the husband committed adultery with herself , the wife 's sister !
The judge and jury find this story a concocted lie .
The infamous perjurer is not punished -- is not even prosecuted .
Obliging maid servants every day come forward to allege their own or some other woman's " immoral relations " with the victim husband .
No one ever dreams of prosecuting them .
It would be waste of time and money -- as no jury would convict .
27
( k) Impunity for Perjured Denials of Guilt .
Women , it is notorious , every day perjure themselves in divorce suits , by denying that they committed adultery when their guilt is manifest .
They are never prose- cuted .
The administrators of the law show by their practice -- though not in articulate words -- that they hold such perjury a venial fault , if not , indeed , a justifiable means of self - defence in the case of holy , inviolate woman .
This privilege , like the analogous one of bringing lying charges against a husband , extends to the wife 's friends and hirelings .
Let a husband untruly deny his illicit connection with a woman if his wife is the accuser .
The Public Prosecutor intervenes , as a case decided in June , 1896 , shows clearly enough , when the male went to penal servitude .
Yet , be it observed , it is only the man 's denying with the object of protecting himself against his wife that is punished .
If the man he not a husband , but a co- respondent : if he deny the truth with the laudable object of protecting a wife ( who happens to be an adulteress -- but that does not strip her of her privilege ) then his perjury is pardonable and chivalrous .
The co-respondent is safe under the shadow of the wife .
In fact he must lie .
And this brings us to the next head of privilege .
(l) Impunity for Treacherous Confession of Guilt .
Here we have a most striking rule -- No woman is supposed to be a cowardly traitor if she turns " wife 's evidence " against a man , and truly alleges that he had illicit relations with herself .
She is assisting justice , promoting morality , showing true repentance by open confession , and aiding in the women 's trade union object of keeping down man , the slave !
Her treachery to her accomplice is condoned .
28
But a man who would dare to turn " husband 's evidence " against a wife , cannot be found within the four seas .
The reason stares one in the face .
Such a witness would not he welcomed as a servant of justice , and a repentant sinner .
No !
he would be esteemed by judge , jury , press and public to be a loathsome reptile , unfit for human society .
A howl of execration would drive him from the land .
Such a depth of morbid senti- ment has been reached that even if a man charged with immoral relations with a wife , refuses or omits -- pre- sumably through religious or conscientious motives -- to come forward and perjure himself on her behalf , an indignant press comments on his conduct , and tells him he has not acted as a gentleman .
( m) Impunity to Procure Adultery .
A wife seeking divorce and confiscation of her husband 's property can exercise all her privileges of violence , insolence , and , under her recent charter , of adultery , without inconvenience , but she can in addition make him guilty as well as herself , with the trivial difference that he will be punished .
A wife can get female detectives to send female seducers in her hus - hand 's path , and can then produce her hirelings in the box with conclusive proofs of the husband 's and their own guilt .
If the attempt be made on the husband 's side there is swift retribution .
In the first place as the adultery was committed with his own connivance she is quite absolved from legal responsibility .
But more follows .
At this moment , such witnesses on a husband 's side can be sent to prison for successful conspiracy to procure the adultery of a wire .
The wife herself wins her suit .
12 . IMPUNITY TO MURDER HUSBAND .
Exactly as in the case of bigamy , the law on murder and homicide are nominally the same for men as for 29 women .
But if a wife by poisoning or violence , kills her husband , the administrators of the law show in practice what can be done by twisting a text .
The matter will again be referred to under the Criminal Law , but provisionally the rules may be reduced to form somewhat as follows :-- ( 1 ) The least excuse is sufficient to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter .
( 2 ) All the wife 's statements against her husband are assumed to be true until they are proved to be false .
( 3 ) The proof of the actual deed of crime must be much more conclusive than in the case of a man .
( 4 ) If the verdict be [ by ] a mere chance one of murder , a sympathetic judge announces he will forward to the proper quarter the sympathetic jury 's recom- mendation to mercy .
This recommendation is acted on by the Home Secretary as a matter of course in the case of a woman .
( 5 ) If the verdict is , as it usually is , one of man - slaughter , a shamefully inadequate or possibly a merely nominal sentence is imposed .
( a) Poisoning .
This peculiarly treacherous crime is a legitimate mode of self - defence if practised by a wife on her husband .
( b) Violence .
A wife is still " weak woman " when armed with a poker , a metal pot , a vitriol bottle , a petroleum can , or a revolver .
If these lethal substances killed her husband it must have been by accident .
In any case he had taken her " for better or worse , " and had to put up with the consequences .
Why did he cross her temper ?
Besides , even if she were ill - tempered , why did he not make a better selection when marrying ?
The elimina- 30 tion of thoughtless males is rather useful on the whole to the progress of the race .
The decisions to which this line of argument , con- scious or sub-conscious , leads judges and juries , shamefully neglectful of their public trust , may be seen from the appended cases , selected haphazard from a newspaper file .
( c) Poisoning a Husband .
Mrs. Maybrick was tried at Liverpool Assizes for poisoning her husband .
She read a written statement by herself ( Mr. Justice Stephens ordered that she be not permitted to communicate with her lawyers before writing it ) to the effect that she administered the poison to her husband at his own request .
The judge and jury accepted her statement that she administered the poison , but disbelieved her statement that it was at his own request , and , wonderful to relate , she was convicted of murder , but the Home Secretary commuted her sentence ; and after undergoing a few years ' imprison ment she is now at large .
( d) Setting a Husband on Fire .
Mary O'Reardon , August 1st , 1894 , poured oil over her husband , and deliberately set him on fire with a lighted paper .
Sentenced at the Central Criminal Court to six years ' penal servitude .
The offence was plainly wilful murder .
The man had shortly before attempted to commit suicide -- being driven to the attempt by her ill - usage .
( e) Setting a Husband on Fire .
Catherine Chilton ( Durham Assizes , Nov. 24th , 1894 ) threw a lighted lamp at her husband .
Sentenced to twelve months ' hard labour for manslaughter .
The judge described it as a wanton and wicked act , and said it was a mercy for the prisoner that the jury had reduced the original charge to one of manslaughter .
31
( f) Stabbing a Husband .
Annie Hibberd , August , 1894 , stabbed her husband twice , remarking , " Revenge is sweet .
Found guilty of manslaughter at the Central Criminal Court , and sentenced to six years ' penal servitude .
(g) Driving a Waggon over a Husband .
Jane Payne , August 18th , 1894 , thrust her husband off a waggon , and then deliberately backed the horses , driving the wheels over him twice .
Both legs fractured .
He died a few hours afterwards .
Found guilty of man- slaughter .
( h) Setting a Husband and Child on Fire .
Jane Ann Trelawney Baker ( [ age ] 32 ) pleaded guilty to manslaughter of her husband and child by throwing a lighted lamp at the former .
She was sentenced to three days ' imprisonment , which meant her immediate release , and on leaving the dock remarked , amid the sympathy of the Court , that she was a childless widow , alone in the world !
! !-- Central Criminal Court , December 14th , 1893 .
( i) Killing a Husband by Throwing a Knife at Him .
At the Central Criminal Court , October 24th , 1894 , a married woman surrendered to answer an indictment charging her with the manslaughter of her husband .
The defence was that the prisoner did not fling the knife with the intention of killing her husband .
She threw the knife in a moment of great mental irritation , and it unfortunately struck the deceased .
The jury could not agree to a verdict and were discharged .
The case was put back until the following week for counsel in the meantime to consider if it were necessary to proceed further with the case .
Mr. Justice Wright , in allowing the prisoner out on a recognizance , told her that she need not attend unless she received notice to do so .
The 32 judge , it should be added , who throughout the trial appeared favourable to the prisoner , disallowed various questions of the prosecution as to the previous relations with the husband , and cut short the medical evidence , saying that he did not like to see the time of the Court wasted with cases such as these , or words to that effect .
Of course not !
Mere husband killing , alter all -- what is that ?
In the opposite case , that of killing a wife by the husband , how often have judges been careful to point out to the jury that any unlawful assault , if death happened to result from it , was , in the eyes of the law , wilful murder !
Non-matrimonial Privileges Of Women [ edit ]
As already been stated , the division of our subject into the Matrimonial , Civil , and Criminal and Non- Matrimonial Privileges of Women , although obviously convenient , necessitates some over - lapping .
This , how - ever , is unavoidable , as , for many reasons , it is well to keep the promised or actual wife 's privileges against her husband and others clear from those of other women .
But women in general have many and serious privi- leges besides those affecting the matrimonial or quasi- matrimonial relations .
The Criminal Law . [ edit ]
The express wording of the law - - and , much more , the tacit warping of the Criminal Law in favour of women by the bias of judge , jury , and the press -- has created a regular system of conferring privileges on women as against men , or against the community in general :-- 1 . As regards Trial .
2 . As regards Sentence .
3 . As regards Prison Treatment .
4 . As regards Pardon . 33
The only exceptions to these privileges are :--
(a) If the offence has been committed by one woman against another .
( b) If the offence is by a baby farmer [ caretaker ] , committed against other women 's babies .
The reasons for these exceptions are , of course , obvious , and need not be dwelt upon here .
1. TRIAL AND SENTENCE .
The rules are substantially the same as those affecting wives in particular , already enumerated .
(a) The least excuse is sufficient to exonerate any woman from penal consequences .
( b) All the women 's statements against a man are assumed to be true until they are proved to be false .
( c) The proof of the actual deed of crime must be much more conclusive than in the case of a man .
(d) The jury almost invariably recommends to mercy on the rare occasions when they convict .
(e) A shamefully inadequate or even a nominal sentence Is imposed .
2. LIST OF CRIMES .
The list of the wife 's exemptions from punishment for crimes against her husband may nearly all be repeated as enjoyed , though possibly in a somewhat less degree , by all women ( other men 's wives or not ) against a man , or against the community at large .
( 1 ) In cases of drunkenness this offence against the safety of the com- munity is visited on the woman with a trifling fine .
The matter is looked on rather as a joke than an offence .
( 2 ) In cases of libel and slander , a criminal prosecution against a woman is practically unknown .
A nominal penalty , such as a promise not to repeat the offence , is the usual ending to such a prosecution .
( 3 ) Crimes of 34 assault and violence generally are almost as privileged in the case of an ordinary woman as of a wife against a husband .
( 4 ) Murder is similarly reduced to man- slaughter , no matter who the woman may be , provided the victim is a man .
( 5 ) Waylaying , injuring business , or procuring dismissal , is similarly a pastime to be in - dulged in by any vindictive woman with absolute impunity .
( 6 ) Perjury is similarly a perquisite of the female litigant -- whether perjury of the defensive or offensive type .
( 7 ) Turning wife 's evidence after seduc - tion of husband is , of course , open to all women without punishment .
( 8 ) Conspiracy to procure the husband 's seduction , as has already been stated , goes unpunished if committed on the wife 's side .
The class of offences more peculiarly effected by women ill general , apart from wives , are due either to revenge or a desire to extort money .
Violence , culmin- ating in murder , has been sufficiently dealt with in con- sidering the wife 's privilege .
Economic motive is displayed in crimes of Fraud , Libel and Slander , Way - laying , Seduction and Perjury , to levy blackmail -- though sometimes libel and slander , waylaying , and perjury are due to motives of revenge .
Sometimes the law expressly discriminates between men and women ; for instance , in the case of seduction : sometimes the administrators , for instance , in the case of fraud and perjury .
( a) Fraud .
Generally speaking , fraud by a woman against a man , by which he is deprived of all or a portion of his property , is not punishable -- if the woman has been in intimate relations with him ; it is her payment .
If she be his wife fraud on her part is unnecessary , since the law expropriates him at her least request .
Other women have an impunity to commit fraud .
In case the man has not been in intimate relations , then the woman 's offence is , if punished at all , visited 35 by a tenth part of the sentence which would be inflicted if a man were the offender .
( b) Libel and Slander .
Cases are innumerable of men being sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for libel .
No case is ever heard of a woman being similarly sentenced .
The following are typical cases :--
At the Essex Assizes , February 2nd , 1895 , before Mr. Justice Mathew , Agnes Ellen Royce , a boarding - house keeper , pleaded guilty to demanding L 300 Dr. Edwin Worts , of Colchester , by menaces and threats .
Mr. Avory , on behalf of the prisoner , stated that the letters and telegram in which she threatened the doctor were written while she was in a hysterical condition , and he suggested that she should be bound over under the First Offenders Act.
Mr. C. F. Gill , who prosecuted , said that the prisoner accused the doctor of having ruined her , and made many serious allegations against him .
No doubt she was labouring under very great excitement when she made these charges .
She was discharged under the First Offenders Act.
" Catharine Matilda Gordon , forty - six , described as having no occupation , and living at Mardon 's Croft , Moseley , near Birmingham , was charged on remand , before Mr. Newton , at Malhorough Street Police Court , on Saturday , with unlawfully and maliciously publishing a defamatory libel concerning Mr Thomas James Hooper , on March 27th last , at the Badminton Club , Piccadilly .
The accused was not legally represented .
The prosecutor is a solicitor , and acts as Clerk to the Justices of the Peace at Biggleswade .
Mr. William Vyse , an independent gentleman and member of the Badminton Club , living at Wickham Road , Brockley , deposed that on or about the 27th of March last he received from prisoner the postcard produced .
Mrs. Gordon : ' I wish very much to apologise publicly , and 36 to withdraw everything I have said about Mr. Hooper . '
Mr. Hooper , in reply to the magistrate , said he regretted to say that he could not believe Mrs. Gordon , as he had received similar promises in writing which had been broken ; in fact , since the summons , which was issued before the warrant was taken out .
She had written to him enclosing a letter from her solicitors recommending her to withdraw .
Mr. Newton said that a woman who sent postcards of the nature referred to did the cruellest act imaginable .
The prisoner had done a most wicked act , and had endeavoured to blacken the character of the prosecutor , apparently without any reason whatever .
Probably there was not a single word of truth in her statements .
To the prosecutor : ' Do you think , Mr. Hooper , alter this caution , you may give her another chance ? '
Mr. Hooper : ' I think so , sir . '
Mrs. Gordon having assured the magistrate that she would not repeat her conduct , Mr. Newton bound her over in her recog- nisances in the sum of Â £ 20 to be of good behaviour in the future . " -- Daily Chronicle , May 4th , 1896 .
( c) Waylaying , Injuring Business , and Procuring Dismissal .
This method of extortion is practically open to all women , wives or not .
Medical men are peculiarly subject to this infliction , and even solicitors do not escape .
But persons in humbler station are not exempt .
The case of a police constable hanged for the murder of a woman some years ago brought the practice vividly , although temporarily , before the public mind .
The woman had for years waylaid him , called at the police commissioner 's office , obtained the suspension of the constable , and boasted of her intention of procuring his dismissal .
The man had no remedy .
In a fit of passion he killed the woman , when waylaying him at midnight on his beat , and was hanged for the crime .
( Case of Constable Cook , June , 1894 ) 37
( d) Murder .
The rule of the Common Law which prescribes hanging as the punishment for murder is practically abolished for females who murder men .
The best illustration of the extent of the women 's privilege to murder men will be found in the considera- tion of the number of cases in which women have been hanged during the last quarter of a century for the offence when , by a mere chance , they were convicted .
As has been stated , a woman who kills a man is usually acquitted .
If she be convicted , it is almost invariably of manslaughter , not murder .
If she be by some off - chance convicted of murder , an agitation for her release is usually started .
So the murderess escapes the gallows , except once or twice in a quarter of a century .
( e) Seduction .
The woman 's privilege of seduction is twofold -- in the Criminal Courts and in the Civil Courts .
In the Criminal Courts there is no punishment of an abandoned woman in society , or out of it , who corrupts the morals of a minor .
Even when disease is the result , there is no case on record of a prosecution , not to speak of punishment .
A contrary rule prevails in France .
So far has this revolting sex privilege been pushed that a boy of 14 can he convicted for committing an act to which he was incited by a girl just under 16 , although , as is well known , a girl of that age is often a woman , while a boy of 14 is usually a child .
This , however , does not exhaust the women 's privi- lege of seduction .
Not merely a female minor , but female adults are protected by exceptional law .
Any person who , by false representations , procures immoral relations with a woman not of known immoral character -- though the woman be 35 and the male culprit 14 -- is liable to imprisonment with hard labour for two years .
38 All lying representations on the part of a woman are permissible , though her sole motive for procuring the connection is to obtain a hold over the man by which to blackmail him .
When this statute was passed in 1887 it was said to be directed merely against criminal conspiracies of persons who , for purposes of gain , induced daughters of the people to have illicit relations with immoral rich men .
A judge has thoughtfully extended the statute to the undreamt - of case of a man inducing a woman of mature age to have connection with himself -- not with a third party .
The whip of the blackmailer has thus been humanely turned into a whip of scorpions .
( R. v. King , Monmouth Summer Assizes , 1890 . )
As an instance of the utter absence of the most elementary sense of impartial justice in the men and women who " run " this pro-feminist agitation , the following may be taken : -- One of .
the latest suggestions of this worthy crew is an enactment by which men who shall infect their wives with any venereal disease ( which they may , of course , have contracted before marriage ) should be made liable to severe penal consequences .
Now , we make no remark on the justice or injustice per se of this proposed extension of the criminal code .
But it is not proposed to make it an offence in the wife ; and it comes from the very people who are loudest in bawling at the wicked violation of the rights of holy womanhood involved in the Contagious Diseases Acts , by which it is sought ( not to punish women for infecting men , oh , dear , no ! ) but simply to prevent the spread of infection by women who make a trade of the sale of their bodies by compelling them to submit to examina - tion , and , if necessary , medical treatment .
No cases can , of course , he cited from the records of the Criminal Courts of the adult woman 's privilege of seduction , for the sufficient reason that the law does not regard it as an offence .
39
But the minor woman 's privilege is abundantly illus - trated because it is an offence for a male to allow himself to be seduced by her .
One wretch was produced as witness against several boys younger than herself whom she had induced to commit the offence .
The Court of Appeal held that she could not be punished , but her victims were consigned to prison .
( Central Criminal Court and Court for Crown Cases Reserved , June , 1894 . )
FALSE CHARGES ON OATH ( EXTORTION OR REVENGE ) .
It is not merely wives who are privileged to make false charges on oath , and to commit and to suborn [ incite ] perjury .
An extensive trade in such charges is pursued by an increasing number of women , encouraged by the absolute impunity which attends their profitable crimes .
Revenge for slighted claims plays a real though a very minor part in the manufacture of these accusations .
Potiphar 's wife has no monopoly of her methods of vengeance .
These cowardly criminals know that the worst they have to fear is the charitable conclusion that they are poor hysterical women .
Within the last few years there has been a large growth of enactments rendering legally punishable various offences against women and girls , and the zeal of the legislature for their protection has found an echo in the energy of the courts in the conviction of the accused .
It is in such cases as these that injustice is readily wrought by sex - bias .
There are no charges so easy to bring and so difficult to refute as accusations of sexual crime .
So well is this recognised that the most innocent man would gladly pay any sum rather than face such a charge .
The only defence is the proof of a nega - tive , always difficult and sometimes impossible , even to 40 sexual crime .
the most innocent .
A moral and well - spent life , a high character , the esteem of friends alike wither before this blasting charge ; they even add fuel to it .
This is shown by the extraordinary remark of one of our judges : " A good character only means that a man has not yet been found out . "
To the intrinsic difficulty of defence presented by the very nature of the alleged offence , the poverty of the man accused often adds a terrible aggravation .
The rich man can protect himself by all the resources of legal defence ; the poor man is left to the mercy of the wolves by his poverty ; which , although it may protect him from blackmail , yet gives him no security against malignant spite -- perhaps the most fruitful source of false accusa- tions .
England , unlike continental countries , provides no legal defence for accused persons .
This is serious enough in ordinary cases , but , in any trial in which a woman is concerned , it amounts to a refusal to a man of the commonest conditions of fairplay .
The public pro- secution of alleged offences against women devolves on the Treasury -- in other words , on the skilled advocates of the Crown , with the resources of the English tax - payer at their disposal in the preparation of cases and the procuring of witnesses .
The accused is left unde- fended , to contend alone against the prejudice of juries .
Public opinion and the press , which so ably voices it , are arrayed against him .
It is not , therefore , a matter for surprise that to be accused by a woman means , practic - ally , in the vast majority of cases , to be condemned .
The necessity for careful inquiries into the character and antecedents of witnesses is nowhere so great as in cases of offences against women and girls .
Charges so easy to make , so difficult to refute , ought to be regarded with the greatest suspicion , and not be accepted with ready credulity .
The bona fides [ good faith ] of all witnesses , the character of the accuser ought to he carefully scrutinised .
To the undefended prisoner this is impossible .
And even 41 if the prisoner is defended , sentimental juries are deaf .
Even where the character of the accuser is good , she may very well happen to be a woman of highly hysterical temperament .
The eminent French scientist , M. Brouardel , says of this type of woman : " She is essentially a liar , that is the true criterion of the hysterical woman .
Such a one has been known to keep at bay for several years law courts , doctors , her own family , with a rampart built of lies upon lies . "
Accu- sations of sexual offences are readily forced by such women , and unless the juries can be convinced of the irresponsible character of their statements , the liberty and honour of the most innocent man may be destroyed .
That distinguished judge , the late Baron Huddleston , in his charge to the jury on one occasion , referring to the Criminal Law Amendment Acts , stated that in his opinion , after an extensive experience of the Acts , men stood far more in need of protection against women than women against men .
The total oppression inflicted by charges of sexual crime must not be measured by the cases which come into Court .
It is a commonplace of the legal profession that for one such case ten are settled out of Court .
In other words , a system of blackmail of the worst type finds its direct incentive and opportunity in the present state of legal administration .
The following selection of a few of the cases arising in the years 1894 and 1895 gives some idea of the wide - spread evils of the present system .
It must not be thought for a moment that because these cases have resulted in acquittals no reform is necessary .
In view of the law of libel only cases where the accusations have failed can be cited , but every criminal lawyer knows that failure occurs in only a small minority of cases .
It must also be borne in mind that such charges entail social infamy unless triumphantly rebutted ; a mere will not suffice .

1.--Dr. Patrick Lyons Blewith ( West Ham ) was charged with a serious assault on Bessie Page ( age 16 ) .
On cross-examination she said she " did not consent , but never murmured , " " too frightened . "
Did not even tell the other people in the outer waiting - room .
Acquittal .
July 8th , 1894 2 . -- Alfred Lee , a vestryman , was charged on remand at Bow Street , with indecent behaviour in a public thoroughfare and in the presence of three females .
From the report of the officer who made enquiries it appeared that the witnesses bore very indifferent characters [ were impartial ] .
Three gentlemen deposed to the high moral reputation of the accused , who was discharged .
April 24th , 1895 .
3 .-- Sarah Adams ( West London ) at night met R. B. Pearson in the street , and picked his pocket .
When he attempted to retake the money she screamed and made " accusations against him .
She got one month .
August 19th , 1894 .
4 .-- Joseph Barker ( 52 ) , " coster [ produce seller ] , was charged by his daughter Eliza ( age 14 ) with indecently assaulting her .
Medical evidence revealed no trace of assault .
The prisoner denied the accusation , but was nevertheless committed for trial ( Islington ) .
April 29th , 1894 .
The Grand Jury threw out the bill [ charge ] .
5 .-- William Hughes and his son , colliers [ coal workers ] at Pontypridd , were accused of having violated Maggie , aged 12 , daughter of the elder prisoner .
The child swore she had been put up to make the charge by Ellen Haines , the prisoner 's housekeeper , and the doctors found no medical evidence .
The case was dismissed .
April 8th , 1894 .
6 .-- Dr. Thos. D. Griffiths , of Swansea , was accused by Mrs. Gwynne - Vaughan of committing adultery with her , also of perform - ing upon her an illegal operation and inducing abortion .
All charges proved false .
April 8th and 15th , 1894 7 .-- Thos .
Moore ( 44 ) , manager to a tea merchant , was charged with disgraceful conduct to a young girl .
He alleged that she began first by kissing him and poking him in the ribs .
He was acquitted .
May 27th , 1894 .
8 .-- Walter Hill was charged at the Old Bailey with indecent assault by Louisa Smart , and Ellen Windram was charged with aiding and abetting him .
Hill and Windram were also charged 43 with conspiring to incite Maria Wakefield , a married woman , to commit adultery .
The jury stopped the case and acquitted the prisoners .
It is to be noted that Mrs. Smart was prosecutrix about the same time in another indecent assault case , and that Ada Wakefield was prosecutrix in a similar case against her uncle which was dismissed .
September , 1894 .
In a paper read before the Birmingham and Midland Counties Branch of the British Medical Association , on November 9th , 1893 , the eminent surgeon , Dr. Lawson Tait , F.R.C.S. , thus sums up a large number of cases brought under his notice by the police authorities :--
Analysis Of Cases .
" In this way I have now reported in all upon nearly a hundred cases , and I have advised prosecution in only six , and in all of these have convictions been obtained .
It has , of course , been left to the police to prosecute as they chose on my report in twenty - two cases , and they have refrained from the prosecution in all but seven cases , and of these the bills were ignored in two cases by grand juries , in four light sentences were passed summarily or at sessions for com- mon assaults , and in one case punishment , probably well deserved , was obtained on a charge of wounding another person .
In the remainder , about sixty - six , I have advised that no effort at prosecu- tion should be entertained for a moment , and the police have aquiesced in my advice .
I say , concerning the number of the last class , ' about sixty - six , ' because a number of the cases involved charges concerning two children , so that reckoning from the number of plaintiffs there would be a larger number of cases than if the statistics were taken from a list of defendants , and one case in particular will show how curiously important this may be . "
In a further analysis he says : --
" Excluding the special groups I have already alluded to , and a few others , to be excepted for various but not important reasons , I find I am left with a list of nearly fifty , in which there was not the slightest surgical evidence of an assault of any kind having been committed ; and from the fact that only in some five or six was the 44 question of a charge on the reduced count even entertained , it must be clear that the amount of manufactured charges of this kind is most alarmingly large .
In twenty - six cases there was evidence quite satisfactory that the charges were trumped up from evil motive and in twenty - one the evidence was all in favour of accidental in - ducements , the children having been seen to be fondled by men of suspicious appearance
The first fact that strikes one about these cases is that the average age of the first group of children was within a small fraction of twelve years , whilst the average age of the second group is only seven years .
A second material fact is that whilst the second group contains a considerable proportion of children of respectable and even well - to - do people , the former group is entirely composed of children of the lowest class of the population . "
BLACKMAIL .
HE further states :--
" There are at least twenty cases on my list where no assault was committed , nor could have any been , consistently with the story and the appearances found , in which blackmailing was deliberately attempted ; and I regret to say in many it was successful .
One of the most outrageous was a charge of completely successful assault on a girl of fifteen , alleged to have been accomplished at 11 a.m. on one of the iron spiral staircases in the Municipal Art Gallery .
The complainant described the place and gave the date and hour with a precision which was remarkable , as also was her description of what took place .
She described accurately the attendant , whom she charged by name .
Only two things were against her -- she was uninjured , and the attendance books of the institution showed conclusively that the defendant had not been at the gallery that day . "
" WANDERING SERVANTS " AND FEMALE VIGILANCE COMMITTEES .
THE following passage from his paper throws some light on the origin of many of these charges : --
" The charges in a very large proportion of cases were distinctly based on motives sometimes of the most extraordinary kind , and in 45 the great bulk these motives were malevolent .
The ' wandering servant ' motive is one of the least harmful , and accounts for a small number .
To those who do not understand the phrase I may explain that it simply means that a girl who may have been quite innocently dawdling about till past the hour of return rigidly enforced by a strict mistress , does not go home , but wanders about all night or sleeps in an outhouse .
She is either found by the police or goes back home in the morning and concocts on the way a story of rape , particularised by the most minute details , not one of which is corroborated on examination , nor can the police find a scrap of evidence in support of her story .
Yet she becomes the interesting prey of some Vigilance Committee , and it is more by good luck than by good guiding , as the Scotch say , that she does not pick out and name some unfortunate man for the gratification of the prurient curiosity of the fussy women who have taken up her case .
In one of these cases brought to me the interesting wanderer by misfortune , selected as her victim the husband of the chairwoman of her committee , and thus trouble came upon her and the committee was dissolved . "
FORCING A MAN TO MARRY .
IN the following cases the facts are instructive as showing the use to which such charges may be put :--
" In one of the cases I regret having advised a prosecution , though technically I was quite right in doing so and bound to do it ; but now I have no doubt whatever that the assault was arranged and encouraged , and but for an untimely interruption something more would have followed .
The charge preferred was laid solely for the purpose of bringing an unwilling bridegroom to the altar .
This effect it had , for on the prosecutrix declaring in the witness - box that if he would keep his engagement and marry her she would with - draw the charge , a sympathetic judge advised him to take the offer , which he unwillingly did under pressure of receiving a nominal sentence .
The subsequent history of this couple has convinced me the whole thing was a plant on the unfortunate man . "
SPECULATIVE ATTORNEYS AND MILLINERS [ TRIFLERS . ]
IN some of the cases he examined the question of age was important :-- 46
" In a very few of these cases prosecution was not advised and not undertaken by the police on the question of either real or apparent age .
The wording of the Criminal Law Amendment
Act is made to supply a few of the omissions of the old law concerning rape , and in raising the age under which the consent of the female participator is not recognised , the Act puts the dangerous weapon into the hands of that person of showing that she des not appear to be sixteen .
This is a fertile source of blackmailing , because a girl of fifteen and a half has only to get a man to have connection with her , or to attempt it , and he is at her mercy .
If he will pay up his defence is easily arranged by the speculative attorney who is always at the back door of such cases .
He has only to plead that he had a discussion with the girl about her age , that he reason - ably believed she was over sixteen , and a little skilful millinery displayed in the witness - box settles the release of the defendant .
But if he wo n't pay up then the milliner can make the prosecutrix look much under sixteen , and a heavy sentence is the result .
To give an opinion on the part of a skilled expert that a girl is or is not under fourteen , the usual molimenal [ puberty ] age , is a matter of infinite ease compared to giving an opinion that the girl is or is not under sixteen .
Maturity has been reached , and the changes at fifteen and sixteen are far less than at thirteen and fourteen , a very important fact which has been forgotten . "
THE MOTIVE OF MALICE .
THE following passages show that spite is often as potent a motive in these charges as blackmail : --
" There is another and still more dangerous element in these cases , and that is the malice of persons , always women , who prac- tically get up the cases or provoke them , and with this may be placed a few subsidiary influences which may well be classed with this .
A few examples of some of them will be given in detail .
" Two children were brought to me ( case 56 ) , aged fourteen and eleven and a - half respectively , living in the same set of back houses in a well - known and fairly respectable street , the elder girl looking much older than her ascertained age .
The person against whom the charge was made was the father of the older girl , and she made the charge that she found her father indecently assaulting the 47 younger girl .
She told the neighbours and the neighbours brought in the police .
The younger girl proved to be quite uninjured , but it speedily came out that the elder girl was her own father 's regular mistress for more than two years .
The girl who was the cause of this action was one of the most virulent little minxes I ever saw , and she made no secret of her reason for splitting [ ratting ] on her father being the fact that she found him taking up with another girl .
I have included this little wretch as one of the habitual prostitutes , but I do not believe she comes under the definition .
She does afford , however , a perfect example of how the great bulk of these charges are brought about . "
FEMALE REVENGE ON FATHER OR HUSBAND .
THE following shows that a similar horrible charge may be brought against an innocent man :--
" Two little wretches , of ten and twelve , who had been thrashed by their father for stealing , promptly turned round on him with a charge of having ' seduced ' them both , giving here an interesting example of female revenge of the direst kind , attempted at an unusually early age .
The charge had not the slightest foundation , and they admitted as much when they found they were not believed .
Stepmothers give frequent examples of the same abomin- able attempts to punish their husbands by trumping up such charges , and in three instances mothers used even their own children as the instruments of their diabolical designs . "
PREJUDICE AGAINST ACCUSED .
As to the prejudice accusations of sexual crime incite , Dr. Lawson Tait says :--
" Matters are such under this unrighteous combination that how - ever men may laugh at it and make jokes , they do not willingly travel with single unknown female companions in railway carriages .
They know very well that for a man to have the finger of a woman pointed at him with a charge of a sexual offence is to secure that man 's extinction , no matter what the verdict of a jury may be .
In 1881 ( Lond . Med. Gazette ) a case was tried in which a girl , to shield 48 herself against her equal share of guilt , charged her partner in it with the crime of rape .
The jury could hardly be got to acquit the innocent man even though the prosecutrix had to admit that she never called out , her mother sleeping in the next room , because she was afraid her cries would waken the old lady . "
The following indicates strongly one of the disadvantages the undefended prisoner labours under :
-- DANGER OF RULE ALLOWING UNDEFENDED PRISONER TO GIVE
EVIDENCE .
" This new arrangement by which a defendantis allowed to go into the box and give evidence on his own behalf is most mis- chievous when a poor prisoner is undefended .
His poverty involves ignorance , of necessity , and in the hands of a prosecuting barrister his slightest slip in cross-examination will be made to tell against him mercilessly .
That is the case if he elects to be sworn .
If , on the contrary , he declines , either from ignorance or fear , the jury invariably reckons the fact against him .
" I sat through a case quite lately and saw a poor ignorant wretch who , being undefended , did not understand the purport of the invitation , neglected this opportunity .
The judge charged clearly in his favour -- indeed , there was hardly any evidence against him .
But the jury brought him in guilty , and in talking the matter over with one of them after I learned that they were much impressed by the fact that he did not give evidence . "
In considering the results arrived at by Dr. Lawson
Tait we must bear in mind that the series of charges he analysed had all been brought under the notice of the police .
The vast number of charges compromised for money , without any appeal to the police , must be added to form any fair estimate of the situation .
The foregoing catalogue as regards specific crimes is striking enough , but it does not quite exhaust the criminal law privileges of women .
As regards punish - ment , prison treatment and pardon , there are come additional immunities .
49
1. PRIVILEGE AS TO PUNISHMENT .
( a) Flogging .
The sacro - sanct hide of female fiends must not he touched with the lash .
Consequently , a wretch who tortures for years innocent children -- like the Montague wild beast -- must not be flogged .
The female garrotter must not be flogged .
By express enactment no one hut a male call he sentenced to corporal punishment .
( b) Hanging .
As has already been shown the punishment of hanging has been practically abolished for women who murder mere men .
If they murder some other woman or babies of some other woman it is quite a different thing .
They are , however , exempt from hangings if they murder their own babies .
( c) Duration of Imprisonment .
In every case the duration of the term of imprison - ment passed on a female offender is , as everyone knows , enormously less than the punishment imposed on a man for a similar or a lesser offence .
2. PRIVILEGE AS TO PRISON TREATMENT .
( a) Flogging .
Under no circumstances can a female prisoner he flogged for breaches of prison discipline .
Men and boys can be , and are , flogged like dogs for the most trivial disrespect to the governor and other officials .
( b) Less Rigid Discipline .
In one of the convict prisons a strike of female prisoners was announced against some disciplinary regulation to which they objected .
The obnoxious regulation was rescinded .
If they had been men they would have been flogged into submission .
( Riot at Wormwood Scrubbs , 1894 . ) 50
( c) Lighter Labour .
This is quite apart from the fact that they are assigned much less toilsome forms of labour .
3. PRIVILEGE AS REGARDS PARDON .
The comparative facility with which remission or commutation of sentence on female criminals can be procured is known to every solicitor conversant with Criminal Law Procedure -- not merely in cases of infan- ticide -- but in all cases of crimes of violence , the chances of pardon are immeasurably greater than in the case of a male .
The Civil Law . [ edit ]
As every litigant who has to contend with a woman knows to his cost , feminine privilege is not confined to matrimonial matters , nor to the Criminal Courts .
The purse of the male is hit in the Civil Courts quite as heavily as his person in the exercise of the criminal privileges of the female sex .
Anyone who has any relations , even of the most innocent character , with a woman , from a tenant or a trader who contracts with her to a casual guest at a friend 's house who makes her acquaintance in a social way , may have occasion to discover that absence of intimacy does not necessarily shield him from unpleasant consequences .
The chief privileges of women in the Civil Courts are as follows ( they can not be paralleled [ equalled ] by those of a peer or a member of the House of Commons ) :--
1. Freedom from Arrest for Debt if Married .
2. Property Of Married Woman Exempt from Seizure .
3. Privilege to Commit Breaches of Contract .
4. Privilege to Defraud .
5. Privilege to Seduce .
6. Privilege to Commit Adultery .
7. Privilege to Insult .
8. Privilege to Assault . 51
9. Privilege to Waylay .
10 . Privilege to Libel and Slander .
1. FREEDOM FROM ARREST FOR DEBT .
The process of imprisonment for debt ( nominally for contempt of Court in not paying an instalment of a debt ) is retained in England under the Debtors Acts , 1869 and 1882 .
But not in the case of the married female [ .]
No married woman is to be punished for non-payment of debt , and the Court is incapable of being contemned by a married woman .
This superiority to Common Law standard , for the mere male , yet again marks out the woman as a member of an inviolable noblesse .
A woman can obtain goods and not be compelled to pay for them , may use all her arts of persuading the chivalrous trader -- but no compulsory power of im - prisonment need disturb her .
This may or may not be a good rule , if applied as in certain American States , to both men and women .
But when reserved to women , it is an obvious sex privilege .
2 . PROPERTY EXEMPT FROM SEIZURE .
A married woman , as already pointed out , although rolling in wealth and owning tens of thousands a year , even when separated and released from all duty to her husband and children , retains her privilege of having her property exempt from seizure for debt .
Some very amusing cases -- amusing that is to all except the male litigant -- of rich women refusing to pay traders and solicitors will be present to the public mind .
When a rich woman develops a taste for litigation , the wisdom of the legislature has found no way of protecting the defendant from ruinous costs .
Even if she quarrels with her solicitor , he is powerless to protect himself against being mulcted in costs -- perhaps a happy stroke of poetic justice , as lawyers have largely created these oppressive sex-privileges of women .
( See the many ramifications of the Cathcart Case . ) 52
3. BREACH OF C ONTRACT .
The absence of any compulsory power over a woman 's person or a married woman 's property and the bias of the courts amounts practically to a licence for her to break any contract at pleasure .
This is quite apart from the peculiar privilege of women to waste a man 's time and money in a pretended engagement , possibly to lure on a more wealthy lover -- and to he exempt from penalty .
Their privilege to commit per- jury and slander with impunity plays a great part in the decision of any case in which a woman 's contract is concerned .
All stock brokers , insurance agents , soli - citors , and bankers , and business men generally , know how hopeless , as a rule , is any prospect of getting a contract enforced against a woman .
As a rule it is best to compromise or submit to injustice rather than try it out with an adversary privileged to use loaded dice .
4. PRIVILEGE TO DEFRAUD .
Precisely as in the Criminal Law , there is no real remedy against any fraud not of extraordinary magni- tude and clearness of proof , perpetrated by a woman on a man .
A notorious female blackmailer brings lying accusa - tions , suing on breach of promise of marriage , against a prominent Conservative member of Parliament .
She loses her suit as she has to admit on cross-examination that she a few months previously , had extorted Â£ 5,000 from another victim of a similar suit , which was hushed up .
But her victim could not get back his Â £ 5,000 -- and no one suggested civil or criminal process against her .
5. PRIVILEGE TO SEDUCE .
The feminine privilege of seduction extends also to the civil Courts .
No civil action lies against any woman of full age or the seduction of a minor , not even if her doings be a device to entrap him by thr
Comcast must feel it 's being attacked by all sides .
It 's been hit by lawsuits , investigated by the FCC , and roundly criticised everywhere else .
It has brought the issue of traffic shaping to the forefront of people 's minds , and into public discussion .
Aiming to highlight ISP's and their shaping , the EFF has released a new tool for users to test their connection 's integrity .
It ’s been about a year since we first broke the story about Comcast and their torrent - throttling practices .
Today , they were orderedÂ ( doc|pdf ) to cease their practices by the end of the year , and disclose their practices by the end of August .
Many expect Comcast to appeal , but others feel that Comcast has no grounds for it .
Regardless , Comcast is not the only ISP that is throttling .
As was revealed in the stats from Project Glasnost , Cox is also throttling heavily .
So , while some are popping the champagne corks over this victory , others are still working hard to keep our ISP ’s honest , and ensure that their customers are getting what they paid for .
The latest of these , is a project called Switzerland by the EFF .
Still in very early alpha , it ’s an attempt to not just detect sandvineing by an ISP , but other forms of throttling as well .
Unlike Glasnost , which uses a central server and known torrent streams to detect activities from the ISP interfering , this will use a more decentralised method , where peers running Switzerland swap information about the packets they send to other Switzerland users , in encrypted data packets sent via a central server .
In effect , it ’s a checksum of torrent activity sent via a 3rd party .
As Peter Eckersley , staff technologist for the EFF , and developer of Switzerland puts it “ Alice and Bob are exchanging packets , they connect to a neutral server ( Switzerland ) to arbitrate between their different views of the packets ” .
When asked why the EFF started this project , and why they believe a neutral network is important , he told TorrentFreak : “ There were several reasons why we started the Test Your ISP project , and designed and built Switzerland .
One reason was pragmatic : we were trying to run systematic tests of the interference that Comcast was deploying against P2P networks , and we decided that the only sensible way to do that was to build an automated sensor network .
So we set about doing that . ”
“ The bigger picture , of course , is that without transparency the Internet wo n’t remain the amazing open and innovative thing that it has been , ” Eckersley says .
“ And EFF ’s mission is to make sure that the Internet stays open and innovative .
We need to shine lights into the dark corners of the network , and make sure that ISPs are n’t setting themselves up in some control room and saying “ protocol A okay , but protocol B does n’t fit with our business plans , so let ’s give it second - class treatment or stop it from working entirely . ”
Some might worry that the client might open up people to being monitored by anti-p2 p companies or other undesirables , using the system as another method of verification , but there is really no way around it .
The simplest method to avoid that is , in Peters words , “ avoid exchanging copyrighted files between Switzerland clients .
The copyright risks are probably lower if you run your own Switzerland server , but it ’s still going to keep logs . ”
The question of what the FCC will do about these other ISPs and their traffic management is one to ponder .
Our inquiries on this matter have been acknowledged , but not replied to at the time of publication .
Public space has a loose definition .
It can be sidewalks , government buildings , or even streets , which account for nearly a third of the land area in an average city .
But in people 's minds , " public space " is a park or a forest or a beach – places associated with recreation , the out - of - doors and that " nature " thing we tend to divorce ourselves from .
Making a connection between the idea of public space and the mundane reality of potholes and rush hour can be difficult .
But by temporarily taking cars out of the picture , cities are converting the public space of streets into the public space of common perception .
It 's an idea that started out in Latin America more than 30 years ago .
The Colombian capital of Bogota began to prohibit cars from driving in certain parts of the city on Sundays , creating safer places for people to walk and bike .
The event picked up in popularity and has grown to cover more than 70 miles of the city 's streets , attracting more than a million residents every week .
Numerous other cities in Latin America and Europe have followed the lead of Bogota , but this is a trend that has only recently picked up in the United States .
Portland , Oregon held its first street closure in June , New York City held three similar events in August , and San Francisco had two of its own in September .
Chicago is the next major city to try it out , with two Sunday events this month .
The main idea in each of these cities is the same : get cars off the streets and people on them .
Bikers and pedestrians crowd the street in San Francisco for a recent street closure event , " Sunday Streets " .

These events came about largely as a reaction to the lack of public spaces and parks in many cities , which is endemic in the dense urban areas of Latin America .
By creating parks on the streets of the inner city , city dwellers living far away from proper public parks are able to do a little recreating in their own front yards .
The Chicago events , dubbed " Sunday Parkways " , are specifically aimed at providing public space where little is available .
" In Chicago you have the lakefront and you have Lincoln Park , but that only serves a specific geography , " says Margo O'Hara with the Chicagoland Bicycle Federation , one of a handful of community groups that is organizing the two Sunday events on October 5th and 26th .
The street closures they 've set up will take place several miles from the city 's major park areas .
" These are communities with the least amount of parkspace and the highest rates of asthma and obesity . "
Unlike other cities , Chicago 's events are not organized by the city .
The independent " grassroots " organizers are counting on the city to take notice this month and take the lead in the future .
" We 'd hope that the city would recognize the importance of an event like this , in particular in the neighborhoods that we 're targeting , " says Sunday Parkways organizer Adolfo Hernandez .
Connecting underserved communities was also the impetus for San Francisco 's recent " Sunday Streets " , which ran for 4.5 miles in the city , across town from its major open space , Golden Gate Park .
" It really did help bring people out and connect those communities and give those communities opportunities to have open space in their front yard , rather than having to pile on an hour - and - a - half long train ride or get in a car to go to Golden Gate Park , " says organizer Susan King .
Each of the " Sunday Streets " events drew around 15,000 people , according to King .
New York 's recent 8 - mile closure saw more than 50,000 people on the streets , and Portland 's 6.5 - mile event brought more than 17,000 .
Stacked up against weekly participation figures that top a million in Bogota , 500,000 in Guadalajara and 70,000 in Mexico City , the burgeoning U.S. events have some catching up to do .
But organizers in Chicago and San Francisco say that this year 's events are just the start .
" These are very much pilots where we 're testing to see what works , where is there a potential for growth , and where our limits are , " says Hernandez .
" But we 're definitely looking to make this part of the Chicago landscape . "
Joining the list of cities experimenting with street closures is Pasadena , California , which recently closed off a loop of road around the city 's iconic Rose Bowl stadium .
The area is heavy with pedestrians as well as amateur cyclists , who regularly swarm out in groups of more than 150 riders to train .
The loop 's unique oval shape and subtle incline are well known in the cycling community , but this popularity has also caused some problems .
With so many cyclists and pedestrians using the area and little organization , accidents have been known to happen .
Cyclists ride around Pasadena 's Rose Bowl during the city 's recent temporary car ban .
Hundreds of people showed up for the two - hour event .
Cyclists who ride the 3.3 - mile loop every week were excited about the closure , which took place on a warm Thursday evening at the end of September .
" This is the first time we 've had the whole enclosure blocked off to vehicular traffic , which will be very , very nice , " cyclist Mark Rich says .
" Hopefully this will be the start of something good for the city of Pasadena . "
The city seems keen to address the congestion issues at the Rose Bowl , but closing the road is just one idea up for consideration .
With police and traffic control costing the city about $ 4,000 for 2 hours of street closure , economics may prohibit a repeat .
" It 's not inexpensive to do this .
That 's one of the downsides , " says Bernard Melekian , Pasadena 's chief of police and interim city manager .
" Clearly it 's not something that we 're necessarily going to be able to sustain over a long period of time . "
Another option is to remove one lane of car traffic to accommodate the area 's non-motorized users .
But with more people coming out to walk , bike and recreate at the Rose Bowl loop , Melekian says something 's going to have to be done .
" I think that is the future .
Clearly people are finding different ways to recreate , different ways to work out , and they 're drawn to an area like this one .
We have to figure out how to manage it . "
Though it 's unclear whether Pasadena will be able to continue its road , event organizers in Chicago hope to host about five similar events next year , and King says she 's already planning one or two events per month from April to October 2009 .
These events are slow to pick up steam , but organizers seem confident that they 'll take hold .
It may be a long while before American cities go as far as cities like Bogota and kick their cars out every week .
But as more of these events take place and more people come out for them , there may come a drastic change in the way people think about their cities and the public spaces that surround them .

In an effort to further balance the game , Koraa levitated over to the Priest Beta forums to drop the bomb that Blizzard was canning all Priest racial abilities in an upcoming Beta build .
This comes long after Fear Ward , formerly a Dwarf racial ability for Priests , was made baseline and trainable at Level 20 .
However , Koraa makes a few important points , the most notable being that Desperate Prayer , the Human and Dwarf Priest racial ability , will become the 11 - point talent for Holy .
Holy Nova , on the other hand , will become baseline .
Desperate Prayer will likely be retuned to better fit an 11 - point talent ( it currently has a 10 minute cooldown ) .
Koraa adds that the formerly Undead Priest racial Devouring Plague will also become a baseline spell , with a reduced cooldown of 30 seconds ( down from 3 minutes ) and " greatly reduced " mana cost .
The Draenei racial ability Symbol of Hope will be renamed Hymn of Hope and also become a baseline ability , now restoring 5 % of total mana every 2 seconds for 8 seconds to the priest 's party members .
All other racial abilities , from Starshards to Shadowguard , will be removed from the game .
Enjoy them now before Patch 3.0 hits !
Yesterday , the Midwest Democracy Network–a nonpartisan alliance of 20 civic and public interest groups in the Midwest –released former U.S. Senator John Edwards ’ and U.S. Senator Barrack Obama ’s responses to a questionnaire on federal political and government reform issues .
The questionnaire was sent to all Democratic and Republican Party presidential candidates , but the two Democrats were the only ones that responded .
Regarding the limited participation in their questionnaire , the Midwest Democracy Network issued a statement saying that :
“ Unfortunately , the vast majority of the presidential candidates chose not to address voters ’ concerns about the health and direction of American democracy .
Their silence is disappointing , and , of course , the American people have every reason to feel let down and badly treated . ”
In their responses , Edwards and Obama took a number of positions calling for a variety of electoral reforms .
Both candidates said that they would strengthen the public financing system for presidential elections and both said that they would be willing to accept public funds for their campaign if their Republican challenger did .
They also both support voluntary financing of Congressional races and electronic filing for campaign finance data in Senate races .
In addition , the candidates support stronger limits to prevent the so - called “ Revolving Door ” where administration officials move into lobbying jobs after leaving government .
They also both support a variety of reforms designed to make voting easier , more effective , and less corruptible .
Michigan members of the Midwest Democracy Network include Common Cause Michigan , the League of Women Voters , and the Michigan Campaign Finance Network .

You decide .
Make sure that once you pick , you accept the logical consequences of your choice .
A man has made legal history as the first to be sentenced for downloading " Tomb Raider - style " computer - generated child pornography ...
The pictures were part of an illustrated story involving child abuse and incest - but involving no real children
The pictures on which Hoque was acquitted were " almost comic strips " with speech bubbles , the court heard .
The six pictures on which he was found guilty were so realistic , the jury concluded they looked like photographs .
" I think you 'll get some insight into the damage that children can suffer .
This may be on the fringes of it but it 's still an entrance , a door into a very murky and distasteful world . " [ said the judge . ]
They were among tens of thousands of images on his computer hard drive seized by the police in October 2006 , ranging from crude , simple illustrations to cartoon images to complex graphics .
Most were " fairly distasteful and disgusting , but perfectly lawful " , said the judge .
Britain -- where they have more surveillance cameras than jobs ( sadly , zing ) -- Computer generated still pictures .
No one thought he had molested anyone , and it appears no one even thought he was going to .
But the pics are more like heroin , the more you use , the more you want , and maybe then you might become a molester :
The problem with this argument is that it does n't fit the reality .
Are you sentencing him for possessing the pictures only , or because it leads down the path to wanting more ?
Because he already wanted more :
In other words , if he had the tens of thousands but not those six , is there no concern ?
If I had those six , but not the other ten thousand , would I get the same sentence ?
You have no idea , really , if it leads to molestation , that argument is a red herring .
If it was actually the real concern , then this would not have happened :
The judge did not ban Hoque from working with children .
The problem with policing a thought crime is that we can't agree on what is a crime , let alone a thought .
And if you do n't have the legal or physical ability to forbid someone from performing a physical action ( e.g. work with kids ) how do you plan on forbidding them from thinking things ?
These are not real kids , this is CGI .
As abhorrent as it may be , you can't regulate thought on the assumption it leads to behavior .
It is impossible to ask how many virtual child porn users molest .
There 's no way to verify either .
You can't argue that fake child porn will incite them to molest kids ; legal porn would n't get them fired up as well ?
Or the KMart catalog ?
Or a visit to the playground ?
Almost Supreme Court Justice - but - instead - we - got - Kennedy Robert Bork made the argument that pornography , especially child pornography , does n't deserve to be protected speech anyway .
Carefully , he hedges that while the government should n't have the right to outlaw such " speech , " neither does it have the right to prevent segments of society from curbing it themselves .
Supporting this nuance , he us that porn as a first amendment issue is a relatively new discussion , despite how the First Amendment , not to mention porn , actually is .
He 's right , but he 's perhaps purposely avoiding the question of whether it is ok to punish real people for , in essence , looking at stuff .
As I 've said elsewhere on the same subject , do n't confuse my neolib sentiments for actual lib sentiments : if you want to prevent child molestation , make it a capital crime .
But the focus has to be on the act , not the thought , because you can't measure the thought , neither does it translate clearly into act .

First detection of magnetic field in distant galaxy produces a surprise
Related images
( click to enlarge )
Using a powerful radio telescope to peer into the early universe , a team of California astronomers has obtained the first direct measurement of a nascent galaxy 's magnetic field as it appeared 6.5 billion years ago .
Astronomers believe the magnetic fields within our own Milky Way and other nearby galaxies — which control the rate of star formation and the dynamics of interstellar gas -- arose from a slow " dynamo effect . "
In this process , slowly rotating galaxies are thought to have generated magnetic fields that grew very gradually as they evolved over 5 billion to 10 billion years to their current levels .
But in the October 2 issue of Nature , the astronomers report that the magnetic field they measured in this distant " protogalaxy " is at least 10 times greater than the average value in the Milky Way .
" This was a complete surprise , " said Arthur Wolfe , a professor of physics at UC San Diego 's Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences who headed the team .
" The magnetic field we measured is at least an order of magnitude larger than the average value of the magnetic field detected in our own galaxy . "
The astronomers from the University of California campuses at Berkeley , San Diego and Santa Cruz used the world 's largest fully steerable radio telescope for their measurements — the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in Green Bank , West Virginia operated by the National Science Foundation 's National Radio Astronomy Observatory .
The young protogalaxy they probed , DLA - 3C286 , is located in a region of the northern sky that is directly overhead during the spring .
Until recently , astronomers knew very little about magnetic fields outside our own galaxy , having directly measured the magnetic field in only one nearby galaxy .
" And that field was n't as strong as the field we saw , " said Wolfe .
But a team of Swiss and American astronomers reported in the July 17 issue of Nature that an indirect measurement of the magnetic fields of 20 distant galaxies , using the bright light from quasars , suggests that the magnetic fields of young galaxies were as strong when the universe was only a third of its current age as they are in the mature galaxies today .
Wolfe said those indirect measurements and his team 's latest direct measurement of a distant galaxy 's magnetic field " do not necessarily cast doubt on the leading theory of magnetic field generation , the mean - field - dynamo model , which predicts that the magnetic field strengths should be much weaker in galaxies in the cosmological past . "
" Our results present a challenge to the dynamo model , but they do not rule it out , " he added .
" Rather the strong field that we detect is in gas with little if no star formation , and an interesting implication is that the presence of the magnetic fields is an important reason why star formation is very weak in these types of protogalaxies . "
Wolfe said his team has two other plausible explanations for what they observed .
" We speculate that either we are seeing a field toward the central regions of a massive galaxy , since magnetic fields are known to be larger towards the centers of nearby galaxies .
It is also possible that the field we detect has been amplified by a shock wave generated by the collision between two galaxies . "
" In either case , " he added , " our detection indicates that magnetic fields may be important factors in the evolution of galaxies , and in particular may be responsible for the low star formation rates detected throughout the gaseous progenitors of young galaxies in the early universe . "
" The challenge now , " said J. Xavier Prochaska , another member of the team who is a professor of astronomy at UC Santa Cruz , " is to perform observations like these on galaxies throughout the universe . "
Taiwanese MP3 manufacturer Luxpro has filed a lawsuit against Apple claiming the Cupertino , Calif . - based company achieved its dominance in the MP3 market through monopolistic behavior .
Filed in the United States District Court Western District of Arkansas , Luxpro says in the lawsuit that “ Apple has sought to stamp out the competition using various schemes ” and “ has repeatedly used unfair tactics against other smaller manufacturers . ”
In 2005 Luxpro showed its newest product at the CeBit tradeshow in Germany .
The “ Super Shuffle ” was a bit too much like Apple ’s iPod shuffle and Apple applied for and won injunctive relief from a German court .
Luxpro later renamed and relaunched the product under the Super Tangent name .
“ Apple , as part of its scheme to squash a competitor , then sued Luxpro in Taiwan alleging that the appearance of the Super Tangent , EZ Tangent , and Top Tangent closely resembled the iPod shuffle , ” the lawsuit reads .
“ Through a clearly one - sided submission by Apple when the lawsuit was filed , Apple was able to convince a Taiwanese court to enter a preliminary injunction that prohibited Luxpro from manufacturing , distributing and marketing any of its MP3 products . ”
Even though Luxpro won the case on appeal , the company claims that “ Apple ’s unlawful legal strategy caused Luxpro to lose valuable market opportunities and a considerable amount of product orders . ”
Luxpro also claims that Apple applied pressure to its business partners demanding they stop doing business with Luxpro .
Luxpro is seeking a jury trial and punitive damages “ to punish the conduct of the Defendant and to deter others from similar conduct . ”
This is n’t Luxpro ’s first lawsuit against Apple .
The company sued Apple in 2005 for $ 100 million claiming lost sales .
While Congress managed to pass a $ 700 billion financial - industry bailout before breaking for over a month to campaign , legislation to extend unemployment aid for 800,000 laid - off workers did not make the cut .
Their benefits will dry up as soon as this Sunday .
Negotiations late yesterday in the Senate for streamlined passage of a bill to extend emergency jobless relief by at least seven weeks failed when Republicans balked .
By evening , most senators had left town on election recess .
Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) said the Senate would reconvene the week of Nov. 17 .
After approving the bailout today , the House overwhelmingly passed ( 368 - 28 ) a jobless benefits extension essentially identical to the Senate version on an accelerated vote .
Speaking on the floor in support of the bill , Rep. Jim McDermott ( D - WA ) said he regretted that it was âa little bit late , â  but â I only hope the Senate is listening .â 
The quick passage could provide momentum for an extension in a lame - duck Senate .
Had the House reverted to lengthier deliberations , to be taken up after the elections , the fate of federal unemployment aid would certainly be shakier , Democratic congressional aides told ProPublica .
A spokesperson for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - KY ) , Don Stewart , said Republicans had refused an emergency vote on a benefits bill because Democrats gave no chance for debate or amendment .
â Itâs a huge spending bill , â he said .
The proposal has been estimated to cost $ 6 billion .
The Senate bill had previously been considered and rejected by Republicans as part of a larger economic stimulus package .
Sen .
Reidâs office told ProPublica that he had tried to attach the unemployment aid extension to the financial bailout passed by the Senate Wednesday night .
But Stewart said no formal unemployment insurance amendment had been proposed .
He said Republicans disagreed over the duration of any federal unemployment aid and how much should be given to each state .
Asked for details of a formula Sen.
McConnell or any party member could live with , Stewart provided none .
He said that , because the Senate is on break until mid-November , â there is no action to be had until that point.â 
Todayâs monthly unemployment update from the federal government showed the U.S. economy had shed jobs for the ninth straight month in September , with 760,000 jobs lost throughout the private sector in 2008 .
The rate of unemployment remained constant at 6.1 percent , or 9.5 million people .
It 's obvious to assume that your henpecking on a wireless keyboard could be intercepted by a RF - snooping ne'er - do - well , but what about your wired or laptop keyboard — that should be safe , right ?
Nope .
Researchers at Lausanne , Switzerland 's Security and Cryptography Laboratory ( part of the EPFL school ) have demonstrated here that 12 different keyboards , bought from 2001 until now , can be eavesdropped upon by monitoring their electromagnetic signatures — wirelessly , from up to 65 feet away , through walls .

.
This second video demonstrates the second set of their experiments .
The researchers devised four separate methods for EM eavesdropping , which will be detailed in specifics in a paper to be released after peer review .
The method for intercepting signals involves detecting the full spectrum of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a keyboard ( which are unshielded to keep costs and form factors down ) , and analyzing the specific change in signal over a variety of wavelengths for each key press .

It seemed like a simple request .
" Please add ' MAINT - CNTRL - ADMIN ' to the cost center dropdown for client # 876 . "
It was also Scott A's very first assignment , having recently started as a web developer for the B2B merchandise reseller .
The ecommerce application he was hired to maintain was ASP - based and had been developed over the course of several years by an outside consultant .
During the job interview , the system looked pretty decent : it tracked orders , inventory , products , etc .
The UI was n't wonderful , but it worked .
As for the request , Scott figured it'd be a matter of finding the cost center table and add a new row for that particular client .
If only it were that simple .
Since there was no " Cost Center " table — nor anything named anything similar — he decided to just trace the code to find where the dropdown got its data from .
That 's when the fun began .
The first thing Scott noticed was that there seemed to be a lot of include files .
And the include files included a lot of other include files .
And those files included even more files .
Functions were being called and objects being created that he could n't find the source for .
After a short while , the entire site began to seem like one giant " choose your own adventure " novel , and it quickly became clear that simply opening up the target page and looking for the drop down was n't going to be enough .
In desperation , Scott wrote a simple script that would trace all of the include files and display them in a nice pretty tree .
Surely , he'd be able to find the files he needed to look at after that .
Following is the output of what he got for one — yes , one — the pages within the website .

What 's the point of a cartel that can't control prices ?
Since OPEC moved up the date of its Vienna meeting and dialed up rhetoric about sharp cuts in oil production , prices for the OPEC basket of crude oil have actually fallen 11 % .
And if the prevailing wisdom explaining why crude prices are weaker is true , actual cuts by OPEC � which will become effective in December �probably wo n't do much to shore up oil prices much , either .
Look ...
The report from inside the McCain campaign brings to light an alarming fact : while McCain tells his supporters publicly to refrain from violent rhetoric , he continues to teach his volunteers rhetoric designed to elicit violent responses .
According to Time , McCain campaign staffers in Virginia are teaching volunteers to see Barack Obama as having terrorist ' friends , ' and then providing these volunteers with arguments for persuading voters that Sen.
Obama , like Osama Bin Laden , shares responsibility for bombings of the Pentagon .
In the article , Time 's Karen Tumulty recounts her visit to a campaign training session in Gainesville , VA , a strategic center for the McCain ground game in Prince William County .
What Tumulty describes is a training session hosted by by Virginia 's state GOP Chairman Jeffrey M. Frederick in which volunteers were being trained to see Barack Obama as a terrorist .
Tumulty writes :
The McCain campaign invited me to visit Frederick and the Gainesville operation on Saturday morning , to get a first - hand glimpse of its ground game in Prince William County , Virginia , a fast - growing area about 30 miles from Washington , D.C.
With so much at stake , and time running short , Frederick did not feel he had the luxury of subtlety .
He climbed atop a folding chair to give 30 campaign volunteers who were about to go canvassing door to door their talking points — for instance , the connection between Barack Obama and Osama bin Laden : " Both have friends that bombed the Pentagon , " he said .
" That is scary . "
It is also not exactly true — though that distorted reference to Obama 's controversial association with William Ayers , a former 60s radical , was enough to get the volunteers stoked .
" And he wo n't salute the flag , " one woman added , repeating another myth about Obama .
She was quickly topped by a man who called out , " We do n't even know where Senator Obama was really born . "
Actually , we do ; it 's Hawaii . ( link )
The report from inside the McCain campaign is disturbing on several levels .
While McCain has begun chiding his supporters at public rallies for using violent rhetoric , his campaign has taken the opposite tack behind closed doors .
Despite the public image of a campaign not responsible for the violent outbursts of a few followers , the Time report reveals a ground operation actually training its volunteers to elicit violent responses in voters -- specifically by making false claims about Barack Obama 's connection to terrorist attacks on U.S. military buildings .
The report confirms that the McCain campaign has staked its chances of winning the Presidency on convincing the public that Barack Obama is on the wrong side of the ' War on Terror ' and , therefore , his victory in the Presidential election would put the power of the White House in the hands of terrorists .
Tumulty 's report raises serious questions about whether or not John McCain is using campaign rhetoric that not only depart from recognized moral boundaries , but risk igniting actual violence .
In particular , by teaching his volunteers to see Barack Obama as similar to Osama Bin Laden -- and by training his volunteers to convince voters of the same -- McCain is using his presidential campaign to tie his Sen. Obama to the mass murders of September 11 , 2001 .
In this way , McCain is effectively teaching his supporters to believe that Sen .
Obama is not only connected to terrorists , but that Sen. Obama deserves the same punishment as terrorists .
In other words , by bringing to light the rhetoric being taught to his campaign volunteers , Time Magazine has provided the explanation for why attendees at McCain and Palin rallies have called for the death of Sen .
Obama rather than just his defeat , which would be the norm in such events .
When supporters of a Presidential candidate view the opposing candidate as merely an election threat , they call for his defeat .
But when they view the opposing candidate as a national security threat -- as they are being taught by the McCain campaign -- they call for that threat to be eradicated .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The role of the United States as the world 's economic leader will be tested this weekend when 20 significant world leaders meet in Washington to address the global financial crisis .
Some European leaders are hailing the summit as the next Bretton Woods - a reference to the historic talks in the latter days of WWII that , in effect , made the dollar the world 's dominant currency and laid the foundation for the economic order of the past 60 years .
The United States basically ran those meetings .
Close to prevailing in the war , it was the world 's undisputed military and economic leader .
But today , with the current credit crisis partly rooted in America , and with the rising economic might of China and a unified Europe , that dominance is being challenged .
" The Europeans see themselves as taking a position equal to the U.S. , " said Irene Finel - Honigman , an international affairs professor at Columbia University specializing in international banking .
" We 're looking at a different composition of players and a different powerplay .
It 's going to be fascinating to watch . "
Europe 's heavy hand
To bolster their position , the Europeans come to the meeting emboldened by their belief that the credit crisis did n't originate on their soil .
They say that means the more tightly regulated European banking model has triumphed over the more lax laws favored in America .
" The initial response was accusing the U.S. of cowboy capitalism , " said Finel - Honigman .
" But as the weeks passed , it 's become clear we 're all in this together . "
Together or not , deep divisions still exist between the United States and the Europeans , who initially called for this meeting and will be pushing an agenda heavy on new rules .
Their proposals include : Greater oversight of hedge funds and investment banks ; increasing how much money banks need to keep in reserve ; more transparent and universal accounting standards ; and limits on executive pay .
All that would be accompanied by a new global network of regulators - regulators that would presumably have power over U.S. banks , a potential non-starter with the Bush administration .
" Self - regulation to solve all problems , it 's finished , " French President Nicholas Sarkozy was quoted saying in the Guardian newspaper last month .
" Laissez - faire , it 's finished .
The all - powerful market that is always right , it 's finished . "
Moreover , the Europeans are expected to come to the talks presenting a more united front than ever .
And they are likely to use one voice to gain international support to counter U.S. policies which many blame for this crisis .
The United States
For the United States , the main goal of the summit will be to derail many of these new regulations , said Robert Brusca , chief economist at Fact and Opinion Economics , a Manhattan consultancy .
It 's a goal Brusca seems to fully support .
" The last thing we need is another powerless , toothless , cumbersome global agency , " he said .
" You need to let [ banks ] run their business , the government is n't going to run it any better . "
The Bush Administration is of the same mindset .
While Bush has agreed some more regulation is needed , particularly when it comes to unifying accounting standards and increasing transparency , he is wary of too much government involvement .
" We must recognize that government intervention is not a cure - all , " Bush said in statement just before the summit Thursday , which seemed almost designed to temper European expectations .
" History has shown that the greater threat to economic prosperity is not too little government involvement in the market - but too much . "
Brusca said the United States should instead focus on what he views as more fundamental causes of this economic crisis - mainly China 's unwillingness to let its currency , the yuan , rise in value .
The low yuan , Brusca argues , makes Chinese goods unfairly competitive , and prods U.S. consumers to buy too much .
This gives China its huge trade surplus , which it has used to buy U.S. Treasurys , mortgage - backed securities and other products that allowed all these banks to lend so freely in the first place .
" They have abused the rules of the game , and politically , this is very dangerous , " he said .
The Bush administration may raise this issue at the talks .
Getting China to raise the yuan was , after all , one of the administration 's highest priorities just a few years ago .
China , Russia , and everyone else
When a consensus is achieved by the G - 20 it carries a lot of weight .
With its 19 nations plus the European Union , it represents 90 % of the world 's economy and 75 % of its population .
But reaching a consensus is the toughest part for such a big and powerful group .
And at this summit , China , Russia , and most developing countries will be pushing for more power , not just within the G - 20 , but in other , more exclusive clubs like the G - 7 , the World Trade Organization , and the International Monetary Fund .
With all these nations pushing for such disparate things , it 's unlikely much will get done , at least this time around .
The Europeans are unlikely to push China to reform its currency because of what China will likely ask in return , said Sebastian Mallaby , a senior fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations .
" China is n't going to give up its export - led growth strategy for the sake of the international system unless it gets a bigger stake in that system - meaning a much bigger voice within the International Monetary Fund and a corresponding reduction in Europe 's exaggerated influence , " Mallaby wrote in a recent op - ed in the Wall Street Journal .
" Naturally , the Europeans are n't proposing it . "
And despite America coming to the table with a black eye from selling these rotten mortgage backed securities around the globe , nearly everyone says the country , with its massive economy and long history of solid stewardship , is still in the driver 's seat when it comes to setting worldwide economic policy .
" There is no other country that could offer the leadership that would cause the G - 20 to come up with anything even worth thinking about , " said George Magnus , a senior economic advisor at the Swiss bank UBS .
That means the Europeans are unlikely to get the type of oversight they 're proposing .
Combine the wide range of interests , the complexity of the problem , and the fact that the U.S. is being represented by a lame duck president - Barack Obama is not expected to attend - and it's unlikely anything will get accomplished besides , maybe , a commitment to meet again .
" I have quite low expectations of what 's likely to be achieved , " said Magnus .
" This is just the beginning of a long and crucial dialogue . "
Wall Street might be disappearing into a black hole , but the stars are aligning for Warren Buffett .
The veteran value investor has swooped in on Constellation Energy Group , the natural - gas and power company that lost more than half its value this week .
MidAmerican Energy Holdings , part of Berkshire Hathaway , has thrown Constellation a lifeline in the form of a tentative $ 26.50 - a- share takeover offer .

ACLU challenges FISA update with first legal brief RAW STORY
Published : Friday September 12 , 2008
Print This Email This
The ACLU filed the first legal challenge to the constitutionality of the FISA Amendments Act Friday , criticizing the law as a infringement of U.S. residents ' right to privacy .
The latest step in the ACLU 's prolonged lawsuit against the FISA bill , the brief accuses the federal government of broadening its surveillance far past what is needed to defend the country from terrorists , according to a press release from the organization .
" The FISA Amendments Act allows the mass acquisition of Americans ' international e-mails and telephone calls , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project .
" The administration has argued that the law is necessary to address the threat of terrorism , but the truth is that the law sweeps much more broadly and implicates all kinds of communications that have nothing to do with terrorism or criminal activity of any kind .
The Fourth Amendment was meant to prohibit exactly the kinds of dragnet surveillance that the new law permits . "
The organization claims the FISA Amendments
Act gives President Bush 's administration unchecked power to spy on civilians without providing any information about its actions or facing review from a court .
A FISA court has repeatedly denied ACLU requests for public access to hearings that might reveal how , if at all , the spying law 's constitutionality is being reviewed , RawStory reported .
President Bush signed the update to the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Survey Act ( FISA ) in early August , giving U.S. intelligence agencies the power to wiretap phones and eavesdrop on Internet conversations .
" The legislation I am signing today will ensure that our intelligence community professionals have the tools they need to protect our country in the years to come , " President Bush said during the signing ceremony , according to a transcript .
The legal documents associated with the FISA bill and the FISA Amendments
Act can be found here .
A recent post on the blog Reason : Free Minds and Free Markets details how the FISA act creates " fertile ground " for those looking for a convenient excuse for surveillance .
The ‘ green movement ’ has swept the world and architecture is at the forefront of the new industrial revolution – buildings being by far the biggest energy - sappers in the world .
Many contemporary architects are limited by the confines of budgets , time tables and constricting clients .
Some industrious innovators , however , are breaking convention and collaborating to launch our imaginations into the future of green design .
A surprising number of the following projects are even slated to be built .
Some of these structures are already in the works while others may never be fully realized .
All , however , share a visionary eco-friendly outlook that pushes the boundaries of contemporary sustainable design .
From floating eco-cities to sustainable skyscraper farms , modular folding origamic architecture to gigantic green super - spires , here are 24 future green designs that boggle the mind .

( Fortune ) --
A lending catastrophe has consumed homeowners , mortgage companies , and the financial system , but Robert Rubin , Citigroup 's director and executive committee chair , does n't seem particularly alarmed .
He told a small crowd at Manhattan 's Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art Wednesday that the problems now roiling the markets and forcing the Federal Reserve into a defensive posture are " all part of a cycle of periodic excess leading to periodic disruption , " and that we are not in fact on the verge of a financial meltdown .
And the economic problems that he did acknowledge were blamed on just about everyone but the major U.S. financial players .
Rubin said part of the problem is that we need a " more educated electorate " to hold politicians accountable .
Without that , the U.S. wo n't be able to overcome long - term economic challenges , like the troubles surrounding social security and budget deficits , or the new problems created by globalization .
Rubin 's remarks seemed glib given that the financial world looks very much ready to melt down .
To wit : Standard & Poor 's issued a report , also Wednesday , saying that financial institutions - including credit unions and some Asian banks - could lose more than $ 265 billion as a result of subprime mortgage contagion , up from an earlier estimated $ 130 billion .
And so far , Wall Street 's premiere banks have only taken $ 90 billion in writedowns .
Additionally , bond insurer MBIA said write - downs in its credit derivatives portfolio rose to $ 3.5 billion in its most recent quarter .
The news upped the chances that the insurer will be downgraded by the ratings agencies , which would set off another huge round of losses for banks and other holders of subprime laden bonds .
It would also hurt prices of municipal bonds , which local governments issue to fund necessary items like infrastructure projects .
Rubin briefly walked the crowd though the journey from irresponsible subprime loan origination to the frozen credit markets , but did n't dwell on the problems at hand .
Instead the former Treasury Secretary addressed the role of government in the economy .
" The key to our future is how well or badly politicians address the economic issues we face , " he said .
He added that politicians must face the " brutal politics around entitlement programs , " cut spending and be willing to shrink the deficit using unpopular tools like higher corporate taxes .
While he did not endorse a candidate Wednesday , he has already thrown his support behind Hillary Clinton .
Rubin may be correct in his assessment of issues like entitlement programs , but this was hardly the speech one would expect from a man whose bank has written down more than $ 24 billion in losses due in large part to greed , cynicism , and bad judgment .
Rubin has been a director and chair of Citigroup 's ( C , Fortune 500 ) executive committee since 1999 , overseeing a period during which the bank took on huge risks that it is paying dearly for now .
He did n't talk about Citi , but when asked he defended both former chief executive Charles Prince and the decision to replace him with Vikram Pandit .
Also at the root of the country 's larger economic problems and one of the most serious deterrents to growth , Rubin said , is the wealth gap .
He added that this is a global problem .
" It 's a paramount task for policy makers to understand why market economy and globalization are associated with severe income distribution issues in almost every country ; and then they must create policy to address the problem . "
He also chided American consumers for their spendthrift ways , pointing out that personal savings amounts to only 2 % of the U.S. economy , vs. 40 % in China .
At the same time he acknowledged that our short - term economic fate rests with consumer spending .
He had lots of advice , but Rubin was stumped when asked where the U.S. fit into a world where China has become the global factory , Brazil the world 's farmer , and India its back office .
" We can do all of these things , but we have to invest in what we have to invest in , which is education , " he said .
But his answer was uneasy .
After all , globalization has made the U.S. the world 's manager and financier , a job that his bank has just screwed up on a massive scale .
By the time he finished , Rubin , a thin , graying , distinguished man with a genial manner had charmed the academic crowd .
He had catered to their sense of vanity by excoriating politics and elevating the role of higher education .
The elephant in the room , of course , was the fact that risky bets at leading financial institutions like Citi , Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) , and Bear Stearns have damaged Wall Street 's reputation as the world 's leading financial hub .
Moreover , as sovereign wealth funds bail them out , it is plain that rampant greed , arrogance and cynicism at places like Citi threaten to handicap our country 's welfare in this era of global economic transformation .
Indeed , at the very beginning of the evening , before Rubin had taken the podium , the event was marred by a pair of aging , scruffy protestors who shouted , " Bob Rubin has no answers except war , genocide , and hypocrisy ! "
They may have been wrong about the war and the genocide , but as far as hypocrisy goes they were spot on .

Here ’s what we ’ve all been waiting for : for the first time , astronomers have taken pictures of a multi- planet solar system , much like ours , orbiting another star .
This coincides with announcement of the first visible light image of an extrasolar planet taken by the Hubble Space Telescope .
This new solar system orbits a dusty young star named HR8799 , which is 140 light years away and about 1.5 times the size of our sun .
Three planets , roughly 10 , 10 and 7 times the mass of Jupiter , orbit the star .
The size of the planets decreases with distance from the parent star , much like the giant planets do in our system .
And there may be more planets out there , but scientists say they just have n’t seen them yet .
“ We ’ve been trying to image planets for eight years with no luck and now we have pictures of three planets at once , ” said Bruce Macintosh , an astrophysicist from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory .
Using high - contrast , near - infrared adaptive optics observations with the Keck and Gemini telescopes , the team of researchers were able to see three orbiting planetary companions to HR8799 .
Astronomers have known for a decade through indirect techniques that the sun was not the only star with orbiting planets .
“ But we finally have an actual image of an entire system , ” Macintosh said .
“ This is a milestone in the search and characterization of planetary systems around stars . ”
The planets are 24 , 37 and 67 times the Earth - sun separation from the host star .
The furthest planet in the new system orbits just inside a disk of dusty debris , similar to that produced by the comets of the Kuiper belt of our solar system ( just beyond the orbit of Neptune at 30 times Earth - sun distance ) .
“ HR8799 ’s dust disk stands out as one of the most massive in orbit around any star within 300 light years of Earth ” said UCLA ’s Ben Zuckerman .
The host star is known as a bright , blue A - type star .
These types of stars are usually ignored in ground and space - based direct imaging surveys since they offer a less favorable contrast between a bright star and a faint planet .
But they do have an advantage over our sun :
Early in their life , they can retain heavy disks of planet - making material and therefore form more massive planets at wider separations that are easier to detect .
In the recent study , the star also is young – less than 100 million years old – which means its planets are still glowing with heat from their formation .
“ Seeing these planets directly – separating their light from the star – lets us study them as individuals , and use spectroscopy to study their properties , like temperature or composition , ” Macintosh said .
During the past 10 years , various planet detection techniques have been used to find more than 200 exoplanets .
But these methods all have limitations .
Most infer the existence of a planet through its
influence on the star that it orbits , but do n’t actually tell scientists anything about the planet other than its mass and orbit .
Second , the techniques are all limited to small to moderate planet - star separation , usually less than about 5 astronomical units .
The planets themselves each appear very interesting .
“ Detailed comparison with theoretical model atmospheres confirms that all three planets possess complex atmospheres with dusty clouds partially trapping and re-radiating the escaping heat ” said LowellObservatory astronomer Travis Barman .

THE autumn of 2008 marks the end of an era .
After a generation of standing ever further back from the business of finance , governments have been forced to step in to rescue banking systems and the markets .
In America , the bulwark of free enterprise , and in Britain , the pioneer of privatisation , financial firms have had to accept rescue and part - ownership by the state .
As well as partial nationalisation , the price will doubtless be stricter regulation of the financial industry .
To invert Karl Marx , investment bankers may have nothing to gain but their chains .
The idea that the markets have ever been completely unregulated is a myth : just ask any firm that has to deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) in America or its British equivalent , the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) .
And cheap money and Asian savings also played a starring role in the credit boom .
But the intellectual tide of the past 30 years has unquestionably been in favour of the primacy of markets and against regulation .
Why was that so ?
Each step on the long deregulatory road seemed wise at the time and was usually the answer to some flaw in the system .
The Anglo - Saxon economies may have led the way but continental Europe and Japan eventually followed ( after a lot of grumbling ) in their path .
It all began with floating currencies .
In 1971 Richard Nixon sought to solve the mounting crisis of a large trade deficit and a costly war in Vietnam by suspending the dollar 's convertibility into gold .
In effect , that put an end to the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates which had been created at the end of the second world war .
Under Bretton Woods , capital could not flow freely from one country to another because of exchange controls .
As one example , Britons heading abroad on their annual holidays in the late 1960s could take just £ 50 ( then $ 120 ) with them .
Investing abroad was expensive , so pension funds kept their money at home .
Once currencies could float , the world changed .
Companies with costs in one currency and revenues in another needed to hedge exchange - rate risk .
In 1972 a former lawyer named Leo Melamed was clever enough to see a business in this and launched currency futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange .
Futures in commodities had existed for more than a century , enabling farmers to insure themselves against lower crop prices .
But Mr Melamed saw that financial futures would one day be far larger than the commodities market .
Today 's complex derivatives are direct descendants of those early currency trades .
Perhaps it was no coincidence that Chicago was also the centre of free - market economics .
Led by Milton Friedman , its professors argued that Keynesian economics , with its emphasis on government intervention , had failed and that markets would be better at allocating capital than bureaucrats .
After the economic turmoil of the 1970s , the Chicago school found a willing audience in Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher , who were elected at the turn of the decade .
The duo believed that freer markets would bring economic gains and that they would solidify popular support for the conservative cause .
A nation of property - owners would be resistant to higher taxes and to left - wing attacks on business .
Liberalised markets made it easier for homebuyers to get mortgages as credit controls were abandoned and more lenders entered the home - loan market .
Another consequence of a system of floating exchange rates was that capital controls were not strictly necessary .
Continental European governments still feared the destabilising effect of hot money flows and created the European Monetary System in response .
But Reagan and Mrs ( now Lady )
Thatcher took the plunge and abolished controls .
The initial effects were mixed , with sharp appreciations of the dollar and pound causing problems for the two countries ' exporters and exacerbating the recession of the early 1980s .
But the result was that institutions , such as insurance companies and pension funds , could move money across borders .
In Britain that presented a challenge to the stockbrokers and marketmakers ( known as jobbers ) who had controlled share trading .
Big investors complained that the brokers charged too much under an anti-competitive system of fixed commissions .
At the same time , big international fund - managers found that the tiny jobbing firms had too little capital to handle their trades .
The Big Bang of 1986 abolished the distinction between brokers and jobbers and allowed foreign firms , with more capital , into the market .
These firms could deal more cheaply and in greater size .
New York had introduced a similar reform in 1975 ; in America 's more developed domestic market , institutional investors had had the clout to demand the change long before their British counterparts .
These reforms had further consequences .
By slashing commissions , they contributed to the long - term decline of broking as a source of revenue .
The effect was disguised for a while by a higher volume of transactions .
But the broker - dealers increasingly had to commit their own capital to deals .
In turn , this made trading on their own account a potentially attractive source of revenue .
Over time , that changed the structure of the industry .
Investment ( or merchant ) banks had traditionally been slim businesses , living off the wits of their employees and their ability to earn fees from advice .
But the need for capital led them either to abandon their partnership structure and raise money on the stockmarket or to join up with commercial banks .
In turn , that required the dilution and eventually , in 1999 , the abolition of the old Glass - Steagall act , devised in the Depression to separate American commercial and investment banking .
Commercial banks were keen to move the other way .
The plain business of corporate lending was highly competitive and retail banking required expensive branch networks .
But strong balance - sheets gave commercial banks the chance to muscle investment banks out of the underwriting of securities .
Investment banks responded by getting bigger .
Expansion and diversification took place against a remarkably favourable background .
After the Federal Reserve , then chaired by Paul Volcker , broke the back of inflation in the early 1980s , asset prices ( property , bonds , shares ) rose for much of the next two decades .
Trading in , or lending against , such assets was very profitable .
And during the “ Great Moderation ” recessions were short , limiting the damage done to banks ' balance - sheets by bad debts .
As the financial industry prospered , its share of the American stockmarket climbed from 5.2 % in 1980 to 23.5 % last year ( see chart 1 ) .
Risky business
As banks ' businesses became broader , they also became more complex .
With the help of academics , financiers started to unpick the various components of risk and trade them separately .
Again , Chicago played its part .
Option contracts were known in ancient history but the 1970s saw an explosion in their use .
Two academics who had studied , or taught , at the University of Chicago , Fischer Black and Myron Scholes , developed a theory of option pricing .
And the Chicago Board Options Exchange was set up in 1973 as a forum for trading .
Whereas futures contracts lock in the participants to buy or sell an asset , an option is more like insurance .
The buyer pays a premium for the right to exercise his option should prices move in a set direction .
If prices do not move that way , the option lapses and the buyer only loses the premium .
The Black - Scholes formula shows that an option 's value depends on the volatility of the underlying assets .
The more the price moves , the more likely the option is to be exercised .
Calculating that volatility was made a lot easier by the growing power of computers .
The next great development in risk management was the swap .
Bond markets had been domestic , with buyers focusing on issuers from their home markets .
That created the potential for arbitrage , issuing bonds in one currency and swapping them for another , creating lower interest rates for both borrowers .
It was a short step from currency swaps to interest - rate swaps .
Borrowers on floating ( variable ) rates could swap with those on a fixed rate .
This allowed company finance directors ( and speculators ) to change their risk exposure depending on their view of where rates would go .
Rather than pay each other 's interest costs directly , the payments would be netted out .
The final stage emerged only in the past decade .
A credit - default swap ( CDS ) allows investors to separate the risk of interest - rate movements from the risk that a borrower will not repay .
For a premium , one party to a CDS can insure against default .
From almost nothing just a few years ago , CDSs grew at an explosive rate until recently ( see chart 2 ) .
Futures , options and swaps all have the same characteristic : a small initial position can lead to a much larger exposure .
Futures contracts are bought with only a small deposit or margin ; option sellers have to cover buyers ' losses , which may be many times the value of the premium ; the net exposure of a swap counterparty may be smaller but the gross position will be huge , a problem if the counterparty defaults .
This made it hard for regulators to keep track of a firm 's exposure .
For years , therefore , they concentrated on improving the infrastructure of the market , making sure that deals were well documented or settled through a central clearing house ( something yet to be achieved for CDSs ) .
The biggest hiccup in the growth of the derivatives markets came after the 1987 stockmarket crash , when a technique known as portfolio insurance took a lot of the blame .
This involved investors selling stock - index futures to protect themselves from falls in the value of their portfolios .
The problem was that the two markets acted on each other ; as the futures price fell , so did the cash value of shares , forcing institutions to sell more futures and so on .
That prompted the American authorities to introduce “ circuit breakers ” , limiting the use of portfolio insurance at difficult times .
Derivatives caused more embarrassment in the 1990s as naive local authorities , such as Orange County in California , and corporate treasury departments lost fortunes in contracts they did not understand .
But gradually the authorities learnt to love these markets ; Frankfurt , for example , competed hard to win trading in German government - bond futures away from London .
The theory was that , by allowing business and investors to spread risk , both markets and economies would become more robust .
Alan Greenspan , the chairman of the Fed from 1987 to 2006 , was in the vanguard of this view .
In his book , “ The Age of Turbulence ” ( 2007 ) , he welcomed the growth of CDSs , arguing : “ Being able to profit from the loan transaction but transfer credit risk is a boon to banks and other financial intermediaries which , in order to make an adequate rate of return on equity , have to heavily leverage their balance sheets by accepting deposit obligations and / or incurring debt .
A market vehicle for transferring risk away from these highly leveraged loan originators can be critical for economic stability , especially in a global environment . ”
Securitisation , which has been at the centre of the current crisis , is another child of the 1970s .
It involves bundling loans into packages that are then sold to outside investors .
The first big market was for American mortgages .
When homeowners pay their monthly payments , these are collected by the servicing agent and passed through to investors as interest payments on their bonds .
Again , this business was encouraged by the authorities as a means of spreading risk .
Everybody appeared to win .
Banks earned fees for originating loans without the burden of holding them on their balance - sheets ( which would have restricted their ability to lend to others ) .
Investors got assets that yielded more than government bonds and represented claims on a diversified group of borrowers .
No wonder securitisation grew so fast ( see chart 3 ) .
These asset - backed securities became ever more complex .
Securitisation eventually gave rise to collateralised debt obligations , sophisticated instruments that bundled together packages of different bonds and then sliced them into tranches according to investors ' appetite for risk .
The opacity of these products has caused no end of trouble in the past 18 months .
More fundamentally , securitisation opened a new route to growth for banks .
No longer were commercial banks dependent on the slow , costly business of attracting retail deposits .
Securitisation allowed them to borrow in the markets .
Few imagined that the markets would not be open at all times .
In 2007 Northern Rock , a British mortgage lender , was the first spectacular casualty of this false assumption ; many more banks have been caught out in 2008 .
Asleep at the wheel ?
While all this was happening , regulators were not wholly passive .
They had to deal with crises such as the failures of Drexel Burnham Lambert , which dominated the junk - bond market , and Baring Brothers , a British bank brought low by a rogue trader .
But these were regarded as individual instances of mismanagement or fraud , rather than as evidence of a systemic problem .
Even the American savings - and - loan crisis , an early deregulation disaster , was tidied up with the help of a bail - out plan and easy monetary policy , and dismissed as an aberration .
Rather than question the principle of deregulation , some governments redesigned their regulatory structures .
Britain devised the FSA in 1997 ( even taking away banking regulation from the Bank of England ) in a conscious attempt to create a single supervisory body .
In America the SEC shares authority with the Commodities Futures Trading Commission , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , state insurance commissioners and so on .
The authorities did make a more fundamental attempt to regulate the banks with the Basel accord .
The first version of this , in 1988 , established minimum capital standards .
Banks have always been a weak link in the financial system because of the mismatch between their assets and liabilities .
The assets are usually long - term loans to companies and consumers .
The liabilities are deposits by consumers and investors that can be withdrawn overnight .
A bank run is hard to resist , since a bank cannot realise its assets quickly ; worse still , doing so — by calling in loans — may cause economic havoc by prompting bankruptcies and job losses .
The Basel accord was designed to deal with a different problem : that big borrowers might default .
It required banks to set aside capital against such contingencies .
Because this is expensive , banks looked for ways around the rules by shifting assets off their balance - sheets .
Securitisation was one method .
The structured investment vehicles that held many subprime - mortgage assets were another .
And a third was to cut the risk of borrowers defaulting , using CDSs with insurers like American International Group .
When the markets collapsed , these assets threatened to come back onto the balance - sheets , a prime cause of today 's problems .

It would be a mistake to argue that , had politicians rather than bankers been in charge , policy would have been more prudent .
Indeed , politicians encouraged banks to make riskier loans .
This was particularly true in America , where a series of measures , starting with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 , required banks to meet the credit needs of the “ entire community ” .
In practice , this was social policy : it meant more lending to poor people .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the two government - sponsored giants of the mortgage market , were encouraged to guarantee a wider range of loans in the 1990s .
The share of Americans who owned their homes rose steadily .
But more buyers meant higher prices , making loans even less affordable to the poor and requiring even slacker lending standards .
The seeds of the subprime crisis were sown , and the new techniques of securitisation allowed banks to make these loans and then offload them quickly .
Initially , the growth of homeownership was seen as a benign effect of deregulation , as was the ability of consumers to borrow on their credit cards , a habit they took to enthusiastically .
The authorities largely welcomed this boost to consumer demand .
In the 1970s and 1980s , they might have worried about the effect on inflation or the trade deficit .
But technological change in the 1990s , and the impact of China and India in the 2000s , kept headline inflation down , while liberalised capital markets and Asian savings made external deficits easy to finance .
In addition , those countries with big financial centres were delighted to have them because of the tax revenues they yielded .
That hardly encouraged them to look too closely at the financial industry .
Nor did it hurt that political parties in both America and Britain received a lot of contributions from financiers .
Liberalisation happened for many reasons .
Often , regulators were simply trying to catch up with the real world — for instance , the rapid development of offshore markets .
In addition , deregulation provided things that voters wanted , such as cheap loans .
Each financial innovation that came along became the object of speculation that was fuelled by cheap money .
Bankers and traders were always one step ahead of the regulators .
That is a lesson the latter will have to learn next time .
Amid the crisis of 2008 , it is easy to forget that liberalisation had good consequences as well : by making it easier for households and businesses to get credit , deregulation contributed to economic growth .
Deregulation may not have been the main cause of the rise in living standards over the last 30 years , but it helped more than it harmed .
Will the new , regulated world be as benign ?
MARBURG , Germany —
This fairy - tale town is stuck in the middle of a utopian struggle over renewable energy .
The town council ’s decision to require solar - heating panels has thrown Marburg into a vehement debate over the boundaries of ecological good citizenship and led opponents to charge that their genteel town has turned into a “ green dictatorship . ”
The town council took the significant step in June of moving from merely encouraging citizens to install solar panels to making them an obligation .
The ordinance , the first of its kind in Germany , will require solar panels not only on new buildings , which fewer people oppose , but also on existing homes that undergo renovations or get new heating systems or roof repairs .
To give the regulation teeth , a fine of 1,000 euros , about $ 1,500 , awaits those who do not comply .
Critics howled that the rule , which is to go into effect on Oct. 1 , constituted an attack on the rights of property owners .
The regional government in Giessen stepped in and warned that it would overturn the rule .
City officials in Marburg said , in turn , that they would take their case either to administrative court or all the way to the Hessian state capital , where they would try to get the state building code changed to protect their ordinance from officials in Giessen .
The egg normally travels down the fallopian tube from the ovary to the womb
Reactions to cannabinoid chemicals were important for the embryo to move along the fallopian tube towards the womb , animal experiments showed .
The Vanderbilt University scientists told Nature Medicine their findings could be important for understanding why ectopic pregnancies can occur .
This is when the embryo starts to grow outside the womb .
Ectopic pregnancy
The researchers recommended more research to find out whether cannabis use might increase the risk of ectopic pregnancies .
In normal pregnancy , eggs make their way from the ovaries to the womb through the fallopian tubes , where they may be fertilised by a sperm .
The fertilised egg continues on to the womb , where it implants itself to the wall and continues to grow .
In ectopic pregnancy , the fertilised egg takes an alternative route and can implant itself outside of the womb .
Most often it implants in the fallopian tubes themselves , but it can also latch on to the ovary , the abdomen , or the cervix .
According to Dr Sudhansu
Dey and colleagues , marijuana is one of the most popular illicit drugs used by pregnant women , raising concern about its affects during pregnancy .
Our results raise caution for women of reproductive ages regarding chronic marijuana consumption for recreation or pain alleviation
The study authors
Researchers had already found receptors in mouse embryos that respond to cannabis - like chemicals .
The same receptors have also been found in the wombs of humans .
Dr Dey 's team decided to investigate the role of these receptors by blocking their action .
When they were blocked the normal journey of mouse embryos along the fallopian tube towards the womb was disrupted .
Cannabis
The researchers said their findings had major implications for ectopic pregnancy in women because the fallopian tubes the site where most occur .
" It remains to be seen whether the incidence of ectopic pregnancy is associated with ... chronic use of cannabinoids , " they said .
It 's such a neglected area of research , despite one pregnancy in every 80 being ectopic
Professor Bill Ledger , consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Sheffield University
But they added : " Collectively , our results raise caution for women of reproductive ages regarding chronic marijuana consumption for recreation or pain alleviation . "
They said tobacco smoking was already known to increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy and had been shown to impair the journey of rat embryos along the reproductive tract .
Professor Bill Ledger , consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Sheffield University , said : " It 's very interesting and it would merit more human research to see if cannabinoid receptors are present in the human fallopian tube .
" But to say that women who smoke cannabis socially are at high risk of ectopic pregnancy would be a step too far at this stage .
" The major causes of ectopic pregnancies are sexually transmitted infections and other things that damage the fallopian tubes like endometriosis and previous surgery .
" We know the risk factors and we are getting better at detecting ectopic pregnancies and treating them .
" But we need much more research like this looking at exactly why they occur .
" It 's such a neglected area of research , despite one pregnancy in every 80 being ectopic , " he said .
Sue Jacob from the Royal College of Midwives said : " We need to look at the bigger picture .
" The rise in sexually transmitted infections , the rise in alcohol binging and the rise in drug taking all have an impact on sexual health .
" Ectopic pregnancies need to be researched further in light of these behaviours , " she said .
" There is a huge number of capable and talented women at Ernst & Young looking to maximise their achievement in the firm and in their career , and looking for the skills and tips and tools to do that .
' Black Silicon ' Could Revolutionize Solar Cell Technology
October 12th , 2008 by Andrew Williams
A newly discovered material called ‘ black silicon ’ is between 100 and 500 times more sensitive to light than conventional silicon , and could be used to revolutionize solar energy generation .
The material was discovered when a team of Harvard University scientists shone an ultra-powerful laser ( briefly producing the same amount of energy as the sun falling on the entire surface of the Earth ) on a silicon wafer , before adding sulphur hexafluoride .
The result was a silicon wafer that looked black to the naked eye , but when examined under an electron microscope turned out to be covered with a massive amount of ultra-tiny spikes .
The substance has since been found to be incredibly sensitive to light , leading to a range of exciting plans for commercialization , including night - vision and infra-red imaging systems .
According to James Carey , co-founder of Harvard spin - off company SiOnyx , “ We have seen a 100 to 500 times increase in sensitivity to light compared to conventional silicon detectors . ”
However , insiders in the solar power industry are likely to be more excited by the prospect of using black silicon technology to build far more efficient photovoltaic cells , using essentially the same silicon - based processes that are currently employed .
Harvard is expected to announce this Monday ( October 13 ) , that it has licensed patents for black silicon to SiOnyx , so it seems likely that we could see the radical new technology put to practical good use in the near future .

The following is an excerpt from " What Matters , " the latest book by " Day in the Life " series creator David Elliot Cohen .
For more information , see whatmattersonline.com
Sathi's face is covered with carbon dust from recycled batteries .
She is 8 and works in a battery recycling factory in Bangladesh .
As she cleans the carbon rods from exhausted D - cell batteries , Marjina holds her young child on her lap and gently lulls her to sleep .
Marjina migrated from the countryside to Dhaka , the capital of Bangladesh , with her son and four daughters after her husband died .
Now she toils every day in a workshop by the Buriganga River that recycles used batteries .
Wiping tears from her eyes , Marjina tells me , " Regardless of how hard my children and I work , we accumulate more and more debt every month .
I do n't know what to do .
I have nothing that I can sell to pay off my debts . "
In my country , Bangladesh , labor comes cheap .
On the outskirts of Dhaka , in village - like slums , dozens of workshops recycle the castoff materials scavenged from garbage dumps .
One of these unnamed workshops recycles dry - cell batteries .
Hear Noorani describe his photos in an audio slideshow »
Day in and day out , women and children as young as three or four break open discarded batteries with hammers in order to remove the recyclable carbon rods and tiny pieces of reusable metal .
Depending upon the speed of their work , they earn between 30 and 50 taka ( 40 to 70 U.S. cents ) per day .
For a young child , it often takes more than a week to earn the equivalent of one U.S. dollar .
Like Marjina , many women bring their children to work because there is simply no other place for them to stay .
The environment in and around the workshops is loaded with carbon dust and other toxic material .
Young children play in these polluted areas until they are tired and fall asleep , and most suffer from chest and eye infections .
Working conditions in these workshops are dismal and depressing .
The makeshift cabins are often lit by one sixty - watt bulb or a single small window .
The hours are long , the work tedious , and everything -- walls , ceilings and even the children 's faces -- is covered with black carbon dust .
Often only the whites of their eyes and red shiny lips are visible .
The children constantly lick their lips to keep them wet , literally eating the dust particles .
The particles they inhale can lead to black lung disease .
It is easy to dramatize the plight of these young workers in order to create a sensational report .
As you can see from my photographs on these pages , the visuals are horrific .
But I always try to be careful , because as hard as it is to imagine , I know that sensational reports in the media can actually create even worse situations for these children .
Child labor , as UNICEF 's annual " State of the World 's Children " report explains , is a complex and often misunderstood problem , but here are some of the basic facts :
An estimated 250 million children are employed around the world .
Of these , nearly three - quarters , or 170 million , work under hazardous conditions -- in mines , with chemicals and pesticides , or operating dangerous machinery .
Although child laborers are ubiquitous , they are often virtually invisible , toiling as domestic servants in homes , hidden from view on plantations or , in the case of Marjina 's children , covered in black carbon dust behind the walls of an anonymous workshop .
While not unique among South Asian countries , Bangladesh may present the world 's most gruesome picture of the rich openly and grossly exploiting the poor .
While economic inequities exist to a greater or lesser degree in every nation , in Bangladesh the inequality between haves and have - nots is startling and unabashed .
It strikes me whenever I see drivers in BMWs , Mercedes and Hummers on the streets of Dhaka , raving and honking behind man-powered cycle rickshaws pulling heavy loads .
And as in the rest of South Asia , you can't help but notice the hideous slums that butt up against fancy upper - middle - class apartment blocks .
There is no serviceable separation of the classes here .
Open space is almost nonexistent in Dhaka .
Regularly battered by natural disasters such as floods , cyclones and resultant soil erosion -- worsening now in the age of global warming -- desperate rural families are migrating to urban areas at an astonishing rate , overwhelming city services .
In the last decade , Dhaka has become one of the most densely populated cities in the world .
Many rural families move to the cities out of desperation , hoping for better employment opportunities , only to find themselves spiraling deeper into debt with nowhere to turn .
In addition to natural calamities , one of the major causes of Bangladesh 's mounting poverty is a lack of government investment in the social sector .
This is largely due to the unnatural calamity of corruption that reaches into every imaginable government office .
In 2005 , for the fifth year in a row , Bangladesh was at the very bottom of Transparency International 's Corruption Perception Index .
In 2006 , it was third from the bottom .
" Corruption is a major cause of poverty as well as a barrier to overcoming it , " explains Transparency International chairman Peter Eigen .
"
The two scourges feed off each other , locking their populations in a cycle of misery . "
Government corruption and the resultant cycle of poverty have a direct and calamitous impact on the welfare of Bangladeshi children .
More than seven million children work in Bangladesh -- many from 6 a.m. until 7 p.m. -- scavenging heaps of garbage , hammering and breaking bricks under the burning heat , melting and molding metal in workshops .
They work 13 hours just so they can have one decent meal at the end of the day .
Their wages are paltry , practically nonexistent .
They are exposed to hazards that are inconceivable to most of us .
The sad fact is that these children have to work to stay alive ; if they do n't work , they do n't eat .
But , that does not mean that they have to be exploited .
In Bangladesh , with one of the largest collections of nongovernmental organizations and international agencies in the world , it is shameful that millions of my countrymen live on the edge of extinction .
But the world being the way it is , and Bangladesh being Bangladesh , I am convinced that no agency or government will be able to fix this situation until there is an economic solution that benefits businesses as well as children .
For example , the major export - based industry of Bangladesh , the garment industry , once employed thousands of children .
Generally , they were given lowskill tasks such as cutting and trimming loose threads from completed garments .
They helped the sewing machine operators and the finishers who packed the products .
The garment industry benefited from cheap child labor , and there was a visible positive effect on the entire society .
But all of this came to an abrupt halt in 1992 when Democratic Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa introduced the well - meaning Child Labor Deterrence Act .
Also known as the Harkin Bill , it threatened to ban importation of garments from developing countries that employ child labor .
Fearing loss of substantial business from U.S. buyers , frightened garment companies in Bangladesh quickly fired more than 50,000 child workers .
A UNICEF study later concluded that these unemployed children were , for the most part , forced into other work that was often far more dangerous and less lucrative -- breaking rocks , rolling cigarettes , working construction and engaging in prostitution .
This is what concerns me about publishing photographs such as the ones you see here .
Seeing images of children working in dangerous conditions for little or no pay , making goods for Western consumers , leaves those consumers with a sense of guilt and powerlessness .
The resulting boycotts ease the conscience of the consumers but actually harm the children they seek to protect .
While children can be exploited and abused in all forms of employment , it is the larger establishments , such as the Bangladeshi garment factories , that allow monitoring and control blatant abuse .
In relatively decent settings like garment factories , systems can be put in place that ensure some form of education , life - skill training and decent pay .
Once the children are thrown out of the garment factories , all that is thrown out with them .
As Shahidul Alam , a photojournalist and a social activist in Dhaka , explains , " The notion that a garment employer might be helping children by allowing them to work may seem very strange to people in the West .
But in a country where the majority of people live in villages , where children work in the home and the fields as part of growing up , there are no romantic notions of childhood as an age of innocence . "
Not all child work is harmful .
Some children actually choose to work , to develop new skills and move toward adulthood .
Millions of children work part - time , combining work with school .
Often children 's wages make the difference between destitution and survival for their families .
Take away their jobs and children go hungry , become homeless or are driven to more poorly paid , more dangerous jobs .
Harunur Rashid , a battery recycling plant owner , replied , " When the government forbids employment of children , what happens to the families going hungry ?
The law itself is good , but you have to be practical . "
As horrible as all this may sound , it is important to understand that , for many children , earning a living or supplementing their family 's income is a matter of survival .
Slogans like " Stop Child Labor " embody romantic and ultimately impractical notions when it comes to places like Bangladesh .
Instead of trying to abolish child labor by boycotting goods made by children , governments and civil societies should help create safer working environments for children , ensure that systems are in place to monitor abuse , and provide education and a living wage .
The Amsterdam Conference on Child Labor in 1997 , which included young delegates -- working children from Central and South America , West Africa and Asia -- concluded , " Action should be taken to eradicate the most pernicious forms of child labor .
But , in the absence of a real assault on the root causes of poverty , children should have the right to work .
It is not work but exploitation in the workplace that should be targeted . "
Until that happens , children will be living and dying in the conditions you see here .

Google launched its first foray into the browser wars today with the official release of Chrome , a new open source web browser that aims to push forward Internet innovation and elevate user expectations .
Although Chrome is still a bit light on features , it is surprisingly polished and has an assortment of highly promising capabilities that could influence the future of browser design .
User interface
The Chrome user interface is extremely minimalistic .
The Chrome tab bar , which is mounted along the top of the window , seamlessly converges with the application titlebar .
The toolbar and URL textbox are displayed below the tabs in a layout that is reminiscent of Opera .
Users can drag the tabs to reorder them or drag them between individual windows .
There are some nice visual flourishes that accompany various tab management tasks .
Tab reordering shows a smooth sliding animation , for instance , and a translucent thumbnail overlay appears when the user snaps a tab out of the browser .
The visual feedback provided by these subtle cues improves usability without disrupting the flow of user interaction .
Although Google obviously invested a lot of effort into fine - tuning the usability of the tab implementation , I identified a handful of weaknesses .
The biggest is the lack of support for tab overflow handling .
Unlike most browsers , which generally display a menu of some kind with a list of tabs that do not fit into the tab bar , Chrome just keeps making the tabs smaller so that more will fit .
With a sufficiently large number of tabs , the labels become completely obscured .
Another frustration is that double - clicking the combined tab / title bar causes the window to maximize instead of creating a new tab .
This is the most visible case where Chrome 's tendency to mix user interface paradigms creates a clear conflict in expected behavior .
There are a few key features that seem to have been left out , including the complete absence of support for RSS .
Most modern browsers have RSS readers integrated directly into the user interface .
Chrome does n't even provide any kind of visual notification when the user browses a page that has a feed .
I expected Chrome to have some kind of RSS component that integrates with Google Reader , but no such luck .
One aspect of the Chrome user interface that particularly impressed me is the autocompletion mechanism in the URL textbox , which Google refers to as the Omnibar .
This feature is evidently inspired by the Firefox 3 AwesomeBar , but it embellishes on the concept and adds some really nice additional features .
In addition to providing completion suggestions based on the user 's history and bookmarks , it will also provide domain recommendations and allow users to perform searches .
The domain recommendations seem to be powered by something like Google Suggest .
When you start typing in a domain name , the system will offer completions based on the most popular sites that start with the same letters .
For instance , when you type " c " it will offer cnn.com even if the user has not previously visited that site .
The default Chrome home page displays thumbnails of the user 's most frequently visited sites .
This feature looks a lot like Opera 's Speed Dial .
It also displays the bookmark toolbar , a sidebar with recent bookmarks , and a history search .
It brings together a bunch of useful functionality and it loads pretty close to instantly , so it 's a nice step up from about : blank .
The Chrome bookmark user interface looks pretty similar to the one in Firefox 3 .
Users bookmark a page by clicking a star icon that appears on the left - hand side of the URL textbox .
This displays a popup in which the user can specify a title and select the location where the bookmark will be stored .
Unlike Firefox , the system does n't support tagging .
Bookmarks are not displayed in the user interface by default except on the start page , but users can optionally enable a bookmarks bar that clings to the bottom of the main toolbar .
Bookmark support is still very limited in Chrome and it lacks a full bookmark management interface .
Incognito mode
Another nice feature that Google has touted is the Incognito mode , which disables history tracking .
This is similar to Safari's Private Browsing mode and it's becoming a standard feature in many browsers .
Rather than being able to toggle Incognito mode across the entire program , users can open special windows that are set in Incognito mode .
To indicate that Incognito mode is enabled , the window panes are rendered in dark grey instead of blue and have an icon of a cloaked man .
In light of what most users will do with the Incognito mode , I think that a Ceiling Cat icon would be far more appropriate :
Internals
The heart of Chrome is the WebKit engine , a lightweight HTML renderer that was developed by Apple with parts of the KDE project 's open source KHTML component .
WebKit offers a nice balance of performance , standards compliance , and reliability that make it a good choice for browsers .
WebKit has also proven to be very portable , scalable , and conducive to embedding .
In addition to serving as the renderer in Apple 's Safari browser on both desktop and mobile devices , WebKit has also been adopted for use in numerous other contexts , including the Adobe AIR runtime , Trolltech 's Qt toolkit , Nokia 's S60 web browser , and Google 's Android web browser .
It 's therefore unsurprising that Google decided to use WebKit for Chrome .
Chrome provides outstanding performance comparable to other browsers .
Load time is extremely fast and the user interface is snappy .
Chrome starts up and shuts down quickly and I encountered little lag .
Although Chrome is built on top of WebKit , the Chrome developers decided to eschew Squirrel Fish , Apple 's new high - performance JavaScript runtime implementation .
Instead , Chrome uses V8 , a unique virtual machine that was developed by a team of specialists in Denmark .
V8 was designed from the ground up to provide good performance for large - scale web applications that make extensive use of JavaScript .
It has a built - in JIT compiler that generates native code on the fly .
It also has an extremely aggressive incremental garbage collection mechanism that reclaims memory more efficiently .
One of the most intriguing aspects of the Chrome internals is the multiprocess design .
Each individual tab and plugin runs within its own process in order to boost stability and prevent memory fragmentation .
When a rendering bug within a page causes a crash , the tab will go down but the rest of the browser will remain unaffected .
Users can launch Chrome 's built - in task manager to see how how the memory is distributed across the entire browser .
This is extremely beneficial because it will make it easy for users to identify which pages are hogging memory .
Users often blame the browser for heavy memory use , but the culprit is often poorly - designed web pages .
The task manager might give web developers an incentive to be more careful .
Chrome will provide even more detailed information through the about : memory page , which will even compare Chrome 's resource consumption against that of other actively running browsers .
We conducted some tests to compare Firefox , Safari , Internet Explorer , and Chrome .
Although the results vary widely between tests and should n't be considered as an authoritative comparison , Chrome 's multiprocess design generally incurs a higher memory overhead than other browsers .
Internet Explorer 8 offers a similar feature , but does n't do a one - to - one relationship between tabs and processes .
IE8 attempts to hit a more even balance between resource consumption and reliability by using fewer processes .
Another similarity between IE and Chrome is that both use Vista 's integrity protection security model to insulate the user from web malware and other attacks .
In Chrome , individual tab processes are run with low integrity permissions which effectively limits the damage that can be caused by a security exploit .
Market impact
Chrome is still in the early stages of development , but it could have an impact on the browser landscape when it starts to mature .
Many have speculated that toppling Internet Explorer is the ultimate goal behind Chrome , but that 's not going to happen overnight .
The initial audience for Chrome will primarily consist of early adopters and technology enthusiasts , so we can expect to see it cannibalizing some market share from Firefox , Safari , and Opera .
If Google aggressively courts OEMs and gets them to preinstall Chrome on consumer desktops , then the company could start to gain some serious traction against Internet Explorer .
If Google does n't pursue preinstallation opportunities , then it is likely that Chrome will make only modest inroads .
During a press conference today , a Google spokesperson said that the company intends to pursue multiple vectors of distribution , but he declined to provide details about any specific plans .
Google has kicked off Chrome with a strong product .
Although the software feels polished and robust , the early stage of development is clearly revealed in its lack of support for advanced features like RSS integration and full bookmark management .
If Google continues to invest in moving Chrome forward and manages to build up some community involvement , though , the new browser could quickly become a shiny new contender in the browser market .

The Purr- muda triangle : Mystery after FORTY - FIVE pet cats disappear from same town
First to go was Tabatha , then Blackie , Lucky and Norman .
Felix vanished , Star never came home and YumYum was never seen again .
In all , at least 45 cats have gone missing in eight years from the quiet , tree - lined Meriden Avenue and its surrounding streets .
Nobody knows what is behind the disappearances , and the only clues have been a few discarded collars - no bodies have ever been found .
Cats including Molly , Felix , Ernie , Lily , Lucky and Blackie are among the dozens of cats to have disappeared from the one area
Owners call the area a ' Bermuda Triangle for cats ' .
The situation is now so severe that the RSPCA has stopped re-homing cats there , while residents of the streets in Stourbridge , Worcestershire , are considering desperate measures - either employing a pet detective , or putting up CCTV cameras .
Julie Wootton , whose 15 - year - old cat Norman went missing last year , has been logging the disappearances since they started .
The 42 - year - old said : ' I 've counted nearly 50 cats , but we suspect there may have been many more .
Where they are ending up we just do n't know . '
Kerry Davis said she would not own any more cats after her pet Gizmo disappeared along with his sister Lily
The latest victim is Gizmo , a five - year - old tabby which disappeared from Meriden Avenue a few weeks ago .
His sister , Lily , vanished last year .
Their owner Kerry Davis , 31 , said : ' It was heartbreaking when Lily disappeared .
She was so friendly , she would go up to people just to get some love and affection .
' Now Gizmo is gone too , it 's just devastating .
I could n't bear to get any more cats after what 's happened around here . '
The vanishing acts began in 2000 but appeared to have come to a halt in June last year .
However , they began again in May .
This aerial map shows the number of cats which have gone missing in the one area dubbed the Purr- muda Triangle
One family with young children lost all three of their cats , while one homeowner is so distressed that she wants to move away .
Cheryl Vine , another cat owner , said : ' There must be people trapping them and using them for something because cats will always drag themselves home if they are injured . '
The RSPCA said : ' There have never been any bodies found .
Without any evidence it has been very hard for our officers to investigate . '
Residents are too afraid to let their remaining cats out after a spate of feline disappearances
The Pope rejects the new Sarkozy - appointed French ambassador to the Vatican because he 's gay and married to a man .
These facts in no way impede the man 's ability to do his job , just as being gay does not in any way impede a seminarian 's ability to be a great priest ( as so many gay men have been through the centuries ) .
But this Pope is a bigot , as we now know - and will discriminate against people just for who they are , rather than what they can professionally do .

We had to do a double take when we saw that a company called Cyberdyne recently demonstrated a " cyborg - type " " robot suit . "
Our double take was quickly followed by yet another double take ( would that be a quadruple take ? ) when we saw that Cyberdyne was calling the robot suit , " HAL . " ( For those who are missing the Sci -Fi cultural references : Cyberdyne was the name of the fictional company from the Terminator movies that eventually gives rise to the artificial intelligence and cyborgs that nearly wipe out humanity ; and the HAL 9000 was the fictional , artificial - intelligence - based computer from 2001 : A Space Odyssey that commits murder in order to preserve the integrity of its mission .
We 're guessing that the real Cyberdyne chose these names consciously in a tip - of - the - hat to these science fiction classics .
But we 're not so sure the irony of referencing movies where technology acts out against humans is perhaps the approach for an assistive technology ...
But we digress ... )
Cyberdyne is a " venture firm " that was established in 2004 to commercialize the developments of University of Tsukuba professor , Yoshiyuki Sankai , who has been working with robots since 1992 .
HAL stands for " Hybrid Assistive Limb , " and is wearable robot designed to " expand and improve physical capability . "
" HAL is expected to be applied in various fields such as rehabilitation support and physical training support in medical field , ADL support for disabled people , heavy labour support at factories , and rescue support at disaster sites , as well as in the entertainment field .
" According to Cyberdyne 's Website , the HAL - 5 Type - B comes in two configurations : a full - body type ( weighing approximately 51 pounds ) and a lower - body type ( about 33 pounds ) .
( The Associated Press reports that the lower - body suit weighs 22 pounds and that the full - body unit is not available yet . )
The company states that when you wear the suit , it does n't " feel heavy , because its exoskeleton supports its own weight . "
Cyberdyne claims that the suit can " multiply the [ wearer 's ] original strength by a factor of 2 to 10 . "
The lower - body unit was recently demonstrated at the company 's headquarters in Tsukuba , Japan , and will be available for rent in Japan for $ 2,200 per month starting this Friday .
The unit is battery powered with an estimated continuous run time of about 2 hours and 40 minutes .
The HAL suit works by monitoring the nerve impulses from the surface of the skin , and then interprets and translates the signals into physical movements .
The HAL suit 's movements occur " a fraction of a section earlier than the muscles actually move . "
Essentially , the device reads your mind .
While the possible uses for such the HAL suit are boundless , the Associated Press reports that " Sankai said the HAL technology is devoted to social welfare purposes only , adding he has refused requests from military officials to share it . "
The Cyberdyne site further states that " currently HAL is used by people with weakened muscles and by some people with disabilities due to stroke and / or spinal cord injury .
" Kudos to Sankai and Cyberdyne for developing a mind - reading technology that can help make the injured and elderly more mobile .
But did the company have to beat us over the head with the implication that one day our own technological creations might try to kill us ?
Perhaps the company 's next robot model will be called Caprica - Six
DALLAS ( Reuters ) - Republican evangelicals are not the only political base vice presidential pick Sarah Palin is energizing .
Democratic foot soldiers have sprung into action in response to John McCain ’s running - mate ’s personal attacks on their candidate , Barack Obama , her opposition to abortion rights and her endorsement from religious conservatives .
“ When Palin ’s radical and extremist views are combined with her inexperience and questionable record , it makes for an energizing brew more potent than Red Bull , ” said Colorado Democratic leader Pat Waak , referring to the caffeinated energy drink .
Palin ’s impact on the left was seen almost immediately after her rousing speech last month at the Republican National Convention , when Obama ’s campaign reported the next day that over $ 8 million had poured into it from over 130,000 donors .
More recently , Palin drew the ire of Democrats when she accused Obama of “ palling around ” with terrorists because he served on a community board in Chicago with former 1960s radical William Ayers .
“ Her attacks will make liberals see red , ” added political scientist Cal Jillson of Southern Methodist University .
The Alaska governor , skewered on late - night comedy shows and an object of liberal wrath on the blogosphere , has also proven an able fund - raiser for other secular and liberal causes before the November 4 presidential election .
Songwriter Gretchen Peters is donating the royalties from her song “ Independence Day ” during this election cycle to Planned Parenthood -- and asks that donations be made in honor of Palin .
Planned Parenthood provides women ’s health - care services , including abortion clinics , and is frequently a target of social conservatives .
Peters was angered by the McCain / Palin campaign ’s use of the song , which is about domestic abuse .
“ The fact that the McCain / Palin campaign is using a song about an abused woman as a rallying cry for their vice presidential candidate , a woman who would ban abortion even in cases of rape and incest , is beyond irony , ” Peters says on her website .
“ They are co-opting the song , completely overlooking the context and message , and using it to promote a candidate who would set women ’s rights back decades , ” she says .
Planned Parenthood spokesperson Tait Sye said a separate online campaign to raise money on its behalf “ in honor of Sarah Palin ” has netted more than $ 1 million from over 38,000 donors in all 50 states and two - thirds of the donations are from new donors who have not contributed to it before .
Organizations and activists who support abortion rights are a base for the Democratic Party .
Abortion is a sharply divisive and highly partisan issue in the United States .
Palin , who bills herself as a moose - hunting mother of five , gave birth last spring to a Down syndrome baby and strongly opposes abortion rights .
COUNTERPUNCH
“ Sarah Palin has energized the Republican base in unexpected ways and there is always countermobilization to a successful mobilization , ” said Jillson .
In the battleground state of Colorado , Democratic Party officials said they were getting a boost from Palin ’s presence on the ticket .
“ I am meeting women who have never been involved before , and they are really energized to work on behalf of the Obama - Biden ticket , ” said party leader Waak .
The factors that make Palin such a target for liberals of course are the same that have enabled McCain to solidify his support among the Republican Party ’s evangelical base .
President George W. Bush , a Republican , got almost 80 percent of the votes cast by white evangelical Protestants in the 2004 election and analysts have said McCain , who had failed to really excite this group before he picked Palin , cannot win without them .
Evangelicals account for about 25 percent of the U.S. adult population , giving them clout in a country where faith and politics often mix .
Scott Boras would n’t say this is an important winter for him .
He denied that he thinks he has to restore an image that was tarnished a year ago .
Sitting in his office in Newport Beach last week , baseball ’s most powerful agent turned questions about him into answers about what the presence of Manny Ramirez and Mark Teixeira will mean for their potential employers .
“ I look at it as an extraordinary opportunity for franchises , because when you look at the number of franchise players that are normally available in free agency , you ’re not going to have that many that hit the market because they usually sign before they ever get there , ” he said .
“ The question is , how often do you have access to the player that can give you all the qualities that these players represent to facilitate the needs of your franchise ? ”
Behind Boras , outside the glass doors of his personal work space , were Gold Glove trophies and life - size images of his clients .
Whatever statistics he wanted were at his disposal , courtesy of a computer in the basement operated by a former NASA engineer that has video of games and data dating to 1871 .

The sun was setting outside , but several of the 70 - plus employees of the Boras Corp .
were still at work , briskly walking around the office and occasionally dropping by to deliver a quick message to the boss .
Preparations for the most important time of Boras ’ year had to be done .
Four days later , Boras shifted his base operations to the St. Regis Resort Monarch Beach , which is only a 10 - minute drive from his office .
The hotel is the site of the general managers ’ meetings , which started Monday and will run through Thursday .
Boras has players to sell .

He has 16 clients who are free agents this winter , a cast that includes pitcher Derek Lowe and catchers Jason Varitek and Ivan Rodriguez .
“ We ’re going to do $ 300 [ million ] - $ 400 million in contracts like we did three or four years ago , ” Boras said , referring to the winter of 2004 - 05 .
Teixeira alone is expected to command a deal worth more than $ 100 million .
Ramirez also could get a nine - figure deal if Boras can convince teams that his age , 36 , should n’t diminish his value .
If he can ’t , everyone will be forced to wait .
At least that ’s the expectation .
Asked how soon he expected to learn where Ramirez would play baseball next season , Dodgers General Manager Ned Colletti smiled and nearly started laughing .
Colletti gathered himself and gave a measured response .
Advertisement
“ I ’m not too confident it will be resolved in the next short period of time , ” Colletti said .
Angels GM Tony Reagins seemed to have similar thoughts about his effort to re-sign Teixeira .
Though Reagins said the Angels have “ high - level interest ” in the first baseman , he added , “ At some point , you have to move forward with your off - season plans . ”
To Colletti , Reagins and most baseball executives , Boras is still Boras , even if his reputation took a hit last winter when he reportedly was fired by New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez and rehired to negotiate his record contract extension only because baseball rules required Rodriguez to have an agent .
Boras said the widely held perception of what happened is wrong .

“ What was put out there was way off base , ” he said .
Boras also denied that his relationship with Rodriguez became strained when he advised him to opt out of the record 10 - year , $ 252 - million deal the agent negotiated for him after the 2000 season .
“ We did A - Rod ’s contract , ” he said .
“ We still represent A - Rod . ”
Rodriguez ’s extension was worth $ 275 million over 10 years .

Boras said his company has negotiated about $ 4 billion in contracts .
He represents more than 70 major league players and another 70 minor leaguers , who are well taken care of .
The Boras Corp. employs two psychologists and a conditioning coach who runs the Boras Sports Fitness Institute .
The company has a marketing and personal management division .
Boras said his company has never had outside investors .
“ You ca n’t have bills because your interest has to solely be on the athlete , ” he said .
“ In the corporate world , a lot of agents have demands on them from the board .
They have to make revenue .
My attitude is that whatever you do in this business , whatever you own , whatever you have has to be paid for .
That way when you ’re negotiating , you ’re negotiating strictly for the client , not for the need for money . ”
But it also meant , Boras said , that he lost money in his first 10 years in the business .

Boras was the second - oldest of four children who grew up in a modest household in Elk Grove , south of Sacramento .
He said he used to wake up between 4:30 and 5 a.m. every morning to work on the family farm .
Until his chores were done , he said , he could n’t play baseball .
He earned a scholarship to the University of the Pacific and was a minor league outfielder and infielder in the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs systems .
He went to law school when his career was cut short by knee injuries and did medical malpractice work in Chicago .
He started representing some of his former teammates and became a full - time agent in 1985 .

Boras has been credited -- and vilified -- for his role in landing record contracts for major league and amateur players .
“ Scott has always pushed the envelope on player compensation , ” said San Diego - based agent Barry Axelrod .
His methods have been questioned by many in baseball , including several major league executives who said they did n’t want to be interviewed on the record because they expect to negotiate with Boras in the future .
The Dodgers are certainly wary of him .

Colletti was caught by surprise two winters ago when J.D. Drew , a Boras client , unexpectedly opted out of his contract and left the Dodgers with a vacancy in the outfield .
The Dodgers signed Juan Pierre to a five - year , $ 44 - million deal that winter .
Last winter , the Dodgers signed another Boras client , Andruw Jones , to a two - year , $ 36.2 - million deal .
Jones hit .158 with three home runs in 75 games and owner Frank McCourt has become increasingly distrustful of the agent , according to multiple baseball sources .
Colletti did n’t want to talk about Boras , saying he does n’t like to discuss his dealings with specific agents .

Reagins talked but did n’t say much .
“ What we understand is that he has to do his job as the advocate for the player , ” he said .
“ And we have to do our job as an advocate for the club . ”

Last week , Republican presidential candidate John McCain called for a commission to " find out what went wrong " on Wall Street .
It was an excellent suggestion : Public inquiries into Wall Street practices served the country well in the 1930s .
And Mr. McCain has a special advantage to bring to any such investigation -- many of the relevant witnesses are friends or colleagues of his .
In fact , he can probably get to the bottom of the whole mess just by cross-examining the people riding on his campaign bus .
So the candidate should take a deep breath , remind himself that the country comes first , pull the Straight Talk Express over at a rest stop , whistle up his media pals , and begin .
Topic A should be deregulation .
Financial institutions are dropping everywhere after playing with poorly regulated financial instruments ; the last investment banks standing are begging the government for stricter oversight ; and some of our nation 's leading champions of laissez faire have ditched that theory in an extraordinary attempt to rescue the collapsing industry .
The philosophy of government that has dominated Washington for almost three decades is now in ruins , and it is up to Mr. McCain to find out exactly why we believed it in the first place .
Why did government stand back and permit all the misconduct that generated all this bad debt ?
What particular ideas led us to believe that government should just keep its hands off and let markets run their course ?
Maybe the McCain Commission on Deregulation can kick off with a statement from the candidate himself .
It will be helpful for the public , if painful for the senator himself , to hear about Mr. McCain 's own close brush with one of the towering figures of financial deregulation , Charles Keating , the master of Lincoln Savings and Loan .
Keating had a special , urgent interest in getting Big Brother off our backs : in 1986 some meddlesome agency suspected him of massive violations of S&L regulations .
Keating fought back by recruiting a handful of legislators , including Mr. McCain , to pressure S&L regulators to leave his S&L alone .
A few years later , Lincoln became one of the largest financial failures in U.S. history .
Dow 36,000 !
The market can be thought of as a giant tug - of - war between two teams , one of which thinks that the market is too high , the other too low .
Straining at the very far right end of the rope are two fellows named James Glassman and Kevin Hassett ( GH ) .
Writing in the op - ed section of the Wall Street Journal , the Atlantic Monthly , and finally in their best - selling above - titled book , they contend that the market , far from being historically overvalued , is actually ridiculously undervalued .
Nervous at Dow 11,000 ?
Get over it .
This fearless duo sees fair value at about 36,000 .
The problem , as we shall see , is that they arrive at this number by using a model which is exquisitely sensitive to its inputs .
Then they diddle those inputs to arrive at their highly agreeable conclusions .
Their chosen vehicle is the venerable dividend discount model ( DDM ) .
Formulated in 1938 by John Burr Williams , it rests on a deceptively simple premise :
Since all companies eventually go bankrupt , the value of a stock , bond , or of an entire market is simply the value of all its future dividends discounted to the present .
( In GHspeak , this is referred to as the " perfectly reasonable price , " or PRP . )
Since a dollar of future dividends is worth less than a dollar today , its value must be reduced , or discounted , to reflect the fact that you will not receive it immediately .
This amount of reduction is called the " discount rate " ( DR ) .
And as we shall soon see , fiddling even a little bit with the DR opens the door to all kinds of mischief .
If this model looks complicated , it is .
For each future year you take the present dividend , multiply it by ( 1+r ) n , where r is the rate of dividend increase and n is the number of years in the future , and then divide by ( 1+DR ) n .
Plus , you have to compute this for an infinite number of years .
And it can get worse , with two - and three - stage models with varying growth rates over time .
Fortunately , with a constant growth rate the whole infinite sequence simplifies to :
PRP = ( div ) / ( DR - g )
where PRP = " perfectly reasonable price , " div = annual dividend amount , DR = discount rate , and g = dividend growth rate
If the Dow throws off about $ 150 per year in dividends , and the dividends are growing at 6 % per year , then the only other number left to toss into the above equation is that pesky DR .
And amazingly , throughout most of the article GH maintain that the appropriate DR is the treasury bond rate , which at the time they wrote the piece was 5.5 % .
Because the DR is less than the growth rate , an infinite value for the market results ( you do n't want to know ) , which even they find hard to swallow .
( What the authors missed is that 6 % rate covers a period when inflation was around 4 % - 5 % , while the recent 5.5 % rate for T bonds presumably reflects a considerably lower future inflation rate . )
So lower the dividend growth to 5.1 % , keep the DR at 5.5 % , and abracadabra , the above equation yields Dow 37,500 .
To demonstrate just how squirrely this model is , I 've plugged the above numbers into the simplified DDM equation : PRP = 150/( 0.055 - 0.051 ) = 150/0.004 = 37,500
Per finance convention , the numbers on the bottom are expressed as decimals , where .055 refers to the DR of 5.5 % , and 0.051 to the dividend growth rate of 5.1 % .
Notice how tiny the denominator of 0.004 is relative to the input numbers .
Move both of the numbers in the denominator the wrong way by just 1 % ( .01 ) and you have a Dow PRP of 6250 .
And if that displeases you make your estimates just a hair more optimistic , and you get a Dow PRP of infinity .
The odor of a small furry rodent begins to waft .
For starters , note the proximity of the growth rate and DR , and how that proximity makes the denominator in the discount - rate calculation a teeny - tiny 0.4 % .
This is akin to balancing an elephant on fence post :
One small wobble in the post , and several thousand pounds will lurch in an unexpected direction .
This is evidenced by the following graph , which shows the DJIA ’s value using the Glassman / Hassett growth assumptions over a range of discount rates .
For clarity I 've plotted this relationship between DR and Dow PRP :
Once again , the value of the DR is critical .
For example , if the actual DR is 8 % instead of 5.5 % , then fair value for the Dow falls to 5,172 .
Oops .
The same thing happens if the dividend growth estimate is off .
As already mentioned , the dividend 6.1 % growth of the past decades included over 4 % of inflation .
In other words , real growth was less than 2 % .
So the dividend growth rate going forward may be quite a bit lower than it has been in the past .
Decreasing dividend growth by 2.5 % has the same effect as increasing the DR by the same amount — Dow 5,172 .
So what determines the appropriate DR ?
It is very simply the cost of money ( or the risk free rate ) , plus an additional amount to compensate for risk .
Think of the DR as the interest rate a reasonable lender would charge a given loan applicant .
The world ’s safest borrower is the US Treasury .
If Uncle Sam comes my way and wants a long - term loan I ’ll charge him just 6 % .
At that DR the DDM predicts that a perpetual $ 1.00 annual loan repayment , or coupon , is worth a $ 16.67 loan .
Next through the door is General Motors .
Still pretty safe , but not as riskless as Uncle Sam .
I ’ll charge them 7.5 % .
At that DR a perpetual $ 1.00 repayment / coupon is worth a $ 13.33 loan .
Finally , in struts Trump Casinos .
Phew !
For the risk of lending these clowns my money I ’ll have to charge 12.5 % , which means that The Donald ’s perpetual $ 1.00 repayment / coupon is worth only an $ 8 loan .
So the DR we apply to the market ’s dividend stream hinges on just how risky we think the market is .
And here things get really sticky .
Relying on long - term data , GH observe that the stock market is actually less risky than the long treasury bond .
For example , since 1926 the worst 30 - year annualized return for common stocks was 8.47 % , versus 1.53 % for treasuries .
Of course , a very different picture emerges when one looks at shorter periods .
For example , the worst 1 - year returns are – 43.35 % for stocks , and – 7.78 % for bonds .
And at a gut level , no matter how much of a long - term investor you think you are , the market still probably got your attention on October 19 , 1987 .
So the GH - Dow controversy depends on whether you think that investors experience risk as a short - term or a long - term phenomenon .
What the authors are saying is that US investors have abruptly lengthened their risk time - horizon : Seventy years ago few investors understood that excessive trading undermines profits , that stock - price fluctuations tend to cancel themselves out over time , making stocks less risky than they might appear at first glance , and that it is extremely difficult to outperform the market averages .
Americans have learned to buy and hold .
One wonders what planet GH inhabit .
Are they unaware that trading volume has been steadily increasing for decades , not decreasing ?
That average domestic mutual fund turnover has increased from 30 % to over 90 % in the past 25 years ?
That a recent survey of over 66,000 accounts at a " large west coast discount brokerage " showed an average annual portfolio turnover of 75 % ?
That only 7 % of mutual fund investments are indexed ?
That the historically modest market declines of 1987 , 1990 , and 1997 , far from resulting in inflows from legions of long - termers buying cheap , produced dramatic mutual fund outflows ?
Most authoritatively of all , in an elegant study published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 1993 Shlomo Benzarti and Richard Thaler calculated that the risk - horizon of the average investor was just one year .
The easiest way of thinking about the interplay of short - and long - term risk is to imagine a new kind of 30 - year treasury bond , similar to the conventional bond , except that the government stands ready at all times to redeem it at par .
Clearly , the redeemable bond would carry a considerably higher price / lower yield because of its lower short - term volatility .
And yet on the GH planet , where investors only care about long - term return , it would be priced identically to the conventional 30 - year bond , since both have the same return to maturity .
Even conceding GH ’s point that investors are increasingly focused on stocks for the long run and will manage to push the Dow up past 36,000 , one has to ask just how risk free stocks would be at that point .
The authors ignore a rather inconvenient fact : that recent market history has dramatic effects on DR .
In 1928 , just as today , everybody was a " long - term investor , " and the DR for stocks was quite low ( although probably not as low as it is today ) .
Five years later , with the attrition rate of buy - and - holders approaching 100 % , the DR was dramatically higher .
And at Dow 36,000 , it would n’t take much of a change in the DR in order for the risk free world of stocks to come to an abrupt end .
If investors decided that they demanded even a measly 1 % risk premium , the Dow would decline by about two thirds .
The irony being that to the extent GH are right about a near term " correction " of stock prices past 36,000 , the risks of subsequent stock ownership increase dramatically .
Ignoring the crash scenario still does not make the GH planet look very appetizing .
If the true discount rate is 5.5 % and the Dow " correctly " priced at 36,000 , then the future return of stocks is also 5.5 % .
Assuming inflation averages 2.5 % over the next 30 years , that ’s a real return of just 3.0 % .
Why would any rational investor invest in stocks with treasury inflation protected securities ( TIPSs ) priced to produce a guaranteed 4.35 % real return ?
There are other , more fundamental problems with Dow 36,000 .
For starters , consider the significance of a 5.5 % long - term stock return .
The " cost of capital " for corporations is necessarily the same as this long - term return .
At a dirt - cheap capital cost of 5.5 % do you think that corporations are going to be particularly careful with how they spend it ?
The free - spending behavior of the dot.coms , whose capital comes even cheaper , is not encouraging .
( Or , on a grander scale , just how careful is Uncle Sam with his 5.5 % capital ? )
In essence , the authors have improved on Professor Irving Fisher 's famous 1928 faux pas : " Stock prices will soon reach a permanently high plateau .
Although the destination will be deadly dull , the ride there will be a real barn burner . "
