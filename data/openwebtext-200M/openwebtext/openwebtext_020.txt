On Lisp is a comprehensive study of advanced Lisp techniques , with bottom - up programming as the unifying theme .
It gives the first complete description of macros and macro applications .
The book also covers important subjects related to bottom - up programming , including functional programming , rapid prototyping , interactive development , and embedded languages .
The final chapter takes a deeper look at object - oriented programming than previous Lisp books , showing the step - by - step construction of a working model of the Common Lisp Object System ( CLOS ) .
As well as an indispensable reference , On Lisp is a source of software .
Its examples form a library of functions and macros that readers will be able to use in their own Lisp programs .

" The first book that really explains what Lisp is all about . "
- John Foderaro , Franz Inc .
" On Lisp draws the reader in from the very first sentence .
The author 's writing style is clear and articulate , but comfortably informal .
The subject matter is important , and has not been adequately treated in previous books .
The chapters on macros present important material that is virtually unique to this book .
The chapter on object - oriented programming is excellent .
The author builds a nice mini-CLOS to teach basic object - oriented techniques , but then wisely switches to real CLOS to cover the more advanced topics . "
- David Touretzky , Carnegie - Mellon University
" An excellent description of the real essence of Lisp . "
- Thomas Cheatham , Harvard University
" As with his other book , ANSI Common Lisp , Graham writes in a fluid style that is a pleasure to read . "
- Amazon.Com
" The topics On Lisp covers are extremely useful for any seriously aspiring Lisp programmer .
I think it 's a great idea to collect in one place programming techniques normally attainable only the hard way .
The examples , which are plentiful and excellent , are one of the significant strengths of the book . "

There will be increased flooding of low - lying areas when there are storm surges
Dr John Church
Australian researchers found that sea levels rose by 19.5 cm between 1870 and 2004 , with accelerated rates in the final 50 years of that period .
The research , published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters , used data from tide gauges around the world .
The findings fit within predictions made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
The IPCC's Third Assessment Report , published in 2001 , projected that the global average sea level would rise by between 9 and 88 cm between 1990 and 2100 .
In an attempt to reduce the scale of uncertainty in this projection , the Australian researchers have analysed tidal records dating back to 1870 .
The data was obtained from locations throughout the globe , although the number of tidal gauges increased and their locations changed over the 130 - year period .
These records show that the sea level has risen , and suggest that the rate of rise is increasing .
Over the entire period from 1870 the average rate of rise was 1.44 mm per year .
Over the 20th Century it averaged 1.7 mm per year ; while the figure for the period since 1950 is 1.75 mm per year .
Although climate models predict that sea level rise should have accelerated , the scientists behind this study say they are the first to verify the trend using historical data .
Floods and surges
Melting ice on Antarctica is a cause of sea level rise
Dr John Church , a scientist with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation based in Tasmania and an author of the study , said that higher sea levels could have grave effects on some areas .
" It means there will be increased flooding of low - lying areas when there are storm surges , " he told the Associated Press .
" It means increased coastal erosion on sandy beaches ; we 're going to see increased flooding on island nations . "
There is now a consensus among climate scientists that rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are the major factor behind rising temperatures .
Increased temperatures can lead to higher sea-levels through several mechanisms including the melting of glaciers and thermal expansion of sea water .
Through the 1997 Kyoto protocol , industrialised countries have committed to cut their combined emissions to 5 % below 1990 levels by 2008 - 2012 .
But the US and Australia have withdrawn from the treaty .
Dr Church urged : " " We do have to reduce our emissions but we also have to recognise climate change is happening , and we have to adapt as well . "
They say they have discovered a mural depicting the Maya creation myth and the coronation of a king , thought to be more than 2,000 years old .
Archaeologist William Saturno said it was like finding the Maya equivalent of the Vatican 's Sistine Chapel .
The mural was discovered at the San Bartolo site in northern Guatemala .
' Unique ' find
Mr Saturno , of the University of New Hampshire , said the mural - painted in greyish blue , orange and flesh tones - was discovered at the western wall of a room attached to a pyramid .

The mural on the wall - measuring 0.9x9 m ( 3x30 ft ) - includes four deities , which are variations of the same figure , the son of the maize god , offering a blood sacrifice from his genitals .
The first deity stands in the water and offers a fish , establishing the watery underworld , Mr Saturno said .
The second stands on the ground and sacrifices a deer , establishing the land ; the third floats in the air , offering a turkey to establish the sky ; and the fourth stands in a field of flowers , the food of gods , establishing paradise .
The crowned Maya king is depicted at the end of the mural , Mr Saturno said .
" It was like discovering the Sistine Chapel if you did n't know there had been a Renaissance , " Mr Saturno said at a news conference .
" It 's like knowing only modern art and then stumbling on the finger of God touching the hand of Adam , " he said .
Mr Saturno first reported the discovery of the site in 2002 .
The western wall is thought to be painted about 100 BC , but was later covered when the room was filled in .
Archaeologists say the artwork is particularly unique because it dates from hundreds of years before the classical Maya period .
The Mayas - known for their prowess in astronomy and mathematics - dominated southern Mexico and parts of Central America for some 1,500 years .
The mural and William Saturno's research will be featured in the January issue of National Geographic magazine .
The ROBOTMAK3RS sponsored a community Smart Boat Contest .
Participants were challenged with the task of creating a smart boat that includes MINDSTORMS , BOOST , Powered UP , CONTROL + , WeDO or SPIKE Prime .
The boat did not have to float on water .
The winner of the contest was Hector Fernando Palomino Gutierrez from Lima , Peru .
Hector has been building with LEGO robots since 2012 .
He took a course called " Introduction to Mechatronics Engineering " at his university .
One of the tasks in the course was to build a robot with an NXT core set to complete a challenge .
That experience made him fall in love with LEGO MINDSTORMS .
In 2015 , he got a job as a high school teacher in educational robotics and now he continues working with MINDSTORMS .
To come up with this design , Hector started by looking for inspiration on Google and YouTube .
When none of the models were to his liking , he started thinking about the WRO robots his students have made .
He remembered that every robot has some type …

The Truthiness Hurts Legions of determined amateurs are challenging the safe unreality manufactured by the purveyors of professional news and entertainment .
By Adrian Duyzer
Published January 09 , 2006
One of my favourite authors is John Updike .
He writes about the ordinary lives of ordinary Americans in an extraordinary way .
He truthfully reflects reality in his characters and stories .
Since his subject matter is the often adulterous lives of American adults , he frequently writes about cheating and its consequences .
Because reading a novel is like living a story , the enormous impact of adultery on his characters ' lives also had an impact on me - a very small impact , since a novel is not real life , but it all adds up .
Reading about the consequences of bad decisions , and thus experiencing them secondhand , makes one less likely to make them .
You can learn from other people 's mistakes .
Contrast this faithful portrayal of the human condition to pop culture and advertising .
Sex is cheap and easy .
Beautiful women are there for the taking .
Big cars and bigger houses are what matters .
Bling is for winners .
Consequences are for losers .
To protect us from this shallowness , we develop mental shields in various ways - from our parents , faithful portrayals of the human condition by great artists and writers , religion , friends , and actual experiences and their consequences .
Most likely , it 's all these things , combined with an innate sense of morality and judgment , reinforced by common sense and sharpened by humour and irony .
The problem is , as any medieval warrior could tell you , a good shield is too frickin ' heavy to carry all the time .
The challenge for communicators is how to get the audience - us - to lower our guards .
Catchiness is one way .
It 's hard to resist a catchy tune .
Pretty much everybody thinks Britney Spears sucks , but she still sells records .
Even the most jaded twenty - somethings will dance to her after enough beers .
We can like an entertainer ironically , the same way we get excited over a steaming bowl of Kraft Dinner .
In the end the joke is on us , because as much as we might mock it , the meal still ends up in our stomachs .
The news media do it much the same way .
They seduce us with easy answers , soundbites , expert analyses and reporter summations , all relayed to us calmly and " objectively " .
Steven Colbert , formerly of the Daily Show , coined a word for it : " truthiness " .
Truthiness is what you get when you take actual events and make them " fair and balanced " .
Truthiness is Judith Miller 's reports for the New York Times that laid out the case for WMDs in Iraq .
Maintaining the appearance of calm is key for the news media .
We are naturally inclined to listen to people who are calm .
We trust people who are cool and collected .
They must have a handle on the situation , we think , otherwise they'd be freaking out .
This is why news reports on natural disasters tend to go something like this :
NEWSCASTER : Andy , you 're right in the path of the hurricane , and we 're actually having a bit of trouble hearing you because it 's so windy .
What can you tell us right now ?
ANDY : Well Lou , this is actually one of the largest hurricanes ever recorded .
Behind me you can see the giant wall of wind and water that is rapidly approaching .
I 'm actually being pelted with small bits of debris right now Lou , and I can tell you , that 's a somewhat unpleasant experience .
A sensible person who was not trying to maintain the facade that the situation was under control would n't be talking into a microphone at all , except to say " Holy crap , Lou , get us the heck out of here ! "
The problem is that this display of normal behaviour would bring the broadcast down to a human level , destroying its authority .
For the same reason , government figures never cry or show fear in public .
Ask the Experts
The next person to appear on the newscast or in the article is a welcome figure : the expert .
This expert - who could be a doctor , scientist , government official , or professor - has the answers .
She is a professional with years of experience .
He is a scientist who conforms to the highest standards .
When she opens her mouth , she can be trusted .
Dr. Hwang Woo -Suk , a pioneer in stem cell research , is a perfect example .
South Korea 's most prominent scientist , Dr. Hwang became famous when he announced his team had successfully cloned a human embryo in May 2005 .
He subsequently cloned a dog called Snuppy , and then announced his team had created 11 distinct stem cell lines tailored for specific individuals .
This last achievement made world headlines as a major breakthrough in stem cell research .
It opened up the possibility of growing human tissue custom - made for individuals : the ability to grow skin , muscle , and even organs from stem cells harvested from the patient .
In spite of persistent rumours of unethical practices - like using embryos from women on his team for research and accepting " donations " from staff members - Dr. Hwang 's work went unquestioned .
Then someone noticed something odd .
Some of his photos showing the 11 stem cell lines were actually pictures of the same cell .
A key co-author of the study , Gerald Schatten , asked to have his name withdrawn from it , citing allegations of fraud by someone closely involved with the experiments .
It was n't long before the entire edifice came crashing down .
The landmark achievements were faked .
Dr. Hwang was a fraud .
He resigned in disgrace , his research and reputation in tatters .
Blinding us with Science
Dr. Hwang is a rare case of deliberate deception .
But regardless of the purity of their intentions , most research papers written by scientists are false .
At least , that 's what John Ioannidis says in a research paper published in August 2005 .
His study of highly cited papers published between 1990 and 2002 found that less than half of them were valid , a problem he attributes to " small sample sizes , poor study design , researcher bias , and selective reporting and other problems . "
The irony of a research paper that says most research papers are wrong is obvious , but it does n't take a scientist to see the problems with many studies .
In a study published in the October 2005 of Biological Psychology , Meredith Chivers from Toronto's Centre for Addiction and Mental Health , and J. Michael Bailey from Northwestern University , claim that straight men are only aroused by women , but straight women are aroused by all human sexual activity and some non-human sexual activity .
In this case , non -human means bonobo monkeys .
Eighteen men and eighteen women participated in the study .
Devices intended to measure sexual stimulation were attached to the participants , and then they were shown a variety of video clips showing sexual activity , including one scene featuring bonobos ( bonobos on bonobos , that is - no " interspecies " videos were shown ) .
The men were not aroused by the monkey business but according to the study , the same could not be said for the women .
The researchers concluded that what turns people on is " less specific in women than in men , " but it 's hard to escape the offensive notion that what they 're really saying is women like bonobo sex a little more than is normal .
Even if their tiny , crackpot study supported their conclusion , could it be any more useless ?
This research is at best pointless and at worst degrading , but that wo n't stop it from being perpetuated .
Even if it is proved wrong at some point , or its authors disgraced like Hwang , it will still be fodder for lists of rare " facts " or ammunition for beer - fuelled disputes with feminists in university pubs .
Science is thus turned against itself : meant to be a shield , it can disarm us instead .
Take a Guess
Few people disarm us as expertly as experts , especially when they start talking about the future .
The glib pronouncements of newscasters are easy to ignore , but when the expert gets on the show to make predictions , we 're all ears .
When they 're important enough experts get interviewed at home , and they always choose a spot right in front of a huge bookshelf .
" Look at me , " they are saying .
" Not only am I an expert , but look at all the other experts whose books I read . "
I wonder how many of those bookshelves contain Expert Political Judgment : How Good Is It ?
How Can We Know ? by Philip Tetlock .
This recently published work contains the results of a study ( uh - oh ) he started twenty years ago that tracked 284 experts whose livelihood is " commenting or offering advice on political and economic trends " .
His startling conclusion : experts are no better than non-experts at predicting the future , even in their fields of expertise .
In fact , asked to choose between three possible futures ( e.g. " the economy stays the same " , " the economy improves " , or " the economy worsens " ) , they performed no better than random .
In other words , rolling dice was as good as the experts at predicting the future .
According to Tetlocke , " In this age of academic hyperspecialization , there is no reason for supposing that contributors to top journals - distinguished political scientists , area study specialists , economists , and so on - are any better than journalists or attentive readers of the New York Times in ' reading ' emerging situations . "
In fact , Tetlocke claims that the more famous the expert , the worse they were at prediction .
This is the cult of professionalism , where expertise is worshipped .
Rank Amateurs
In contrast to this safe and smooth unreality stands the Internet , where traditional media , corporate advertising and the experts fight for attention against blogs , forums , and content ranking services that are created and populated by amateurs .
The importance of a new study is not determined by the editor of a newscast but by the number of people who share it with others on the web .
This is n't good news for everyone , especially those who make their living peddling truthiness and calm " objectivity " , making expert predictions and coming to questionable conclusions .
In an article called " The Amorality of Web 2.0 " , Nicholas Carr criticizes the " cult of the amateur " :
The promoters of Web 2.0 venerate the amateur and distrust the professional .
We see it in their unalloyed praise of Wikipedia , and we see it in their worship of open - source software and myriad other examples of democratic creativity .
Perhaps nowhere , though , is their love of amateurism so apparent as in their promotion of blogging as an alternative to what they call " the mainstream media . "
He is right that there are problems .
One that Carr does not discuss is that the cult of the amateur ritualizes the worship of popularity .
From search engines to content aggregators , information on the web is ranked according to how many people like it : the number of people who link to a site , or the number of people who recommend an article , is what brings it to the forefront .
But the truth is frequently unpopular , especially when it says something about us we do n't want to hear .
That said , there are plenty of amateurs who shout unpleasant truths from Internet rooftops .
The truthful information I find online , put there or made more prominent by amateurs , is often far more scary than what I hear on television from professionals .
But to Carr , what 's scariest is that the professionals might be replaced by amateurs :
Of course the mainstream media sees the blogosphere as a competitor .
It is a competitor .
And , given the economics of the competition , it may well turn out to be a superior competitor .
The layoffs we 've recently seen at major newspapers may just be the beginning , and those layoffs should be cause not for self - satisfied snickering but for despair .
Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur .
I for one can't imagine anything more frightening .
I do n't need to use my imagination to think of things that are much more frightening .
Those we have trusted - the newspapers , television , government officials and experts - have created a world for us that bears little resemblance to reality .
In spite of our best attempts to shield ourselves with skepticism and disbelief , we are often seduced by this vision of unreality .
After all , John Updike makes no claims that he is telling the truth - his work is fiction .
I learned from his stories anyway .
The fiction created for us by professionals is told to us as truth .
We try not to believe it , but we are immersed in it so fully that it is hard for us not to .
Our shields are not waterproof .
They will not save us from drowning .
And so , although the cult of the amateur has its problems , it also brings with it great benefits .
It is a lungful of fresh air for an almost submerged populace .
But the cult of professionalism will not be defeated so easily .
The battle is just getting started .

Python Templates
by James Tauber .
See blog entry to comment .
Originally posted to the Python Web SIG back in 2003 .
Published here May 2006 with minor changes .
Step 1
Simple string substitution can be achieved with the % operator :
name = " Guido " print " Hello %s ! " % name
Step 2
... which can be used with a dictionary :
dict = { " name " : " Guido " } print " Hello %( name )s ! " % dict
Step 3
The template can be a class , where the dictionary is passed into the constructor and __str__ is overridden to make the substitution :
class Template : def __init__ ( self , dict ) : self .
dict = dict def __str__ ( self ) : return " Hello %( name )s ! " % self.dict print Template ({ " name " : " Guido " })
Step 4
__getitem__ can be overridden to perform additional processing on values :
class Template : def __init__ ( self , dict ) : self .
dict = dict def __str__ ( self ) : return " Hello %( name )s ! " % self def __getitem__ ( self , key ) : return self.dict[key ].upper ( ) print Template ({ " name " : " Guido " })
Step 5
Processing can even be driven from the template itself , with %(... ) s referencing a function to apply to the value :
class Template : def __init__ ( self , dict ) : self .
dict = dict def __str__ ( self ) : return " Hello %( name ) s .
Hello %( name|upper )s ! " % self def __getitem__ ( self , key ) : l = key.split( " | " ) if len( l ) == 1 : return self.dict[key ] else : return getattr ( self , l [ 1 ] ) ( self.dict[l [ 0 ] ] ) def upper ( self , s ) : return s.upper ( ) print Template ({ " name " : " Guido " })
Step 6
Values in the dictionary can even be lists whose items are processed individually :
class Template : def __init__ ( self , dict ) : self .
dict = dict def __str__ ( self ) : return " < ul >
%( list|li )s
</ul > " % self def __getitem__ ( self , key ) : l = key.split( " | " ) if len( l ) == 1 : return self.dict[key ] else : return getattr ( self , l [ 1 ] ) ( self.dict[l [ 0 ] ] ) def li ( self , l ) : return "
" .join ( [ " \t < li >%s < /li > " % x for x in l ] ) print Template ({ " list " : [ " foo " , " bar " , " baz " ] } )
Step 7
The template can be moved into a class attribute :
class Template : _template = " " " < ul >
%( list|li )s
</ul > " " " def __init__ ( self , dict ) : self .
dict = dict def __str__ ( self ) : return self .
_template % self def __getitem__ ( self , key ) : l = key.split( " | " ) if len( l ) == 1 : return self.dict[key ] else : return getattr ( self , l [ 1 ] ) ( self.dict[l [ 0 ] ] ) def li ( self , l ) : return "
" .join ( [ " \t < li >%s < /li > " % x for x in l ] ) print Template ({ " list " : [ " foo " , " bar " , " baz " ] } )
Step 8
In some cases , you may want a value to come from a method rather than the dictionary :
class Template : _template = " " " < ul >
%( lst|li )s
</ul > " " " def __init__ ( self , dict={} ) : self .
dict = dict def __str__ ( self ) : return self .
_template % self def __getitem__ ( self , key ) : return self ._process(key.split( " | " ) ) def _process ( self , l ) : arg = l [ 0 ] if len( l ) == 1 : if arg in self.
dict : return self.dict[arg ] elif hasattr ( self , arg ) and callable ( getattr ( self , arg ) ) : return getattr ( self , arg ) ( ) else : raise KeyError ( arg ) else : func = l [ 1 ] return getattr ( self , func ) ( self._process ( [arg ] ) ) def lst ( self ) : return [ " foo " , " bar " , " baz " ] def li ( self , l ) : return "
" .join ( [ " \t < li >%s < /li > " % x for x in l ] ) print Template ( )
Step 9
Now let 's define a base template class and try multiple instances where we delegate formatting of the items to a different template than the overall list itself :
class DictionaryTemplate : def __init__ ( self , dict={} ) : self .
dict = dict def __str__ ( self ) : return self .
_template % self def __getitem__ ( self , key ) : return self ._process(key.split( " | " ) ) def _process ( self , l ) : arg = l [ 0 ] if len( l ) == 1 : if arg in self.
dict : return self.dict[arg ] elif hasattr ( self , arg ) and callable ( getattr ( self , arg ) ) : return getattr ( self , arg ) ( ) else : raise KeyError ( arg ) else : func = l [ 1 ] return getattr ( self , func ) ( self._process ( [arg ] ) ) class LI_Template : _template = " " " \t < li >%s < / li > " " " def __init__ ( self , input_list= [ ] ) : self .input_list = input_list def __str__ ( self ) : return "
" .join ([self._template % x for x in self.input_list ] ) class UL_Template ( DictionaryTemplate ) : _template = " " " < ul >
%( lst|li )s
</ul > " " " def li ( self , input_list ) : return LI_Template ( input_list ) print UL_Template ({ " lst " : [ " foo " , " bar " , " baz " ] } )
Step 10
Much of the LI_Template can be refactored into a base class that does for lists what Dictionary Template does for dictionaries :
from step9 import DictionaryTemplate class ListTemplate : def __init__ ( self , input_list= [ ] ) : self .input_list = input_list def __str__ ( self ) : return "
" .join ([self._template % x for x in self.input_list ] ) class LI_Template ( ListTemplate ) : _template = " " " \t< li>%s < /li > " " " class UL_Template ( DictionaryTemplate ) : _template = " " " < ul >
%( lst|li )s
</ul > " " " def li ( self , input_list ) : return LI_Template ( input_list ) print UL_Template ({ " lst " : [ " foo " , " bar " ] } )
Step 11
We can make at least two more improvements to Dictionary Template .
One is to allow keyword args to the constructor .
The other is to change __process to support references to functions that are passed in ( rather than being defined as methods ) :
class DictionaryTemplate : def __init__ ( self , dict={} , ** keywords ) : self.dict = dict self.dict.update( keywords ) def __str__ ( self ) : return self .
_template % self def __getitem__ ( self , key ) : return self ._process(key.split( " | " ) ) def _process ( self , l ) : arg = l [ 0 ] if len( l ) == 1 : if arg in self.
dict : return self.dict[arg ] elif hasattr ( self , arg ) and callable ( getattr ( self , arg ) ) : return getattr ( self , arg ) ( ) else : raise KeyError ( arg ) else : func_name = l [ 1 ] if func_name in self.dict : func = self.dict[ func_name ] else : func = getattr ( self , func_name ) return func( self._process ( [arg ] ) ) from step10 import ListTemplate class LI_Template ( ListTemplate ) : _template = " " " \t< li>%s < /li > " " " class UL_Template ( DictionaryTemplate ) : _template = " " " < ul >
%( lst|li )s
</ul > " " " print UL_Template ( lst= [ " foo " , " bar " , " baz " , " biz " ] , li=LI_Template )
Step 12
Here is an example which starts to show a slightly more involved template .
A 2,000 - year - old piece of paper inscribed with legible handwriting has been found in Gansu Province , suggesting that China 's paper - making and handwriting history are older than previously thought .
The 10 square centimeter piece of paper , made from linen fibers , was found during restoration of an ancient garrison near the Yumen Pass at Dunhuang in northwest China .
The garrison was in use during the Western Han Dynasty ( 206 B.C. - 25 A.D. ) , a report in the Beijing - based Guangming Daily said .
" The paper was made in 8 B.C. , more than 100 years before the birth of Cai Lun who is widely considered the inventor of paper - making in China .
It also shows that the ancient Chinese have been writing on paper for much longer than we thought , " said Fu Licheng , curator of the Dunhuang Museum .
Cai Lun successfully made paper out of tree bark , cloth , and fishing nets in 105 A.D .
Experts say so far over 20 ancient Chinese characters on the paper have been identified , and that the piece of paper was likely part of a letter .

This is how you build endurance ; running once a week wo n't cut it .
Space out the days to allow for recovery time between sessions .
Anything more goes beyond fitness and into running for other purposes , something you may find yourself doing if bitten by the running bug .
As the weeks go on , push yourself to run further and for a longer period of time .
If you ran 10 minutes at a time the first week , push yourself to do 15 the second week .
Make it 20 the third week .
You 'll soon find that you 're able to go much longer before you feel like you have to stop .
To build endurance , try these strategies :
Running the same boring track day in and day out is going to make you feel burned out pretty soon .
Treat yourself to a run in the woods , or in a neighborhood you 've never explored before .
Try to rotate your workout sessions between 2 or 3 different places to keep things interesting .
4
Do n't give up too soon .
After a few runs , you might be inclined to think you are n't cut out for running .
You 'll think to yourself , should n't this be more fun by now ?
Why does it hurt so much ?
Just keep going .
Tell yourself you 'll give it at least two weeks before throwing in the towel .
After a few weeks of pushing yourself by following a running routine you will begin to feel lighter , faster , and you 'll start having more fun .
Eventually you 'll realize you do n't want to miss a run .
Press release from The International Union of Sex Workers on
Amnesty International ’s Decision to Adopt Policy on the Human Rights of Sex Workers
12 August 2015
The IUSW is deeply grateful to Amnesty International for adopting policy to protect the human rights of sex workers .
In doing so , Amnesty has listened to hundreds of sex workers ’ organisations across the world who call for a rights - based approach to address problems associated with the sex industry [ i ] .
Criminalisation creates systematic human rights abuses and turns people in the sex industry into easy targets for perpetrators of violence .
Catherine Stephens of the IUSW comments “ People in the sex industry , whether there by choice , circumstance or coercion , are entitled to equal human rights and the full protection of the law as other citizens .
It is vulnerability which creates victims , not sex work itself , and evidence shows criminalisation increases our vulnerability .
Policies that solve problems are based in reality and on evidence and we welcome Amnesty ’s commitment to evidence - based policy that respects and protects the rights of people in the sex industry . ”
Article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law .
All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination .
By criminalising us when we work together , UK law effectively discriminates against sex workers ’ right to equal protection of the law .
Criminalising our consent to sex ( the “ Swedish model ” of criminalising clients ) means that if we contact the police to report a crime against us they may choose to seek easy arrest results by targeting our clients rather than those who have harmed us .
Sex workers in Sweden report increased likelihood of rape due to having to accept clients who give no personal information who then act in the knowledge that identification of perpetrators is more difficult and many recount stories of police abuse and disrespect , including being harassed at home , being made homeless due to police threats to prosecute their landlords as living off proceeds of prostitution , being told by police that sex workers cannot be raped and being gang - raped by a group of police officers .
7
Criminalisation of clients not only breaches Article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , it contravenes Article 6 .
Article 6 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law .
From this it follows :
Every individual has the right to autonomy and bodily integrity .
A woman ’s consent to sex is her own to give .
The state is not entitled to diminish or disrespect the validity of her consent to sex .
Article 17.1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others .
Article 20.1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association .
Brothel keeping legislation , in the UK and elsewhere , concerns premises and location , rather than coercion or exploitation .
The effect of this is that people who have sex for money cannot own or share property together without risk of prosecution .
In addition , UK legislation on “ controlling for gain ” ( “ pimping ” ) is entirely unconnected with trafficking or exploitation .
It criminalises almost every way of working with or for a third party and explicitly includes people working of their own free will . [ ii ]
The only way to exchange sex for money indoors and be free of the risk of successful prosecution is to do so entirely in isolation , breaching not only our human rights but vastly increasing the dangers we face .
Gangs target us – for sexual predation and financial profit – knowing they will find either the easy target of a lone individual or occupants of a shared premise , who are at risk of arrest if they contact the police .
Women connected with the IUSW have received criminal convictions as a result of sending two dozen text messages – over a period of two years – ensuring another woman would be present for her shift at a brothel and for working from a holiday flat , rented for a fortnight , with another woman on the basis that both were running the brothel created by the other ’s presence .
Article 21.1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country , directly or through freely chosen representatives .
People in the sex industry are isolated and endangered by criminalisation and stigma .
Exposure risks police investigation of ourselves or our workplaces , potential problems with child custody , possible loss of employment ( even if our sex work experience is completely in the past ) and chance of eviction if we work from home . [ iii ] [ iv ] [ v ]
These vulnerabilities impede us from participating in the policy discussions that will affect our lives and livelihoods .
Sex workers who speak out have little personally to gain and much to lose – the hazards of drawing attention are exacerbated by anti-sex workers rights ’ campaigners who prefer to try to dismiss us as “ pimps ” rather than respond to our arguments .
[ vi ] [ vii ]
The more closely we can be identified , the more dangerous this is – to clear ourselves of such accusations of illegality , we would need to make clear we work in complete isolation , informing those who might wish to do us harm of our vulnerability to attack .[ viii ]
Article 21.2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
Everyone has the right of equal access to public service in his country .
The harmful effects of criminalisation on access to services are widely recognised .
UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon specifically notes the harms of discrimination against people in the sex industry : “ In most countries , discrimination remains legal against women , men who have sex with men , sex workers , drug users , and ethnic minorities .
This must change . ” [ ix ]
The UNAIDS Guidance Note on HIV and Sex Work describes problems caused by “ laws , policies and practices [ that ] drive sex work underground ” and increase stigma and discrimination against people in the sex industry .
This view is endorsed by UNAIDS co-sponsors UNHCR , UNICEF , WFP , UNDP , UNFPA , UNODC , ILO , WHO , the World Bank and the UNAIDS Secretariat . [ x ]
Notes :
The IUSW is a an unfunded organisation ( all work is by volunteers ) of sex workers and allies who believe that
everybody in the sex industry , whether there by choice , circumstance or coercion , is entitled to the same human , civil and labour rights as others
protection of human rights and safety must be a priority
practice and policy on the sex industry should be created through meaningful inclusion of those most affected – people who currently sell sex , not ideologically - driven NGOs or campaigners
and
policies that solve problems are based in reality and on evidence , rather than on ideology , emotion , stereotypes , dramatic individual cases or cherry - picked data .

Eliot Spitzer , the New York attorney general , is close to a settlement with one of the world 's largest record companies to resolve accusations that it used improper tactics to influence radio programmers to play its songs , people involved in the discussions said last night .
The agreement between Mr. Spitzer and the record company , Sony BMG Music Entertainment , one of four music conglomerates under investigation , is expected to be announced on Monday , these people said .
They cautioned , however , that the talks were continuing and could still break down .
The settlement is expected to establish a blueprint for agreements that Mr. Spitzer will probably seek with the other three major record companies , which have all received subpoenas .
Late last year , investigators in Mr. Spitzer 's office served subpoenas on Sony BMG , a unit of Sony and Bertelsmann ; the Universal Music Group , a unit of Vivendi Universal ; the EMI Group ; and the Warner Music Group seeking copies of contracts , billing records and other information detailing their ties to independent middlemen who pitch new songs to radio programmers in New York State .
Investigators have also reviewed e-mail messages and internal memos and have questioned senior executives at Sony .
The hidden cost of outsourcing
Outsourcing customer service may seem like a bargain , but it can cost you some of your most valuable clients .
( Business 2.0 ) - Dell ( Research ) tried it , then reversed course .
Capital One ( Research ) gave up as well , and so did JPMorgan Chase ( Research ) .
All came to the same conclusion about their attempts to farm out front - line customer - service jobs to outside contractors :
The hidden costs far outweighed the potential savings in labor expenses .
Waning enthusiasm
With consumers enjoying more choice than ever before , evidence is growing that great service is essential for long - term customer retention .
To cite just one example , a recent survey of pension policyholders in the United Kingdom found that 75 percent would leave their current provider if they experienced bad customer service .
Meanwhile , the current enthusiasm for outsourcing call centers , IT support , and other " noncore " service functions is n't delighting anyone .
Two - thirds of the companies that responded to a survey by InformationWeek reported either no change or a worsening in customer satisfaction as a result of business - process outsourcing .
A 2005 Gartner study predicts that 60 percent of organizations that outsource customer - facing processes will see significant numbers of frustrated customers switching to competitors .
The costs associated with these defections add up quickly , which helps explain why the same study found that 80 percent of companies that outsource customer - service functions fail to meet their cost - savings targets .
No wonder all three of the companies cited above recently brought some of their customer - support operations back in - house after contracting them out to companies that were n't very good at providing help .
There are practical reasons why an outsourcer 's service level is seldom as high as what you 'll get from your own people .
If outside contractors cut costs , it might be because they 're more efficient .
But it 's far more likely that the savings occur because contractors pay their people less , spend less on training , or both .
In the petrochemical and mining industries , for example , research shows that a disproportionate number of accidents involve contractors .
Just as there 's no such thing as a free lunch , there 's no such thing as a free worker who 's been properly trained to do a great job .
Likewise , when people do n't identify with the organization on whose behalf they 're working , their performance typically suffers .
That 's because in - house employees tend to be far more interested in nurturing a good reputation among clients and customers .
It 's human nature : Since the name of their organization is n't directly associated with the service that contractors provide , there 's less motivation to make sure it 's done right .
Real competitive advantage
Which is why the backlash against customer - service outsourcing is upon us , and why it 's gathering steam .
Sure , outsourcing offers short - term cost savings .
But contracting out critical functions can never deliver sustainable competitive advantage , because competitors can always hire the same contractors to do the same thing ( equally poorly ) .
Real competitive advantage stems from strategies that are n't easily imitated -- and , sorry , buying services on the open market is n't one of them .
Unless you work for Wal - Mart ( Research ) or you sell a commoditized product like petroleum , you 'll soon figure out that competing solely on price is a fool 's game .
Even in retail : Tiffany is having a stunning year , and Whole Foods Market 's ( Research ) profits and stock price are way up - - 5 and 70 percent , respectively - - in 2005 .
Neither of those companies seeks to compete on price .
Their edge stems from perceived value -- what consumers think they 'll get for their money .
If you 're prepared to dash those expectations just to save a few pennies per customer , perhaps it 's time to rethink your strategy .

At first sight it is little more than a poetic polemic about the virtues of an effective leader .
But a poem has been removed from school textbooks in Pakistan after it became clear that the first letter of each line spelt out " President George W Bush " .
Penned by an anonymous writer , The Leader embarrassed education officials in the country after it found its way into an English textbook for 16 - year - olds .
The 20 - line work , which was first printed last year , includes the lines : " Never back down when he sees what is true / Tells it all straight , and means it all too / Going forward and knowing he 's right / Even when doubted for why he would fight . "
And the poetic description of the ideal leader continues : " Over and over he makes his case clear / Reaching to touch the ones who wo n't hear / Growing in strength , he wo n't be unnerved / Ever assuring he 'll stand by his word / Wanting the world to join his firm stand . "
The revelation is likely to embarrass Pakistan 's president Pervez Musharraf , who has been criticised at home for taking what has been perceived to be a pro-American stance in supporting the Bush administration 's so - called war on terror .
An official working with the Pakistan Education ministry told the Times of India : " We have decided to delete the poem from the book , published by the National Book Foundation , and prescribed for federal board students .
" It will be stretching the matter too far to assert that the poem was inserted in the book deliberately to enumerate the qualities of President Bush . "
An investigation has been launched to find out how the work was not spotted by the committees which censor the content of textbooks .
It was first printed in A Textbook of English last year after the Pakistani government took the decision to deregulate the publication of textbooks .
The leader
Patient and steady with all he must bear ,
Ready to accept every challenge with care ,
Easy in manner , yet solid as steel ,
Strong in his faith , refreshingly real ,
Is n't afraid to propose what is bold ,
Does n't conform to the usual mold ,
Eyes that have foresight , for hindsight wont do
Never back down when he sees what is true
Tells it all straight , and means it all too
Bracing for war , but praying for peace
Using his power so evil will cease :
So much a leader and worthy of trust ,
Here stands a man who will do what he must
The spiralling cost to the taxpayer and secrecy surrounding how the money will be spent threaten the enthusiasm that greeted the capital 's victory over Paris in the race to host 2012 , politicians on the assembly 's Budget Committee warn in a document seen by The Observer .
The £ 8bn figure is considerably higher than the £ 5bn revised budget for the event produced just last week .
It is based on evidence given by official bodies and key figures involved in funding and delivering the event , such as the Olympic Development Authority .
There have also been recent revelations about how the cost of providing security and regenerating London 's East End for 2012 is soaring .
The Budget Committee will meet this Wednesday to air their fears and demand far greater openness from Olympic leaders about the financing of 2012 .
Its report says that speculation about an extra £ 250 m having to be found to cover VAT on building the venues for 2012 ' adds urgency to our call for more public information ' .
Assembly members say the £ 2.4bn figure was at best unrealistic and at worst an attempt to appeal to both the public and the International Olympic Committee , which awards the Olympics .
Brian Coleman , the Assembly chairman and a Conservative member , said last night : ' We were told the £ 2.4 bn figure was robust and rigorous .
It turns out that it was a back - of - the - envelope fantasy job .
The question now is : who pays ?'
Assembly members yesterday said they fear that London 's Games could end up being the most expensive ever .
Tessa Jowell , the Culture Secretary and Olympics Minister , is likely to face tough questioning on Tuesday when she gives evidence at the Commons Culture , Media and Sport Select Committee 's inquiry into 2012 .
Assembly members fear that Londoners could end up subsidising house - building in the city 's East End through the £ 625 m
Olympic precept on their council tax bills , that 2012 will swallow up the capital 's entire budget for economic development .
But Jowell last night said the public and media should distinguish between the narrow costs of putting on 2012 and the much larger expense of regenerating a huge swathe of the East End alongside the building of the Olympic venues .
' People should bear in mind that the assembly budget committee have n't factored into their report the large sums of money we will recoup from our investment now from selling land and , for example , turning the 2012 International Broadcast Centre into offices and light industrial units ' , said Jowell .
' We are conducting a fundamental review of the costs that were carefully constructed as part of the original bid to take account of changes since we won the bid , such as increases in commodity prices , the increased cost of security since the 7/7 bombings and our bigger ambition now to realise the prize of regeneration .

A spokesman for the charity group organising its rescue from the river in central London said the bottle - nosed whale went into convulsions as it was taken by barge into the Thames Estuary and died at around 7 pm .
Chairman of the British Divers Marine Life Rescue group Alan Knight said : " We had a phone call from the vet saying that it had started convulsing and while he was on the phone it died .
" It was still about two hours away from the planned release place . "
Another spokesman , Tony Woodley , said his hopes had been lifted that the animal could survive when he saw it being lifted on to the barge but he soon realised that it would be a struggle to keep it alive .
" It is such a shame and I know that so many people in the UK and around the world have been watching this , " he told Sky News .
" It is such a great shame that on this occasion we have not been successful . "
Update 4/11/06 : I ’ve received some criticism on this post from people who assumed I was saying you should never use image tags in HTML .
My bad for the misleading title , I ’ve added to the title in parens to be more concise !
For those that did n’t read the whole post , in the last paragraph I say that it ’s fine to use HTML image tags for content , I just think it ’s bad design to use image tags for style elements .
Anyhow , thanks for all the feedback ( postive and negative ) and here ’s the original post :
CSS offers us a lot of power to style and decorate our pages with images , however , replacing text with an image is one gap not well addressed by CSS such that you often see sites doing :
< a href= ” / ” >< img alt = ” Home ” src=” home.gif ”/></a>
which is obviously bad for 2 reasons :
1 . It violates the separation of content and design by including a design element in your HTML
2 . Your SEO will suffer because image alt tags do n’t carry as much weight as real text
As a result a number of people have come up with clever image replacement techniques in CSS .
It began in 2003 with the Fahrner Image Replacement technique ( or Classic FIR ) , however , the technique I currently favor is the Mike Rundle ’s Phark revised method which :
1 . Works well cross browser ( but be sure to test in IE 5 for possible issues if you ’re still supporting it )
2 . Works with a screen reader such as JAWS for accessibility
3 . Works well for SEO ( many techniques style the text with display : none which likely wo n’t work with the next generation of crawlers such as Google ’s new Mozilla based crawler )
Taking the example above , the correct approach would be as follows :
< a id =” home ” href= ” / ” > Home </a>
Then apply the Phark revised method via CSS :
#home {
display : block ;
text - indent : - 9000 px ;
background : url(/images/home.gif ) no -repeat ;
height : 25 px ;
width : 100 px ;
}
Here ’s the result :
About Us
Now we ’ve replaced the text with an image yet still kept the separation of content and design clean .
I stated that it ’s bad design to use image tags in your HTML but I ’d like to qualify that , it ’s fine if your “ content ” is an image such as a product photograph in a web catalog , a graph , or a headshot in your user profile .
Also I think it ’s fine to bail on image replacement if you start wasting a lot of time in CSS layout land , it ’s just good to start with the clean text based approach first and use it until it becomes impractical .

The giant earthquake that set off a devastating tsunami across the Indian Ocean in December 2004 disrupted the earth enough to change gravity and to deflect satellites passing hundreds of miles above .
Two identical satellites , collectively known as the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment , or Grace , travel one behind the other in a polar orbit separated by about 130 miles .
By recording small changes in the distance between them when their orbits are deflected , the satellites provide data used to calculate variations in the earth ’s gravitational field .
In a report in the current issue of the journal Science , scientists at Ohio State University and the University of California , Santa Barbara , report that in the aftermath of the magnitude 9.1 earthquake , the largest in four decades , Grace recorded a sudden drop in gravity near the quake ’s epicenter off Sumatra .

A Self - Vindicating Policy
Building new nuclear weapons creates the threats they are supposed to avert .
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 24th January 2006 .
In nuclear politics , every action is justified by the response it provokes .
The US explains its missile defence programme by claiming that other states are developing new weapons systems , which one day it might need to shoot down .
In response , Russia has activated a new weapons system , the Topol - M , designed to “ penetrate US anti-missile defences ” ( 1 ) .
Israel , citing the threat from Iran , insists on retaining its nuclear missiles .
Threatened by them ( and prompted , among other reasons , by his anti-semitism ) , the Iranian president says he wants to wipe Israel off the map , and appears to be developing a means of doing so .
Israel sees his response as vindicating its nuclear programme .
It threatens an air strike , which grants retrospective validity to Ahmadinejad ’s designs .
And so it goes on .
Everyone turns out to be right in the end .
Tomorrow the deadline passes for the only objection anyone is likely to be allowed to make to the latest £ 100 million of government spending on Britain ’s nuclear capability .
West Berkshire council is permitted , on planning grounds , to ask the government for a public inquiry into whether the Orion laser project at Aldermaston should go ahead .
The government is under no obligation to grant it .
No one else has any power to impede the scheme .
The Orion programme seems to be one of those projects whose purpose will be determined after it has begun , but it appears to have something to do with evading the comprehensive test ban treaty ( 2 ) .
It might help British engineers to design a new generation of bombs without having to test them .
If so , it will strengthen the suspicion that the government is considering not only replacing our existing Trident missiles , but also building an entirely new class of weapons to accompany them .
In 2002 a spokesman at Aldermaston suggested that the plant might start building either mini- nukes or nuclear warheads for cruise missiles ( 3 ) .
Three weeks ago , the Royal Navy announced that it is spending £ 125 million upgrading the Faslane naval base on the River Clyde in Scotland ( 4 ) .
The base houses the submarines which carry the UK ’s Trident missiles .
Like the Orion project , the spending has been approved before parliament or the public has had a chance to decide whether it is necessary : what it means , in effect , is that the Trident replacement programme has already begun .
The defence secretary explains that a new missile system is necessary because “ some countries ” have not been “ complying with their obligations under the non-proliferation treaty ” ( 5 ) .
In response , therefore , the UK will refuse to comply with its obligations under the non-proliferation treaty .
This provides other countries with their justification for … well , you ’ve got the general idea .
Last week , France joined the exclusive club of responsible nations ( the UK ( 6 ) , US ( 7 ) and North Korea ) which have threatened other countries with a pre-emptive nuclear strike .
What greater incentive could there be for the rogue states Chirac spoke of to “ consider using … weapons of mass destruction ” ?
( 8 )
Unlike the British parliament , the US Congress has been permitted to vote on such matters , and despite a great deal of bellyaching from the administration , has bravely sought to block a new nuclear weapons programme .
For two years in a row it has refused to approve the money for George Bush ’s “ robust nuclear earth penetrator ” , a mini- nuke which could have reduced the threshold for first use .
But now it seems to have been duped .
Last year it approved initial funding for something called the “ reliable replacement warhead ” programme .
The administration maintained that this was nothing more than the refurbishment of existing nuclear weapons .
The legislators chose to believe it .
David Hobson , a Republican who sits on the House Appropriations Committee , and has led the fight against new weapons , was persuaded that “ this is not a sneaky way to get a whole new powerful warhead type of thing in the future .
We ’re not trying to do separate missions than those the warheads were designed for today .
” ( 9 ) Ellen Tauscher , a Democrat who is fiercely opposed to proliferation , insisted “ this is about tinkering at the margins of the existing weapons systems , nothing more . ” ( 10 ) The programme would concentrate on replacing a few non-nuclear components , such as wires and electronics , in order to extend their life .
They seemed naïve then and they seem more naïve today .
The US has already spent about $ 60 billion maintaining and refurbishing its weapons under a separate programme , called “ stockpile stewardship ” .
It was n’t easy to see why it needed a new scheme .
Even before the reliable replacement warhead programme had been approved , the outgoing deputy head of the Nuclear National Security Administration ( NNSA ) had let slip that a new generation of weapons was “ not the primary objective , but [ it ] would be a fortuitous associated event . ” ( 11 )
Now the associated event is beginning to look like a primary objective .
A couple of weeks ago , the San Francisco Chronicle interviewed the head of the NNSA , Linton Brookes .
“ I do n’t want to mislead you , ” he admitted .
“ I will personally be very surprised if we can get the advantages we want without redesigning the physics package . ” ( 12 )
The “ physics package ” is the nuclear warhead .
He went on to explain that the warheads “ will require new pits ” ( the “ pit ” is the plutonium core in which the reaction begins ) .
“ We are going to need to melt them down and recast them . ”
The new warheads would be bigger than the old ones .
This is beginning to look like “ a whole new powerful warhead type of thing ” .
Writing in the online magazine OpenDemocracy a few days ago , the professor of peace studies Paul Rogers suggested that an early candidate for replacement under the new programme would be America ’s Trident missiles .
If this is the case , it “ would suit the British very well , with the prospect of close collaboration and maybe even the sharing of some development costs . ” ( 13 )
So , without any proper public debate on either side of the Atlantic , both nations might have begun developing a new nuclear weapons programme which could last for 40 or 50 years .
Thoughout that period , their missiles will continue to provide everyone else with an excuse to flout the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
When Iran is referred to the UN Security Council , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will be able to turn every accusation it makes back on his accusers .
He will insist that the council ’s members are asserting a monopoly of ultimate violence ; that while there is as yet no definitive evidence that he is in breach of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , no one can doubt that they are .
He will point to America ’s tacit endorsement of Israel ’s nuclear status and its overt endorsement of India ’s .
He will assert that the enforcement of the global nuclear regime discriminates against Muslim states .
And though he is wrong about many things , he will be right about all that .
This is not to say that the horripilation Iran ’s nuclear programme inspires is unjustified .
Nor is it to claim that no other state would seek to develop or maintain nuclear weapons if the official nuclear powers gave theirs up .
But the refusal of the members of the security council to make any moves towards disarmament , their threats of pre-emptive bombing and their quiet development of new weapons systems guarantees the failure of both the UN and the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Nothing could make us less secure than the billions we are spending in the name of security .

That much money at stake means that it 's almost certainly going to be dominated by teams of people with real understanding of the problem domain , probably PhDs in statistics , and more computing resources than a single desktop PC .
And while winning might not be the point , I want to at least have a good shot at getting a respectable result .
But after reading the ongoing comp.lang.lisp thread about the competition ( " Subject : massive data analysis with lisp " ) , and disagreeing with most of what was written there , I needed to validate my opinions on how the data should be represented internally , by writing at least the data - handling parts of the program .
In - memory database , which each rating stored as a separate structure instance ?
That 's going to take gigabytes of memory due to the headers and the inefficient struct slot packing .
Using an SQL database ?
That seems like a horrible idea , unless you intend to do all of your processing using SQL functions .
Once you want to do anything even moderately complex on the lisp - side , you 'll need to transfer the data over , and get buried in the overhead .
Storing the data as flat files , and using READ for reading them ?
AARGH !
My gut feeling – supported by complete lack of knowledge of the problem domain – is that there 's simply the wrong amount of data for any of these to be feasible , compared to an efficient in - memory representation .
The plan was to pack each datapoint into a x86 - 64 fixnum ( 22 bits for the user info , 15 for the movie , and 3 for the rating , lots of padding ) , write the fixnums into a file with a suitable SBCL array header as a prefix , and then mmap the file .
This has several nice properties : it loads instantly , can be accessed at memory speed , is reasonably memory - efficient , does n't stress the GC , has good paging characteristics ( on - demand , copy - on - write ) , and looks like a normal Lisp vector .
mmap two copies with the entries sorted in a different order , and you can also do easy and quick searches and joins bon both movies and uids .
On the minus side , this does take 2*800 MB of memory and disk space .
Luckily that 's just right for my machine , so the program will still run without any disk trashing ( the whole working set wo n't really fit into memory at once , but the accesses have a pretty good locality ) .
The exact specifics of the data layout are obviously not crucial , just something that works for me .
Somebody else might make different tradeoffs , like omitting the movie from the rating , and inferring it from the array index to get it to fit into less memory / 29 - bit fixnums .
Or you might store the different properties ( movie / uid / rating ) in separate arrays , to get better cache / page locality .
Initially this was all that I was going to do .
But once the the data was available , I could n't resist playing around with it a little .
Pretty soon I had a working implementation of an unsophisticated brute - force algorithm , which I expected would be barely better than the naive approach of just predicting averages .
But actually it ended up getting a slightly better score on the probe dataset than the current Cinematch algorithm does .
The most likely reason was that I did n't bother separating the probe set from the training data , which would skew the results .
So I did the qualifying dataset too , and submitted it for scoring .
As expected the score on that one is worse , but it 's not nearly as bad as I feared .
Rather it 's 7th on the leaderboard , a mere 1.6 % behind Cinematch .
I 'm fairly convinced that if I 'd been using any other sort of data representation , I would 've been forced to abandon this algorithm as too slow .
Even as - is , it 'll take several hours to process the full qualifying set .
There are a few morals to this story :
India has admitted the first test - firing of its new nuclear - capable Agni III missile failed on the weekend after the media reported it was suffering a design flaw .
Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee said the missile failed to reach its target and plummeted well short into the Bay of Bengal .
Describing the failure as a snag , Mukherjee said India would press ahead with the program and correct any faults .
You never know when you might want to significantly alter the orbital path of the Earth .
Maybe the Sun is going Red Giant and you miss the days when lead did n't melt in direct sunlight .
Maybe Earth is about to hit an asteroid .
Maybe it is n't , but you want it to .
Maybe you want to destroy it : a significant number of methods for destroying the Earth involve moving it by some substantial amount .
Well , it is n't easy .
In fact , it 's very very difficult .
The Earth is very big , moving very fast , and therefore very difficult to stop or even slow down .
Ordered approximately by plausibility .
Electromagnetic influence .
Traditionally the Earth is thought of as " ground " , " neutral " .
This is because overall it carries almost exactly zero overall charge .
But what if it did n't ?
If there was some way to electrically charge the Earth , by dumping lots of identically charged particles onto the Earth or just ionizing particles already on Earth - a large amber rod might perhaps be in order - then we could use magnetic fields to drive the planet in the direction we wanted it to go .
Maybe .
Or better yet : the Earth already has a standing magnetic field ; perhaps we could construct a cylinder of cable around it , and pass current to move it using Lorentz forces .
I know what you 're thinking .
Yeah , this is ridiculously implausible .
Moving on .
Direct rocket propulsion .
Build gigantic , possibly nuclear upward - pointing rocket furnaces , maybe one , maybe four , maybe a million , whatever you can budget for .
" Gigantic " as in the size of , say , Belgium .
Design them carefully so that when used the rocket engines do not actually just propel themselves through the ground and into Earth where they become useless - you may need to periodically dig them out again after several thousand years ' continued thrusting , or else just build new ones over the top .
The most obvious major drawback with this method is that right now there are n't even theories as to how you could possibly build rocket engines of the sort proposed here .
Another , more sophisticated , problem is that the Earth is constantly spinning .
You could build an engine at either pole and this would n't have any effect , but anywhere else and the constantly changing angle of thrust will cause the Earth to behave somewhat like a loose Catherine Wheel - type firework .
Plotting acceleration vectors towards whatever your target is in this case may prove to be a nontrivial problem , solvable only with high - tech computer simulations .
Alternatively , as the Earth 's angular kinetic energy is negligible compared to its orbital kinetic energy , you might consider diverting a relatively small amount of resources to simply stopping the Earth from spinning at all , before beginning the main project .
Atmospheric considerations are ignored here since it is far more energy - efficient to manually remove the Earth 's atmosphere , move the planet , and reinstall it .
Direct matter propulsion .
Same method as above , just using gigantic mass drivers / railguns to fire huge quantities of matter away from Earth , instead of a rocket exhaust .
The principle here is much the same , with the railguns behaving somewhat like discretized versions of thrusters , providing instantaneous changes in velocity as opposed to sustained steady change .
Drawbacks : as above , the momentum change you get is minuscule because you have to subtract off the 11 km / s needed to launch the material upwards forever at all .
Highly inefficient .
Disassemble , move the bits and pieces , reassemble .
The major problem here is figuring out how to pick up big pieces of continental plate without breaking them .
It all depends how fussy you are about how the Earth looks afterwards , of course .
Solar sail method .
I can't honestly add much to that article except to say that to move the Earth substantially , the sail used is going to have to be pretty big .
Like , suspended - from - space - elevators big .
Difficult ...
Colin McInnes , however , suggests an alternative .
Construct a huge solar sail with a significant mass .
Plan it right , and you can couple it together with the Earth with gravity alone , using the solar wind to balance out the Earth 's gravitational attraction .
Wait long enough , and the solar wind blowing the sail outwards will take the Earth outward too , since the two are gravitationally bound together !
It is possible to use a solar sail to steer the Earth into the Sun .
Just use it to tack against the direction in which the Earth is travelling , gradually slowing its orbital velocity and increasing the orbit 's eccentricity , until the orbit passes within the Roche limit where the Earth is torn apart by tidal forces .
Billiards method .
Clonk the Earth with something big and heavy , causing it to alter course .
Let me emphasize the words " big " , " heavy " and " clonk " .
Ceres , the solar system 's largest asteroid , has less than 1/40,000th the mass of Earth ; the Moon , a mere 1/80th .
These objects are the heaviest you 're likely to find - there are heavier moons and entire planets you could consider using , but to be honest from this point of view it looks more like using a succession of hundreds , thousands or tens of thousands of smaller asteroid impacts would be a better bet .
Certainly , no single impact is going to do all the course changing you 'll be wanting to pull off .
Note that the Earth does not and will not behave like a solid , rigid billiard ball under such huge impacts as these .
For example , an object the size of Mars hit Earth once in the dim and distant past .
Rather than simply bouncing off , the object destroyed much of both itself and Earth , causing a VAST spray of matter to be hurled off from the impact point ; this matter coagulated into what is now the Moon .
Basically , the point here is that modelling impacts like these is a tricky business .
Do your numbers carefully .
Google has also announced a deal with MTV this week
The deal will see Google pay Fox at least $ 900 m ( £ 472 m ) , provided certain web traffic targets are met .
However the agreement does not include FoxSports.com , which already has contracts with Microsoft and MSN .
Google said online community MySpace was an important site to be involved with given its rapid popularity growth .
Adverts
From October , MySpace users will be able to use Google to search for groups and friends through the site .
Google will also provide text - based adverts triggered by keywords found on the websites .
The deal ends speculation about which search engine would serve MySpace .
Yahoo and MSN were also reported to have been in the running .
MySpace was bought by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corporation in July last year .
President of Fox Interactive Media Ross Levinsohn said that 250,000 people were joining MySpace each day .
The site was approaching the 100 million user profiles , he said .
Earlier this week , Google struck a deal with MTV to distribute video footage from the music station to websites and blogs .
FOR most homeowners , their house is their biggest single financial asset and their mortgage is their biggest single liability .
House - price inflation has normally made this a good bet .
But it makes little sense in financial theory for investors to borrow a lot to speculate on a single asset class .
This is particularly true when high house prices in many nations have forced many buyers to take on debts that are a substantial multiple of their incomes .
The answer , according to Zurich Cantonal Bank , is to link the value of the loan to that of the property .
On September 18th it launched a new product that offers two ways of doing so .
One version includes a put option ( a kind of insurance ) linked to Zurich 's house - price index .
At a cost of around 0.5 % a year , this option ensures that , if regional house prices fall , the size of the loan will decline in tandem .
The second version links the level of the mortgage rate to the house - price index .
This is not the first product of this type .
In July , Advantage , the British lending arm of Morgan Stanley , an American bank , unveiled a mortgage called Flexishare .
Under this deal , the value of part of the loan rises and falls in line with the house price ; in return , Advantage charges a lower interest rate ( 2.99 % ) on that portion of the loan .
Morgan Stanley hopes to package up such loans and re-sell them on the capital markets , where they might be an attractive alternative to index - linked bonds .
On the surface , it certainly seems sensible for a homebuyer to finance a purchase with the equivalent of both equity and debt ; that is what the corporate finance experts advise businesses to do .
But there are some obvious caveats .
The low - interest portion of the Advantage mortgage may entice homebuyers who are struggling to afford their regular payments , thus tilting the loan book towards the least creditworthy part of the market .
The structure also sounds a little like the “ negative amortisation ” loans ( under which interest payments are added to the capital ) recently introduced in America , which are seen as a sign of a housing bubble .
And in Britain , home - equity schemes ( which allow the elderly to release some of the value locked into their properties ) have not enjoyed a great reputation .
But the big question is whether buyers will be willing either to pay a higher interest rate ( in Switzerland ) , or to give up some of the potential rise in house prices ( in Britain ) , in order to insure against the downside .
British homebuyers , like their American counterparts , are mainly used to house prices going up .
Significantly , while Advantage says it has seen interest in its Flexishare deal , it has so far had no actual takers .
Fliegende Rattengehirne Hans Boës
Nervenzellen aus Rattenembryonen lernen in einem Flugsimulator ein Kampfflugzeug zu steuern
Das ist eigentlich der Stoff aus dem üblicherweise Science - Fiction - Filme gedreht werden : Hirnzellen in einer Nährstofflösung lernen , wie man ein Kampfflugzeug fliegt .
Sie reagieren mit der Zeit schneller und besser als ihre menschlichen Kollegen .
Alsbald erwachen diese lebenden Gehirne dann plötzlich aus ihrem unbewussten Dornröschenschlaf und übernehmen in einer dramatischen Wendung der Geschichte die Herrschaft über ihre Erschaffer , indem sie sich mit allen verfügbaren Computernetzwerken des Militärs kurzschließen und ein neues „ Superhirn “ bilden
Zumindest der Anfang dieses Science - Fiction - Thrillers ist seit kurzer Zeit Realität : Wissenschaftler an der University of Florida haben einem künstlich gezüchtetem Netzwerk aus embryonalen Rattennerven in einem Flugsimulator das Fliegen eines virtuellen Kampfflugzeugs gelehrt ( Chip im Gehirn oder biologisches Gehirn in der Maschine ) .
Zunächst hatten die Ratten - Neuronen natürlich Mühe , das Flugzeug überhaupt in der Luft zu halten .
Aber mit der Zeit lernt das Neuronale Netz , den virtuellen Flieger zu steuern .
Inzwischen sind diese „ fliegenden Rattengehirne “ in der Lage , einen militärischen F - 22 Jet selbst bei Hurricane - Windstärke sicher zu steuern .
Die Idee zu dem liebevoll „ the brain “ genannten Versuchsaufbau hatte Prof. Thomas DeMarse am Department of Biomedical Engineering der University of Florida
Die Arbeiten von DeMarse sind insofern bahnbrechend , als es der Forschung bisher nur gelungen ist , einige wenige vernetzte Gehirnzellen mit elektronischen Kontakten zu verknüpfen .
DeMarse dagegen hat gleich 25.000 Neuronen aus einem Rattenembryo extrahiert und über ein Gitter von 60 Elektroden zu einem selbsttätig agierenden Mini-Hirn zusammen wachsen lassen .
Damit ist er fähig , einen Computer mit dem künstlichen Rattengehirn kommunizieren zu lassen .
Auch scheint diese Methode sehr vielversprechend , da er inzwischen über eine standardisierte Petrischale verfügt , mit der er relativ preiswert gleich mehrere derartiger künstlichen Gehirne erschaffen kann und so in der Lage ist , die Reaktion verschiedener Hirne auf verschiedene simulierte Umgebungen zu studieren .
DeMarse schreibt auf seiner Website zu dem Versuchsaufbau :
We begin by growing living rat cortical neurons on multielectrode arrays ( MEA ) from MultiChannel Systems which consist of 60 electrodes arranged in an 8x8 grid . (...)
These arrays are covered with approximately 25,000 neurons which rapidly begin to re-establish connectivity within a few hours of being placed on the MEA .
These arrays can both record and stimulate the action potentials of neurons near each electrode ( electrical signals between neurons ) as they communicate within these dense networks .
This enables us to establish a bi-directional communication channel where we can listen to and analyze the activity of a living neural network ( a brain in a dish if you will ) while we simultaneously measure the effects of inputs to study how the network encodes and computes information .
Mit anderen Worten : Die neuronalen Zellen aus den Rattenembryonen werden einfach in die Petrischale mit einem elektronischen Gitternetz von 8 x 8 Elektroden gegeben und verknüpfen sich innerhalb von Stunden ganz von alleine zu einem kleinen selbsttätig arbeitenden „ Gehirn in der Schüssel “ .
Mithilfe der Elektroden werden jetzt nicht nur verschiedene stimulierende Impulse in das Neuronen - Netzwerk eingebracht , sondern die Reaktion des künstlichen Mini-Hirns auf diese Impulse kann gleichzeitig auch gemessen und aufgezeichnet werden .
Der Wissenschaftler erhofft sich dadurch ein wesentlich verbessertes Verständnis von den komplexen Abläufen in derartigen biologischen Kleincomputern .
Das Labor der „ fliegenden Hirne “
Ein weiterer Durchbruch des Teams um DeMarse gelang mit einem einfachen Trick .
Bisher war es nicht gelungen , die Nervenzellen - Kulturen über längere Zeit am Leben zu halten .
Vor allem die Verdunstung der Nährflüssigkeit und die damit verbundene Änderung der osmotischen Eigenschaften sowie Probleme mit der Kontamination der Flüssigkeit durch die Umgebung haben bisher derartige Zellkulturen oft schon nach wenigen Wochen absterben lassen .
Für die Verwendung als Rechenmaschine ist das natürlich etwas unpraktisch .
DeMarse hat nun einfach die Petrischalen mit einer transparenten hydrophobischen Membran luftdicht abgeschlossen .
Diese Membran ist selektiv durchlässig für Sauerstoff und Kohlendioxid , sodass die Sauerstoffversorgung der Zellen gewährleistet ist .
Damit wird die Verdunstung und Kontamination der Nährflüssigkeit verhindert und seine Zellkulturen haben bisher schon mehr als ein Jahr überlebt .
Dadurch kann er die Entwicklung und das Verhalten seiner Kulturen über einen längeren Zeitraum beobachten , was einen erheblichen Fortschritt zu früheren Versuchen darstellt .
Die US National Science Foundation hat dem Team um Prof.
DeMarse dann auch gleich eine Förderung von 500.000 Dollar zur Verfügung gestellt , um ein verbessertes mathematisches Modell der Funktion der künstlichen Gehirne zu kreieren .
Außerdem wird seine Erforschung der Ursachen von Epilepsie vom US National Institute of Health finanziell unterstützt .
Demnächst werden die elektrischen Kontaktnetze zu den Neuronen jedoch noch sehr viel feiner .
Forschern am Berkeley National Laboratory haben im Jahr 2005 einen Preis dafür erhalten , dass sie mit einer neuen Technologie Millionen von kleinen elektrischen Kontakten auf einem Chip unterbringen , mit dem die kleinen biologischen Mini-Gehirne noch wesentlich genauer analysiert und stimuliert werden können .
Mit diesem Neural Matrix CCD lassen sich nicht nur die Aktivitäten fast jeder einzelnen Nervenzelle verfolgen , sondern es wird künftig auch möglich , derartige Rechner - Nerven - Verbindungen zur Herstellung künstlicher Augen , Ohren oder zur Steuerung sonstiger künstlicher Körperteile einzusetzen .
Neural Matrix CCD
Die Forscher erhoffen sich darüber hinaus alsbald Lösungen für die Integration biologischer Komponenten in sogenannte Hybrid - Computer , die die Vorteile beider Technologien in einem einzigen Rechner integrieren .
Denn Neuronale Netze spielen schon länger in bestimmten Gebieten eine herausragende Rolle .
Allerdings werden derartigen Neuronen - Rechner bisher immer noch auf der Basis herkömmlicher Rechenmaschinen simuliert ( Neuronales Upgrade ) .
Zahlreiche Anwendungen
Die neuen Forschungen geben nun zu der Hoffnung Anlass , dass bald echte biologische Nervennetze diese Aufgaben übernehmen .
Durch die Verwendung von embryonalen Nervenzellen , könnten diese Rechner mit ihren Aufgaben buchstäblich wachsen .
Außerdem sind die Algorithmen der lebenden Neuronennetze im Gegensatz zu Computern extrem Fehlertolerant .
Im menschlichen Gehirn beispielsweise sterben täglich Hunderte von Zellen ab .
Passiert etwas Vergleichbares in einem herkömmlichen Computer , ist die Folge der komplette Systemausfall .
Im Unterschied dazu werden bei Nervennetzen die fehlenden Verbindungen einfach durch neue ersetzt .
Auch in der Mustererkennung scheinen Neuronale Netze den traditionellen Rechenmaschinen deutlich überlegen .
So haben Neuronale Netze - bisher auf Basis von elektronischen Neuronen - Simulatoren - in den letzten Jahren zunehmend Verbreitung bei der Bewältigung der ungeheuren Datenmengen von Suchmaschinen gefunden .
Sie helfen den herkömmlichen Prozessoren bei der Sortierung der Suchergebnisse nach Prioritäten .
Das hilft die Qualität der Suchergebnisse zu steigern .
MSN hat kürzlich bekannt gegeben , dass sie eine auf Neuronalen Netzen basierende Suchstrategie in ihre Suchmaschine integrieren werden .
Auch Kreditinstitute zeigen vermehrt Interesse an der inzwischen einsatzreifen Technologie .
So will VISA in den kommenden Jahren ein System auf Basis Neuronaler Netze einführen , dass Kreditkartenbetrug schneller und sicherer erkennt als bisherige Systeme und dadurch Millionen spart .
Andere Banken , wie die Londoner HSBC folgen dem Beispiel .
Und vor allem Marketing - Strategen zeigen vermehrt Interesse an den neuen Möglichkeiten der prospektiven Mustererkennung .
Denn genauso , wie man das Verhalten von Kreditkartenbetrügern an ihrem Verhalten erkennen kann , lässt sich auch das Kaufverhalten jedes Konsumenten mit den bio-logischen Algorithmen erkennen .
So erhoffen sich die Firmenstrategen , dass es demnächst möglich wird , einem Kunden ein Produkt genau dann anzubieten , wenn er danach sucht .
Aber auch für wissenschaftliche Zwecke lassen sich diese Methoden einsetzen .
So bauen britische Forscher am Natural History Museum in London gerade ein Erkennungssystem mit dem hübschen Namen DAISY ( Digital Automated Identification System ) für alle Lebensformen der Welt auf Basis eines Neuronalen Netzwerkes auf .
Alles was man künftig dann noch tun muss , um eine Lebensform zu identifizieren , ist ein Digitales Bild eines Tieres oder einer Pflanze an das DAISY - Portal zu schicken und der Rechner erkennt das Muster aus Abermillionen von bereits eindigitalisierten Bildern .
Das Team um DeMarse hat zunächst sehr viel einfachere Einsatzmöglichkeiten für ihre „ fliegenden Rattengehirne “ im Sinn .
Eines der angestrebten Ziele ist der Einsatz in unbemannten Aufklärungsdrohnen der US - Armee .
Damit wären wir dann auf dem
Weg zum automatischen Krieg mal wieder einen Schritt näher am Ziel ( An der Schwelle zum automatischen Krieg ) .
Vielleicht wird ja doch noch der zweite Teil des eingangs erwähnten Science - Fiction Thrillers bald Wirklichkeit .
Wie es scheint , arbeiten viele mit Hochdruck daran .
Bei all dem bleibt die Hoffnung , dass vielleicht auch positive Entwicklungen aus der Verbindung von lebenden Gehirnen und Rechenmaschinen folgen : Mithilfe Neuronaler Netze werden künftig geniale Lösungen zur Verbesserung der Nachhaltigkeit unserer Gesellschaft gefunden .
Neuronale Netze haben das Potential unser Leben durch die Verbindung von Maschinenlogik und Bio-Logik erheblich zu verändern .
Wir stehen mal wieder an einem Wendepunkt zu einer neuen Entwicklung : Der Computer wird kreativ .

Laut Dave Goldberg , beim Internet - Portal Yahoo für Musikdienste zuständig , schade das digitale Rechtemanagement DRM der Musikindustrie mehr , als es ihr nutze .
In Los Angeles sorgte Goldberg anlässlich des Branchengipfeltreffens Music 2.0 mit der Aussage für Aufsehen , hohe Preise und restriktive Nutzungsbedingungen sorgten dafür , dass die Käufer die Online - Läden nicht wieder besuchten .
Die Plattenlabels sollten sich ein Beispiel an eMusic nehmen , das Dateien im MP3 - Format verkauft und daher ganz ohne Kopierschutz auskommt – insgesamt brauche die Industrie innovative Verkaufskonzepte .
Erst kürzlich hatte der Yahoo - Musikmann den baldigen
Tod der Audio - CD prophezeit und Abo - Dienste wie bei Yahoo als Zukunft im Musikgeschäft gepriesen .
Im Kontrast zu Goldbergs Aussagen steht der Erfolg von Apples iTunes Music Store , der seit gestern mehr als eine Milliarde heruntergeladener Songs verzeichnen kann .
Per Fairplay geschützt , lassen sich die Songs zwar auf bis zu fünf PCs freischalten , auf den iPod übertragen sowie auf eine Audio - CD brennen .
Allerdings könnten viele MP3 - Player anderer Hersteller mit dem Apple - eigenen AAC - Format nichts anfangen .

Germany ’s warm up game against Sweden on Wednesday 16th August 2006 could be off , due to a row over football boots .
Adidas , the German football boot company that sponsors the national team , have insisted that the entire squad wear Adidas football boots for the game .
With all international players at this level , having personal sponsorship deals with their own choice boot manufacturer , this agreement with Adidas has caused major rifts in the German camp .
“ The whole team have spoken out for a free choice of boots , ” said the German general manager , Oliver Bierhoff .
It has been reported that several leading players have held talks with the German footballing authorities , Jens Lehmann , Bernd Schneider and Torsten Frings and Golden Boot winner Miroslav Klose .
Word is that the German players have threatened to boycott the match unless the players can select their own football boots .
If Adidas succeed in forcing the players to wear football boots that they have not personally selected , I think it will have two effects ;
1 . I will be surprised if the performance is a good one , knowing what it is like to have to get used to new football boots .
It may also be in the back of the players minds , that they are being forced against their will , so a poor performance can easily be blamed on the football boots .
2 . Having forced the issue with the German national team , football boot manufacturers may well decide to try and enforce this policy with other national teams and perhaps lead to entire football boot brand sponsorship deals with clubs .

I figured that instead of whining about the big OEMs we should promote the companies that actually care about desktop Linux .
It would be nice someday to have a master site as a " Linux computer finder " .
For now you can just pass this list around .
We need to convince the shopping engine sites to have a Linux computer catagory .
For example I was sending suggestions to pricescan.com for a " Linux " OS choice .
They now have a " Linux " selection when for searching for computers ( although they have a very limited selection ) .
These also have a limited Linux OS category Pricegrabber.com nextag.com
Here are some other shopping engines to pester .
bizrate.com shop.com
Suggest to them that they need a ' select by OS ' feature ( with Linux ) .
Send them my list of merchants , too . :^)

Yes / No Support_Options varchar

Would we want the last field to be made visible , so as to know " this company used to , but no longer does , offer computers or is out of business " ?
Or would it be better to simply drop the company from the DB if they are no longer offering GNU / Linux systems ( or went out of business ) ?
Perhaps we should distinguish between " out of business " and " no longer offering GNU systems ?

Distros d_id int , primary key d_name varchar 128 d_link text

co_id d_id int references distros.d_id
The company name , address and country probably wo n't change much .
The offerings could .
Same with distributions -- name and home page wo n't change , so no sense listing them multiple times , once for each company offering a computer with it .

As far as the Active_Inactive goes , just remove them if they become inactive .
You could treat the no-OS option just like another distros .

You might want to save that for phase II or just not worry about it .
One distro might be supported and another one not ,

Some sites keep the Linux / no - OS machines hard to find so directions to find the Linux / no - OS machine pages would be handy .
Here 's an example of values for amazon.com
linux_clue_on_homepage ......... hompage_url ..........................
http://www.amazon.com/ desktop_distros ......................
Linspire laptop_distros ........................ special_directions .................... computers >

This is an excellent effort and I 'm looking forward to seeing it develop .
However , in order to offer the most benefit , the issue of the Microsoft Tax needs to be accounted for .
Many vendors selling pre-installed GNU / Linux ( and even bare - bones ) pass the tax off to consumers as a soft cost .
For example , emperorlinux is one such company .
By tracking this information on a vendor by vendor basis , consumers will be armed with more information be in a better position to know where their hard earned money is going .

At first , no -OS was about the only option ( other than build it from parts ) .
Now we have viable preinstalled Linux vendors .
If we are going to present a main - stream ARTICLE to " joe public " then we need to leave out the geek part .
I say for " phase one " we concentrate on the preinstalled Linux vendors .

That reminds me of a colleague - the oldest one of our company .
His hard disk in his private laptop went * bang* , so I told him to get a new one .
When he arrived with it , it was n't a long question : he had no license for anything from Redmond , he had seen Etch on my Dell , he wanted it , he got it .
And now he and his wife tell me each time how easy it all is .
I think it 's a question of openness to new things , of being able to " let go " of old habits , all that sort of things .
Whenever he has a question , I 'm helping him - but that 's not very often .
For the basic " average Joe " like him , who types a letter in OO and browses the web with FF , life is easy .
The next computer could be preinstalled or without an OS , he would n't care much I think .
So no frustration there ...

True , the average joe cam be pretty dense .
But is Linux , at least with a KDE interface , any more difficult than Window for a first time user ?
Certainly not in my experience .

Why do you assume that new users in Linux are going to get any more frustrated than those in Windows ?
That makes no sense .
> but an entirely different matter when * you * are the one customers will be calling when they 're upset that they can't get something working like they want .
And you do n't get that in windows ... ;-)...
Right .
In my experience It 's far easier to get help for Linux on the Internet than it is for Windows .
So load their bookmarks with Linux help links , and xchat with some good IRC help channels as default .
You 'll probably never hear from them again except when their ready to order a new system :D
Turn your Linux offering into a positive as in 'we can give you the very latest Linux Distros , preconfigured , and ready to go ' ( with the cute tux , and , put it on the top position ) .
Put Windows as the after thought ' or we can supply you with a preconfigured Windows install ' ( that 's probably at extra cost I assume ? ) .

I have been talking with 2 frustrated Windows users - one a non-techie , the other a mainframe operator with little real PC experience .
One had an issue with the anti-virus software , the mainframe operator just received his Dell Inspiron that wo n't play his DVDs , presumably because he has n't activated his license .
The truth is , we really are guessing as to why it wo n't play - there is no hint whatsoever from the system .
I would highly recommend making both OSes an option .
You could just as easily have a handy page explaining the differences in features , etc .
It would even be o.k. to post something to the effect of , " switching from Windows to GNU / Linux might require a nominal period of adjustment - anywhere from a few hours to a few days . "
That 's a suggestion , and I believe a rather viable one at that .

Another important aspect of the GNU / Linux sales pitch should involve selling the lack of DRM / TCPA / Phone - Home technology that users have grown to expect from Windows .

Right , that is my reaction since years .
I then explain to them why , in case they ask .
And only for * very * good friends on * very * few occasions I sometimes waste my time trying to figure out what went wrong with their M$ - tho I also tell them that I would never advise a friend to keep using that ...
The beginning of this was funny .
Can you imagine their faces when they heard me saying : " Oh sorry , I do n't do Windows since quite some time - instead I 'm using BSD " ?

You hit the nail right on the head .
The average Windows user has gotten so accustomed to jumping through hoop after hoop just to use their computer .
It 's like bringing in the dog to get ride of the cat to get rid of the mouse to get rid of the .... and so on , and so on .
They 're busy trying to find a serial for their pirated 0day copy of antivirus - solution - of - the - month and I 'm saying " virus ?
what 's that ? " .
That 's assuming they 've negotied a means to connect to the public Internet without fear of Redmond shutting down their computer .
GNU / Linux is so ahead of the game in this regard since ( depending on the distro involved ) it 's just ready to go .
This alone is a tremendous selling feature and noone has picked up on it yet .
With vista on the horizon and Apple 's move to Intel ( a DRM preparation strategy ) , the situation is ripe for exploitation .

It is indeed possible that it really is n't about the user , but instead that * we* , as a company , would be less able and more frustrated supporting Linux , not because of anything specific to Linux , but just because we 've been supporting Windows for years and years , and have gotten darn good at it !
If that 's the case , then it is n't about Windows vs Linux at all , but about * our * skills and experience as a provider of support .
And that is something we can approach knowing we can be sucessful at .... just a little time and learning !

10:50 PM EDT Jon , I thought about my previous suggestion about making GNU / Linux more available .
But this last post confirms my suspicions about your tech support issue .
So let me suggest this :
Start by studying a GNU / Linux distro to support it .
SUSE or Ubuntu seem to be the best bet .
Does n't really matter which one - just choose the one that suits your tastes .
Get familiar with the desktop stuff and provide support for it .
You can then expand to another distro .
Ideally , you would gradually support at least one RPM - based , and one Apt - based distro .
In the meantime , offer GNU / Linux as an option in the config pages , with the caveat that : " Although we will soon offer support for SUSE Linux , community - based support is currently the only option .
If you are comfortable with community support ( link to page describing how community support works ) , and prefer to have GNU / Linux , be sure to select it instead of Windows .
If you prefer commercial support , you may want to wait until we provide it . "
Incidentally , Ubuntu has commercial support options available already .
You could literally offer Ubuntu pre-installed , and a link to the commercial Ubuntu support information - it 's right on the Ubuntu site .
Granted , it 's about $ 100 for something like a year of support , but that frees you until you can learn to support it yourself .
Then you add the support cost into the cost of the PC .
You can call it the installation / support fee , if you like .
BTW , that puts $ 100 in your pocket for every PC sold with Ubuntu or SUSE .
How much profit do you make off Windows ?
And does that carrot cause you to rethink your strategy at all ?

Small correction there .
Several very good AV companies offer their product free ( though granted , not Foss ) to individual users .... no need to pirate anything , although , MS 's activation access is certainly a valid point ...
Try adding a different drive or a new CPU and you could be out of luck .
The very fact that a Windows user ' may ' have to go through any of this when they are in complyance with MS 's ' rules ' is certainly a downer , and to my mind , downright insulting .
A very practical reason to move to Linux .

No OS - check box Support Options multi-select box ( none , community , vendor support , 3rd party support ) Company URL - input text Special Directions - input text ( directions to the Linux info on sites that hide it ) Active or Inactive - check box ( are they still in business ? )

I just want to be able to de-activate a store that ceases 6 months from now .

We just need a way to make that happen .
Vendors that offer " No OS " boxes are allowed .
We 're working on a search option that filters those out for non-techies , or those who do n't want that option .
That will likely happen a little later .

If a company can't reliably offer a product then do n't have them on the list .
I would like to see the no-OS vendors kept on a separate list .
Maybe this will encourage them to get on " The " ( preinstalled Linux ) List .
" The " List will then strive to be the " consumer friendy " list ( without the geek distractions ) .

Linux * should * be in more homes in offices , but it is not .
Linux * should * run every game and piece of productive software in existance , but it does not .
Dell 's " recommendation " is , in fact , forced upon by Microsoft .
What 's their incentive to " recommend " anything else ?
To make it a nightmare for support ?
To get endless calls about Photoshop and Half - Life 2 ?
How will this progress if we flat - out ignore Dell 's offering ?
Nobody wants to buy a OS - less PC from Dell ?
Why continue offering ?
Oh wait , people * do * want a OS - less PC ( you know any non -geeks that are up for installing a PC ? ) ?
Well , then let 's continue to appease the customers .
> You have to be pretty determined and very watchful to make it through the Dell ordering process without ending up with MS Windows .
If you ( not * you * ) go to Dell , most likely you are there to buy a Windows PC .
That 's what they do .
If you are determined to buy a non-Win PC , there 's nothing to be wary of when purchasing their Open Source Desktops ( well , be mindful of the software section in ordering in Small Office , but nothing is included by default ) .
Nowhere in the ordering process for OSD does it ever try to get you to purchase Windows .

Even when you try to customize the box , Windows is the only choice .
You apparently have to go through the small business page , which many home users would not think to do .
After all , they are not a small business .
GNU / Linux is not merely a business OS , even though that is its predominant use .
The problem is , you have to already know to go through the small business section to get to the OSDs .

why not just get a windows machine ( usually a helluva lot cheaper than what you posted ( Dell sells around 449 for a laptop ) ) and then just repartition it to install whatever the hell you want ?
just my $ 0.02

Well questioner , of course you can do that .
I might go a step further and say ' why would anyone do other than build their own computer , thus getting complete control of the hardware spec ' .
The truth is that its good to have choices for users , both experienced and new .
A computer with Linux preinstalled is much more likely to sell to a new user , or , one with minimal building skills .

In reply to a question about the value of Linux pre-installed cyber - rigger gave a link about the malware / viruses / spyware / trojans / bots on the web that wreak havoc with that other OS , especially before XP SP2 , but I can give several additional advantages :
avoiding IE more choice .
There are multiple choices for all the desktop apps my students used last year .
If we had to pay licence fees for every app we used , we could not have had so many .
keeping PCs going longer .
Linux can run on five year old PCs just fine on thick clients and ten years or more on thin clients .
This triples the value for money from the PC purchase .
keeping PCs running harder .
Lots of PCs with that other OS crash with the least little stress .
' 9 x sometimes crash with a few windows open in a browser .
XP is better but still " slows down " or needs a reboot to tidy things up .
GNU / Linux will run 24/7 flat out .
My Linux terminal servers are often just a standard PC with extra memory and storage .
They will run at 100 % CPU usage for months with no problem .
This higher utilization rate on desktops and servers makes the hardware pay for itself .
easier software maintenance .
Apt / yum / yast are much more agile than Windows update .
For most desktop users , the distro provides everything needed .
The Debian apt system will keep a system running smoothly for years without a re-installation .
lower cost .
I have just planned a 150 seat installation of Linux .
I saved $ 22000 CDN on Windows licences and $ 15000 on Office licences .
That saving paid for all our printers , cameras , scanners .
By using Linux terminal servers and thin clients I saved a similar amount on hard drives not needed in the system and lower powered / memoried clients .
I even saved a few thousand by using Multi- seat X ( e.g . http://groovix.com/ ) with gigabit /s cabling ( fewer parts ) .
The result is my school can have twice as many computers with less maintenance from the same capital budget using Linux instead of that other OS .
When I spoke with the ISP about our Internet needs , he fell off his chair when I mentioned the numbers of clients .
All the other schools use that other OS and cannot afford enough clients to put a cluster in every classroom , library , office and lab .
As usual , I have gone overboard , but there are many advantages to Linux pre-installed .
The most important I leave until last : most users of PCs do not do , will not do , and have never done an OS installation .
Pre-installation eliminates this barrier for them to enter the wonderful world of desktop Linux .

I have frequently followed links to Dell.com to read about Linux / NoOS stuff and enjoyed it , but I have found it impossible to search their site for stuff .
I sent them an e-mail about it .
I searched for " dimension n " , for instance , and found no hits .
I searched for linux and found a hit for an XP machine .
This is either the world 's worst - indexed site or they deliberately try to hide some of their products .
Are they only selling these things to avoid anti-competition regulations ?
Why are they selling only on dell.com and not dell.ca ?
There is obviously a market or they would not have the product .
Why not make it easy to find ?
On the other hand , if you search via Google for " dimension n " the first hit is what we seek .
Is it not strange that Google can index their site more effectively than Dell can ?
If you search Google for Dell linux , you get http://www.dell.com/linux and we are off to the races .
Further , Dimension n does not seem to be available in Canada but Precision is , pre-installed with RHEL ... see http://www1.ca.dell.com/content/products/compare.aspx/precn?... but it is an expensive beast .

When this list gets databased I think that it needs to be split up once more .
Currently it 's split in two : Linux pre-installed vs no-os .
I think it needs to be split in three :
1 ) Linux pre-installed and supported 2 ) Linux pre-installed 3 ) No-OS
The support factor is pretty important for Joe Average .

10:21 PM EDT cyber_rigger and LXer staff ,
you 're doing a great service here .
And tho I understood the " average Joe " vs. Barebone argument , and tho I also do n't want to promote a company before actually seeing what they provide , let me cite from an email I just received a few days ago :
( Andy from LixSystems ) >
" Our download links are up running again and we encourage anybody who wants an easy quick Linux install on these motherboards to download our Install DVD .
This is truly how motherboards should be delivered to customers , with a free operating systems that installs in 15 minutes and is pre-configured with the correct drivers .
Even the experienced Linux user will save hours of installation with our install DVD .
We even pre-configured all the V4l drivers and applications , and a KWorld TV Terminator captured cards will work out of the box with our distro .
Aver SAA7134 based capture cards work as well .
We are working on " out of the box " ATSC and dvb support . "
I know that installing something on an otherwise " naked " hard disk is maybe beyond the capabilities of the mentioned " average Joe " .
But if they send * me * an almost complete system ( sans CPU and RAM ) , I 'm pretty sure that if you want to buy from them , they would be happy to send a complete and pre-installed system .
Plus of course : with so many people looking for infos about AM2 mobos and drivers and stuff on just * my * pages , I really think that the guys over at LixSystems ( or their LinuxTechToys store ) are providing a great service with their images .
They should at least be listed under the categories " no - OS , but with Linux images readily available " , or at least , " Linux - friendly " .
Or am I still missing something here ?
Of course I will test and report on that sponsored system as soon as it arrives .
cheers , wjl

6:17 PM EDT Frustrating that none ( none ! ) of these vendors " officially " support Linux .
Especially the ones selling Linux pre-installed .
How do they get away selling something and not support it ?
Unacceptable .
Far from being impossible , there are already companies available who support Linux distributions , but do not sell hardware .
If the hardware company cannot manage the Linux support themselves , then they should partner with one of these Linux support firms .
Even short of that small step , they could package the Linux support contract cost on top of the hardware price , with the assurance they will cooperate with the support firm .
To sell something out the door while hinting it will work for Linux , yet demanding the customer prove problems in Windows , is a terrible business practice .
When computer resellers start standing behind their product working with Linux , then they will get my business .
Otherwise , you 're surviving on slim hardware margins .
I , like many others , regularly purchase computers based on the HW / SW support supplied .
I am a UNIX computer technician during the day , but when I come home I want my x86 computer to simply work - and I do not mind paying someone to ensure it does .
Show me a supported HW / SW Linux solution ( USA - based ) and you will have my next computer purchase .

Ever call Dell and discover that the problem appears to be related to Windows and not the PC ?
Have any guesses on who Dell tells you to call ?
The blasted Windows EULA absolves MS from having to take responsibility and the hardware manufacturers do n't want to touch it , either .
If you want your OS supported , pay for support .
You 'll get some support from System76 , and you can also buy support from Canonical .

You take my meaning wrong .
True , OEMs do not " support " Windows in a way where they handle support calls specific to Windows ( such as , " My Explorer just crashed ! " ) , but they do claim their hardware will support a Windows operating system .
I mean support as in providing structure to prop something up , not specifically technical support where people call for help .
When a OEM supports Linux , then they are saying their hardware works with Linux .
And , should you call up with proof that there is a visible hardware failure through Linux , then they would replace the hardware .
Even this simple level of support is hardly known through the OEM world .

This is from the System 76.com website FAQ .
Their policy goes much further past just supporting the hardware I mentioned :
" Have you ever called Microsoft when you have a Windows problem ?
It 's more likely you called the teenager down the street .
When you have a problem with the software on your machine you can give us a call .
You can also ask questions in the System 76 forums or search our extensive knowledge base .
The community and System 76 constantly work to fill the knowledge base with definitive how to 's , troubleshooting , and answers to your questions . "

Cool , understood now .
Yeah , System76 looks great .
Even if you do n't do the * buntu , you can buy their laptops and be assured that their hardware will work with whatever you 're using .
Funds do n't allow a purchase now , but I 've got my eyes on one of their laptops .
PCLinuxOS wo n't be a problem on one of those , and I do n't have to pay a " tax " for the OS the way I would if I bought a Windows PC or a Mac .

Welcome back from your trip into outer space .
I 'm assuming you dropped off the face of the Earth ?
BTW , you only linked to the forum .
I take it you missed the actual database we 've implemented ?
http://lxer.com/module/db/index.php?dbn=14
It seems quite usable these days .
That should have been part of your patch . ;-)

One suggestion : it would be a little more usable if for the US vendors it included state information .
I know where Cleveland is .
But AVADirect is listed as Twinsburg , and in the US that is not very helpful .
Even if I click on the name , it says " Twinsburg , United States " .
Only by clicking on the link to their website and then clicking on contact information do I find out Twinsburg is in Ohio .

Thank
You for the info bigg .
A states directory is a good idea but until then I updated the database so that it says Cleveland next to Twinsburg and I noted its location in Ohio in the notes section .

Given the huge call for Dell to provide Linux pre installed , and the amount of press this is generating , now would be a good time for companies that already sell Linux on the Desktop to promote themselves .
One way would be with " news " articles in local papers .
Another would be with announcements to bloggers that are writing about the Dell thing , another would be to mainstream media , with a tie in to the Dell news .

Confusing news and advertisements is not the best way to get the message across .
MS and Dell both welcome these " stories . "
The informed cast a weak , weary , lame eye on such .
>> Another would be with announcements to bloggers that are writing about the Dell thing , another would be to mainstream media , with a tie in to the Dell news .
I do n't think tie-ing in is anything that independent distributors of hardware want , not now or in the future .
OK , now the rant .
Have you ever met an idiot ?
As I 've posted eleswhere , I 've taken over 16,000 tech support calls .
From my POV less than 10 % were idiots .
Most were confused by MS representation of what their computer could or should do .
Confusion and misdirection of the innocent does not make an idiot .
It makes the appearance of an idiot .
This is the hideous insidious MS scam :
If I can confuse you , you 're mine .
The Jesuits ( or is it the Fransiscans ? ) say , " Give me a child before age 6 , and he 'll be mine forever . "
OK , I 'm GM , coming out with a new car :
It 's called " Car . "
Forever hence , when anyone says " What kind of car do you have , " GM Car owners answer , " Oh , I have a Car car . "
Not BeOS , not GeOS , not OS / 2 PM , not X , I 've got Windows .
What does that mean ?
Well I did n't need to define it , MS did it for me .
See , it 's a Windows Window .
But what does that mean .
Meaning ?
Oh that 's irrelevant since I 've got Microsoft Windows .
Since I can throw my mind out of focus , I can avoid the fact that I 'm scared to death of computers .
I can avoid the hassle , the brain - strain that might actually cause me to " get it . "
Thank God for Microsoft , his holiness be anointed to sainthood for destroying the intellectual in the name of the sacrificial .

I do n't think I will buy one of these , but was pleasantly surprised to see it .
The last time we were able to buy an off the shelf computer was in the mid ' 90s , it had OS / 2 and Windows 3.1 loaded as a dual boot .
I envy windows users when it comes to the ease of buying new systems , all they need to worry about is price and features .

As far as I can tell ( I do n't speak Spanish , but understanding French helps a lot ) , they offer 4 different Linux desktops with 2 years guarentee , but I can't find anything about the support .
The prices look rather cheap to me ( thanks to the Euro , I can compare these days ) .
BTW Carrefour is to Europe ( France - region ) like Wal - Mart is to the US .
Remember , I added Carrefour under a different name before for France ( http://www.boostore.com/carrefour/Catalog/micro-informatique... ) .
This might mean , Linux is coming to the Carrefour in more countries .

In t
The folks at Playstation Magazine ( PSM ) received an unexpected surprise on Friday when Sony dropped by with a shiny new Playstation 3 for them to play with .
Here ’s what they had to say :
The terrorist " mastermind of a major conspiracy " yesterday entered a guilty plea in Woolwich Crown Court to a charge of conspiracy to murder .
Dhiran Barot admitted planning a radioactive " dirty bomb " explosion which it was claimed would have caused " injury , fear , terror and chaos " , and / or " fear , panic and social disruption " .
Barot also planned a coordinated series of attacks in the UK and US , with the " Gas Limos Project " , involving three limousines filled with explosives and gas cylinders placed in underground car parks , being allegedly the principal attack planned .
The " mastermind " is claimed to have planned the attacks between 2000 and 2004 , but the prosecution accepted that there was no evidence that he had obtained money to finance the plot , or that he had acquired bomb - making material , radioactive substances , limos or gas cylinders .
Nor does there appear to be any indication that he knew where to source radioactive materials , how to build a dirty bomb , or how to set off sufficient gas cylinders in an underground car park to make a skyscraper collapse .
Or indeed what the limo parking deal might be in the bowels of the World Bank HQ or the New York Stock Exchange , which were among the cosmopolitan list of targets .
Barat , who according to the Daily Mail was run to earth in a Harlesden barber 's shop after a " dramatic chase " , did have several attack plans in notebooks , and plans for the US attacks were " found on computers " after his arrest .
Expert evidence , reports
The Times , indicated that the dirty bomb would not have caused death " but , if constructed to Barot ’s plan , would have spread enough radioactive material to make 500 people sick . "
It is entirely unclear how a number so precise might be derived from the rough notes of an apparent amateur with no actual terror gear , but wreaking radiological havoc is no doubt one of the many things that fall into the category of being Easy for terrorists to ...
Realistically , the experts available to the prosecution will have said that the damage caused by a dirty bomb will be mainly that which is inflicted by the conventional explosives , and that the distribution of the radioactive material will depend on the size and construction of the conventional bomb used for this purpose .
And they may have said that under certain conditions , depending , numbers of people might experience minor contamination .
Or not , depending .
And they may also have said that the radioactive bit of the mess created probably would n't be particularly hard to clear up .
Might they have said that the major effect of dirty bombs is the global hysteria the discovery of the plans causes ?
We wish ...
Details of Barot 's case were revealed when reporting restrictions were lifted following his guilty plea .
The prosecution stressed that in admitting his guilt Barot was making no admission regarding the involvement of seven co-defendants in the conspiracy .
These deny all allegations , and will be tried next year .
Barot 's arrest was one of a number which took place in the UK in August 2004 following the arrest the previous month of Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan in Pakistan .
Khan 's arrest prompted a heightened security alert in Washington and New York City , and produced some intriguing reverberations in the US , detailed by Juan Cole here and here . ®

Yes , if I could believe in the immortality business , the world would indeed be too good to be true ; but we were put here to do what service we can , for honour and not for hire ; the sods cover us , and the worm that never dies , the conscience , sleeps well at last ; these are the wages , besides what we receive so lavishly day by day ; and they are enough for a man who knows his own frailty and sees all things in the proportion of reality .
The soul of piety was killed long ago by that idea of reward .... [ M ] an 's cherished belief is that he loves that happiness which he continually spurns and passes by ; and this belief in some ulterior happiness exactly fits him .
He does not require to stop and taste it ; he can be about the rugged and bitter business where his heart lies ; and yet he can tell himself this fairy tale of an eternal tea-party , and enjoy the notion that he is both himself and something else ; and that his friends will yet meet him , all ironed out and emasculate , and still be lovable — as if love did not live in the faults of the beloved only , and draw its breath in an unbroken round of forgiveness !

I know this much about racing in the rain .
I know it is about balance .
It is about anticipation and patience .
I know all of the driving skills that are necessary for one to be successful in the rain .
But racing in the rain is also about the mind !
It is about owning one 's own body .
About believing that one 's car is merely an extension of one 's body .
About believing that the track is an extension of the car , and the rain is an extension of the track , and the sky is an extension of the rain .
It is about believing that you are not you ; you are everything .
And everything is you .

Abstract : A circular program contains a data structure whose definition is self - referential or recursive .
The use of such a definition allows efficient functional programs to be written and can avoid repeated evaluations and the creation of intermediate data structures that would have to be garbage collected .
This paper uses circular programs in various ways , to implement memo- structures and explicit search - trees to hold solutions to constraint - satisfaction problems .

Introduction .
A circular program contains a data structure whose definition is self - referential or recursive .
Such a program cannot be written in a conventional , strict , imperative programming language but it can be written in a functional language employing lazy evaluation [ 6,8 ] or call by need .
general schema : let rec ds = f( ds ) -- ds is some data structure eg. let rec posints = 1.( map succ posints ) -- list of all +ve integers
Note that `.' is the infix list constructor also known as cons , rec qualifies recursive definitions and map applies a function to each element of a list and so produces a new list .
The list posints contains all the positive integers 1 .( 2.( 3. ... ) ) or [ 1,2,3 , ... ] .
It begins with 1 and continues with the result of applying the successor function succ to each element of posints itself .
Successor applied to the first element gives the second element , 2 , and so on .
It is the definition of the value of the data structure posints , not just its type ( list ) , being recursive that makes this a circular program .
Under lazy evaluation , an expression is not evaluated unless it is needed .
In particular , the right hand side of a definition , and the actual parameter of a function , are not evaluated until they are needed - if they are needed .
When an expression is evaluated , the value is remembered to avoid recomputation later .
( The conditional , ` if ' , is the only non-strict or lazy operator in many imperative languages . )
Lazy evaluation permits recursive definitions of data structures and also allows some computations with infinite data structures .
All of a potentially infinite data structure can be defined although only a finite part may be evaluated .
If only a bounded part were defined and evaluated , a copy would have to be made if it had to be extended , wasting time and space , because functional languages do not permit side - effects .
Circular programs can , in certain cases , have it both ways - an expanding data structure with side - effect - free programming .
As a bonus , infinite data structures are sometimes easier to define because boundary cases are simpler or absent .
Although posints represents an infinite list , a program using posints does not loop unless an attempt is made to print or otherwise evaluate all of the list .
The program terminates provided that only finite parts of such structures are manipulated .
It is sometimes necessary to distinguish between the data structure as seen by the programmer and as implemented by the language system .
If the definition simply incorporates the data structure directly , as in ones below , then a cyclic structure of cells and pointers is created in the computer memory .
let rec ones = 1 . ones -- = [ 1,1,1 , ... ] data structure in memory : ones : ------->
1.-->--| ^ | | v | | |--<---
This ability to create cyclic structures can be used to form circular lists , doubly linked lists and threaded trees in a functional language [ 1 ] .
The programmer cannot determine if a cyclic structure has been formed , except indirectly by the program 's speed or modest use of space .
If the recursive definition uses some function of the contents of the data structure , as in posints , no cyclic structure is created at the implementation level but those parts already computed can be used to compute new parts .
This can be used to implement queues [ 1 ] and various space efficient programs .
Many functional programs compute their final result in stages , some data structure being operated on , often in small steps or passes , by functions such as map , filter , reduce , and so on .
Each step produces an intermediate data structure which is eventually discarded and collected as garbage at some cost .
Bird [ 3 ] used circular programs in program transformations to convert multi-pass algorithms into single - pass algorithms .
He attributed knowledge of circular programs to Hughes and to Wadler and the technique is so useful that it has probably been discovered several times .
The objective of the paper is to promote this useful functional programming technique .
The examples given here construct lists and trees in new ways .
They are used to define memo- structures and explicit search - trees which remove the need to repeat tests in certain constraint - satisfaction problems .
They have all been run on a small lazy interpreter which was instrumented to record program behaviour and they perform as predicted .
The notation used is from a hypothetical , " generic " functional language and is explained when required .
Circular Lists .
The ones and posints examples are amongst the simplest circular programs .
To introduce the technique more fully , some non-trivial but routine examples on lists are given here .
A popular example computes the Hamming numbers .
These are all numbers of the form 2i×3 j×5 k , i , j , k>=0 , i.e. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 15 , ... .
In this section various circular programs are derived from the Hamming numbers program .
The simplest program for the Hamming numbers is the following : let rec Hamming = 1 . ( merge3 ( map ( × 2 ) Hamming ) ( map ( × 3 ) Hamming ) ( map ( × 5 ) Hamming ) )
This is an example used in many books and papers [ 4,9,13 ] .
Hamming is a self - referential list .
It begins with 1 followed by the result of merging three lists .
These are the results of multiplying all members of Hamming by 2 , 3 and 5 respectively giving [ 2 , ... ] , [ 3 , ...] and [ 5 , ... ] .
The second Hamming number is thus 2 , so the three lists are [ 2,4 , ... ] , [ 3 , ...] and [ 5 , ... ] , which allows the computation to proceed to the next step .
Many duplicate numbers are produced , for example 6 = 2×3 = 3×2 , and all but one copy must be removed by the merge function .
It is well known that this inefficiency can be removed by ensuring that the factors in a product are combined in ascending order : let rec a = 1 . ( map ( × 2 ) a ) -- [ 1,2,4,8 , ... ] and b = 1 . ( merge ( tl a ) ( map ( × 3 ) b ) ) -- [ 1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12 , ... ] and Hamming = 1 . ( merge ( tl b ) ( map ( × 5 ) Hamming ) )
Note that hd ( head ) returns the first element of a list and tl ( tail ) returns a list minus its first element .
A further operator null can be used to test if a list is empty .
The list a holds all powers of 2 and is defined in a very similar way to posints .
List b holds all products of 2 and 3 .
No duplicates are produced because powers of 2 are multiplied by powers of 3 and then by powers of 5 , in order .
Consequently a simpler version of merge can be used that does not need to deal with duplicates .
It is a natural exercise to generalise the Hamming problem to find all products of an arbitrary list of factors .
The factors are assumed to be coprime and in ascending order .
let rec products [ ] = [ 1 ]
|| -- no factors products ( f.fs ) = -- at least one factor f let rec m = 1 . ( merge ( map ( × f ) m ) ( tl ( products fs ) ) ) in m Note this program uses pattern matching .
The function products accepts a single list parameter .
It distinguishes two cases , patterns or kinds of input parameter : the empty list [ ] and the general list f.fs consisting of a first factor f and a list of remaining factors fs .
A definition is given for each case .
Multiple cases are separated by || which can be read as `otherwise ' .
If there are no factors the list [ 1 ] is returned .
If there are factors , the products of the first factor f and of all other factors in fs must be combined .
The result list m is self - referential .
First , multiplying any member of m by f is itself a product - map ( × f ) m .
Second , products of members of fs are also members of m although the leading 1 is not needed - tl ( products fs ) .
Merging these two lists and putting 1 on the front gives m .
It is easy to see that any valid product must be produced by this process .
The last program works correctly on finite lists of factors .
It will not work when given an infinite list of factors because the merge operation requires the head of two lists before it can produce any output .
For an infinite list of factors this would require the heads of an infinite number of lists to be assembled which is impossible .
This drawback can be overcome by recognising that the second value in m must be the smallest factor f itself .
let rec products ( f.fs ) = -- NB. not ( null fs ) let rec m = 1 . f . ( merge ( map ( × f ) ( tl m ) ) ( tl ( products fs ) ) ) in m
This program happens to require an infinite list of factors although a case to allow for finite lists can be added .
Every instance of m now has two values at the front before any merge and thus one value remains when the tail is taken so output can begin immediately .
Circular Trees .
The previous section gave examples of circular programs over lists .
Here trees are defined in a similar way and used as memo - structures to store the results of functions so that later calls can access them quickly without recomputation .
In general , one or more functions and structures are defined using mutual recursion .
general schema : let rec -- mutually recursive ds = g ds f -- data structure(s ) and and f x = h x ds f -- function (s )
The technique is illustrated by application to the Fibonacci numbers .
Both the so called slow and fast Fibonacci programs are well known .
The slow version is doubly recursive and runs in time exponential in n : let rec slowfib n = if n < =2 then 1 else slowfib( n - 2 ) + slowfib ( n - 1 )
It is easily seen that the running time , T( n ) , satisfies T( n ) > 2*T( n - 2 ) .
For example , slowfib ( 7 ) calls slowfib ( 5 ) and slowfib ( 6 ) .
Slowfib ( 6 ) calls slowfib ( 5 ) and all its subcomputations again .
Many computations are repeated .
The fast program recognises that partial results are recalculated many times by the slow program .
It gains efficiency be replacing binary recursion with linear recursion to run in O ( n ) time : let fastfib n = let rec f n a b = if n=1 then b else f ( n - 1 ) b ( a+b ) in f n 0 1
The parameters a and b hold two successive Fibonacci numbers .
At the next step these become b and a+b respectively .
It is possible to define a circular program that builds a list of the Fibonacci numbers : let rec fiblist = 1.1.( f fiblist ) -- [ 1,1,2,3,5 , ... ] and f ( a.t ) = ( a + ( hd t ) ) . ( f t)
The function f both produces fiblist and uses it via its parameter which always lags two steps behind the element being calculated - just enough .
It is now possible to find fib(n ) by indexing to the n th element of fiblist with the standard function index : let fib = let rec fiblist = 1.1.( f fiblist ) -- memo list and f ( a.t ) = ( a + ( hd t ) ) . ( f t ) -- f builds fiblist and find n = index n fiblist -- get nth element of fiblist in find
The list fiblist is a structure storing old results of fib n .
On a first call of fib n the first n elements of fiblist are constructed .
On a second call the result is just looked up in fiblist ; the second call is faster but is still O( n ) as index takes O( n ) time .
Actually , the result is looked up on the first call too , but it does not yet exist and so the list is built to the required length .
Bird [ 2 ] discusses the use of arrays to store past values in the process of deriving the fast Fibonacci program in an imperative language .
Hughes [ 10 ] describes a system that automatically stores past values of functions for fast recall ; his system is implicit whereas the memo - structure here is explicit .
If a tree of Fibonacci numbers were built , the results of later calls could be looked up in O ( log n ) time .
The nodes of a complete binary tree can be numbered so that the children of node n are 2n and 2n+1 : 1 . . . . 2 3 . . . . 4 5 6 7 . . . . ...
The value of fib n can be stored at node number n : 1 . . . . 1 2 . . . . 3 5 8 13 . . . . ...
Given this tree and an integer , for example n = 6 10 = 110 2 , the binary digits of n indicate whether to take left or right subtrees in locating the n th node and this can be done in O ( log n ) time .
The bits of n are read from the second most significant bit to the least significant bit ; a 1 indicates go right and a 0 indicates go left .
Therefore 110 2 implies : start at the root , go right and then left .
We first define an infinite binary tree type : datatype tree = fork int tree tree -- infinite binary tree type let element ( fork e l r ) = e -- extract the element value and left ( fork e l r ) = l -- extract left subtree and right ( fork e l r ) = r -- extract right subtree
Fork is a constructor that builds a new tree given an element and left and right subtrees .
Element , left and right return the components of a tree .
let fib = let rec fibtree = fork 1 ( fork 1 ( build 4 ) ( build 5 ) ) -- memo tree , ( build 3 ) -- fibtree : tree and build n = fork ( f ( n - 2 ) + f( n - 1 ) ) -- build & f ( build ( 2*n ) ) ( build ( 2*n+1 ) ) -- construct fibtree and f n = lookup n element -- return fib n and lookup 1 g = g fibtree || -- lookup decodes n lookup n g = -- n> 1 lookup ( n div 2 ) ( g o ( if even n then left else right ) ) in f Graphically , fibtree is defined to be : 1 . . . . 1 build 3 . . . build 5 . build 4
The values in nodes one and two are both 1 and are provided to enable node three to be built .
This allows node four to be built and so on .
The function lookup extracts the n th number from the tree .
It does this by constructing a function g to follow left or right links according to the bits in n as described .
Functional composition ` o ' is used to link the desired sequence of element , left and right operations together and these are finally applied to fibtree . ( ( p o q ) ( x ) = p( q( x ) ) )
Assuming fib has been previously called with a parameter greater than n , a second call fib n takes O ( log n ) time to scan down fibtree .
It might appear that the first such call would take exponential time because of the two calls to f within build but this is not the case .
The call f( n - 2 ) causes the tree to be evaluated and built up to node n - 2 .
The call f( n - 1 ) only causes one additional node to be evaluated using f( n - 3 ) and f( n - 2 ) which are just looked up , their corresponding nodes having been built already .
On the first call , there are O ( n ) calls on build , f and lookup the latter being logarithmic , the total time taken is O( n log n ) .
There is thus an increase in cost from O ( n ) to O( n log n ) on first calls but a reduction from O ( n ) to O ( log n ) on subsequent calls over the " fast " Fibonacci program .
There is also the cost of space to store the tree to be considered .
A subtle point should be noted :
Our program let fib = let rec ... in f binds fib to f which has fibtree in its environment so fibtree persists for as long as fib does and is not recomputed .
If we carelessly defined let fib2 n = let rec ... in f n then fibtree would persist for only as long as a call to fib2 remained unevaluated and would be recomputed on each call .
Some optimising compilers would undo this unfortunate effect by effectively converting fib2 into fib .
However this is a difficult issue because a programmer might deliberately write a function having the form of fib2 because he or she needs a temporary data structure but wants it to be destroyed to avoid tying up space .
It is natural to ask if the log (n ) factor in the costs can be removed but it is caused by the use of a tree rather than an ( unbounded ) array with O ( 1 ) indexing .
In an imperative language , and in some functional languages , one might use an array instead of the tree .
However this would place a limit on the size of n .
If it is necessary both to have random access to the Fibonacci numbers in log(n ) time and to have sequential access then it may be convenient to derive a list from the tree in breadth - first order .
Since the tree is complete and infinite the list is particularly simple to create : let rec fibtree = as before and build = ... and f = ... and lookup = ... and fiblist = map element nodes -- elements in breadth - first order and nodes = bfirst fibtree -- ( sub ) trees in breadth - first order and bfirst t = -- breadth - first traversal of t let rec q = t . ( traverse q ) and traverse ( ( fork e l r ) .
q2 ) = l . r . ( traverse q2 ) in q Function bfirst returns a list or queue q of the subtrees of a tree t in breadth - first order .
The queue begins with t itself and the auxiliary function traverse produces the rest of the queue .
Function traverse examines the first element in q and adds its subtrees to the end of q , i.e. in the second and third positions .
This is repeated for successive elements of q .
The definition of the queue q is self - referential .
Since q naturally grows as the tree is scanned , and since it is also infinite , it is hard to see how q could be created efficiently without a circular program .
The lists nodes and fiblist respectively contain the subtrees and the elements of fibtree in breadth - first order .
Accessing the n th element of fiblist also causes fibtree to be evaluated to node number n .
Circular Search Trees .
Many search problems or constraint - satisfaction problems require finding a sequence of values < a , b , c , ...> , or just abc ... , that satisfies certain constraints .
A search program explores the search space , building an implicit or explicit tree of ( partial ) solutions .
If the constraints are uniform in a certain sense then the solution tree may be defined recursively and explicitly .
The advantage is that no test is performed twice as the results of previous tests are available from the structure of the tree .
This is valuable if the cost of performing tests outweighs the cost of building and keeping the tree .
The uniformity required covers two conditions .
Firstly , it must be possible to build all long solutions by extending short solutions .
Secondly , the constraints on an element in the sequence must involve other members of the sequence only in ways that depend on their relative , not absolute , positions in the sequence .
These conditions hold in many problems .
A suitable n- ary search - tree , in which a node contains an element of type 't , a subtree and the siblings of the node , can be defined as follows : datatype tree 't = empty || node 't ( tree 't ) ( tree 't )
Note that 't is a type parameter - an arbitrary type .
There are two cases to tree - the empty tree and a node - separated by || .
Siblings are linked together via the third component of a node .
As an example , the complete infinite tree over { 1 , 2 , 3} can be defined as : let rec three = node 1 three ( node 2 three ( node 3 three empty ) ) -- : tree int A simple generalisation of this example allows trees to be built over the range [ 1..n ] : let build n = let rec T = toplevel 1 -- : tree int and toplevel m = if m> n then empty else node m ( f T ) ( toplevel ( m+1 ) ) and f T = T in T
The function toplevel builds the nodes at the top level of the tree and f fills in the subtrees .
Here f is just the identity function and as such it is redundant but it is included to give a general schema .
The program above creates a finite cyclic data structure .
If we wanted to expand out the cyclic structure , into an infinite copy , f could be redefined as follows : f empty = empty || f ( node a subtree sibs ) = let others = f sibs in node a ( f subtree ) others Solutions to the various problems discussed below are formed only by redefining f in variations on the above .
Apart from the changes that this entails the schema is unaltered in each case .
Permutations .
A common method of generating permutations is to extend partial permutations , beginning with the empty sequence .
If abcde is a partial permutation it can be extended with X to abcdeX provided that X differs from a , b , c , d and e .
Equivalently , it can be extended provided that bcdeX is a partial permutation and provided that X differs from a .
Note that bcde is already a partial permutation because abcde is .
If a tree is used to hold the permutations then bcdeX , being shorter than abcdeX , must occur in the tree at the previous level , if it is indeed a partial permutation .
If we read permutations as paths from the root of the tree , and identify a node with the path to it , the subtree of abcde is a pruned version of the subtree of bcde with all occurrences of a filtered out or banned .
We call bcde the shadow of abcde .
The shadow of bcde is cde and so on .
Coding these ideas into function f of the schema in the previous section gives the following program : let build n = let rec T = toplevel 1 and toplevel m = if m> n then empty else node m ( f m T ) ( toplevel ( m+1 ) ) and f banned empty = empty || -- f banned shadow f banned ( node a subtree sibs ) = let others = f banned sibs in if a = banned then others -- prune a's subtree else node a ( f banned subtree ) others -- no pruning in T Function f has gained an extra parameter for the banned element and performs a filtering operation on the shadow tree .
A single test , a=banned , tells if a permutation can be extended with a given value , all other exclusions being implicit in the tree structure .
As the permutation tree is traversed it is gradually evaluated .
If for example the first permutation , 123 , from build 3 were printed , the evaluated portion would be : . . . . . . . . . . 1 2 3 . . . . . . . ? . . . . 2 1 3 1 2 . . . . . . ? . ? ? 3 1 Note , ` ? ' is used to denote an unevaluated subtree .
Recall that we read a permutation , such as 123 , as a path from the root of the tree and identify a node with the path to it .
The shadow of 123 is 23 .
The subtree of 23 is ` node 1 ?
empty ' and the 1 is banned for 123 , so 123 is a complete permutation .
The shadow of 23 is 3 .
The subtree of 3 is ` node 1 ? ( node 2 ? empty ) ' and the second branch is banned beneath 23 so its subtree is ` node 1 ? empty '.
The shadow of a path grows with the path , one step behind it .
The structure of the tree stores the results of many past tests so that only a single extra test is performed to add a new node .
( This is not a big issue in permutation generation but there are cases where it is . )
Note that Topor [ 12 ] has examined the space complexity of functional programs for generating permutations represented as linear linked lists .

The well known n-queens problem is to place n queens on an n×n chess board so that no two queens threaten each other .
Each queen must be on a separate row , column and diagonal and this property is an invariant that must be maintained as partial solutions are extended .
The fastest imperative solutions [ 11 ] are based on permutation generators .
A board is represented by the permutation of rows that the queens on the columns occupy .
This representation automatically ensures the separate row and column parts of the invariant .
Here we observe that a partial solution abcde can be extended to a partial solution abcdeX if and only if bcdeX is also a partial solution and a and X are on separate diagonals and rows .
By using shadows , X need only be tested against a 's diagonals as the results of the other diagonal tests against other queens are already encoded in the shadow tree and do not need to be repeated .
Again , the required program is a modification of the general schema with f redefined .
Function f gains a new parameter col , being the current column number .
let build n = let rec T = toplevel 1 and toplevel m = if m> n then empty else node m ( f 1 m T ) ( toplevel ( m+1 ) ) and f col banned empty = empty || f col banned ( node a subtree sibs ) = let others = f col banned sibs in if member banned [ a , a+col , a - col ] then others -- prune else node a ( f ( col+1 ) banned subtree ) others -- no prune in T
The standard function member tests the membership of an element in a list .
Note that the test member banned [ a , a+col , a - col ] is an amalgam of the old permutation test , a=banned , and the new diagonal test .
Irreducible or Good Sequences .
Axel Thue [ 7 ] defined the notion of an irreducible sequence in a series of papers in the period 1906 - 1914 .
Dijkstra [ 5 ] later called these `good sequences ' and used them in an exercise in structured programming .
A sequence over the alphabet { 1 , 2 , 3} , or in general over { 1 , ..., n} , is irreducible if and only if it contains no adjacent subsequences that are identical .
For example , 1213121 is irreducible but 12132131 is not because 213 is immediately repeated .
It is easy to see that ( i ) a sequence abcdeX of even length is irreducible iff the shorter sequences abcde and bcdeX are irreducible and the two halves abc and deX are unequal and ( ii ) a sequence abcdefX of odd length is irreducible iff abcdef and bcdefX are irreducible .
This enables a circular program to be written for a tree representing all the irreducible sequences .
For example , the shadow of abcde ( of odd length ) is bcde .
Assuming that abcde is irreducible , abcdeX is irreducible if and only if bcdeX is irreducible , if and only if X is a descendant of bcde .
let build n = let rec T = toplevel 1 and toplevel m = if m> n then empty else node m ( f 2 [ m ]
T ) ( toplevel ( m+1 ) ) and f len seq empty = empty || f len seq ( node a subtree sibs ) = let others = f len seq sibs and seq2 = a.seq in if even len & repeated ( len / 2 ) seq2 then others -- prune else node a ( f ( len+1 ) seq2 subtree ) others -- do n't prune in T A new parameter seq carries the particular sequence forward as f descends through the tree .
When the length len is even , a test is made that the sequence a.seq is not the concatenation of two sequences of length len / 2 .
Function repeated performs this test in O ( len ) time and has an obvious definition .
It is not necessary to test for any shorter repeats .
These are implicitly ruled out by the use of the shadow to generate subtrees .
The test would be more complex without this information .
That portion of the tree that is evaluated in order to print the first irreducible sequence of length five is shown below : . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 2 3 . . . . . . . . 2 3 1 1 . . . . . . 1 1 3 . . . . 3 1 . . 1
The shadow of 12131 is 2131 whose shadow is 131 whose shadow is 31 whose shadow is 1 .
Conclusions .
Programmers are familiar with recursive functions but recursive or self - referential data structures used in circular programs are rare .
Circular programs are very powerful enabling many infinite structures to be efficiently defined .
They often remove the need for intermediate structures and for repeated calculations .
They can be used safely provided that later values depend only on earlier ones in the structure .
Memo - structures can be formed by a data structure and function defined using mutual recursion .
Explicit circular search - trees can reduce the number of tests performed in constraint - satisfaction problems .
As usual , there is a trade - off of time against space .

The bones are at least 2,000 years old
Little is known about the dodo , a famous flightless bird thought to have become extinct in the 17th Century .
No complete skeleton has ever been found in Mauritius , and the last full set of bones was destroyed in a fire at a museum in Oxford , England , in 1755 .
Researchers believe the bones are at least 2,000 years old , and hope to learn more about how dodos lived .
A team of Dutch and Mauritian scientists discovered the bones in a swampy area near a sugar plantation on the south - east of the island .
The bones were said to have been recovered from a single layer of earth , with the prospect of further excavations to come .
Sections of beaks and the remains of dodo chicks were thought to be among the find .
' Foolish ' bird
The discovery was hailed as a breakthrough in the Netherlands .
RAPHUS CUCULLATUS
Forest - dwelling and flightless
Waded in ponds to catch fish Killed by sailors for extra food Ship animals stole its eggs
Dutch geologist Kenneth Rijsdijk , who led the dig , said DNA samples from the dodo bones could revolutionise our understanding of how the birds lived .
The dodo was mocked by Portuguese and Dutch colonialists for its size and apparent lack of fear of armed , hungry hunters .
It took its name from the Portuguese word for " fool " , and was hunted to extinction within 200 years of Europeans landing on Mauritius .
Cost Per Minute : Are Compact Discs A Good Value ?
Since its tuneful Tuesday ( see our earlier discussion on XMSR ) lets revisit the concept of value and music .
This meme is increasingly infiltrating the mainstream .
Today 's question : " Are Compact Discs A Good Value ? "
No , and the tale below is a classic example of not just that , but why the industry continues to stubbornly insist on losing sales :
You ’ve heard many times on the pages of AVRev.com about how the woes of the music industry ca n’t be placed solely on the shoulders of peer - to - peer file swapping or piracy .
The fact that the compact disc is still a poor value was never more evident to me than when I was at the mega electronics store WOW ! in Long Beach , California this weekend .
This staggeringly large store features a fully stocked Tower Records / Video , along with the newly merged CompUSA / Good Guys !
I went in to pick up some toner for my laser printer and , for some reason , the once familiar but long forgotten desire to browse the CD racks came over me .
I realized that in my collection of “ must have ” music , I had a gaping hole .
I did n’t have the Metallica CD … And Justice for All , and I was n’t about to break out my worn - out cassette version or download the album from Limewire for fear of Metallica ’s strong - armed legal team , so I figured I ’d pick up a copy at Tower Records .
I wandered up and down the aisles , remembering the days when I would actually care and get up for the upcoming release of a new album by a band I thought was amazing .
Perhaps
I ’m showing my age as I hit my early thirties , but I just found it hard to get excited about anything I saw on the “ new releases rack . ”
Then again , finding the next big thing was n’t my goal .
I wanted one of the best metal albums of all time and before I knew it , I was at the Metallica rack .
Flipping through the CDs , I found that oh so familiar album cover with the crumbling statue of the Lady of Justice on the cover and almost did n’t flip the disc over to check the price , assuming it would be somewhere in the $ 11.99 to $ 14.99 range .
Curiosity got the best of me and I flipped over the disc .
To my amazement , the price tag read a staggering $ 18.99 and there was not the typical yellow “ sale ” sticker that I am so accustomed to seeing .
If I wanted to rock to some “ Shortest Straw ” and “ Harvester of Sorrow ” in my car , I would have to plunk down quite bit of dough .
I have never considered myself cheap , but I found myself with a little case of sticker shock .
In retail , there is a price where almost anything will sell .
List your house at $ 50,000 over market value and , unless it ’s a scorching hot market , the offers wo n’t come pouring in .
For me , with this CD purchase , the decision came down to something simple : the $ 20 bill in my wallet .
To go along with my craving for this Metallica disc was also craving for a strawberry smoothie at Jamba Juice .
Had Tower priced the disc at what I felt to be a fair amount for a back catalogue record ( $ 9.99 to $ 13.99 ) , I would have bought it without hesitation .
Because they swung for the fences , I left the disc in the bin , doing the retailer , the label and a reportedly financially starving Lars Ulrich no good whatsoever .
I did buy the over - priced drink and then went home to purchase the exact disc I wanted , used , from eBay , for a little bit over $ 5 with $ 2 shipping .
I know arguing over $ 10 here and there seems like I might be cheap , but I am not .
I lunch in Beverly Hills every day , paying easily what the album would have cost me .
I was making an economic protest about the value of the album .
I understand overhead and royalties with the best of them , but at the same time the label has long ago paid for the production costs of such a great , multi-platinum heavy metal record .
With CDs in jewel cases costing about $ 0.50 , I was getting ripped off and I was n’t going to stand for it , nor was I going to do anything illegal or immoral in response .
This lost “ brick and mortar ” sale due to an overpriced disc is becoming a common occurrence .
I have often heard my friends saying , “ I just do n’t buy music any more , because it ’s too expensive and just not worth it , ” or “ Why do n’t you just get it used ? ’
People are still buying DVDs by the millions each week , with “ King Kong ” selling a reported 6.5 million copies in its first week .
A number - one - selling compact disc might be lucky to do 10 percent of that amount .
Of course , this number could be a little skewed , as there are many more music releases in a given week than there are mainstream DVD releases , but the days of N’Sync or Eminem having first week sales well north of a million copies seem to be a thing of the past .
It seems lately that even the biggest - selling albums in a particular year barely sell more than Peter Jackson ’s big - budget thriller did in seven days .
The labels and retailers are committing suicide .
Theyt ultimately will reap what they have sown : financial irrelevance and replacement by more competitive entertainment and digital media .

Funny , that .
Because when I was in New Orleans on hurricane relief , I was driving literally 11 - 12 hrs per day and wanted some tunes to play in the rental .
I went to a store thinking I 'd replace my lost copies of And Justice for All , Ride the Lightning , and Master of Puppets that disappeared back in grad school .
The cheapest was 17.99 and these are what ... 15 year old discs ?
Screw em , I ended up buying some local funk / brass stuff ( Soul Rebels , Meters ) and some mint used Coltrane , Kenny Burrell , Grant Green , Dr. John for $ 7 / per and a new Pavement double disc reissue of Slanted and Enchanted for $ 19 .
One more thing on Metallica ... if you are even a casual fan , check out the documentary film on them " Metallica : Some Kind of Monster " .
It 's a great flick ... not alot of music footage , more " inside the band " and all the dysfunctional BS ( and I 'm not a metal head by any stretch , but i love this film ) .

Claim : Woman pens hilarious account of family ’s efforts to rescue trapped cat from garbage disposal .
TRUE
Example : [ Collected on the Internet , 2002 ]
This is the story of the night my ten - year - old cat , Rudy , got his head stuck in the garbage disposal .
I knew at the time that the experience would be funny if the cat survived , so let me tell you right up front that he ’s fine .
Getting him out was n’t easy , though , and the process included numerous home remedies , a plumber , two cops , an emergency overnight veterinary clinic , a case of mistaken identity , five hours of panic , and fifteen minutes of fame .
First , some background .
My husband , Rich , and I had just returned from a five - day spring - break vacation in the Cayman Islands , where I had been sick as a dog the whole time , trying to convince myself that if I had to feel lousy , it was better to do it in paradise .
We had arrived home at 9 p.m. , a day and a half later than we had planned because of airline problems .
I still had illness - related vertigo and because of the flight delays had not been able to prepare the class I was supposed to teach at 8:40 the next morning .
I sat down at my desk to think about William Carlos Williams , and around ten o’clock I heard Rich hollering something indecipherable from the kitchen .
As I raced out to see what was wrong , I saw Rich frantically rooting around under the kitchen sink , and Rudy — or , rather , Rudy ’s headless body — scrambling around in the sink , his claws clicking in panic on the metal .
Rich had just ground up the skin of some smoked salmon in the garbage disposal , and when he left the room , Rudy ( whom we always did call a pinhead ) had gone in after it .
It is very disturbing to see the headless body of your cat in the sink .
This is an animal that I have slept with nightly for ten years , who burrows under the covers and purrs against my side , and who now looked like a desperate , fur - covered turkey carcass , set to defrost in the sink while it ’s still alive and kicking .
It was also disturbing to see Rich , Mr. Calm - in - an- Emergency , at his wits end , trying to soothe Rudy , trying to undo the garbage disposal , failing at both , and basically freaking out .
Adding to the chaos was Rudy ’s twin brother Lowell , also upset , racing around in circles , jumping onto the kitchen counter and alternately licking Rudy ’s butt for comfort and biting it out of fear .
Clearly , I had to do something .
First we tried to ease Rudy out of the disposal by lubricating his head and neck .
We tried Johnson ’s baby shampoo ( kept on hand for my nieces ’ visits ) and butter - flavored Crisco : both failed , and a now - greasy Rudy kept struggling .
Rich then decided to take apart the garbage disposal , which was a good idea , but he could n’t do it .
Turns out , the thing is constructed like a metal onion : you peel off one layer and another one appears , with Rudy ’s head still buried deep inside , stuck in a hard plastic collar .
My job during this process was to sit on the kitchen counter petting Rudy , trying to calm him , with the room spinning ( vertigo ) , Lowell howling ( he ’s part Siamese ) , and Rich clattering around with tools .
When all our efforts failed , we sought professional help .
I called our regular plumber , who actually called me back quickly , even at 11 o’clock at night ( thanks , Dave ) .
He talked Rich through further layers of disposal dismantling , but still we could n’t reach Rudy .
I called the 1-800 number for Insinkerator ( no response ) , a pest removal service that advertises 24 - hour service ( no response ) , an all - night emergency veterinary clinic ( who had no experience in this matter , and so , no advice ) , and finally , in desperation , 911 .
I could see that Rudy ’s normally pink paw pads were turning blue .
The fire department , I figured , gets cats out of trees ; maybe they could get one out of a garbage disposal .
The dispatcher had other ideas and offered to send over two policemen .
This suggestion gave me pause .
I ’m from the sixties , and even if I am currently a fine upstanding citizen , I had never considered calling the cops and asking them to come to my house , on purpose .
I resisted the suggestion , but the dispatcher was adamant : “ They ’ll help you out , ” he said .
The cops arrived close to midnight and turned out to be quite nice .
More importantly , they were also able to think rationally , which we were not .
They were , of course , quite astonished by the situation : “ I ’ve never seen anything like this , ” Officer Mike kept saying .
( The unusual circumstances helped us get quickly on a first - name basis with our cops . )
Officer Tom , who expressed immediate sympathy for our plight —
“ I ’ve had cats all my life , ” he said , comfortingly — also had an idea .
Evidently we needed a certain tool , a tiny , circular rotating saw , that could cut through the heavy plastic flange encircling Rudy ’s neck without hurting Rudy , and Officer Tom happened to own one .
“ I live just five minutes from here , ” he said ; “ I ’ll go get it . ”
He soon returned , and the three of them —
Rich and the two policemen — got under the sink together to cut through the garbage disposal .
I sat on the counter , holding Rudy and trying not to succumb to the surreal - ness of the scene , with the weird middle - of - the - night lighting , the room ’s occasional spinning , Lowell ’s spooky sound effects , an apparently headless cat in my sink and six disembodied legs poking out from under it .
One good thing came of this : the guys did manage to get the bottom off of the disposal , so we could now see Rudy ’s face and knew he could breathe .
But they could n’t cut the flange without risking the cat .
Stumped .
Officer Tom had another idea .
“ You know , ” he said , “ I think the reason we ca n’t get him out is the angle of his head and body .
If we could just get the sink out and lay it on its side , Ill bet we could slip him out . ”
That sounded like a good idea at this point .
ANYTHING would have sounded like a good idea , and as it turned out , Officer Mike runs a plumbing business on weekends ; he knew how to take out the sink !
Again they went to work , the three pairs of legs sticking out from under the sink surrounded by an ever - increasing pile of tools and sink parts .
They cut the electrical supply , capped off the plumbing lines , unfastened the metal clamps , unscrewed all the pipes , and about an hour later , voila !
the sink was lifted gently out of the countertop , with one guy holding the garbage disposal ( which contained Rudy ’s head ) up close to the sink ( which contained Rudy ’s body ) .
We laid the sink on its side , but even at this more favorable removal angle , Rudy stayed stuck .
Officer
Tom ’s radio beeped , calling him away on some kind of real police business .
As he was leaving , though , he had another good idea : “ You know , ” he said , “ I do n’t think we can get him out while he ’s struggling so much .
We need to get the cat sedated .
If he were limp , we could slide him out . ”
And off he went , regretfully , a cat lover still worried about Rudy .
The remaining three of us decided that getting Rudy sedated was a good idea , but Rich and I were new to the area .
We knew that the overnight emergency veterinary clinic was only a few minutes away , but we did n’t know exactly how to get there .
“ I know where it is ! ” declared Officer Mike .
“ Follow me ! ” So Mike got into his patrol car , Rich got into the driver ’s seat of our car , and I got into the back , carrying the kitchen sink , what was left of the garbage disposal , and Rudy .
It was now about 2:00 a.m .
We followed Officer Mike for a few blocks when I decided to put my hand into the garbage disposal to pet Rudy ’s face , hoping I could comfort him .
Instead , my sweet , gentle bedfellow chomped down on my finger hard , really hard , and would n’t let go .
My scream reflex kicked into gear , and I could n’t stop the noise .
Rich slammed on the brakes , hollering “ What ?
What happened ?
Should I stop ? ” , checking us out in the rearview mirror .
“ No , ” I managed to get out between screams , “ just keep driving .
Rudy ’s biting me , but we ’ve got to get to the vet .
Just go ! ”
Rich turned his attention back to the road , where Officer Mike took a turn we had n’t expected , and we followed .
After a few minutes Rudy let go , and as I stopped screaming , I looked up to discover that we were wandering aimlessly through an industrial park , in and out of empty parking lots , past little streets that did n’t look at all familiar .
“ Where ’s he taking us ? ” I asked .
“ We should have been there ten minutes ago ! ” Rich was as mystified as I was , but all we knew to do was follow the police car until , finally , he pulled into a church parking lot and we pulled up next to him .
As Rich rolled down the window to ask , “ Mike , where are we going ? ” , the cop , who was not Mike , rolled down his window and asked , “ Why are you following me ? ” Once Rich and I recovered from our shock at having tailed the wrong cop car and the policeman from his pique at being stalked , he led us quickly to the emergency vet , where Mike greeted us by holding open the door , exclaiming “ Where were you guys ? ? ? ”
It was lucky that Mike got to the vet ’s ahead of us , because we had n’t thought to call and warn them about what was coming .
( Clearly , by this time we were n’t really thinking at all . )
We brought in the kitchen sink containing Rudy and the garbage disposal containing his head , and the clinic staff was ready .
They took his temperature ( which was down 10 degrees ) and his oxygen level ( which was half of normal ) , and the vet declared : “ This cat is in serious shock .
We ’ve got to sedate him and get him out of there immediately . ”
When I asked if it was OK to sedate a cat in shock , the vet said grimly , “ We do n’t have a choice . ”
With that , he injected the cat ; Rudy went limp ; and the vet squeezed about half a tube of K - Y jelly onto the cat ’s neck and pulled him free .
Then the whole team jumped into “ code blue ” mode .
( I know this from watching a lot of ER . )
They laid Rudy on a cart , where one person hooked up IV fluids , another put little socks on his paws ( “ You ’d be amazed how much heat they lose through their pads , ” she said ) , one covered him with hot water bottles and a blanket , and another took a blow - dryer to warm up Rudy ’s now very gunky head .
The fur on his head dried in stiff little spikes , making him look rather pathetically punk as he lay there , limp and motionless .
At this point they sent Rich , Mike , and me to sit in the waiting room while they tried to bring Rudy back to life .
I told Mike he did n’t have to stay , but he just stood there , shaking his head .
“ I ’ve never seen anything like this , ” he said again .
At about 3 a.m , the vet came in to tell us that the prognosis was good for a full recovery .
They needed to keep Rudy overnight to re-hydrate him and give him something for the brain swelling they assumed he had , but if all went well , we could take him home the following night .
Just in time to hear the good news , Officer Tom rushed in , finished with his real police work and concerned about Rudy .
I figured that once this ordeal was over and Rudy was home safely , I would have to re-think my position on the police .
Rich and I got back home about 3:30 .
We had n’t unpacked from our trip , I was still intermittently dizzy , and I still had n’t prepared my 8:40 class .
“ I need a vacation , ” I said , and while I called the office to leave a message canceling my class , Rich made us a pitcher of martinis .
I slept late the next day and then badgered the vet about Rudy ’s condition until he said that Rudy could come home later that day .
I was working on the suitcases when the phone rang .
“ Hi , this is Steve Huskey from the Norristown Times - Herald , ” a voice told me .
“ Listen , I was just going through the police blotter from last night .
Mostly it ’s the usual stuff breaking and entering , petty theft but there ’s this one item .
Um , do you have a cat ? ”
So I told Steve the whole story , which interested him .
A couple hours later he called back to say that his editor was interested , too ; did I have a picture of Rudy ?
The next day Rudy was front - page news , under the ridiculous headline “ Catch of the Day Lands Cat in Hot Water . ”
There were some noteworthy repercussions to the newspaper article .
Mr. Huskey had somehow inferred that I called 911 because I thought Rich , my husband , was going into shock , although how he concluded this from my comment that “ his pads were turning blue , ” I do n’t quite understand .
So the first thing I had to do was call Rich at work Rich , who had worked tirelessly to free Rudy — and swear that I had been misquoted .
When I arrived at work myself , I was famous ; people had been calling my secretary all morning to inquire about Rudy ’s health .
When I called our regular vet ( whom I had met only once ) to make a follow - up appointment for Rudy , the receptionist asked , “ Is this the famous Rudy ’s mother ? ”
When I brought my car in for routine maintenance a few days later , Dave , my mechanic , said , “ We read about your cat .
Is he OK ? ”
When I called a tree surgeon about my dying red oak , he asked if I knew the person on that street whose cat had been in the garbage disposal .
And when I went to get my hair cut , the shampoo person told me the funny story her grandma had read in the paper , about a cat who got stuck in the garbage disposal .
Even today , over a year later , people ask about Rudy , whom a 9 - year - old neighbor had always called “ the Adventure Cat ” because he used to climb on the roof of her house and peer in the second - story window at her .
I do n’t know what the moral of this story is , but I do know that this “ adventure ” cost me $ 1100 in emergency vet bills , follow - up vet care , new sink , new plumbing , new electrical wiring , and new garbage disposal , one with a cover .
The vet can no longer say he ’s seen everything but the kitchen sink .
I wanted to thank Officers Tom and Mike by giving them gift certificates to the local hardware store , but was told that they could n’t accept gifts , that I would put them in a bad position if I tried .
So I wrote a letter to the Police Chief praising their good deeds and sent individual thank - you notes to Tom and Mike , complete with pictures of Rudy , so they could see what he looks like with his head on .
And Rudy , whom we originally got for free ( or so we thought ) , still sleeps with me under the covers on cold nights and unaccountably , he still sometimes prowls the sink , hoping for fish .
Hi , I ’m Mark Nottingham .
I currently co-chair the IETF HTTP and QUIC Working Groups , and am a member of the Internet Architecture Board .
I usually write here about the Web , protocol design , HTTP , and caching .
Find out more .
Leveraging the Web : Caching
The first in an occasional series about the real - world benefits of REST and the Web architecture , as applied to HTTP .
I used to work for a fairly huge company as a Web / Internet guru .
One day , I got sucked into a meeting with a visiting executive who was talking about rolling out a new set of servers to allow customer service reps access internal documentation .
The requirement was to make large - ish PDF files available on the internal network world - wide nearly instantaneously , with access control .
An external vendor had quoted a solution ; it involved rolling out a pair of Windows NT servers ( for redundancy ) to each location around the world , each with its own database and custom - designed software that client applications on the reps ’ desktops would connect to .
The whole thing would be tied together with message queues and centrally managed .
Our exec was n’t happy because the deployment cost for this was huge ; developing software , rolling out and maintaining Windows NT boxes with databases to over fifty sites around the world is no picnic .
The cost of the servers and software alone was prohibitive , and the ongoing maintenance was a very healthy chunk of change .
And , the complexity of the proposed system lead us to believe that it would be pretty flakey .
Furthermore , he was frustrated because the same information was already available on an internal Web site , but it just was n’t fast enough for his purposes ( after all , if you ’re a rep in Dubai , you ca n’t wait around with a customer on the phone for five minutes while the PDF comes down ) .
So , when I wondered aloud why they did n’t just use Web caches , he got very interested .
After a prototype using Squid , we got buy - in to go further .
The app had some pretty specific requirements ; for example , each and every request had to be authenticated , but we still needed to get the PDF from local cache .
We took care of that with a Cache - Control : public , must - revalidate .
Then , they wanted the PDF to be in cache , even for the first person to request it .
So , we had a small script on the Web server that pushed the PDFs into the caches as they were published , effectively pre-fetching them .
They wanted it to be reliable , so we designed a two - level hierarchy with fail - over between both co-located and remote caches .
Even in a complete failure , the original Web site could be used , so that the data would still be available ( albeit slow ) .
Caching is n’t just about saving bandwidth ; it ’s also about distributing an application , improving reliability and improving user experience .
We ended up deploying a large - ish number of Network Appliance Netcaches around the world .
The NetApps were fantastic ; because they were off - the - shelf appliances , they were very easy to configure , and once running , they did n’t require any but the most basic monitoring .
The startup cost was , IIRC , nearly an order of magnitude less than the original quote , and the maintenance for the NetApps was , comparatively , a pittance .
The project took about six months , start to finish , and that was mostly working out the deal with NetApp and getting the deployment plan together ; there was n’t any development beyond the thirty or so lines of Perl to get the database to ping the caches .
Our exec was very happy .
I went to headquarters to do the final integration into the Web site , and give a demo or two .
At one point , some senior IT execs came in and were very sceptical about the value of caching ; while it might do good in tiny , remote offices , it would n’t help there ( where they had some impossibly big pipes straight into the Internet ) .
Needless to say , their eyes pretty much popped out of their heads when I showed them the difference between surfing from the net and surfing from the cache , and they were immediate converts .
Lessons Learned
The biggest surprise to many involved was that we were able to scale the Web site out with basically no code , using off - the - shelf components .
Caching brought both scalability and reliability to the application very cheaply and easily , despite the requirement for authentication .
It was also quite eye - opening to see how using a message queue and other “ Enterprise ” mechanisms just plain were n’t necessary , despite experts ’ insistence that they were .
The constraints of the Web ( as REST explains ) makes it very easy and simple to do very powerful things .
Lastly , this is a nice demonstration that caching is n’t just about saving bandwidth ; it ’s also about distributing an application , improving reliability and improving user experience .
Pakistan ’s “ truce with the Taliban is an abject surrender , and al Qaeda has an untouchable base of operations in Western Pakistan which will only expand if not checked
The news of the Pakistani government signing a truce agreement with the Taliban in North Waziristan is far worse than being reported .
We raised the alarm early morning on September 4 , and newly uncovered information on the terms of the agreement indicate Pakistan has been roundly defeated by the Taliban in North Waziristan .
The “ truce ” is in fact a surrender .
According to an anonymous intelligence source , the terms of the truce includes :
– The Pakistani Army is abandoning its garrisons in North and South Waziristan .
– The Pakistani Military will not operate in North Waziristan , nor will it monitor actions the region .
– Pakistan will turn over weapons and other equipment seized during Pakistani Army operations .
–
The Taliban and al Qaeda have set up a Mujahideen Shura ( or council ) to administer the agency .
–
The truce refers to the region as “ The Islamic Emirate of Waziristan . ” –
An unknown quantity of money was transferred from Pakistani government coffers to the Taliban .
The Pakistani government has essentially paid a tribute or ransom to end the fighting .
– “ Foreigners ” ( a euphemism for al Qaeda and other foreign jihadis ) are allowed to remain in the region .
–
Over 130 mid-level al Qaeda commanders and foot soldiers were released from Pakistani custody .
–
The Taliban is required to refrain from violence in Pakistan only ; the agreement does not stipulate refraining from violence in Afghanistan .
Al Rayah – the flag of al Qaeda .
Click image to view .
The truce meeting was essentially an event designed to humiliate the Pakistani government and military .
Government negotiators were searched for weapons by Taliban fighters prior to entering the meeting .
Heavily armed Taliban were posted as guards around the ceremony .
The al Rayah – al Qaeda ’s black flag – was hung over the scoreboard at the soccer stadium where the ceremony was held .
After the Pakistani delegation left , al Qaeda ’s black flag was run up the flagpole of military checkpoints and the Taliban began looting the leftover small arms .
The Taliban also held a ‘ parade ’ in the streets of Miranshah .
They openly view the ‘ truce ’ as a victory , and the facts support this view .
Tahir Yuldashev
While this is not reported in the media , the “ Taliban commanders ” in attendance include none other than Jalaluddin Haqqani , military commander of the Taliban in Afghanistan , and Tahir Yuldashev , the commander of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan .
The New York Times does place Haqqani and Yuldashev in the Waziristan region .
Both men are deeply in bed with al Qaeda , and it is useless at this point in time to make distinctions between al Qaeda , the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan , the Taliban and Pakistan jihadi groups like Lashkar - Toiba .
Syed Saleem Shahzad indicates other known Taliban commanders were present at the meeting ;
“ At the gathering , mujahideen leader Maulana Sadiq Noor and a representative of Gul Badar ( chief of the Pakistani Taliban in North Waziristan ) , as well as other members of the mujahideen shura ( council ) , were seated on a stage while the leaders of the JUI - F [ the political party of Pakistani opposition leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman and only party in North and South Waziristan , which was not always the case ] delivered the speeches . ”
Note that while unstated , Haqqani and Yuldashev also sit on the Mujahideen Shura .
To add insult to the defeat of the Waziristan truce , Pakistan has openly admitted that it would let Osama bin Laden remain a free man if committed to living a peaceful existance in the region .
“ If he is in Pakistan , bin Laden ‘ would not be taken into custody , ’ Major General Shaukat Sultan Khan told ABC News in a telephone interview , ‘as long as one is being like a peaceful citizen , ” reports ABC News ’
The Blotter .
An independent intelligence source confirms Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan Khan ’s position is an accurate reflection of Pakistani policy .
[ Note : Pakistan has since retracted its statements on bin Laden and immunity , but the Blotter transcript oftheinterview refutes this . ]
The Pakistani government has ceded a region the size of New Jersey , with a population of about 800,000 to the Taliban and al Qaeda .
The establishment of the Islamic Emirate of Waziristan is not the end of the Taliban ’s expansion , however .
An intelligence source indicates similar negotiations between the Taliban and the Pakistani government are being held in the agencies of Khyber , Tank , Dera Ishmal Khan and Bajaur .
The jihadi dreams of al Qaeda ’s safe havens in western Pakistan have become a reality .
And the gains made by the Coalition in Afghanistan have now officially been wiped away with the peace agreement in the newly established Islamic Emirate of Waziristan .

Jane Goodall Lecture at the Google Campus

If you really want something , and really work hard , and take advantage of opportunities , and never give up , you will find a way .

Google Trends is particularly unscientific .
Many of those Vista searchers may be looking for beautiful views , and the Ubuntu seekers may be investigating the founding principles of post - apartheid South Africa .
" My interpretation of that is that our documentation sucks so badly that people have to search a lot ... " jokes Shuttleworth .
Nonetheless , he feels he is backing a winner .
" It will take me time to get this business to profitability , " he concedes .
But he still feels that Linux is the right horse to back .
" I do n't see any downward trend there .
I see Linux continuing to grow . "
Of course , Shuttleworth has no VC backers or shareholders to account to – with a £ 400 m liquidity event already under his belt , he only has to please himself .
Of course , that 's not strictly true – the Ubuntu project owes its success to the developers who put the project together , largely on a voluntary basis .
So keeping them onside and involved while Ubuntu makes the transition from underground distro to viable commercial operation will be a difficult but crucial task .
" One of the really interesting questions we got when we made the Sun announcement was , do you think it will hurt your community credentials if you start working with Sun , IBM , HP and so on ?
" So it is very important to our business model that that not be the case .
Because much of the value of Ubuntu lies in the fact that it 's collaboratively produced with the community . "
Shuttleworth 's success in sustaining that community is as much down to his own laid - back charisma as it is to his deep pockets .
But the corporate world has a way of sucking that out of people and communities .
Balancing the needs of paying customers with the freewheeling spirit of an open source pioneer wo n't be easy .
Of course , Ubuntu does have one corporate user .
A very high profile one , in fact – Google .
So what about Goobuntu , the mysterious Linux distribution based on Ubuntu , currently spotted only inside the Googleplex ?
" Goobuntu is simply their internal desktop platform .
Obviously Linux makes sense for them .
Their developers love it , they have plenty of expertise to manage it , and Goobuntu is the chosen platform for their developers .
But there is a big difference between that and working on something that you are going to productise and ship out to the world , " says Shuttleworth .
So we wo n't get our hands on Goobuntu any time soon ?
" I do n't see any indication at this stage that that is a real plan .
They would n't have to tell me of course .
The nature of free software is that they could complete a plan like that , develop it and execute it without us knowing . "
Intriguing .
Anyone hoping for the arrival of the longed - for Google OS should n't hold their breath .
But the progress of Ubuntu will be well worth watching in the meantime .
Bootnote
In a feeble attempt to curry favour with the readership , Mr Shuttleworth claimed that he is an avid Register reader .
He also revealed that he has some peculiar features in common with the Register 's Otto Z Stern : " My prostate is made of opal – that story cracked me up , " he confided .
We believe this medical precaution is required for all amateur cosmonauts .

NBC Programs Now On iTunes
The lineup of available prime - time shows includes " Law & Order , " " The Office " and " Surface . "
Classic TV programs and late - night shows are also being offered .
NBC Universal on Tuesday started selling primetime and classic TV shows through Apple Computer Inc.'s iTunes store , joining ABC in making network video entertainment available through Apple 's content delivery system for a computer or the popular iPod portable player .
The lineup of available prime - time shows includes " Law & Order , " " The Office " and " Surface . "
NBC Universal will also offer late - night programming with " The Tonight Show with Jay Leno " and " Late Night with Conan O'Brien , " as well as classic TV shows " Alfred Hitchcock Presents , " " Dragnet , " " Adam - 12 , " and " Knight Rider . "
Current shows are available the day after they air on TV .
All the programs are sold in a designated area of the iTunes store featuring the NBC Universal brands , including the NBC network , Sci-Fi Channel , and the USA Network .
Television shows , as well as music videos and short films , are sold on iTunes for $ 1.99 each .
Songs are available for 99 cents apiece .
The addition of NBC programming ups to 16 the number of TV shows available on iTunes .
Since the debut of video on Oct. 12 , Apple has sold more than 3 million videos through iTunes .
Apple started offering video online the same day it launched the video iPod .
In agreeing to offer programming on the Web , TV networks are bowing to the increasing pressure of the Internet , which is becoming a major distribution channel for entertainment .
Where networks in the past were wary of the Internet , they are now embracing it .
" We are committed to helping viewers enjoy the wide breadth of our programs across an equally wide range of devices and distribution models , " Bob Wright , vice chairman of General Electric Co. and chairman and chief executive of NBC Universal , said in a statement .
" Apple has developed a distribution platform that is attractive to consumers while at the same time providing the safeguards against theft that are so important to us and to every content provider . "

Chip and PIN and the Media Spin
Many of you will have heard about the new way to pay for goods and services in the UK , " Chip and PIN " .
It 's been hyped as " the biggest change to payment since decimalisation " .
We 've been regularly asked for comment on the new system , so have recently condensed the balance of our opinions into the following paper :
" Chip and Spin " by Ross Anderson , Mike Bond , Steven J. Murdoch Download PDF File ( 79KB )
Nearly all the material in this paper is accessible to all readers , however certain parts may require moderate computer literacy .
If you are not at all technically savvy , you can continue on to browse through this site which has been prepared by one of the authors in order to explain the basics of the arguments in a less technical manner , and at a slower , more detailed pace .
News and Updates
Mar 06 : Our own investigations of transaction traces led us to discover that the potential Cardholder Verification Method list attack we described as a possible EMV weakness was in fact already fixed before EMV was deployed .
You can read the new results in the EMV Weaknesses section .
Advantages and Disadvantages
Now , the Chip and PIN system has advantages and disadvantages associated with each of the interested parties .
On the one hand , APACS and the banking community in general are already doing very well at describing the advantages of Chip and PIN , both in relation to the customer and themselves .
On the other hand , parts of the media have portrayed the scheme as entirely negative , with headlines such as " Crisis Looms for Chip and PIN " , maybe just to sell papers , or maybe in line with the agendas of third - party dissenters .
However , it does seem that the UK banking community is avoiding open discussion of the disadvantageous aspects more than they should be .
The purpose of this site is not to provide totally balanced comment on the move , but to give proper airing to the drawbacks .
It 's a always a tough job for onlookers to assess the truth behind anything controversial , but the greater the quantity of information , and the greater the variety of sources the better .
What is Chip and PIN ?
" Chip and PIN " is the media slogan for the new EMV Card Payments System designed to augment and eventually replace magnetic stripe payment cards in Europe .
It was designed by Europay , Mastercard and Visa , and the specifications for this new technology are managed by EMVCo , a company specially created for that purpose .
In the United Kingdom , all the banks have decided to make their EMV cards conform to an additional specification UKIS , created by APACS , the banking industry association .

Welcome to IGN 's new weekly countdown of the exceptional , fascinating and absurd , something we like to call Top 10 Tuesday .
Every week we 'll feature the top ten games , characters , fashion statements or whatever else we can think of that in some way relates to gaming and its history .
And just because it 's called Top 10 Tuesday does n't mean it 's always going to be a list of the best - we like to razz on stuff just the same as we praise it .
From counting down the best consoles ever to revealing the worst use of fish heads in a videogame , this is where it 's at .
Today 's Top 10 focuses on some of the brilliantly terrible game controllers that shipped for game systems .
Many of these were first - party , out - of - the - box concepts , while others were cash - in ideas from engineers that clearly either did n't have a sense in their noggin , or they simply listened too much to their marketing department .
Either way , these controllers are a bad bunch .
10 . 5200 Controller Though Nintendo did n't truly innovate with analog control out of the box , at least the company got it right .
Atari's attempt two decades prior was just unbelievably half - assed - the company created an analog joystick that did n't even center itself when released , and its engineers used material for its buttons that seemed to deteriorate at room temperature .
The games were challenging , but not in a good sense ... with this thing , trying to get Pitfall Harry to jump over a gap was just as difficult as trying to stop him from running to the right .
9. Turbo Touch 360 Dear Control Engineers :
Please do n't remove the D - pad on a controller in favor of a touch - sensitive surface .
You may try to con fighting gamers into thinking it'll make smooth circular motions easier , but you may not realize they like to rest their thumb on the pad when idle .
Thanks .
Your Pal , Craig
8. U - Force
What looks like a laptop when folded and a Death Star access panel when open is one of the most ridiculous third - party controllers ever conceived .
Infra-red beams shot out of this unit 's surface and tried to interpret hand motions as controller movements , but did it work ?
Know anyone who owned this thing ?
There you go .
7. Power Glove
One of the stupidest controllers is also considered one of the most classic simply due to brilliant marketing known as " product placement . "
The Wizard , starring Fred Savage , was a 90 minute Nintendo commercial for Mattel 's Power Glove and Super Mario Bros.
3 , even so far as using both items in the movie trailer .
So even if you did n't pay your six bucks for a movie ticket , you were still assaulted with the branding .
Oh , and you wo n't look as cool as this kid when you strap it on , so do n't bother .
6. TI - 99 Joystick Computers in the 80s were n't meant for the gaming market , but let 's be realistic : that 's all we really used these things for anyway .
Texas Instruments '
TI - 99 , a computer with an optional disk drive twice as massive , jumped on the gaming market early with a bunch of classic games like … um …
M* A * S * H…and , um …some Pac - Man clone …
Anyway , you had the choice of controlling these games with either A ) the keyboard , or B ) one of the crappiest , most unresponsive , piece of junk joysticks ever produced .
But hey , there were two of them !
5. Philips CDi Game Controller Philips certainly had its heart in the right idea .
It just did n't have the brains .
The Philips CD - I was a near dead - on - arrival , straight - to - infomercial multimedia system with a huge focus on games .
But with a really retarded set of remote controller designs , from the sluggish and wildly inaccurate analog unit shown here to a digital pad that looks more like a crackpipe than a controller , these guys really knew how to woo the gaming public .
But at least the system had Zelda !
4. Intellivision Disk Look , we understand that many system designers were shooting in the dark during the early days of videogames .
I 'm sure that a handheld controller that looked like a touch - tone phone appeared " Space Age Technology , " and the design even preceded the Nintendo D - pad by more than a half - decade …even offering more directional points than an 8 - way controller could dream of having .
But good luck figuring out if you 're pressing left or just slight up and left .
And controller overlays ?
Work of the devil .
3. Sega Activator Didn't the U - Force teach us that invisible infra-red beams are the absolute worst way of controlling your games ?
This octagon from Sega promised players who stood in the middle a new way of fighting in titles like Eternal Champion .
But it just ended up making 8 year olds look like they were having convulsions .
2. Xbox Fat I may be able to palm a bowling ball , but even I could n't comfortably or effectively wrap my mitts around Microsoft 's original monstrosity .
This gargantuan thing was clearly made for the Rock Biter from The Neverending Story .
What a shame the Nothing took him away .
1. Jaguar Controller Maybe Atari was doomed even before the Jaguar was ever conceived , but their idea of a controller definitely did n't help .
Not only did the company bring back the unnecessary phone keypad - with - overlays theme of the early 80s , Atari also created a three action button device in a world of Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat , a genre that the company was trying to woo over to its 64 - bit system .
On top of this , the company utilized a VGA plug for its controller ports , and the controller plugs simply fell out if a mouse farted somewhere in the house .
Jason Acosta , who studied pirates for his history thesis at the University of Florida , shows his pirate paraphernalia , including a replica of a 17th century pirate flintlock gun and sword , on May 10 , 2006 .
Pirates deserve more credit than the Hollywood stereotype of bloodthirsty one - eyed peg-legged men who bury treasure and force people to walk the plank , Acosta said .
They helped European nations explore the Americas and practiced the same egalitarian principles as our Founding Fathers , he said .
Acosta is a descendant of a pirate who fought in the Battle of New Orleans .
( University of Florida / Kristen Bartlett )
Blackbeard and Ben Franklin deserve equal billing for founding democracy in the United States and New World , a new University of Florida study finds .
Pirates practiced the same egalitarian principles as the Founding Fathers and displayed pioneering spirit in exploring new territory and meeting the native peoples , said Jason Acosta , who did the research for his thesis in history at the University of Florida .
“ Hollywood really has given pirates a bum rap with its image of bloodthirsty , one - eyed , peg - legged men who bury treasure and force people to walk the plank , ” he said .
“ We owe them a little more respect . ”
Acosta , a descendant of a pirate who fought for the United States in the Battle of New Orleans , studied travel narratives , court hearings , sermons delivered at pirate hangings and firsthand accounts of passengers held captive by pirates .
Comparing pirate charters with the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution , he said he was amazed by the similarities .
Like the American revolutionaries , pirates developed three branches of government with checks and balances .
The ship captain was elected , just as the U.S. president ; the pirate assembly was comparable to Congress ; and the quartermaster resembled a judge in settling shipmate disputes and preventing the captain from overstepping his authority , he said .
Colonists and pirates also were alike in emphasizing written laws , democratic representation and due process , Acosta said .
All crew members were allowed to vote , ship charters had to be signed by every man on board , and anyone who lost an eye or a leg was compensated financially , he said .
These ideals grew out of both groups ’ frustration at being mistreated by their leaders ; the British forced the colonists to quarter troops and pay taxes , and captains on merchant ships beat their shipmen , starved them and paid less than promised , Acosta said .
“ It ’s no wonder that many sailors seized the opportunity to jump ship and search for a better way of life , namely piracy , which offered better food , shorter work shifts and the power of the crew in decision - making , ” he said .
A golden age of pirating emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries as these Brethren of the Sea sailed the world ’s waterways , plundering hundreds of millions of dollars worth of gold , silver and other merchandise , shaping the modern world in the process , Acosta said .
Pirates mapped new territory , expanded trade routes , discovered good ports and opened doors with the native peoples , Acosta said .
“ They really helped European nations explore the Americas before Europeans could afford to explore them on their own , ” he said .
By selling stolen silks , satins , spices and other merchandise in ports and spending their booty in the colonies , pirates created an economic boom , helping struggling settlements and making Port Royale in Jamaica and Charleston , S.C. , huge mercantile centers , Acosta said .
“ They did n’t bury their treasure , they spent it , helping colonies survive that could n’t get the money and supplies they needed from Europe , ” he said .
Without the infusion of money into the New World from piracy , it is possible that Britain and France may not have been able to catch up with Spain , Acosta said .
“ Had it not been for pirates , Britain might have had trouble holding onto the American colonies , ” he said .
“ Pirates decimated the Spanish so badly that Spain finally had to give up some of its American empire just to get pirating to stop . ”
Native Americans and black slaves oppressed by the Spanish in the Caribbean gave pirates inside information on where to dock ships and find supplies , Acosta said .
Slaves fleeing plantations were welcomed on pirate ships , where they shared an equal voice with white sailors , he said .
Acosta said he believes pirates would be given a place in the history books if they had been able to write their stories and leave diaries like the more literate American colonists .
A Gainesville middle school teacher , Acosta occasionally brings up pirates in his classroom , where he has a captive audience , thanks to the popularity of the movie “ Pirates of the Caribbean , ” which has a sequel opening July 7 .
“ I had one group of students in my class who just went around the playground all the time saying , ‘ Aaar , we ’re the pirates , ’ ” he said .
Richard Burg , an Arizona State University professor and expert on pirates , said Acosta is performing a great service by emphasizing pirates ’ democratic and egalitarian ways .
“ The men who sailed under the skull and crossbones were ordinary folk , like America ’s revolutionaries , standing firm against oppressive governments and economic systems , ” he said .
“ Mr. Acosta is one of the few scholars who understand this . ”

There are three perennial passions in Argentina : football , the tango and the country 's claim to Britain 's South Atlantic outpost , the Falkland Islands .
Even the build - up to Argentina 's World Cup game against Germany yesterday failed to entirely deflect attention from what in the last few months has become the hot political issue .
In the latest of a series of provocative moves - provocative , at least , when seen from the Falklands and the Foreign Office - the Argentinian parliament on Thursday established a commission to investigate how to win control of the islands Argentinians refer to as the Malvinas .
In Britain , the issue is regarded today mainly as historical .
Margaret Thatcher and Rex Hunt , the Falklands governor when the Argentinians invaded the islands in 1982 , joined 293 others at Lincoln 's Inn in London on June 13 to mark Liberation Day .
Plans are being prepared at the Ministry of Defence and other government departments for a march - past by veterans down Whitehall next year , the 25th anniversary of the war .
But for the Argentinian president , Nestor Kirchner , a Peronist with leftwing leanings , the issue is more than just historical .
He has embarked on a renewed push for the islands and enlisted the support of other left - leaning leaders , from Cuba 's Fidel Castro to Venezuela 's Hugo Chávez .
For Mr Kirchner it is personal as well as political .
He was born in , and became mayor of , the southern Patagonian port of Río Gallegos , a city that sits directly across from the Falklands and from where Argentinian troops embarked for their failed invasion .
" Kirchner views the Malvinas question with a Patagonian eye , a view hardened by the geographic proximity and the war , " according to a Buenos Aires - based political analyst , Rosendo Fraga .
" I do n't think it was Kirchner 's original intention but the sovereignty issue has provided a rallying point to gather left - leaning Latin American governments into an anti- colonial bloc . "
British government officials are privately dismissive , seeing the sudden renewed interest in the islands as little more than a piece of political cynicism , motivated by Mr Kirchner 's drive for re-election next year .
One of the officials said yesterday that about 200 diplomats , journalists , ex-combatants and legislators took part in Thursday 's commission launch " but it contained few surprises , just the usual rhetoric from firebrands about the islands , depicting the UK as the Evil One " .
The British government , while far from alarmed , is expecting the rumbling to continue and become louder as the election draws closer .
Mr Kirchner 's approach represents a marked change in the conciliatory , passive approach that Argentina has been more or less pursuing since the fall of the late dictator General Leopoldo Galtieri in the aftermath of the war .
The strategy of trying to woo the islanders reached its height under the presidency of Mr Kirchner 's predecessor , Carlos Menem : Argentinians still cringe over his decision to mail islanders , as a Christmas present , copies of Winnie the Pooh .
Cooperation between Argentina , Britain and the Falklands has broken down in various areas : fishing agreements , oil exploration , joint scientific cruises and air links between the Falklands and Latin America .
Mr Kirchner succinctly summed up the new approach on April 2 when he spoke at the annual remembrance service for the dead of the 1982 war : " The Malvinas must be a national objective of all Argentinians , and with dialogue , diplomacy and peace we must recover them for our homeland .
But dialogue , diplomacy and peace do not mean we have to live with our head bowed . "
The new mood is reflected in the streets .
The Argentinian war cry Las Malvinas son Argentinas ( the Falklands are Argentinian ) has resurfaced in graffiti and posters round Buenos Aires .
The Malvinas are a matter of wounded pride , not over the calamitous end of the war , which is universally dismissed as the last lunatic act of a floundering dictatorship , but over the original British occupation of the islands in 1833 .
The president is not advocating another bout of war but has ordered his country 's diplomats to pursue the policy more aggressively .
The Argentinian foreign minister , Jorge Taiana , met Kofi Annan , the United Nations secretary general , in New York on June 14 to ask him to intervene to persuade Britain to set out the government 's position clearly in a long statement on June 14 to a special UN committee on independence from colonialism .
He claimed the Malvinas had been inhabited by Argentinian settlers until they were replaced in 1833 by force with a population of British origin .
Rebuffed
He said Argentina had continued to seek an atmosphere favourable to the resumption of negotiations with Britain over sovereignty but had been rebuffed .
Last year alone , he said , Argentina had submitted 15 notes of protest to the UK rejecting what it described as illegitimate acts in the Malvinas , including surveying for hydrocarbons and the granting of licences for the exploration and exploitation of minerals .
" These British unilateral acts also refer to the continued presence and recent upgrading of the British military base in the Malvinas islands , whose operating capacity extends beyond the area illegitimately occupied by the United Kingdom , " he said .
He blamed Britain for the failure to establish direct scheduled air services between the island and the Argentinian mainland , saying Buenos Aires was still awaiting a reply to an Argentinian proposal suggested three years ago .
The most recent point of contention is a British unilateral decision , in an apparent contravention of a joint agreement on conservation of fishing stocks , to extend fishing licences from one year to 25 , he said .
Nicholas Winterton , the Conservative chairman of the all - party parliamentary group on the Falklands , who attended the Lincoln 's Inn reception , is unimpressed by the new Argentinian push .
" Argentina got a bloody nose 25 years ago and similarly I would advise them not to try again , " he said .
Britain deploys 1,200 military personnel to protect the estimated 2,600 islanders , at a cost of £ 110 m a year .
Is it worth it ?
Mr Winterton said it was .
He said that Argentina was historically wrong in claiming the Falklands , the islanders had a right to decide their own future , the islands were important strategically , standing at the gateway to Antarctica and Britain owed them a debt for their participation in both world wars .
" This outweighs the cost , " he said .
Debt
The Foreign Office concurs .
A spokesman said : " The UK will not negotiate on sovereignty unless and until the islanders wish it . "
And the Kelpers , as the islanders are often known , do not wish it .
Robert Rowlands , who lives in the Falklands capital Port Stanley , said discussion of sovereignty will happen " only when the islanders are ready " and that would be " never " .
The islanders said they were unconcerned about the political moves in Argentina .
Sue Buckett , 49 , whose family settled in the Falklands in 1833 , said : " We 've been hearing these sorts of noises since I was a child . "
They complain about bullying tactics by Argentina .
Jan Cheek , a fishing company owner whose squid trawler was detained earlier this year after allegedly entering Argentinian waters , said : " We 'd be happy to have neighbourly relations , but their claims get in the way of that . "
Argentinian government officials dismiss the British government 's claim that Mr Kirchner is using the Malvinas to win re-election , insisting it has been on his agenda before and since the last election .
Backstory
The Falklands have prospered since 1982 , with islanders enjoying the highest per-capita income in South America .
Much of the success is down to commercial fishing , which received a boost when a 150 - mile conservation zone was set up around the islands in 1987 .
Fish stocks are overseen by the South Atlantic Fisheries commission , set up by Britain and Argentina in 1990 .
Wool continues to provide a livelihood for some islanders .
Preliminary exploration in the North Falkland Basin , 150 miles north of the islands , is also raising interest in the islands ' potential as a source of oil .
While the territories continue to be administered by a governor appointed by the Queen , a new constitution in 1985 established an executive council consisting of eight elected officials .

Some of my other projects
Might as well put them here ...
Coherer
The first device to detect radio waves for practical use was a " coherer " .
Developed in the late 1800's , it simply consisted of a tube with two electrodes separated by a loose pile of iron filings .
In its resting state , the coherer provided high resistance to current on the two electrodes .
However , when it was hit with a strong radio wave the resistance drops to a low value .
If the sender and reciever then agreed on a rate of transmission , you 've got all you need to transmit messages through the air .
At the time , the radio wave was supplied by a spark gap transmitter .
I 'd read about these things long ago , and the part I remember most was what happened after the device " cohered " .
To reset it , you 'd have to physically jostle the coherer .
This led to a lot of really interesting inventions to automatically kick the coherer after it activated .
I recently ran across an excellent web page which described how easy it is to make your own coherer : http://home.earthlink.net/~lenyr/coherer.htm
Of course , I had to try one myself .
It took about a half - hour , and worked first time out of the box .
Here 's a picture :
I cut a section of a clear Bic pen for my " glass tube " , and got my pinch of filings by putting an old nail in a vice and working it over with a file .
For my spark gap transmitter , I used the igniter from my rusty and broken gas barbeque .
I have an idea to do an even more twisted and elaborate project based on this .
We 'll see if I can find the time .
Here 's a YouTube video of it working :
Simple Laser Spirograph
I think my wife now regrets giving me a green laser pointer for Christmas a couple of years ago .
It 's a great little gadget - and I 'm constantly shooting it around the house .
I thought it would be fun to try to recreate a laser light show , so I put together a little spirograph machine .
Here 's a video of it :
It looks a lot better in person ( the frame rate of the video camera warps the picture somewhat ) .
One thing I did n't mention in the video clip is that the mirrors have to be slightly off - perpendicular to the motor shaft .
It turns out this is very easy to do ( and in fact , it would be a bit harder to get them perfectly perpendicular ) .
I attached the mirrors using double - sided foam tape , and it was irregular enough to give me all the offset I needed .
I doubt I 'll ever get around to it , but the next steps would be to add a mount for the laser and an additional mirror attached to a speaker cone .
Oh , and of course , then turn off the lights and play " Dark Side of the Moon " .
Pong game
A few years ago I picked up an AY - 3- 8500 " pong - on - a- chip " device on eBay .
It made for a quick weekend project .
With a few simple components , I was able to show the kids what a real video game was like .
Will was almost impressed .
Here are some pictures :
And here is a video of it in action :
Dekatron spinner # 2
The first dekatron spinner I built was based on plans at Mike 's Electric Stuff page .
It spun pretty fast , at a fixed rate based on the 60 Hz line frequency .
I donated that spinner to Transmeta when I left in 2002 .
I recently decided to build another spinner - but this time with variable speed .
For the power supply I 'm using a 5V florescent tube driver , which allows me to even run the thing off of batteries .
Besides the florescent driver , the spinner is quite simple inside : a 555 timer for the pulses , feeding into a 4017 to drive the MPSA42's that ground the common cathodes , guide 1s and guide 2s in sequence .
I route the control signals for guides 1 and 2 through a switch to add the ability to reverse directions .
The unloaded output of the florescent driver is about 700 volts , which I drop through 4 1 M ohm resisters before powering the dekatron 's anode .
I 'm pleased with the way the enclosure worked out .
I printed on Avery transparent full - page label stock and then overlaid the enclosure top .
The big holes were cut with a nibbler .
The other holes were made with a hand drill ( and the bit walked when doing the direction switch :-( - got to get a drill press one of these days ) .
Overall , it was a weekend afternoon project .
I have enough parts to do another one , so I 'm going to give this one away in my work group 's holiday gift exchange .
Crystal Radio
I do n't think it 's possible to qualify as a nerd without having built a crystal radio .
I did build a few as a kid - but only from a kit and I never really knew what I was doing .
Still do n't , but am a bit closer .
Anyway , this project started when I was surfing eBay a few years ago and ran across a listing for an old radio crystal in a little round tin .
It 's what a kid in the 30's would have sent away for mail order if he wanted to build a radio .
It contained a " guaranteed galenium crystal " .
Could n't pass up trying to replay that pre-transistor experience , so I bid high and won the auction .
Next step was finding a book or instructions that would have been used by that 1930 's kid .
What I came up with was the " Boy 's First Book of Radio and Electronics " .
It was actually a bit later than the 30's , but was just what I was looking for .
While searching the web for crystal radio stuff , I found The Xtal Society - you need go no further than this , it 's a fantastic resource .
There I was able to purchase a couple of air - variable capacitors , and though another contact some excellent 1918 headphones .
I built my radio on the outside lid of an old telephone ringer box .
The idea was to have the radio on the outside of the box , and store the headphones inside .
It worked out well - radio mounted on the wall , and held the headphones .
For the hardware , I used some parts salvaged from an old Wheatstone bridge .
The knife switch selected between by eBay crystal and a modern diode .
As it turned out , the modern diode was only marginally better than the crystal .
I wound the coil around a dowel , spinning it with a cordless drill .
The final part of the project was to string an antenna .
I ran a single copper wire in the inside of my attic .
I 'm not especially happy with that - at some point I think I 'll do a longer one wrapped around the eaves of my roof .
The radio works pretty well , though I do get a bit swamped by a nearby San Francisco station .
Or at least the radio did work well .
One of the kids mushed the blades of one of the air - variable capacitors together , shorting it out , and I had to unmount the radio from the wall during a recent kitchen remodel .
One of these days I 'll order a new one from the Xtal society and get it going again - perhaps with that improved antenna .
Monica 's Dekadog Kitchen Timer
While questing to build a Nixie tube clock , I ran across references to Dekatron tubes and thought they looked pretty cool .
I added " Dekatron " to my Ebay standard searches , and in the summer of 1999 ( or 2000 ) a preset counter showed up for auction .
I had to have it , and did ( for about $ 50 ) .
A preset counter is a piece of industrial equipment that counts electronic pulses .
When the count equals the number preset via front - panel knobs , a relay is thrown .
These were used for things like controlling the number of turns of wire that went on a spool - really anything on the factory floor that needed counting .
This particular counter used Dekatron tubes as the counter elements .
If you hit them with the right wave patterns , it will make the neon glow bounce from one pin to the next .
It 's set up to normally bounce three pins for each input signal .
With 30 pins , that allows you to count to 10 .
It then uses old vacuum tube triodes to generate the carry into the next tube .
With 3 tubes , it can count from 0 to 999 .
When the counter arrived , it did n't take long to see that it worked perfectly .
I found that I needed to send it an AC wave to count ( and used my old Heathkit breadboard for the signal ) .
The real issue , after I played with it for awhile , was figuring out what to do with it .
My wife had been teasing me a bit about my toys , and had hinted that the exceedingly important work that I was doing had no useful point .
Heresy !
So , to prove her wrong , I decided to convert the preset counter into a kitchen timer .
It 's pretty simple , really .
I built a little box with a 1
Mhz crystal and a series of dividers to give me time bases of 1 minute , 10 seconds , 1 second , .1 seconds , .01 seconds and .001 seconds ( the later important - you never know when you need to cook that toast for an additional .034 seconds ) .
I fed the basic square wave signals into a Max 232 device to give me a - 10 to +10 voltage swing and ran that into the preset counter 's input .
For the alarm device , I originally planned on getting one of those toy monkeys with cymbals and drums .
However , at the toy store I found a couple of little irritating barking dogs that resembled our irritating real dogs ( a golden and black & white Aussie ) .
I had to go with those .
So , for controls it has three toggle switches : start / stop ( controls the pulses ) , timer / freerun ( to give me a mode where I can just watch the lights cycles ) and quiet / annoying ( to control the alarm ) .
To encourage Monica to actually use it , I also went through the house and collected all of the existing kitchen timers , and threw them away .
Fortunately , Monica is a very good sport and actually uses the silly thing .
Here 's a little video of it running
Scope Clock
The scope clock is a very cool kit project designed by David Forbes at http://www.cathodecorner.com.
I heard about it from a posting David made to the Greenkeys teletype enthusiast mailing list , and ordered one of the first kits .
However , it took me a couple of years to get around to putting it together .
Nixie Tube Clock # 1 and Dekatron spinner
This is the first Nixie tube clock I built .
It 's done inside an old ammeter case , and looks a lot better in person than in the picture .
I used a couple of rotary switches to set the time .
The left one selects the digit , and the right sets the value .
When the left - most switch is at the 12:00 position , it puts the clock into run mode .
I thought it would be easier this way , but in retrospect it really is n't .
The Nixies are powered by running a couple of transformers back to back with secondaries connected to give me ~ 165 volts .
A bit low , but it was enough to light the tubes .
One of these days I hope to get around to replacing that with a more modern switching supply ( like I used in my 2nd clock , below ) .
I originally designed the clock to take its clock source from the 60 hz line input , but my circuit design was faulty .
I ended up just stuffing in a clock chip with a 1 second output pulse .
Inelegant , but it works .
To the left of the clock is a dekatron spinner I built , using the circuit from Mike 's Electric Stuff page .
Combo Nixie Tube / Dekatron Clock
This is a collage of photos of my combo Nixie tube / Dekatron clock .
I keep this one at my office at work , and am quite pleased with it .
The six nixies along the top give the time , and the three dekatrons on the bottom spin at 100 , 10 and 1 HZ , reversing directions every 30 seconds .
I used a switching power supply for the Nixies , and voltage multipliers for the dekatron .
The time base is a 1 MHZ crystal , with dividers to give 100 HZ .
Everything is controlled by a Basic Stamp IIx microcontroller ( which was just barely fast enough ) .
Here 's a quick ( and fuzzy ) video of it running :
Ultrasonic Rangefinder
Pretty simple , but slick - I built a ultrasonic rangefinder using the guts of a Polaroid camera .
All of the hard work is done by the ultrasonic rangefinder module .
All I had to do was arrange for the proper power supply , connect it to a microcontroller to time how long it took the echo to come back , convert time to distance and display it on a LCD display .
Cosmac Elf
Here 's my Elf , with the video enhancement displaying the famous Star Trek screen ( note the lower screenshot on the leftmost Popular Electronics magazine ) .
A closer - look at the computer .
You have to enter programs by flipping toggle switches .
I 'll have to confess that it gets old fast .
PDP - 8 clone
This was a fun project - a PDP - 8 clone built using the Intersil 6120 " PDP - 8 on a chip " device .
The computer was designed by Bob Armstrong , at http://www.sparetimegizmos.com.
He posted about it to a computer collector mailing list and a bunch of us expressed interest .
Bob had board made and programmable devices programmed and we all went to town .
I customized mine a bit by making it battery powered .
It uses a sealed lead / acid battery , and can run for five or six hours .
Note that after this above picture was taken , I straightened out the row of LEDs ( and vowed to use a drill press the next time I need to do a straight line of holes ) .
The little computer works great .
I talk to is using Kermit 95 , and have had a great time playing the original adventure and experimenting with FOCAL - 69 .
It runs images of the original DEC PDP - 8 software .
For more info , check out Bob 's 6120 page : http://www.sparetimegizmos.com/Hardware/SBC6120-2.htm.
512 Kbyte RAM disk for TRS - 80 Model 1
My first big electronics project , this as a 512 Kbyte RAM disk for my TRS - 80 Model 1 .
It 's pretty simple now , though at the time I thought it complex .
It 's just a bank of 32Kx8 SRAMS with some latches and addressing glue .
A cool feature are the hex displays I added to show which 256 - byte sector is currently being addressed .
I highly recommend blinky lights for any electronic project .
The board 's memory can only be addressed in 256 - byte chunks , relying on the Z80's INIR and OUTIR instructions .
I also wrote a RAM disk driver , based on some existing code .
It works great - and provided an astonishing speedup to my old Model 1 .
Silly EEPROM programmer
This is a completely silly and useless project , though I was pleased with the way it looked .
For a long time I wanted to build an EPROM programmer , as a prelude to building a Z80 computer .
Being ignorant of even basic electronics , though , I never could understand the schematics of hobbyist programmers to the point that I could build my own .
When EEPROMs came along , though , I figured I could handle that - so build built this simple programmer .
Note that you have to toggle in every address and data value .
Completely unusable .
Model 20 Teletype
I grew up in a newspaper office , to the sound of old mechanical teletype machines .
A few years ago , I decided I needed to hear that sound again and eventually tracked down a Teletype Model 20 - just like we used to have at the newspaper .
After building a rs232 to 60 ma loop current converter ( actually 2 - one of my design which later failed , and a good one designed by Gil Smith ) I wrote a control program in Perl .
I have a website devoted to that project :
http://www.buzbee.net/heavymetal
Here 's a video of the machine running .
Translation of leaf from 1557 Latin book
Back when I had way too much free time on my hands , I got interested in old printing .
I began collecting very old books ( mostly from the early 1500s ) .
While visiting a book dealer in San Jose in 1992 , he handed me a stack of individual leaves to flip through .
I ended up buying three or four - mostly incunabula ( pre 1500 ) , and a leaf from Shakespeare 's 2nd folio .
There was also a single page from an unknown book with really cool woodcuts .
One in particular was clearly a comet .
I later identified the leaf as being from Lycosthenes ' Prodigiorum ac Ostentorum Chronicon - or " Portents and Omens , " published in 1557 .
It was a book listing natural phenomena from the beginning of recorded history .
The language was Latin , and because I had a bit of Latin in college I thought it would be fun to try to translate my leaf .
That lead to a quite interesting adventure , and really showed me the power of the emerging internet .
In the summer of 1992 , I posted to the sci.astro newsgroup for help .
The words describing the comet gave a date , and I thought it was likely that someone had computed comets back in time .
I was hoping for a match .
I got great responses ( including corrections to my faulty translation ) and was referred to several texts .
I was excited to discover that my page 's comet was actually the AD 761 visit of Halley 's comet .
Way cool .
I constructed my translation using PageMaker and scans of the woodcuts from the original .
One thing that impressed me was how well modern font sizes and styles mapped to those used half a millennium ago .
No need to change what works .
A few years later , I located a complete copy of Prodigiorun ac Ostentorum at an antiquarian book fair in Los ' Angeles .
It 's the highlight of my collection .
TRS - 80 Software : Pascal Compiler , Lisp interpreter , Threaded Interpreted Language ( FORTH )
I taught myself to program using my TRS - 80 model 1 in 1980 ( and later learned how to do it right ... ) .
I had a particular interest in computer languages , and over time wrote several language tools for my Model 1 .
The most elaborate was my Pascal compiler .
It was n't a complete Pascal ( no floating point ) , but it did include a number of enhancements such as structured constants .
The compiler itself was written in that variant of Pascal , and eventually the compiler was able to compile itself .
Note that it did this using appx 40 K bytes of memory - and that included both the compiler code and heap used .
I still have a working TRS - 80 , but the programs I wrote can be easily run using any of the fantastic TRS - 80 simulators available today [ TBD - put code / source / simulator links here ]
Besides the Pascal compiler , I wrote a Lisp interpreter .
It was done entirely in assembly language , and I used it to explore garbage collection techniques .
It did a fairly simple reference count scheme , with periodic mark and sweep .
The main feature was arbitrary precision integer arithmetic .
I got a kick out of generating large factorials .
It could do appx .
2000 ! before it ran out of memory .
I also wrote a Forth - like language based on an old Byte magazine book " Threaded Interpretive Languages " .
Big fun , and I still have a fascination for Forth - like languages .
Model Ship
I 've always been impressed by well - done ship models .
I thought it was time I gave it a shot , and picked out a large and elaborate model kit .
Fortunately for me , I let the guy at the hobby shop talk me into trying something a little easier for a first attempt .
This was a Midwest Chesapeake Bay Skipjack kit , and I highly recommend it for a first - time modeler .
It was sufficiently challenging to be interesting , but easy enough to avoid first - timer 's frustration .
I also took the liberty of do a bit of customization , building benches out of left - over planking .
I gave the model to my folks for Christmas a few years ago , and since then a chunk of it has fallen off .
I 'll have to bring some glue the next time I venture back to Kansas .
I put a lot of effort into the little details .
Click on these photos to get huge blow - ups and see if you can tell it 's a model .
I think it turned out well ( other than getting the waterline paint wrong ... ) .
If I ever finish Magic - 1 , I plan on trying a much more difficult one .
LCC retargeting for D16 / M homebrew computer
Recently , John Doran put together a web site with details of his homebrew machine , D16/ M .
While looking over the instruction set , it occurred to me that it might not be that difficult to retarget LCC to it .
LCC is a nice full ANSI C compiler designed to be easily retargeted .
For the most part it is , particularly if your target happens to look like a classic RISC machine with an orthogonal instruction set architecture .
D16 / M is quite different that than - it's a 16 - bit accumulator machine , and addresses memory as an array of 16 - bit words .
To get LCC to work , I told it that D16 / M's char , short , int , long int , pointer , float and double types were all 1 byte wide .
Additionally , I changed a bunch of places in LCC 's source code that had a hard - wired assumption that a byte is 8 bits wide .
Instead , I added a field in the interface record to allow a target to specify how wide a byte ( i.e. - minimum unit of addressability ) is .
For D16 / M , it is 16 , for others 8 .
The result of this is that D16 / M will have 16 - bit ints and chars .
It could easily be extended to support 32 - bit ints & floats and 64 - bit doubles .
The second big trick was to lie to LCC and tell it that D16 / M had 8 integer registers and 8 floating point registers .
In truth , these were simply fixed memory locations .
Amazingly , it all seems to work .
For you LCC retargeters out there , here 's the .md file to see what I did .
Email me if you 'd like more info on the byte width modifications .
As a rule , out - of - work men are less educated than the population as a whole .
Their numbers have grown sharply among black men and men who live in hard - hit industrial areas like Michigan , West Virginia and upstate New York , as well as those who live in rural states like Mississippi and Oklahoma .
The missing men are also more likely to live alone .
Nearly 60 percent are divorced , separated , widowed or never married , up from 50 percent a decade earlier , the Census Bureau reports .
Sometimes women who are working throw out men who are not , says Kathryn Edin , a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania .
In any case , without a household to support , there is less pressure to work , and for men who fall behind on support payments , an incentive exists to work off the books — hiding employment — so that wages cannot be garnisheed .
“ What happens to a lot of guys who become unmoored from family life , they become unmoored from everything , ” Ms. Edin said .
“ They are just living without attachments and by the time they are 40 or 50 years old , the things that kept these men from falling away — family and community life — are gone . ”
Even as more men are dropping out of the work force , more women are entering it .
This change has occurred partly because employment has shrunk in industries where men predominated , like manufacturing , while fields where women are far more common , like teaching , health care and retailing , have grown .
Today , about 73 percent of women between 30 and 54 have a job , compared with 45 percent in the mid-1960 ’s , according to an analysis of Census data by researchers at Queens College .
Many women without jobs are raising children at home , while men who are out of a job tend to be doing neither family work nor paid work .
Women are also making inroads in fields where they were once excluded — as lawyers and doctors , for example , and on Wall Street .
Men still make significantly more money than women , but as women become more educated than men , even more men may end up out of the work force .
At the low end of the spectrum , men emerging from prison with felony records are not easily absorbed into steady employment .
Hundreds of thousands of young men were jailed in the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s , in a surge of convictions for drug - related crimes .
As prisoners , they were not counted in the employment data ; as ex-prisoners they are .
They are now being freed in their 30’s and 40’s and are struggling to be hired .
Roughly two million men in this group have prison records , according to a calculation by Richard Freeman and Harry J. Holzer , labor economists at Harvard and the Urban Institute , respectively .
Many of these men do not find work because of their records .
Despite their great numbers , many of the men not working are missing from the nation ’s best - known statistic on unemployment .
The jobless rate is now a low 4.6 percent , yet that number excludes most of the missing men , because they have stopped looking for work and are therefore not considered officially unemployed .
That makes the unemployment rate a far less useful measure of the country ’s well - being than it once was .
Teenagers take less account than adults of people 's feelings and , often , even fail to think about their own , according to a UCL neuroscientist .
The results , presented at the BA Festival of Science today , show that teenagers hardly use the area of the brain that is involved in thinking about other people 's emotions and thoughts , when considering a course of action .
Many areas of the brain alter dramatically during adolescence .
One area in development well beyond the teenage years is the medial prefrontal cortex , a large region at the front of the brain associated with higher - level thinking , empathy , guilt and understanding other people 's motivations .
Scientists have now found that , when making decisions about what action to take , the medial prefrontal cortex is under - used by teenagers .
Instead , a posterior area of the brain , involved in perceiving and imagining actions , takes over .
Dr. Sarah - Jayne Blakemore of the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience , giving the BA Festival 's BAYS lecture , said : " Thinking strategies change with age .
As you get older you use more or less the same brain network to make decisions about your actions as you did when you were a teenager , but the crucial difference is that the distribution of that brain activity shifts from the back of the brain ( when you are a teenager ) to the front ( when you are an adult ) .
" The fact that teenagers underuse the medial pre-frontal cortex when making decisions about what to do , implies that they are less likely to think about how they themselves and how other people will feel as a result of their intended action .
" We think that a teenager 's judgement of what they would do in a given situation is driven by the simple question : ' What would I do ? '.
Adults , on the other hand , ask : ' What would I do , given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions ? '
The fact that teenagers use a different area of the brain than adults when considering what to do suggests they may think less about the impact of their actions on other people and how they are likely to make other people feel . "
In the study , teenagers and adults were asked questions about the actions they would take in a given situation while their brains were being scanned using fMRI .
For example , ' You are at the cinema and have trouble seeing the screen .
Do you move to another seat ? '
A second set of questions asked what they would expect to happen as a result of a natural event eg .
' A huge tree comes crashing down in a forest .
Does it make a loud noise ?'
Although teenagers and adults chose similar responses , the medial pre-frontal cortex was significantly more active in adults than in teenagers when questioned about their intended actions .
Teenagers , on the other hand , activated the posterior area of the brain known as the superior temporal sulcus - an area that 's involved in predicting future actions based on past actions .
While children start to think about other people 's mental states at around age five , this new data shows that the neural basis of this ability continues to develop and mature well past early childhood .
A second piece of research presented at the festival shows that teenagers are also less adept at taking someone else 's perspective and deciding how they would feel in another person 's shoes .
Participants aged eight to 36 years were asked how they would feel and how they would expect someone else to feel in a series of situations .
Adults were far quicker than teenagers at judging emotional reactions - both how they would feel and how a third party might feel in a given situation .
For example , " How would you feel if you were not allowed to go to your best friend 's party ? " or ' A girl has just had an argument with her best friend .
How does she feel ? "
Dr. Blakemore said : " It seems that adults might be better at putting themselves in other people 's mental shoes and thinking about the emotional impact of actions - but further analysis is required .
The relative difficulty that teenagers have could be down to them using a different strategy when trying to understand someone else 's perspective , perhaps because the relevant part of the brain is still developing .
The other factor to consider is that adults have had much more social experience . "
" Whatever the reasons , it is clear that teenagers are dealing with , not only massive hormonal shifts , but also substantial neural changes .
These changes do not happen gradually and steadily between the ages of 0 - 18 .
They come on in great spurts and puberty is one of the most dramatic developmental stages . "

Phytoplankton are microscopic marine plants that drift on or near the surface of the sea , by far the most abundant type of life found in the ocean .
Just like plants on land they employ green - pigmented chlorophyll for photosynthesis - the process of turning sunlight into chemical energy .
While individually microscopic , phytoplankton chlorophyll collectively tints the surrounding ocean waters , providing a means of detecting these tiny organisms from space with dedicated ' ocean colour ' sensors .
As if dye had been placed in the water , the greenish colour highlights whirls of ocean currents .
Floating freely in the water , phytoplankton are sensitive not just to available sunlight but also to local environmental variations such as nutrient levels , temperature , currents and winds .
Favourable conditions lead to concentrated ' blooms ' like the one we see here .
Monitoring phytoplankton is important because they form the base of the marine food web – sometimes known as ' the grass of the sea ' .
On a local level , out - of - control blooms can devastate marine life , de-oxygenating whole stretches of water , while some species of phytoplankton and marine algae are toxic to both fish and humans .
It is useful that fishermen , fish farmers and public health officials know about such events as soon as possible .
Globally , phytoplankton are a major influence on the amount of carbon in the atmosphere , and hence need to be modelled into calculations of future climate change .
Such blooms are common at this time of year in the Baltic Sea due to the combination of warm weather and waters rich in phosphorous nutrients .
This phosphorous comes from the sea floor , having been released for surface layer phytoplankton to consume when autumn and winter storms mix the water mass – at the start of 2005 a severe storm caused mixing in a deep column of water .
The bloom seen here stretches around 200 kilometres from Lithuania , Latvia and the Russian territory of Kalingrad to the Swedish coast , surrounding the Swedish islands of Gotland and Öland .
Blooms in the Baltic Sea are routinely monitored by the Finnish Environmental Institute ( SYKE ) .

HAMAS , the Islamic fundamentalist movement that pulled off a stunning victory in last week 's parliamentary election , sweeping aside Fatah 's decades - long dominance of Palestinian politics , first came to public notice in the summer of 1988 .
That was when it challenged the secular leadership of the first intifada against Israeli control in the West Bank and Gaza .
Founded in Gaza the year before , the group is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood , which began in Egypt in 1928 with the slogan " The Koran Is Our Constitution . "
An acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement , Hamas is also the Arabic word for " zeal . "
From the start , the group has been a wild card in the Palestinian - Israeli conflict .
In the early years , Israeli authorities appeared to tolerate Hamas in the hope that it would be a counterweight to Yasir Arafat 's leadership .
After the Israelis and Palestine Liberation Organization reconciled themselves to the terms of the Oslo Accords in 1993 , Hamas continued to reject efforts to negotiate peace with Israel , and its attacks on Israeli civilians , particularly suicide bombings , helped stymie progress toward a final settlement .
IN 1965 few people outside Silicon Valley had heard of Gordon Moore .
For that matter , no one at all had heard of Silicon Valley .
The name did not exist and the orchards of Santa Clara county still brought forth apples , not Macintoshes .
But Mr Moore could already discern the outlines .
For 1965 was the year when he published the paper that gave birth to his famous “ law ” that the power of computers , as measured by the number of transistors that could be fitted on a silicon chip , would double every 18 months or so .
Four decades later , equally few people have heard of Rob Carlson .
Dr Carlson is a researcher at the University of Washington , and some graphs of the growing efficiency of DNA synthesis that he drew a few years ago look suspiciously like the biological equivalent of Moore 's law .
By the end of the decade their practical upshot will , if they continue to hold true , be the power to synthesise a string of DNA the size of a human genome in a day .
At the moment , what passes for genetic engineering is mere pottering .
It means moving genes one at a time from species to species so that bacteria can produce human proteins that are useful as drugs , and crops can produce bacterial proteins that are useful as insecticides .
True engineering would involve more radical redesigns .
But the Carlson curve ( Dr Carlson disavows the name , but that may not stop it from sticking ) is making that possible .
In the short run such engineering means assembling genes from different organisms to create new metabolic pathways or even new organisms .
In the long run it might involve re-writing the genetic code altogether , to create things that are beyond the range of existing biology .
These are enterprises far more worthy of the name of genetic engineering than today 's tinkering .
But since that name is taken , the field 's pioneers have had to come up with a new one .
They have dubbed their fledgling discipline “ synthetic biology ” .
Truly intelligent design
One of synthetic biology 's most radical spirits is Drew Endy .
Dr Endy , who works at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , came to the subject from engineering , not biology .
As an engineer , he can recognise a kludge when he sees one .
And life , in his opinion , is a kludge .
No intelligent designer would have put the genomes of living organisms together in the way that evolution has .
Some parts overlap , meaning that they cannot change jobs independently of one another .
Others have lost their function but have not been removed , so they simply clutter things up .
And there is no sense of organisation or hierarchy .
That is because , unlike an engineer , evolution cannot go back to the drawing board , it can merely play with what already exists .
Biologists , who seek merely to understand how life works , accept this .
Engineers such as Dr Endy , who wish to change the way it works , do not .
They want to start again .
So Dr Endy has developed an idea invented by Tom Knight , one of his colleagues at MIT .
Dr Knight calls the idea “ BioBricks ” .
His inspiration was a children 's toy called Lego .
What makes Lego successful is that any part can attach to any other via a universal connector .
A BioBrick is a strand of DNA that has universal connectors at each end .
BioBricks can thus be linked together to form higher - level components and also joined into the DNA of a cell so that they can control its activity .
Dr Endy likes BioBricks because they promise the synthetic biologist the standardised set of parts that has been one of the advantages enjoyed by the electronic engineers behind Moore 's law .
If an engineer wants a particular component for a job , he can go to a catalogue , find a widget with the right parameters and order it from a supplier .
He does not have to design it himself .
He does not even have to know how it works .
Dr Endy thinks BioBricks can put biologists in the same position .
The DNA of a BioBrick contains a combination of genes that acts as a standardised component .
When translated into protein in a cell , it makes that cell do something — and that something is often more than just “ make more of protein X ” .
In particular , Dr Endy is interested in switches and control systems that regulate other genes .
Such switches are the basis of electronics and he hopes they may one day become the basis of an industrialised synthetic biology .
At the moment , BioBricks , like Lego , are still a toy .
They have been used for proof - of - principle studies such as taking photographs with films made of modified bacteria , but not yet for serious applications .
But there are a lot of them around — many in the public domain at MIT 's Registry of Standard Biological Parts .
Such “ open wetware ” is one reason for the emergence of biohacking ( see article ) .
Whether BioBricks will come to dominate the field remains to be seen .
One difficulty they face is the cussed tendency of biological things to evolve .
An electronic component , once designed , can be turned out reliably in a factory .
BioBricks are bred , rather than made , and that introduces scope for error .
Meanwhile , other researchers are content to work with things that more closely resemble natural components , although they still assemble them in unconventional ways .
A new synthesis
One of the leading proponents of this method is Jay Keasling , of the University of California , Berkeley , who also believes that synthetic biology will ultimately need standard , well - characterised parts if it is to thrive .
But he is trying to get there via a practical project , rather than by generating lots of components and waiting for others to think of what to do with them .
Dr Keasling 's project is to do biologically what no chemist has yet managed to accomplish — to synthesise an antimalarial drug called artemisinin cheaply .
At the moment , artemisinin is a herbal remedy .
It is extracted from Artemisia annua , a type of wormwood , and the best source is in China .
Making artemisinin by standard chemistry requires so many steps that it is impractical .
So Dr Keasling persuaded the Gates Foundation to back his idea for doing the job using synthetic biology .
For this , he has built a metabolic pathway in yeast cells that synthesises a chemical called artemisinic acid which chemists can easily convert into artemisinin .
Some of the genes to do this have come from Artemisia , but others have been created from other sources .
Dr Keasling 's project is not the only one to lay down artificial metabolic pathways .
One goal of synthetic biology is to make what is known as cellulosic ethanol .
At the moment , ethanol — whether for wine , beer or fuel — is made by fermenting sugar or starch .
But even in crops such as sugar cane and maize , which have been bred for their high yields , a lot of the plant is wasted .
Although yeast cannot digest cellulose or lignin , the molecules that form a plant 's skeleton , some bacteria and other species of fungi are able to do the job .
Identifying the genes for the enzymes that do this , modifying them and assembling them into new pathways would produce systems that could digest the whole plant and turn it into ethanol .
Nancy
Ho , of Purdue University , in Indiana , has already worked out a way to enable yeast cells to ferment the sugars produced by breaking down cellulose — which natural yeast cannot do .
This is important stuff .
Cellulosic ethanol is the great hope of many environmentalists since its carbon , unlike that in fossil fuels , comes from the atmosphere and thus cannot make a net contribution to global warming when it returns there .
The ultimate proof of the success of synthetic biology , though , would be not merely an artificial metabolic pathway , but an artificial organism .
That is the goal of Craig Venter .
Dr Venter , the man who first sequenced the entire genome of a living creature ( a bacterium ) and then went on to run a private - enterprise rival to the publicly funded Human Genome Project , has re-invented himself again .
This time he is synthesising genomes , rather than analysing them .
Three years ago he made the first viable synthetic virus from off - the - shelf chemicals .
( It is a parasite of bacteria , not humans . )
Now he has a bacterial genome in his sights .
To make the task easier , Dr Venter is first creating what he and Hamilton Smith , his collaborator at the Venter Institute in Rockville , Maryland , call the minimal genome .
This is a stripped - down bacterial genome that contains the smallest set of genes consistent with life in the cushy environment of a laboratory .
Such a genome would have several advantages for synthetic biologists .
First , being small , it would be easier to make .
Second , it would not survive in the big , bad world outside the laboratory , should it chance to escape .
Third , it would not dissipate its biochemical effort on non-essential tasks .
That means it could be used as a platform on which to bolt commercially useful pathways .
According to Dr Venter , the raw materials for those pathways are abundant .
As he observes , half the mass of living organisms on the planet is made of bacteria and these bacteria are divided into zillions of species with countless unidentified genes .
For the past couple of years he has been sampling the oceans and collecting bacterial genes .
He has identified about 6 m .
Among them are , for example , 20,000 genes for hydrogen - metabolising proteins .
That is of particular interest , since Dr Venter sees synthetic biology as a source of new energy - generating technologies — and he has the backing of America 's Department of Energy to prove the point .
He has also found numerous genes for versions of rhodopsin .
In vertebrates this protein is found in retinal cells , where it transduces the energy of light into a nerve signal to the brain .
What it is doing in so many bacteria is not known , though one possibility is signalling how deep they are in the ocean as a consequence of how dark it is .
Whatever the cause , the energy conversion that rhodopsin brings about is also of interest .
It 's life , Jim , but not as we know it
Dr Venter reckons he will be able to synthesise a working bacterial genome from scratch within two years .
More complex genomes , of the sort that make plants , animals and fungi , will take longer .
But they , he thinks , should be possible within a decade .
Even this definitive erasure of the distinction between the living and non-living worlds is not , however , the most radical idea in synthetic biology .
Some people want to go beyond the toolkit that evolution has provided and create biological systems that work with a chemistry that is not found in natural living things .
Biology 's operating system relies on two sorts of molecule : nucleic acids and amino acids .
Nucleic acids ( DNA and its cousin , RNA ) act as information stores .
The information they store is how to assemble amino acids into proteins , which are chains of linked amino acids .
Proteins then go on to do the work of sustaining life .
They manufacture other sorts of biological molecules , such as fats and sugars .
They process energy .
They provide structural support for cells .
One of the recurrent principles of evolution is “ if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it ” .
That is why the kludges Dr Endy is trying to eliminate have endured across the millennia .
Once the nucleic acid-amino acid operating system came into existence it could never be “ fixed ” into anything else by evolution , because the immediate consequences would have been so serious .
But that does not mean it cannot be changed by an intelligent designer , and a number of such people are looking into how this might be done .
One obvious improvement would be to increase the number of amino acids that can be assembled into proteins .
At the moment only 20 are used routinely in biology , but chemists can make thousands of others .
Proteins containing those “ non-biological ” amino acids would have novel properties , and some of those properties might be useful .
That , at least , is the thinking behind the attempt by Lei Wang , of the Salk Institute in La Jolla , California , to extend the amino - acid parts set .
Dr Wang 's starting point is the redundancy of the genetic code used by nucleic acids .
This code is spelled out in the genetic “ letters ” A , C , G and T , which correspond to chemical sub-units of nucleic acids .
The letters are grouped into three - letter “ words ” known as codons , meaning that there are 64 of them .
All but three of the codons correspond to particular amino acids , and the order of the codons in the nucleic acid corresponds to the order of the amino acids in the protein .
The remaining three are signals that the protein is complete .
But , with more codons than amino acids , many amino acids have more than one codon to describe them .
There is also a superfluity of stop signals .
Dr Wang has managed to reassign one of the stop codons in E. coli , the bacterial workhorse of geneticists , to recognise an unnatural amino acid .
This can now be incorporated into proteins made by the bacterium .
Peter Carr of MIT and Farren Isaacs of Harvard Medical School have an even more ambitious plan .
They intend to recode E. coli completely , eliminating the redundant codons .
They have settled on one codon for each natural amino acid and one for the stop signal and plan to go through the bacterium 's entire genome replacing alternative codons with their chosen ones .
The idea is that the cleaned up bacterium will be more efficient .
That remains to be seen ; natural selection has been working on E. coli for a long time , so whether two intelligent designers can do a better job is questionable .
But if their new bacterium is at least viable , it will have 43 codons that can be re-assigned to other tasks .
The debate evolves
Where all this will lead is anybody 's guess .
But synthetic biologists themselves are aware of the risks .
The most obvious is that somebody , whether a malicious biohacker or a political terrorist , will do something deliberately nasty .
The other risk is that something will escape accidentally .
No technology is risk free , but synthetic biology has the twist that its mistakes can breed .
Today the risks are not great .
As David Baltimore , the president of the California Institute of Technology , observes , “ nature is a very tough critic ” .
Any organism modified in a laboratory is unlikely to make it in the outside world in competition with creatures toughened up by natural selection .
Nevertheless , as knowledge increases , so will the risk that something truly nasty might be unleashed .
To avoid that and the opposite problem of hasty legislation to curb their activities , researchers are trying to get their retaliations in first by promoting public debate .
Their historical model is the Asilomar conference of 1975 , when the first biotechnologists met to agree on self - denying ordinances that went a long way towards establishing their credentials as responsible and trustworthy people .
Despite initial fears , biotechnology has not , up to now , caused any serious problems .
A recent meeting of biosynthesists in Berkeley issued a discussion document ; the Sloan Foundation has paid for a report , coming out soon , on the risks and social implications of synthetic biology .
So far , perhaps surprisingly , the wider public has shown little interest .
Perhaps it should .

Browsers , phishing , and user interface design
Scott Granneman
Phishing works for so many reasons , we need to rethink browser and user interface design to provide some real - life security to the average user who does n't see or understand the security cues .
 Answer me this truthfully : do you really trust Aunt Sally or Steve in Accounting or your kid sister Brooke to carefully read an anti-phishing warning , ponder the ramifications , and then make a wise choice ?
If you answer in the affirmative , then you have n't read Why Phishing Works . 
Scott Granneman Legs Diamond , Lucky Luciano ,
And then , on the other end of the scale , today we have the phishers .
Scumbags of the Web ,
If you have n't read
Basically , the researchers sat a variety of folks down and had them use some web sites .
Some were fakes created by the team , and some were not .
After watching what the participants did with the web sites , the researchers quizzed the users as to the motivations for their behaviors .
The results are eye - opening , to say the least .
Here 's some of the scarier things I learned from " Why Phishing Works " .
Think that cues in the browser will help ?
Forget it .
When Firefox 1.0 came out , I thought it was a major benefit that the background color of the address bar changed to gold when you were on a site using HTTPS .
" How cool ! " I remember saying to a friend , " In addition to the gold lock , the entire address bar is gold too .
That 'll make it even more obvious to people that they 're on a secure site ! "
And that was in addition to the other three indicators that Firefox provides .
How utterly naive of me .
In the study by Dhamija et al. , 23 % of the users do n't even look at cues provided by the web browser , such as the address or status bars .
Many have no idea what the padlock icon means ; in fact , one participant confidently asserted that the padlock indicates that the web site can't set cookies .
Instead of browser cues , these people look at the web page itself .
Does it " look " and " feel " right ?
Are there VeriSign logos on the page ?
How about animations ?
Does it seem authoritative ?
In some cases , the padlock icon on the web page itself was enough to convince some that the site was safe , more so than if the padlock was in the browser 's chrome .
URLs do n't work with everyone either

It 's incredibly easy to fool people
I was astonished to read - which again shows my naiveté - that some of the people tested in the study were not only unaware of the term " phishing , " but were also surprised that anyone would even engage in such criminal behavior in the first place .
In the face of such ignorance , it 's no surprise that phishing works .
Others might be aware of phishing , but either ignored or were unsure how to use the various cues provided by the web browsers .
This is n't exactly surprising when you consider that they were asked by the browser to " Accept this certificate temporarily for this session . "
Would your uncle or grandma know what a " certificate " is ?
How about a " session " ?
Did n't think so .
Story continued on Page 2
Occasionally a criminal is so , well , clever that you have to admire him even as you wish that he spends the rest of his life in jail .
Take Arnold Rothstein , for instance .
One of the kingpins of organized crime in New York City during Prohibition and before , the " Great Brain , " as he was termed , was more than likely behind the infamous Black Sox scandal , in which the 1919 World Series was fixed in favor of the Cincinnati Reds .
He is also widely credited with inventing the floating crap game immortalized in Guys and Dolls .
Like some character out of a Damon Runyon story , Rothstein's " office " was outside of Lindy 's Restaurant , at Broadway and 49th Street , and he associated with gangsters whose names still trip off the tongue three - quarters of a century later : Meyer Lansky Dutch Schultz .
When it comes to colorful , clever criminals , Rothstein is at the top of the heap .
And then , on the other end of the scale , today we have the phishers .
Scumbags of the Web , phishers vomit out emails to as many millions of people as they can possibly reach , hoping that a tiny few will respond to their fraudulent request to update their account information at PayPal , eBay , or CitiBank ( or just about any other bank you can imagine ) .
This is an enormous problem , and it 's not getting any better .
I recently read a fascinating study that shows just why that 's the case .
If you have n't read " Why Phishing Works " ( 850 kb PDF ) - written by Rachna Dhamija , J. D. Tygar , and Marti Hearst - stop what you 're doing now and go get it ( or at the very least , read a short summary of what it offers ) .
In just ten pages , your eyes will be opened to just how much of a problem the public - and the security people tasked with protecting them - really face .
I knew it was bad , but I had no idea it was this bad .

The site that fooled all but one participant in the study was for Bank of the West ( that 's a link to the real web site ... or is it ? ) .
On that site was a cute animated video of a bear .
Evidently that tickled a number of the users who reloaded the page several times to see that animated bear .
In fact , some of the participants said that the animation was proof that the site was legit , since it would take too much effort to copy it !
The ordinary folks in the study also figured that if a site has ads on it , then that increases the likelihood that it 's not a fake .
Likewise , the presence of a favicon ( the little icon that appears in the address bar to the left of the URL ) was deemed indicative of a site that was not out to steal your money and identity .

When a neighbour knocked on her door and explained his son had accidentally kicked a football into her garden , Angela Hickling was happy to return it .
But despite carrying out a thorough search the grandmother - of - two could not find the ball anywhere .
Assuming Christopher Salisbury was mistaken , she thought nothing more of it .
So the law - abiding 56 - year - old was astonished when a policeman arrived at her home and arrested her on suspicion of theft .
PC Mark Stokoe , of Derbyshire Constabulary , insisted he had proof of her wrong - doing - a photograph of a white leather Mitre ball on her lawn .
Stunned housewife Mrs Hickling was hauled from her dinner table , driven to a police station , quizzed for 90 minutes and had her fingerprints and a DNA sample taken before being released on bail .
Not surprisingly , police dropped the case a few days later because of lack of evidence .
Last night the mother - of - three said : " The whole episode is unbelievable .
" I 've never been in trouble with the police before .
I have been a good citizen and yet they come along and arrest me when I have n't done anything . "
" Why on earth would I want to keep a child 's football ?
If I found one in the garden I would throw it back over the wall . "
" You 've got burglars breaking into people 's homes , junkies selling drugs and old people being mugged in the street . "
" Yet the police see fit to waste their time locking up law - abiding people for stealing a football which does n't even exist . "
Mrs Hickling believes Mr Salisbury , whose house backs on to hers , had sought revenge following a long - running dispute .
In 2004 , she reported him to the authorities for illegally burying potentially - harmful asbestos sheets at his home in Heanor , Derbyshire .
Magistrates fined him £ 1,000 for breaching environmental laws .
Matters finally boiled over when Mr Salisbury knocked on the Hicklings door claiming his son had kicked his football into their garden .
Mrs Hickling , who lives with husband John , 60 , a tiler , daughter Sheryl , 21 , and son Haydn , 14 , said : " He asked if he could have it back so I went into the garden but there was nothing there . "
" The next day a policeman turned up and told me that theft of a football was a criminal offence . "
" I explained there was no football in my garden but before he left he warned that I could be arrested .
" After that things went quiet .
Then a few weeks later Mr Salisbury came to the house again and said another ball had gone into the garden .
" I had a look but there was still nothing there .
" He said , quite , sinisterly , ' Well , what a surprise .
We 'll see about that .'
" The next day I was having my tea and the policeman came again and said he'd come to investigate the theft of another football .
" He reached into his pocket and showed me a photo of a football in my garden .
" I said , ' That does n't mean I 've stolen it .
It could have been staged when I was out of the house . '
" He read me my rights and asked to look round the house .
He looked in the cupboards and drawers , climbed into the loft and even peeked behind the TV but did n't find anything .
Then he arrested me .
I was terrified . "
Mrs Hickling has made two complaints about PC Stokoe to Derbyshire Police .
Inspector Mark Bannister , of the force 's professional standards committee , has visited her to discuss the grievance but has not apologised .
She is also concerned that her DNA sample will remain on the police 's computer database - even though she has not done anything wrong .
A Derbyshire Constabulary spokesman acknowledged the force could be accused of over - reacting .
He said : " That could certainly be levelled against us but we are duty bound to investigate all criminal complaints made to us . "
He added that PC Stokoe 's superiors had advised the case be ditched .
Chief constables have the discretion to remove DNA from their database in exceptional circumstances including where a person is not charged .
However , they must receive a written request .
Mr Salisbury , a bricklayer , denied inventing the story of " stolen footballs " as an act of revenge .
Speaking from his newly - built £ 190,000 bungalow , he said : " I have got nothing against Mrs Hickling .
It was simply a case of wanting the footballs back .
" They had gone over the wall when my lads were playing in our front garden .
I asked her but we got nothing back .
There were a few of them . "
Mr Salisbury lives with his wife and three children - teenager sons Sam and Harry and daughter Emily , who is at primary school .
He refused to sympathise with Mrs Hickling 's ordeal , adding : " The only thing I can suggest to her is not to keep the footballs and to throw them back over the wall like normal people would do . "
It is not the first time this summer that police forces have appeared over - zealous when dealing with disputes over footballs .
Last month , father - of - two Alistair Wood , 40 , from Preston , Lancashire , was arrested on suspicion of theft after keeping hold of a football belonging to the sons of Crown Prosecution Service employee Stephen Burns .
He was handcuffed and bundled into the back of a police car when he refused to give the ball back until the brothers said sorry .
And in June , Ray Markham , 68 , from Cubbington , Warwickshire , was arrested for theft after keeping a football belonging to neighbour , police sergeant Stewart Bosworth , that smashed his greenhouse .
WASHINGTON , Sept. 6 ( AP )  Methane , a potent heat - trapping gas , is bubbling out of the thawing Siberian permafrost five times as fast as previously thought , researchers are reporting .
The finding , being published Thursday in the journal Nature , is based on new , more accurate measuring techniques .
“ The effects can be huge , ” said the lead author , Katey Walter of the University of Alaska Fairbanks .
“ It ’s coming out a lot , and there ’s a lot more to come out . ”
Molecule for molecule , methane is 23 times as effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide , the main gas linked to global warming .

Ever since YouTube ’s CEO Chad Hurley participated in Herb Allen ’s annual Sun Valley media mogulfest , there has been much speculation about who will acquire the young online video phenom .
If the chatter in the blogosphere is a reliable indicator , many believe it will be Rupert Murdoch .
After all , with MySpace under his belt , it ’s certainly logical for him to want to combine his 80 % market share of social networking with YouTube ’s 60 % market share of online video … giving him clear dominance within the rising social media industry .
But it ’s not likely to happen , and here ’s why .
If rumors are true and YouTube is valuing itself at $ 1 billion , they have essentially out - priced themselves for Murdoch .
As I experienced personally when I negotiated the sale of Delphi Internet to Murdoch , he prefers to use hard cash as his deal currency , not News Corp stock ( maintaining his ownership interest and avoiding dilution are key drivers ) .
Therefore , the prospect of laying out $ 1 billion in cash for an operation with negative cash flow , particularly after spending nearly $ 600 million for MySpace , is a highly unlikely scenario .
And even he wants to , Wall Street wo n’t let him risk his balance sheet without repercussions .
The only practical way for Murdoch to go after expensive deals like YouTube or FaceBook would be to create an alternative form of currency … by spinning off Fox Interactive Media ( “ FIM ” ) .
With FIM publicly traded , he would then have the currency to do such bubble - type valuation deals on an apple - to - apple basis .
I ’m sure Murdoch would love to have YouTube , and it must be frustrating to have your hands tied .
For this reason , I would attach a very high probability of an FIM spin off .
So with Murdoch effectively out of the picture in the near term , which of the other media conglomerates like Viacom / MTV or the Internet giants like Google are possible suitors .
From the perspective of Wall Street , the most likely contender is NBC Universal .
With parent company GE sporting a market cap of $ 340 billion , structuring a billion - dollar deal , using stock as currency , is actually quite feasible .
In fact , I would even go as far as to say that NBC ’s recent promotional deal with YouTube is essentially a form of due - diligence for an acquisition .

At some point when using Qi , you may find yourself wanting to do a bit more than the system provides natively .
Perhaps you want to double click a .qi file and have it run in Qi.
Perhaps you want to do some text processing and you need the CL - PPCRE regular expression library .
If you do have either of those needs , you are in luck .
I ’ll explain how to do both in this article .
But I 'll try to keep an eye towards what 's going on under the hood in Qi so we can better understand the motivation for this code .
First , let us cover passing files to the Qi.bat file and having them run .
This is equivalent to double clicking on a .qi file in windows explorer with the proper file type associations set .
The current Qi.bat that comes with Qi 6.2 does not allow you to pass .qi files on the command line into Qi .
If we look at Qi.bat , we find that it simply loads CLISP with the startup_qi.txt file on the command line as an argument .
It has 2 linesTerpri prints a newline to the output stream then calls the main ( qi:: qi ) function .
If we want our system to understand arguments , we will have to do it before the ( qi : : qi ) line .
This is because at that point , Qi takes over and we have lost our chance to get back to the arguments .
What we need to do is initialize the qi environment ourselves and load our .qi file given on the command line .
Finally , we can call ( qi :: qi ) knowing our file has been loaded into the system .
In the following , we find a load_n_launch function that does exactly this .
Note that while the function is mostly written in Lisp , it can makes calls to the qi subsystem via the package operator .
It is important to remember that even at this point we have entered a " Qi like " environment .
To better understand why , we need to understand how Qi bootstraps itself .
So we understand the qi bootstrap process better now and we can see why things in our qi_startup .
txt can be a bit wierd .
Let us specify an argument loading version of qi_startup .
txt
All we have to do now is create a version of the qi.bat file that launches qi .
It should simply run the lisp .exe with the lispinit.mem file that the Qi bootstrapper created and pass along any arguments it recieves .
I personally like to have it be able to load from anywhere so I include the full path in the specification of the executable and the memory image .
Of course , when you are playing with your memory images , make sure to keep a backup around in case something goes awry .
Now if you double click a .qi file ( assuming you never tried before ) , will ask you to choose which program to run it with .
Select the " Choose from a list " option , then select the " Browse " option and find your version of Qi.bat .
Your program should launch and include all the wonderful functions you have defined .
It makes debugging much easier in my opinion .
Obviously , you could place whatever code you wanted in the load_n_launch spot .
Just call qi::qi to get into the main qi loop at the end of it and everything should work fine .
But this brings us to the second issue , what about lisp functions we want to load ?
Unfortunately , we could not place them in the load_n_launch spot because QI already has changed many important things like case sensitivity and which characters count as " comments " among other things .
If we try to load a lisp file , we will likely encounter errors .
So how do we get CL - PPCRE into Qi ?
The easiest way is to include the entire package into our memory image .
Once we have a lisp memory image with the functions included in it , we can then make a Qi image that will have access to the original functions .
While the steps below work , they create monster images in terms of memory size .
So be certain you only include the things you really need .
Oh , and there are better ways of doing this but I do n't know about them yet .
Feel free to enlighten me .
And that will give you a customised version of Qi !
You can now perform wonders such asBut remember , Qi only reads off one result at the top level .
To see the rest of your results , you have to use multiple - value - list If you have anything else you need to load , you can do it in the above manner .
So in short , we can have our cake and eat it too .
If you can get something working in CLISP , you should be able to get somethign working in Qi .
I hope these tips help your Qi experience and let me know what you think !

Ever since the Mangans gave up their comfortable house in Kansas City , Kan. , and moved here a year ago , the family has been living in a kind of suspended animation .
It almost looks as if they just moved into their two - bedroom apartment near Austria ’s old Imperial Palace : Some boxes shipped from the U.S. have never been opened and the bedroom windows are still covered with sheets because the family ran short of money before they could buy curtains .
The three young Mangan children have stopped asking about their plight , although 9 - year - old Timothy gets angry every once in a while .
“ I wish I can yell at them , ” he blurted out recently about his father ’s former employer .
Joseph Mangan , 41 , is a whistle - blower .
As a result he and his family find themselves in a foreign country with unfamiliar laws , fighting a legal battle that has left them almost penniless .
Advertisement
A year ago , Mangan told European aviation authorities that he believed there were problems with a computer chip on the Airbus A380 , the biggest and costliest commercial airliner ever built .
The A380 is a double - decked engineering marvel that will carry as many as 800 passengers -- double the capacity of Boeing Co. 's 747 .
It is expected to enter airline service next year .
Mangan alleges that flaws in a microprocessor could cause the valves that maintain cabin pressure on the A380 to accidentally open during flight , allowing air to leak out so rapidly that everyone aboard could lose consciousness within seconds .
It ’s a lethal scenario similar to the 1999 crash that killed professional golfer Payne Stewart and five others when their Learjet lost cabin pressure and they blacked out .
The plane flew on autopilot for hours before crashing in South Dakota .
Mangan was chief engineer for TTTech Computertechnik , a Viennese company that supplies the computer chips and software to control the cabin- pressurization system for the A380 , which is being assembled at the Airbus plant in France .
Advertisement
In October , TTTech fired Mangan and filed civil and criminal charges against him for revealing company documents .
The company said the information was proprietary and he had no right to disclose it to anyone .
Mangan countersued , saying he had been wrongly terminated for raising legitimate safety concerns .
Unlike U.S. laws that shield whistle - blowers from corporate retaliation , Austrian laws offer no such protection .
Last year an Austrian judge imposed an unusual gag order on Mangan , seeking to stop him from talking about the case .
Mangan posted details about the case anyway in his own Internet blog .
The Austrian court fined him $ 185,000 for violating the injunction .
Advertisement
And the Vienna police , who are conducting a criminal investigation into the matter , searched the family ’s apartment for four hours , downloading files from Mangan ’s computer as his children watched .
Boxes of documents detailing his allegations clutter the living room , but Mangan ca n’t show the material or talk about the case -- at least in Austria .
To discuss his case with The Times , Mangan took a five - hour train ride to Munich , Germany , where the gag order does n’t apply .
“ I do n’t want to destroy TTTech , ” he said .
“ But I still get nightmares of people dying .
I just ca n’t let that happen . ”
To help pay living expenses and legal fees , Mangan sold his house in Kansas .
With only about $ 300 left in his bank account , Mangan missed a Sept. 8 deadline to pay his $ 185,000 fine and faces up to a year in jail .
Next month he ’s likely to be called before a judge on his criminal case .
Advertisement
The family expected to be evicted this month from their apartment , but their church in Vienna took up a collection to pay their rent .
At the moment , Mangan is hiding out at a church member ’s home because he fears he could be arrested at any time .
Mangan ’s wife , Diana , has been reading a book , “ Lord , Where Are You When Bad Things Happen ? ” to make sense of the family ’s ordeal .
“ He ’s trying to do the right thing .
Why are we suffering for it ? ” she said .
On both sides of the Atlantic , Mangan ’s case has raised eyebrows in the close - knit aerospace community , which is fascinated by his allegations but unclear about how serious they are .
Advertisement
Hans Weber , a veteran aviation consultant in San Diego , ca n’t say whether Mangan has a legitimate claim because he has n’t seen the evidence .
But he is baffled by the extent to which Airbus and TTTech have “ gone after ” Mangan .
“ There is something really unusual about this case in the sense that there is this hard standoff between Airbus and the individual , ” Weber said .
“ It does n’t make any sense to me . ”
One of Mangan ’s key allegations is that because of the A380 ’s unusual design , any loss of cabin pressure would be extremely dangerous .
Most passenger jets have two cabin - pressure valves , with separate motors operating each .
Because aircraft makers want redundancy on safety systems , the planes have three motors for each valve , with different chips controlling each motor .
The Boeing 777 , for example , has cabin - pressure chips made by Motorola Inc. , Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc .
Most jetliners also have a manual override so that the pilot can take control in an emergency .

Airbus has acknowledged that its designers faced challenges as they attempted to reduce the A380 ’s weight .
Early on , the company elected to go with four outflow valves on the A380 , with only one motor on each valve , which is slightly larger than a cabin window .
Each motor uses a TTTech controller chip , and there is no manual override system .
“ Just there , I would not be happy , ” said Chris Lomax , a retired engineer who helped design the cabin- pressurization systems for Boeing ’s 737 and 747 .
“ If all four valves [ on the A380 ] were driven wide open , it would be nip and tuck for the crew to get their [ oxygen ] mask on and begin a descent . ”
Airbus says that the A380 has achieved redundancy by installing the extra cabin - pressure valves , which provide a safety cushion in case a valve fails .
As for Mangan ’s allegations , they are “ an unsubstantiated crusade , ” Airbus spokesman Clay McConnell said .
“ Do n’t you think we would look into it , and if we found it was true we would do something about it ? ” McConnell asked .

The A380 , which is undergoing flight testing , is a year behind schedule because of unspecified problems .
But Airbus has told aviation authorities that there is ample time to fix any problems that are discovered during the certification process .
TTTech executives insist that their product is safe .
They portray Mangan as a disgruntled ex-employee seeking retribution and eager to blackmail them .
“ He ’s trying to destroy the company , ” Chief Executive Stefan Poledna said .
TTTech supplies parts to Hamilton Sundstrand , a United Technologies Corp. unit that is building the A380 ’s cabin- pressurization system .
“ The matters raised by Mr. Mangan have been thoroughly reviewed , ” a Hamilton Sundstrand spokeswoman said , “ and safety of flight will be assured . ”
The European Aviation Safety Agency , which is handling the A380 ’s flight worthiness certification , has reviewed Mangan ’s allegations .
“ We have done the research and acted accordingly , ” spokesman Daniel Holtgen said .
“ We ca n’t comment on it because it is a matter for Airbus . ”

Mangan believes that the European aerospace establishment is whitewashing his claims because of enormous cost savings that will be realized if TTTech ’s chips are approved for the A380 .
TTTech ’s chip originally was designed for use in autos , and the company is trying to get it certified as an existing , “ commercial off - the - shelf ” product that is acceptable for the A380 , according to court records .
Mangan , however , alleges that the chip is being customized for aviation purposes , and thus must undergo stringent testing before being approved by regulators .
If regulators decide that TTTech ’s chip is a simple commercial device and can be used in the A380 , it would then be available for other new aircraft without having to pass costly safety reviews .
Advertisement
That ’s why the industry is so adamant about squashing his claims , Mangan alleges .
Airbus , owned by Dutch and British companies , surpassed Boeing in 2003 as the world ’s largest maker of airliners .
Mangan ’s attorney , Franz Karl Juraczka , advised him last spring to leave Austria before his legal problems snowballed .
Mangan refused : “ I would n’t be able to live with myself if anything went wrong with that airplane . ”
Despite his ordeal , Mangan remains enthused about aerospace design .
He can talk for hours about arcane subjects such as fluid dynamics with the same sense of excitement as a kid with a new toy .
Mangan was born in Ohio and grew up in San Jose , and he always had a fascination for science and technology , family members and friends said .
When Apple introduced its first personal computer , the 12 - year - old Mangan took apart the family ’s television set to try to build a PC for himself .
He also made a satellite receiver out of coffee cans to try to get weather data from an orbiting satellite .

At 16 , while still in high school , he got a part - time job at IBM in San Jose helping to design robotic manufacturing machines .
He attended San Jose State University and the University of Massachusetts , but never received a college degree .
Later , while working for Honeywell on a military jet project , he came into contact with TTTech , a company founded by two professors in Vienna to market their computer chips .
They say the chips contain 20 times more memory than the processors currently used in aviation , while having half the electrical wiring required for data communication systems that oversee aircraft controls .
The chips also can be used on the steering and braking systems of autos .
Moreover , they would cut the cost of aviation chips to about $ 20 apiece , versus $ 500 for previous designs .
Mangan was drawn by the firm ’s potential .
His future seemed bright in February 2004 when he was hired as chief engineer at a salary of $ 100,000 , plus $ 25,000 in moving expenses .
Diana Mangan packed up their three children -- Shelley , now 12 , Timothy and Jarrod , 6 -- and they arrived in Vienna in the summer of 2004 .

With its subsidized medical care and after - school - care programs , Austria looked like a great place to raise a family .
And the family was pleased to discover that Vienna had a Baptist church .
Mangan began work on the chip for the A380 ’s cabin- pressurization system .
Until the 1940s , commercial airplanes were not pressurized and could fly only at about 10,000 feet .
Flying above the clouds , around 30,000 feet , would make flights smoother , but at that altitude a lack of oxygen and temperatures of 140 degrees below freezing would kill passengers within minutes .
Then Boeing launched its Stratoliner , the first passenger plane with a sealed cabin .
Internal pressure was maintained by regulating the intake and outflow of air during flight .
This breakthrough helped lead to the age of modern air travel .
Advertisement
Today , most airline passengers -- besides experiencing mild popping in their ears -- rarely notice that air inside the cabin is in constant flux as air is taken in through the engines and let out through the valves in the belly of the plane .
However , if the valves are stuck open the cabin can depressurize in seconds before anyone can don emergency oxygen masks .
In most cases pilots have time to bring the plane down to a safe altitude , but several recent incidents have raised concerns .
Authorities suspect that cabin- pressure problems caused the August crash in Greece of Helios Airways ’ Boeing 737 in which all 121 aboard died .
And investigators believe that an abrupt loss of cabin pressure may have led to the in - flight breakup of a China Airlines 747 in 2002 , killing all 225 aboard .
Mangan said he found serious flaws early last year in TTTech ’s computer chips and the software for the A380 ’s cabin- pressurization system , according to legal documents .
The system was executing “ unpredictable ” commands when it received certain data , possibly causing the pressure valves to open accidentally .
Advertisement
Because all four motors in the A380 ’s cabin- pressurization system use the same type of flawed TTTech chip , Mangan says , “ if one fails , they all fail . ”
Yet his employer ignored his concerns , he alleges , because fixing the glitches would be costly , could take up to a year and would further delay the A380 ’s launch .
TTTech tried to cover up the defects and forged Mangan ’s signature on documents to suggest that the software passed internal tests and reviews , he alleges in court documents .
“ Once they slip this onboard the A380 , they can justify using it on all other aircraft , ” Mangan said .
Indeed , Boeing Co. has ordered TTTech ’s chips for the flight control system for its upcoming mid-size 787 Dreamliner .
Boeing executives said they were unaware of any problems with TTTech ’s chips , but said further questions should be addressed by TTTech .
Advertisement
TTTech executives denied any wrongdoing .
They said there had been a minor glitch but that it had been fixed .
Within days of firing Mangan last fall , TTTech sued him in civil court to try to force him to retract his statements to aviation authorities about the potential defect .
In contrast to the U.S. legal system , in Austria individuals can file criminal charges .
A few weeks later TTTech also sued Mangan in criminal court .
Then , in December , a civil court issued an injunction barring Mangan from talking about his case .
Advertisement
By May , the family was short of cash , so Mangan returned to the U.S. to borrow money to help pay his legal bills , and while there he also set up an Internet blog to publicize his safety concerns about the new Airbus .
The Mangans developed a circle of Austrian friends at their church who were eager to help .
When Mangan decided his first lawyer was n’t aggressive enough , the church referred him to attorney Juraczka , who agreed to represent him for free .
These days the family ’s living room looks like a legal library , holding Mangan ’s voluminous whistle - blower records .
He wryly notes that the clutter prevented police from finding all of his documents during their search .
Throughout the family ’s ordeal , Mangan remained dogmatic about not being chased out of Austria and about standing up for what he believed in .
Diana said that she wondered at times whether it might be better to move on , but that the family was “ very supportive that it will all work out . ”

The Mangans live day to day , not sure what will come next .
If they ca n’t pay their rent , they hope to return to the U.S. to live with Diana ’s parents in Ohio , although they have maxed out their credit card and ca n’t afford plane tickets .
Mangan is getting ready to file for personal bankruptcy .
TTTech has offered to drop its legal action against Mangan , court records show , and pay him three months of severance , if he retracts his statements .
But Mangan has refused .
Mangan said he was looking for a new job .
He has contacted dozens of aerospace firms in the U.S. and Europe , but none have returned his calls .
“ Nobody wants to touch me , ” he said .
That was the thinking behind Philipp and Laura Muessig ’s decision to start a club in Minneapolis 19 years ago with four friends .
They hoped to save money and to make sure they saw one another once a month .
Their club , which usually meets for a couple of hours on a weekend afternoon , has since put in a concrete walkway , cleared out a garage and cleaned viruses off a computer .
“ With six people , we found ourselves tackling projects we might not do ourselves , ” Mr. Muessig said .
“ It ’s always satisfying to just dive into a project and later say , ‘ We did that ? ’ ”
In Tampa , Fla. , Maria Garcia - Gutierrez started the Home Improvement Team , or HIT , five years ago after buying a two - bedroom bungalow that needed work .
When her mother suggested she round up some friends to take turns working on one another ’s houses , she doubted they would go for it .
“ But none of us could afford to pay anyone to come do the work , ” Ms. Garcia - Gutierrez said .
Five years later , HIT meets one Saturday a month , and usually 10 to 16 people show up .
“ We ’ve developed so many friendships ; it ’s really drawn the neighborhood together , ” Ms. Garcia - Gutierrez said .
Before every meeting she sends an e-mail message to about 175 people in her neighborhood association to let them know about the project .
“ We ’re like a bunch of vampires , ” she said .
“ We like to suck up new blood . ”
Each January , the Monroe co-op ’s members meet for dinner to pick dates for the year .
They work one Saturday a month at a different family ’s house , from March to September , except in August , when they go on a short trip together .
“ It takes a real commitment , ” Daniel Davidson said .
The co-op ’s success hinges on its firm schedule and detailed assignments worthy of an army general .
A month before September ’s work party , Mr. Riedel , the host , started planning , buying paint and gathering tools .
A week before , he sent everyone an e-mail message listing the day ’s 11 jobs and asking them to bring garden tools .
The Riedels made sure to select large projects they preferred not to tackle on their own .

The group has stayed small for a reason .
With one meeting a month , only a limited number of chores can be addressed .
To those who want to join , they offer the following advice for starting a new group :
Begin by inviting friends to an initial meeting and decide how much time to commit , what kind of work should be done and how often to meet .
Some who have worked with her say that the same punctiliousness that made her a sterling steward of the White House paper flow sometimes made her an impediment in her policy jobs , and that her focus on process bodes ill for her work as a justice .
" It was n't that she did n't do the job right , " said David Frum , who was a White House speechwriter when Ms. Miers was staff secretary and has been one of her sharpest critics , " but the way she did the job rules her out of being a person you would think of as capable of handling this enormous responsibility . "
Mr. Bolten acknowledged that he was somewhat surprised when Ms. Miers was chosen as staff secretary because the job had often been filled by more politically minded operatives , including Richard G. Darman in the Reagan administration .
But he added , " What I think made Harriet so successful as staff secretary was that she was a diligent and honest broker , able to digest very complicated material rapidly , and produce a fair resolution for the president , so that the advice that was going in to the president was fully and fairly presented . "
Ms. Miers 's friends in and out of government express disappointment that her nomination has not been greeted in a similar spirit and say they do not recognize her critics ' descriptions of her as an unqualified presidential crony .
" Harriet is a person who is incredibly capable and hard - working and fair and honest , " said Susan L. Karamanian , an associate dean at George Washington University Law School and a Democrat who was mentored by Ms. Miers as a young lawyer in her Dallas firm nearly 20 years ago .
" When I practiced with Harriet , I never once heard her make a serious negative comment about anyone , " Ms. Karamanian said .
" And now for someone who 's dedicated her life to working so hard in the profession , and treating everyone so fairly , to be the object of these statements is just incomprehensible to me . "
Alone in the Hospital
Going to the hospital has never been particularly safe , but hospitals have tried to do what they can .
In the early part of the 1900s , hospitals became fanatical about sterility , to prevent infection .
Each infant in their care , for example , had its own white coat for doctors to wear as they visited that infant , hung on hooks inside out for the next doctor to don .
Holding babies was considered dangerous ( as signage emphasized ) , so they were fed without being held — bottles were simply propped up where the infants could get at them .
Needless to say , parents were denied visits .
And yet mortality rates for infants in hospital care ranged from 30 to 75 percent .
The babies were cared for and nourished , they had no outward physical problems , they simply succumbed to a mysterious phenomenon the doctors labeled “ failure to thrive ” .
Some thought it might be a hidden infection .
So the nurses wore masks and hoods , carefully scrubbed up before they handled infants .
Some hospitals put infants in boxes with glove - valves — the kinds you see in movies when scientists are handling radioactive material — so that they ’d never have to touch the infant at all .
But the problem just got worse .
Henry Bakwin , pediatric director of New York ’s Bellevue Hospital , saw this and thought that perhaps they were going about things exactly wrong .
The infants were n’t dying of infection , he believed , they were dying of loneliness — a loneliness that made it easier for them to succumb to infection .
He took down the signs about washing hands and put up signs requiring everyone to pick up and fondle a baby .
And infection rates went down .
Harold Skeels and a team at the Iowa Child Research Welfare Station decided to try an experiment .
They took thirteen girls out of institutionalized care and had them “ adopted ” by older girls in “ a home for the feeble - minded ” .
Within nineteen months , the average IQs of the adopted kids jumped from 64 to 92 .
But these folks were the radicals .
The mainstream scientific community refused to believe there was anything wrong — people were blowing things out of proportion , they insisted , and anyway , everyone knows children that young ca n’t suffer from depression .
The studies were flawed .
John Bowlby came at it from a different perspective .
Interviewing severely disturbed kids , he discovered they all shared a traumatic separation from their parents when they were young .
He concluded the mother - infant relationship was essential to development and issued recommendations much like Skeels and Spitz .
“ The mothering of a child is not something which can be arranged by roster , ” he wrote in reports for the World Health Organization .
But still the hospitals did n’t change .
Bowlby ’s student John Robertson begun doing observation at hospitals .
He noticed that babies screamed painfully as they were admitted .
The nurses explained that this was normal and they ’d soon settle down .
He noticed that these “ settled ” babies returned to violent fits when they were taken home , attacking her as if they blamed her .
The nurses said that was normal too , mothers were n’t just as good at taking care of kids as the nurses .
Robertson had a different explanation .
He decided to make a movie to prove it .
Unlike the last , this one would be completely scientific .
He would pick a name at random from the list of babies , then always film them at a specific hour , clock in the background , so you could tell he was n’t cheating .
The name he picked was Laura .
When he went to find her he was devastated : Laura was the one girl in a hundred who was n’t crying ; her parents had reared her so strictly that she quietly restrained all her emotions .
“ I saw immediately [ she ] was going to be the one child in a hundred who was not going to demonstrate what I had been shouting my head off [ about ] , ” Robertson said .
But he could n’t pick another child — that would be cheating .
The project continued .
The first day , Laura jumped out of her bath to the door in an attempt to escape .
Her smiles disappear and sometimes she quietly sobs while clutching her teddy .
“ Where ’s my mummy ? ” she asks repeatedly , while trying hard to hold back tears .
Each day she grows grayer until on the fifth , when she appears unsmiling and resentful .
Her mother comes to visit ( thanks to a special exception to the rules Robertson negotiated ) , but she wipes away her mother ’s kiss .
When her mother waves goodbye , she looks away .
When her mother finally comes to take her home on the eight day , she begins shaking with sobs .
She gathers up all of her stuff , but refuses to take her mother ’s hand as they walk out .
They presented the film to the Royal Society of Medicine in London .
The audience was outraged .
It was false , it was slander , it was a trick , it was an atypical child , it was filmed selectively , it was edited dishonestly .
“ People stood up and said that their children ’s wards were not like that , two - year - olds were all happy , ” Robertson recalls .
Robertson was banned from some of the wards he was observing , pediatricians walked across the street when they encountered him .
The hospital claimed that Robertson had interfered with the nurses trying to care for Laura .
As Robertson toured Britain with the film , the reaction was always the same .
When Laura finally saw the film , six months later , she burst into tears .
“ Where were you all that time ? ” she asked her mother .
Reviews in the medical journals , however , were all positive .
And younger nurses and doctors begun telling Robertson how they agreed with him and would do things differently , if only they were in charge .
And a few higher - ups quietly sent some votes of support .
So Robertson kept going .
He took the film to the United States , hoping for a similarly positive reception .
But the Americans insisted that while it was a great film about Britain , it had no relevance in their country .
And nobody was willing to take the obvious step of letting mothers stay with their children on the wards .
Not until 1955 were there signs of change .
Fred Stone , a doctor at the Royal Hospital in Glasgow , decided to do a pilot study .
“ I would drive up the hill to come here , ” he recalled , “ and there would be two hundred parents queueing up in the rain to get in for their half hour ’s visiting . ”
A colleague who had control of two pediatric wards decided to offer one of them to Stone to prove that his suggestions would n’t work .
When the nurses heard about this , they threatened to resign together .
To placate them , Stone set up a series of meetings .
“ The aggression after the first meetings was unbelievable , truly unbelievable , ” he explained .
But the aggression soon turned to tears .
“ They said , ‘ You do n’t understand what you are asking of us .
[ You mean ] a parent can just walk in and see how we ’re neglecting these poor kids [ ? ] ’ [ … ]
And , of course , at that point we had to say , ‘ But what on earth makes you think that we ’re criticizing you ?
You ’re doing an impossible job remarkably well . ’
And , of course , then the tears came as you can imagine . ”
Finally they agreed the experiment should at least be tried .
“ I never heard any more about the issue at all .
Nobody ever came back to me and said , ‘ The six months are up . ’
Nobody ever reported that it had been a success or a failure ; all I knew was that somehow I heard that two wards were doing it , four wards were doing it , the whole hospital was doing it .
And since then we ’ve had almost unrestricted visiting in the whole hospital . ”
Similar experiments were conducted in London , although changes on the Continent did n’t happen until the late 1970s .
In 1959 , the British minister of health made it official policy .
And in the early 1960s , Robertson told BBC Radio parents that they should sit-in by their children ’s cot and force the hospital to try to evict them .
Slowly the tide began to turn .

September 26 , 2006
While Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki ’s continued tenure in office has been the subject of a surge of speculation over the past week , it may be George W. Bush ’s continued reign  at least over Iraq policy  that appears most endangered at the moment .
While no one is talking about a classic " coup d’etat " against the U.S. president , as is being rumored about the increasingly hapless and seemingly helpless Maliki in Baghdad , Bush ’s mantra about " staying the course " in Iraq is now seen as so delusory as to require some form of serious adult intervention .
" Plan B "  that is , anything but " staying the course "  has been on the lips of virtually every foreign policy analyst who considers him or herself worthy of the name this past week when , it seemed , the entire capital appeared to decide that whatever the U.S. has been doing in Iraq for the past three months , six months , or three years is failing , and failing spectacularly .
The somber tone of this week ’s military briefings in Iraq certainly reflected that view as active - duty senior officers who finally went public with their growing frustrations .
Indeed , the fact that the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , Gen . Peter Pace , earlier this month launched a comprehensive , 60 - day review of Iraq strategy belied Bush ’s notion that the current strategy is fundamentally sound .
Even a few of the war ’s most enthusiastic neoconservative supporters have come to admit that it may in fact have been a serious strategic mistake , although they seem determined still to stave off the growing consensus  even among Republican circles  in favor of some kind of timetable for withdrawal .
" The Iraq war was a mistake , " wrote hard - line war hawk Jonah Goldberg in the Los Angeles Times Thursday , suggesting that Iraqis hold a special plebiscite on whether they want the U.S. to withdraw from their country .
" That the Iraq war is , if not a failure , failing , requires little demonstration , " conceded Eliot Cohen , a member of the Pentagon ’s Defense Policy Board ( DPB ) , in a column entitled " Plan B " published in the Wall Street Journal Friday .
Cohen , whose 2002 book , Supreme Command , about how the West ’s greatest civilian wartime leaders constantly ignored or overruled their military commanders received widespread publicity when Bush took it on vacation with him several months before the Iraq invasion , argued that the loss in " American prestige " resulting from the Iraq adventure is such that it " will not be restored without a considerable and successful use of American military power down the road . "
Not only have some 16,000 U.S. troops detailed to keep the peace in Baghdad failed to stop sectarian bloodletting in the capital itself , but they have also shown themselves less able to protect themselves from increasingly potent and sophisticated insurgent and militia attacks .
At some 75 military deaths so far , October is well on the way to becoming one of the deadliest months for U.S. forces since the invasion more than three years ago .
And the sacrifice implied by those deaths is increasingly under question here  both among the public at large and the elite  given the growing unanimity among experts , many of whom still resisted the proposition as recently as last month , that Iraq has reached a state of civil war .
" Almost all the indicators in Iraq point south , and America may already have passed the make - or - break point in its intervention there , " noted an article in the well - respected National Journal published Friday entitled " Endgame . "
The gloom  not to say growing desperation  regarding the situation in Iraq is , of course , compounded not only by the relentless daily media reports cataloguing yet more violence in Iraq , and the Maliki government ’s failure or inability to do anything about it , but also by the sense that the man at the top here , George W. Bush , either does n’t understand how bad the situation has become or is so stubborn and lacking in self - confidence that he would n’t admit it if he did .
In his latest book , aptly titled State of Denial , Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward recounted a White House meeting late last year with Republican lawmakers during which Bush , a football cheerleader during his university years , tried to quell any doubts about his determination to prevail in Iraq .
" I will not withdraw even if ( First Lady ) Laura and Barney are the only ones supporting me , " he told them .
Barney is his dog .
That declaration may have sounded vaguely Churchillian and inspiring to his audience back then .
But , given the blindingly obvious deterioration of the situation in Iraq  and the growing conviction among political pros here that the Republicans will lose up to 40 seats and their control of the House of Representatives and may even lose their majority in the Senate in the Nov. 7 mid-term elections  it is likely to sound stupid , even suicidal , to the same audience today .
Hence the sudden rise in talk not just about a coup d’etat in Baghdad that could somehow produce a new political leadership capable of pacifying the country  either through appeasement or ruthless repression ( either of the Sunni insurgency or of the Shi’ite militias )  but about effective " regime change " at home , as well .
Of course , a Democratic sweep in Congress could produce a new political context here .
Indeed , a growing number of analysts believe that major Republican losses will result at the very least in the long - awaited departure of Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld .
But , by itself , Rumsfeld ’s departure guarantees nothing in terms of a change of strategy , and , given the Democrats ’ own disunity on Iraq and their relative spinelessness until recently in challenging the basic premises  as opposed to competence  of Bush ’s foreign policy since 9/11 , a number of foreign policy heavyweights , most of them Republican " realists , " are suggesting some serious " adult supervision " of the president after the elections , whether he likes it or not .
Indeed , none other than Harlan Ullman , a defense expert who coined the idea of " shock and awe " in military strategy , noted in his column in the Washington Times last week that Bush ’s stubbornness represented a real obstacle to sensible policies not just in Iraq , but in East Asia , where North Korea ’s recent nuclear test has been seen as yet another major Bush failure , and elsewhere .
" Since Mr. Bush is so adamant in his views , perhaps a ‘ council of elders ’ could persuade him to reconsider , " wrote Ullman , who suggested that Senate Armed Services Committee chairman John Warner , former secretaries of state George Shultz and Henry Kissinger , former Democratic national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski could be involved in a concerted effort to " convince the president to appreciate the possibility that many of our policies are failing or founding and , unless we take new directions , events in East Asia could follow the disastrous trajectory of what is happening in the greater Middle East . "
Such a group , he suggested , should also include former secretary of state James Baker , who now heads the bipartisan , Congressionally - created Iraq Study Group ( ISG )  the fast - growing focus of dwindling hope for a miracle cure for Iraq  and has , like Warner , already made clear that " staying the course " is not a viable option .
That has also become the refrain of a rapidly growing number of panicked Republican incumbents who are ostentatiously distancing themselves from the Bush mantra in hopes of extending their political life expectancy .

As attorney general , he took action on his own and announced in November 2001 that doctors who prescribed lethal doses of drugs for the purpose of assisting a suicide risked losing their federal licenses to prescribe all " controlled substances . "
Without such a license , known formally as a " registration , " doctors would find it very difficult to practice medicine , because controlled substances include many prescription pain relievers and other commonly used medications .
Oregon sued to block enforcement of the new rule , joined by a doctor , a pharmacist and several terminally ill patients .
As authority for his action , the attorney general invoked the Controlled Substances Act , a 1970 law that established the framework for federal drug policy , as well as an implementing regulation issued by the Justice Department the following year .
The regulation requires that every prescription for a controlled substance " be issued for a legitimate medical purpose . "
Assisted suicide is " not a legitimate medical purpose , " Mr. Ashcroft declared in what he called an " interpretive rule . "
In his opinion today , Gonzales v. Oregon , No. 04-623 , Justice Kennedy went out of his way to emphasize , with evident disapproval , the unilateral nature of Mr. Ashcroft 's action , taken " without consulting Oregon or apparently anyone outside his department . "
The attorney general 's rule was not entitled to the deference the court usually gives to interpretations by executive branch officials of their governing statutes , he said , because Congress had not given the attorney general the authority he was invoking .
" The authority claimed by the attorney general is both beyond his expertise and incongruous with the statutory purposes and design , " Justice Kennedy said .
Justice Scalia , in his dissenting opinion , took issue with the argument that Congress could not have intended to delegate medical judgments of this sort to the attorney general .
The legitimacy of physician - assisted suicide " ultimately rests , not on ' science ' or ' medicine , ' but on a naked value judgment , " he said , adding : " It no more depends upon a ' quintessentially medical judgment ' than does the legitimacy of polygamy or eugenic infanticide . "
In any event , Justice Scalia said , Mr. Ashcroft 's action was " the most reasonable interpretation " of the statute and the regulation because " virtually every relevant source of authoritative meaning confirms that the phrase ' legitimate medical purpose ' does not include intentionally assisting suicide . "
Natural selection is not natural perfection .
Time and again , biologists have discovered traits that are both beneficial and harmful .
Perhaps the most famous example is the devastating disorder known as sickle - cell anemia .
To get sickle - cell anemia , you have to inherit two faulty copies of a gene that helps build hemoglobin , the molecule that traps oxygen in red blood cells .
In this condition , hemoglobin can’t hold its shape if it ’s not clamped around oxygen .
Without it , the defective hemoglobin collapses into needle - shaped clumps , which then turn the cell itself into a sickle shape .
The sickle cells snag in small capillaries , and the blood can no longer supply as much oxygen to the body .
People who inherit only one copy of this defective gene can get by on the hemoglobin made by the remaining normal copy .
But people who get two copies of the bad gene make nothing but defective hemoglobin , and they ’re usually dead by the time they ’re thirty .
A person who dies of sickle cell anemia is less likely to pass on the defective gene , and that means that the disease should be exceedingly rare .
But it ’s not–one in 400 American blacks has sickle cell anemia , and one in ten carries a single copy of the defective gene .
In the 1940s , scientists discovered what keeps sickle - cell anemia so common : the defective gene provides protection from malaria .
Carrying a single copy of the gene reduces a person ’s chance of getting severe malaria by a factor of ten .
Malaria is caused by a single - celled parasite called Plasmoidum carried by mosquitoes .
Normally it feeds on hemoglobin , but a red blood cell deformed by the sickle - cell gene somehow becomes a miserable home for the parasite .
The needle - shaped clumps of hemoglobin may be able to spear the parasites , or the deformed cells may not be able to pump in potassium , an element essential to Plasmodium .
It ’s also possible that it is easier for the immune system to recognize infected blood cells when they are deformed by sickle cell anemia .
Malaria wreaks colossal damage in many parts of the world .
Today it kills over a million people a year , mostly children , and it has been plaguing our species for thousands of years .
Carrying a single copy of the sickle - cell gene boosts the odds that people can have children in malaria - prone regions .
Unfortunately , when two people who carry the gene have children together , there ’s a one - in - four chance that each child will get both copies of the gene .
Over many generations , the advantage of having one copy of the gene outweighs the disadvantage of having two — at least in populations that have endured centuries of malaria .
In the decades since the discovery of the sickle - cell trade - off , scientists have discovered that several other defenses to malaria have evolved where the disease is a high risk — in Africa , the Mediterranean , Southeast Asia , and New Guinea .
And many of these adaptations come with drawbacks of their own .
Now a new study offers evidence of yet another mixed blessing : one defense against malaria may make people prone to alcoholism .
The discovery of this defense sprang up in an unexpected place : on the tongue .
In recent years scientists have deciphering the molecular biology of how we taste .
They have pinpointed several of the genes that produce receptors on taste bud cells .
They ’ve also reconstructed the structure of the receptors , and have even discovered some of the molecules that locked onto them .
And scientists have also been reconstructing the evolution of those taste receptors .
It turns out that they ’re the product of a complicated history .
Taste receptor genes can get accidentally duplicated , and mutations to the new copies can cause them to grab different molecules .
This growing diversity of receptors can let animals perceive a growing diversity of tastes — in some cases tastes of dangerous toxins in foods .
Compared to other primates , humans and chimpanzees have a relatively bad sense of taste — perhaps because we eat meat and fruits , as opposed to leaves and other plant material that ’s loaded with dangerous foods .
But scientists have identified a couple taste receptors that have experienced a significant amount of natural selection in the human lineage .
This summer a team of scientists reported the discovery of one of these highly evolved genes , known as TAS2R16 .
The evidence indicates that the receptor causes a feeling of bitterness in response to compounds called beta - glucopyranosides , which plants and insects produce to protect themselves against predators .
If these compounds get into a person ’s intestines , they produce cyanide as they are broken down .
Avoiding beta - glucopyranosides thanks to a bitter taste may keep people healthy , and thus be favored by natural selection .
The researchers found that an ancestral version of the receptor was replaced by newer versions on many occasions , beginning over 80,000 years ago .
The newer versions produce a nastier taste to the beta - glucopyranosides .
But the researchers discovered a peculiar exception to this rule .
Some populations in Africa had unusually high levels of the ancestral version of the gene .
These populations also turn out to be at very high risk of malaria .
Why would malaria favor a weaker sense of bitterness ?
One possibility is that beta - glucopyranosides can fight the parasite that causes the disease .
Cyanide is n’t just bad for people , but for Plasmodium as well .
It can even trigger a sickle - cell - like condition in red blood cells .
When malaria poses a major risk , the danger of eating poisons may be offset by their protection against the disease .
TAS2R16 ’s intriguing history prompted scientists to look for other conditions with which it might be associated .
Previous research had found a genetic disposition towards alcoholism , although the scientists could only link the diseases to a large chunk of chromosome seven .
In a new study in press at the American Journal of Human Genetics , researchers now report that this region contains TAS2R16 .
The scientists zeroed in on the taste receptor gene , comparing the versions carried by alcoholics and their relatives ( 2310 people were studied all told ) .
The researchers discovered that people who carried the low - bitterness version of the gene were at a significantly increased risk of alcoholism .
They also found that this gene was rare in European - Americans in their study , but 45 % of the African - Americans carried it .
Based on these results , the scientists suggest that a weak sense of bitterness not only provided protection against malaria , but also changes the taste of alcohol .
Other versions of TAS2R16 may give alcoholic drinks a nasty taste .
When these drinks do n’t taste as bad , it may be easier for people to develop alcoholism .
This study by no means slight the complexity of alcoholism–genes probably only account for half of the variation in people ’s risk , and those genes probably all have their own complex evolutionary history .
But it ’s further evidence of the many evolutionary trade - offs that have shaped our genomes , and our lives .
Every small electronic device is adding more and more features , which is to say more and more of the same features .
An iPod is striking for being able to show movies .
But so is a G.P.S. unit that transmits driving instructions over an FM radio and uses entries in your address book  uploaded from your cellphone via Bluetooth  to plot routes that may vary depending on traffic conditions updated by satellite based on real - time information from other drivers .
There is no meaningful reason why the remote control for your new HDTV could not also place a phone call or tell your new washing machine to skip the spin cycle .
Or , somehow , vice versa .
This means that many small , portable electronic devices are crowded with redundant functionality , which makes them more complicated and more expensive than they need to be .
How many places do you need to store your address book or play Tetris ?
But what feels like redundancy is in fact just a sign of incomplete convergence .
The G.P.S. unit I want has a hard drive with more room for music files than a midsize iPod Nano .
But I already carry an iPod , and I certainly do n’t want to listen to music over the G.P.S. unit ’s speakers or , for that matter , through an FM frequency on the radio .
Nor do I want to watch a download of “ Scrubs ” or “ Pirates of the Caribbean ” or get my e-mail or balance my electronic checkbook on the screen of the G.P.S .
Not yet , at least .
But before long , there will be a single slim rectangular device in which convergence is complete .
What it is will depend on where it is and what it ’s near .
We will have no idea what to call it , because none of its functions will have priority .
Lose it , and you lose everything .
What all this convergence means may be a meaningless question , like what it will cost .
But this is not just the convergence of many tools into one .
It ’s also the convergence of a significant part of our reality into broad , intertwining strands of digitized data .
That is an old prediction for the computer age  the way everything dissolves into information  but there is something new in watching so many different kinds of information receivers become one .
2017 update - I think this article does n’t really get to the point regarding Monads .
Specifically , I do n’t think it goes beyond Functor .
You are probably best looking somewhere else .
An attempt to explain monads and their usefulness in Haskell , assuming only some simple knowledge of Python .
List comprehensions are a great Python feature that have been borrowed from Haskell / ML , and ultimately from set theory .
As you probably know , they provide a convenient syntax for building lists from other lists or sequences :
>>> lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] >>> [ x * 2 for x in lst ] [ 2 , 4 , 6 ]
The alternative to the list comprehension is something like this :
>>> newlist = [ ] >>> for x in lst : ... newlist .
append ( x * 2 )
List comprehensions remove this annoying bit of boilerplate , helping to give Python the conciseness we love .
The list comprehension knows all about creating an empty initial list and appending values etc , so we do n’t have to do that each time .
While learning Haskell , I found list comprehensions a reassuring plateau of familiarity amidst the otherwise rather treacherous , alien landscape , but they also provide a way in to the impenetrable forest of ‘ Monads ’ .
In Haskell , the above Python code looks very similar ( at a GHCi interactive prompt , where Prelude > is the standard prompt ) :
Prelude > let lst = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] Prelude > [ x * 2 | x <- lst ] [ 2 , 4 , 6 ]
That should be pretty easy to understand if you know Python , but here is a full ‘ translation ’ of the list comprehension into English : unpack each value in the list ‘ lst ’ in turn , give it the label ‘ x ’ , and for each one return ‘x * 2 ’ as a value in a new list .
Haskell has another way of implementing the same thing , though — using its ‘ do ’ notation :
Prelude > do { x <- lst ; return ( x * 2 ) } [ 2 , 4 , 6 ]
The similarity with the above should be pretty obvious , and in fact it does exactly the same thing .
You ’ll notice that the order is reversed so it is more like our English version , and matches an imperative style of thinking ( do this , then that ) , whereas the list comprehension syntax reflects its origins in the mathematical notations of set theory .
However , there is one difference .
While list comprehension are specific to creating lists , ‘ do ’ notation has no knowledge of lists at all .
In fact , the only list in this expression is the input value ‘ lst ’ .
So , to prove a point , let ’s eliminate even that bit , by creating a function out of this expression :
Prelude > let double val = do { x <- val ; return ( x * 2 ) }
This is a definition of the function ‘ double ’ , that takes a single value ‘ val ’ .
( At the interactive prompt , we have to add the keyword ‘ let ’ , which would n’t be present in normal Haskell source code ) .
We can now use our function as before :
Prelude > double [ 0 , 1 , 2 ] [ 0 , 2 , 4 ]
GHCi does n’t complain about any of this , even though Haskell is statically typed and we have n’t told it what type of thing val is .
So what type of thing is val ?
We can ask GHCi using : type , but we ’ll have to do it indirectly , by asking it the type of our function double :
[ WARNING : the next few paragraphs are a bit tricky , but it gets easier again soon - hang in there ! ]
Prelude > : type double double :: ( Monad m , Num a ) => m a -> m a
Woah !
What on earth does all that mean ?
Well , let ’s ignore the bit in brackets , and look at the end first :
m a -> m a
The arrow tells us we have a function ( as we expected ) , and it takes values of type m a and returns values of type m a .
m a is a ‘ parameterised type ’ — as a simplification , we can say that ‘ m ’ is a placeholder for a container type , and ‘ a ’ is a placeholder for the type of thing it contains .
In the case of our input lst , m is a list ( represented as [ ] usually ) and a is an integer .
This is normally written [ Integer ] ( a list of integers ) , rather than [ ]
Integer .
In our instance , double took a list of integers and returned a list of integers .
But GHC knew that our function was more generic than simply operating on lists of integers .
From the ‘ do ’ notation , and the lack of anything about lists , it deduced that ‘ m ’ can actually be any ‘ Monad ’ .
From the use of multiplication in ‘* 2 ’ , it deduced that ‘ a ’ has to be restricted to numbers — more specifically , a type which implements the ‘ Num ’ interface ( which includes integers , fractional numbers etc ) .
The ( Monad m , Num a ) => bit is just indicating these restrictions .
So , how did our ‘ double ’ function achieve the feat of unpacking the data from the list , doubling each item , and returning the data in a new list , all without knowing anything about lists ?
Well , by using the ‘ do ’ notation , it was implicitly using a set of methods that are defined in the ‘ Monad ’ interface .
Since lists are instances of the Monad interface , and defines all the methods correctly , it just worked .
Are there other Monads that we could use instead of lists ?
Well , of course , or no - one would have bothered to create an interface if there was only a single instance of it .
One example would be the Maybe monad , that contains either Nothing , or an actual value , written Just somevalue .
The Maybe monad encapsulates a value that might be there , but might not , and the logic that if it contains Nothing , then any function operating on it will have to return Nothing too .
So we can now do this :
Prelude > double Nothing Nothing Prelude > double ( Just 1.5 ) Just 3.0
Magic !
Trying to do Nothing * 2 will give you a type error , but by using the Maybe monad , and our function that was generic over monads , we did it easily , with no extra work .
Impressed ?
In other languages you can create functions that work with different types of collections , by using , for example , the iterator protocol in Python , or the IEnumerable interface in C# .
But here we have taken it to a higher level — the Monad interface is like an abstraction of any kind of container .
Alternatively , Maybe and lists can both be thought of as encapsulating different strategies for computing values .
Maybe handles the case of 0 or 1 values , while list can handle any number of values , and it tries them all .
This in turn leads to the concept that a monadic value represents a computation — a method for computing a value , bound together with its input value .
This becomes especially important when you move on to ‘ State transformation ’ monads , such as the famous IO monad .
In these cases , the container is actually a function ( but just do n’t think about that if it hurts your head ! ) .
So , in Haskell Monads are simply an interface for a very generic container , but an interface that is so important that it has special syntactic support in the language , similarly to how the iterator protocol and lists in Python have various bits of syntactic support ( such as for , in , list comprehensions , etc ) .
The interface is more abstract than that of collections , which makes it more difficult to understand , but more powerful too , and the syntactic sugar all the more sweet , as it is much more broadly applicable .
For instance , monads were used to write the Parsec parser library which ends up with a syntax that allows a pretty direct translation from BNF , and is in fact more readable .
The parser monads know all about applying constraints , backtracking etc , in the same way that the list monad knows about how to take each element and apply the function to each one .
Writing monads is hard , but it pays off as using them in Haskell is surprisingly easy , and allows you to do some very powerful things .
I hope that begins to explain why monads are useful .
The next difficulty is understanding the methods that make up the Monad interface , which is beyond the scope of this article really , but I ’ll try to give an introduction .
You can already guess something about the Monad methods .
One of them you have seen explicitly — it ’s the ‘ return ’ method , responsible for packing things up into the monad .
The other is called ‘ bind ’ or ‘>>=’ , and it does the ‘ unpacking ’ involved with the <- arrow in the do notation .
Actually , the ‘ bind ’ method does n’t really unpack and return the data .
Instead , it is defined in such a way that it handles all unpacking ‘ internally ’ , and you have to provide functions that always have to return data inside the monad .
Why is this important ?
Well , some uses of monads , especially the IO monad , need to ensure that data ca n’t ‘ escape ’ , in order to be able to make certain guarantees that keep your program working as expected .
Monads like Maybe and list are much less possessive — they are quite happy for you to get the data out .
But by defining the Monad interface in this way , it can handle both cases , and it turns out to be quite convenient for both .
What is the <- in the do notation then ?
It is simply some syntactic sugar that allows you to define the right kind of functions easily and painlessly .
It looks very much like ‘ unpack this data from the monad so I can use it ’ , so it helps conceptually .
In fact , together with the rest of the body of the ‘ do ’ block it forms an anonymous lambda function , and we could write our double function something pretty much like this in Python :
def double ( val ) : return val .
bind ( lambda x : val .
return_ ( x * 2 ))
( I ’ve had to use return_ to avoid the clash with Python ’s ‘ return ’ keyword ) .
Haskell ’s do notation eliminates the explicit call to bind , and the lambda , making it quite a bit easier to use .
This becomes especially important when you have long ‘ do ’ blocks , and functions with multiple monadic input values .
One final thing to say - you will be pleased to learn that in Haskell you can actually use whitespace ( newlines and indentation ) instead of semi-colons and braces !
( OK , OK , calm down you Pythonistas at the back , that ’s enough cheering now ;-) .
I ’ve done a complete example implementation of the List and Maybe monads in Python , along with the double function as above , trying to stay close to how it works in Haskell .
You ca n’t really translate Haskell ’s type system , but Python can do a pretty good job of implementing this , partly due to the fact that non-instance methods can be polymorphic , unlike many other OOP languages .
The code is also a nice example of how succinct functional style code often is — there is n’t a function more than 4 lines long .
Has this helped at all ?
I ’d be interested in any feedback , or corrections .
I ’m a Haskell newbie myself , so I may have got some things wrong , in which case I ’ll pretend that I was simplifying things for the sake of clarity :-) .
Renew Your Passport Now !
If you have a passport , now is the time to renew it — even if it ’s not set to expire anytime soon .
If you do n’t have a passport and think you might need one , now is the time to get it .
In many countries , including the United States , passports will soon be equipped with RFID chips .
And you do n’t want one of these chips in your passport .
RFID stands for “ radio - frequency identification . ”
Passports with RFID chips store an electronic copy of the passport information : your name , a digitized picture , etc .
And in the future , the chip might store fingerprints or digital visas from various countries .
By itself , this is no problem .
But RFID chips do n’t have to be plugged in to a reader to operate .
Like the chips used for automatic toll collection on roads or automatic fare collection on subways , these chips operate via proximity .
The risk to you is the possibility of surreptitious access :
Your passport information might be read without your knowledge or consent by a government trying to track your movements , a criminal trying to steal your identity or someone just curious about your citizenship .
At first the State Department belittled those risks , but in response to criticism from experts it has implemented some security features .
Passports will come with a shielded cover , making it much harder to read the chip when the passport is closed .
And there are now access - control and encryption mechanisms , making it much harder for an unauthorized reader to collect , understand and alter the data .
Although those measures help , they do n’t go far enough .
The shielding does no good when the passport is open .
Travel abroad and you ’ll notice how often you have to show your passport : at hotels , banks , Internet cafes .
Anyone intent on harvesting passport data could set up a reader at one of those places .
And although the State Department insists that the chip can be read only by a reader that is inches away , the chips have been read from many feet away .
The other security mechanisms are also vulnerable , and several security researchers have already discovered flaws .
One found that he could identify individual chips via unique characteristics of the radio transmissions .
Another successfully cloned a chip .
The State Department called this a “ meaningless stunt , ” pointing out that the researcher could not read or change the data .
But the researcher spent only two weeks trying ; the security of your passport has to be strong enough to last 10 years .
This is perhaps the greatest risk .
The security mechanisms on your passport chip have to last the lifetime of your passport .
It is as ridiculous to think that passport security will remain secure for that long as it would be to think that you wo n’t see another security update for Microsoft Windows in that time .
Improvements in antenna technology will certainly increase the distance at which they can be read and might even allow unauthorized readers to penetrate the shielding .
Whatever happens , if you have a passport with an RFID chip , you ’re stuck .
Although popping your passport in the microwave will disable the chip , the shielding will cause all kinds of sparking .
And although the United States has said that a nonworking chip will not invalidate a passport , it is unclear if one with a deliberately damaged chip will be honored .
The Colorado passport office is already issuing RFID passports , and the State Department expects all U.S. passport offices to be doing so by the end of the year .
Many other countries are in the process of changing over .
So get a passport before it ’s too late .
With your new passport you can wait another 10 years for an RFID passport , when the technology will be more mature , when we will have a better understanding of the security risks and when there will be other technologies we can use to cut the risks .
You do n’t want to be a guinea pig on this one .
This op ed appeared on Saturday in the Washington Post .
I ’ve written about RFID passports many times before ( that last link is an op - ed from The International Herald - Tribune ) , although last year I — mistakenly — withdrew my objections based on the security measures the State Department was taking .
I ’ve since realized that they wo n’t be enough .
EDITED TO ADD ( 9/29 ) :
This op ed has appeared in about a dozen newspapers .
The San Jose Mercury News published a rebuttal .
Kind of lame , I think .

2006 : One common recommendation for the use of System 6 is word processing and creative writing .
I ’ve tested three System 6 machines against a typical modern computer – and the results may surprise you !
Prepare for Ludicrous Speed !
Gordon Moore , founder of Intel , observed that computer processor complexity approximately doubled every eighteen months .
This observation has become famous as “ Moore ’s Law ” and predicts that computer performance grows exponentially .
Thus we expect a fairly new ( circa 2005 / 06 ) computer running modern software to perform a simple task like word processing much more quickly than a vintage computer ( circa 1988/89 ) .
After all , it should be approximately 28 times more powerful .
However , it ’s also commonly observed that software expands over time to consume available computing resources .
Anyone who has used Microsoft Word for more than a few version upgrades knows exactly what I ’m talking about .
So what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object ?
That ’s what these tests are meant to reveal .
I ’ve tested several configurations of System 6 Macs as well as a typical modern PC .
I measured their ability to perform two fundamental tasks : ready themselves for use and open a large file .
The results will tell how well System 6 competes with modern offerings – and also how to optimally configure a System 6 machine for maximum performance .
Test -1 - 2-3 !
( Anything but That ! )
Five computer systems were tested : Modern computing is represented by the IBM ThinkCentre on my desk at work .
This PC has a 3 GHz Pentium 4HT processor , 512 MB of RAM , runs Windows 2000 Pro with Word 2002 , and is regularly maintained by the corporate IT department .
System 6 computing is represented by a 1990 8 MHz Macintosh Classic with 4 MB of RAM and a 1989 8 MB Macintosh IIci .
The IIci was tested with its original 25 MHz 68030 and with a 40 MHz DayStar Turbo 040 upgrade .
The Turbo 040 was overclocked to 48 MHz .
A 1990 Mac LC was also tested , but it was n’t used for all tasks .
Each of these System 6 Macs was tested with each of three hard drives : a 40 MB Quantum ProDrive LPS ( stock from the Classic ) , a 320 MB Quantum ProDrive LT ( stock from a Quadra ) , and a 9 GB IBM 7200 rpm drive ( DDRS - 39130 ) .
Each drive was prepared by formatting it with Apple HD SC Setup 7.5.3 ( patched ) and installing System Software 6.0.8 “ for any Macintosh ” .
Two tests were performed on each platform : time to boot into Word and time to import a large file .
For detailed information on the testing procedure , see this article ’s appendix .
Matching the Macs
With a good disk , the overclocked Mac IIci +
DayStar Dream System is amazingly , excessively fast .
In fact , I do n’t believe I ’ve ever used another computer that gave such a feeling of snappiness .
If you ’ve never seen a computer cold - boot in less than 8 seconds , you ’ve gotta try it !
With its original hard drive , the Mac Classic lumbers in with a lazy 45 second boot time .
Compared to the fastest System 6 Macs , this seems almost glacial , but remember that 45 seconds is only three - quarters of a minute .
Flip the power switch , and Word is ready before you ’re done pouring your morning coffee .
As with booting - up , having a 68030 processor is worth a lot of speed in opening my test file of about 120,000 words .
These speeds are fast ; I could barely get repeatable results from my stopwatch .
Note again that even the slowest Mac is quite usable : 7 seconds is n’t a very long time at all .
Careful examination of both graphs shows that the most dramatic improvement in speed comes from upgrading to a 68030 or better processor .
The next largest improvement comes from upgrading to a faster hard drive .
Only once the CPU and hard drive have been upgraded does worrying about clock speed really matter .
Of course , those shooting for Maximum Overdrive will still wanted a loaded 68040 IIci or a “ wicked fast ” IIfx .
The 25 MHz and 48 MHz Mac IIci configurations have shown a commanding lead over the 8 MHz Mac Classic .
Let ’s see where a 16 MHz Mac LC fits into the mix , and then compare them all to a new PC running at up to 375 x faster clock speeds .
Windows Joins the Fray
The Macs hold their own booting into Microsoft Word .
When the PC is forced to boot Windows cold , even the Mac Classic has time to dance some Lindy Hop .
Every System 6 Mac can boot dramatically faster than the Windows PC .
But that ’s not the way a modern PC is often used ….
Surprisingly , even when the PC is allowed to wake - from - sleep , most of the Macs are still in the running .
The Mac LC , at a scant 16 MHz , takes only a handful of seconds longer to boot than the PC takes to wake .
The fastest System 6 Mac cold - boots faster than the PC can wake !
Unfortunately for modernity , the Windows PC just ca n’t pull a lead in this contest .
When fitted with a cheap , new - ish hard disk even the 8 MHz Classic bests it .
Look at the advantage the Mac IIci has – even without a CPU accelerator .
Clearly software bloat is dramatically slowing down the PC !
In Conclusion
For creative writing , System 6 is a real contender .
In two real - world performance tests , time - to - ready and time - to - open , System 6 Macs match or trump a modern PC .
In addition , using System 6 gets you the other advantages of vintage Mac computing .
When tweaking System 6 for performance , upgrading to a 68030 CPU makes the most dramatic difference .
Faster clock speeds add performance , but the differences are much less pronounced .
Instead of pushing for megahertz , look for a surplus hard drive .
At a very low price ( often free ) , any 68030 Mac fitted with a hard drive made after about 1998 will provide impressive speed .
When you need to get your words out before the Muse moves on , remember how speedy these old Macs can be .
I hope you have fun putting one to use !
Appendix : Experiment Procedure
Usually , the biggest complaint against impressive benchmark numbers is “ The procedure is opaque !
How can I reproduce it ? ”
We do n’t let that happen at Low End Mac .
Two tests were performed : Time - to - ready and Time - to - import .
These two tests were chosen because they were circumstances in which I had personally experienced inconvenience with slow computers .
They are also among the few word - processing tests that are n’t heavily user - dependent .
A third test was considered , search - and - replace , but just performing two tests was work enough !
Both test procedures were finalized before any results were measured ; these are n’t fake tests meant to cater to a specific agenda .
All test results are the result of averaging at least three independent trials .
Preparation
The PC received no special preparation ; it is maintained diligently by the corporate IT staff , who presumably know more about Windows than I do .
A shortcut to Word 2002 was placed in my Start Menu / Programs / StartUp directory so that Word would launch automatically .
The Macs needed System 6 installed on them :
All three hard drives were attached to my Macintosh SE /30 and initialized with Apple HD SC Setup 7.5.3 ( patched ) .
The default volume scheme was kept each time ; this resulted in one volume of 40 MB , 320 MB , and 1 GB on the 40 MB , 320 MB , and 9 GB drives , respectively .
Then the System 6.0.8 System Startup and System Additions floppies were used to install System 6 on each drive .
Options chosen were “ System for Any Macintosh , Software for AppleTalk Networking , and Software for all Apple printers ” .
The Microsoft Word 5.1a installer was used to do an “ Easy Install ” on each disk .
Each disk was placed into a Mac , and the Finder ’s “ Set Startup ” command was used to enable MultiFinder and set Word to launch automatically on startup .
Time - to - Ready Procedure
Since self - test is very system - dependent and can be unreliable ; neither the Macs nor the PC were timed from the moment of power - on .
Instead , they were all timed from the first sign of OS loading to improve reliability of results .
For the cold - boot Time - to - Ready test , the PC was powered on .
After POST had completed , timing was started the instant the monitor displayed “ Booting Windows 2000 ” and paused when the Windows Logon window appeared .
I typed in my authentication information and timing resumed when the “ OK ” button was clicked .
Timing was stopped when Microsoft Word appeared and the insertion point first blinked to indicate Word was ready to take input .
In this way , the PC is not penalized for any time it took me to type .
For the PC’s Wake - from - Sleep Time - to - Ready test , the system was cold - booted into Windows .
Then I logged in and logged back out again .
For some reason , the first login after a cold - boot took about 3 times longer than subsequent logins .
Since the Wake - from - Sleep was meant to measure typical behavior , only the subsequent logins were measured .
Microsoft
Word was launched , and the system was put into “ Suspend ” mode by choosing that option in the “ Shut - Down System ” dialog box .
Timing began the moment a key was pressed to wake the system and was completed when Word ’s insertion point first blinked to indicate ready .
For the Macintosh computers , the systems were shut down and powered off .
Then they were switched on , and timing began when the “ Happy Mac ” icon appeared .
Timing was discontinued when Word ’s insertion point first blinked .
Time - to - Import Procedure
First , a test file was created in . txt format by pasting the text of one of my past columns over and over until about 126,000 words was reached .
This file was stored on each system ’s local hard drive .
Word was launched and the File -> Open … command issued .
After navigating to the test file , timing was begun the moment the mouse was released on the OK button .
Again , timing ceased when Word ’s insertion point first blinked to indicate ready - to - take - data .
If anyone wishes to attempt to reproduce these results , I heartily encourage them to do so .
Also , if someone wants to try a search - and - replace benchmark , I look forward to seeing the results .

There is a " sucker punch " aspect of this entire episode , that has been used in the past , that makes it doubly despicable .
The now dead open records issue was so completely outrageous and unexpected that it served its intended purpose – to draw attention away from the many other very contentious and controversial aspects of this budget .
And that was exactly what Walker and the majority Republicans wanted to happen .

The Programmer ’s Stone is a theory and training course on how to think as an effective and adaptable computer programmer and information technology specialist .
Alan Carter and Colston Sanger wrote the guide with the aim to explore , recapture and celebrate the programming art form .
The reader is positioned to become a better programmer , understand the struggles confronting inexperienced programmers , and communicate well with experienced programmers .
Here is a summary of themes .
Mapping versus Packing
Mappers apply the cognitive strategy of populating and integrating mental maps , then reading off the solution to any specific problem .
They find methods for achieving objectives by consulting internal mental maps .
Packers are practised at retaining large numbers of knowledge packets .
They aim to perform the ‘ correct ’ action in any given situation .
Their strategies for dealing with ambiguous circumstances , where there is no satisfactory correct action , are ad hoc .
Mappers experience learning as an internal process which adapts to external and self - generated stimuli .
Packers experience learning as a task to be performed using appropriate methods .
Efficient mapper learning uses intuition to explore conceptual relationships and recognize truth .
Efficient packer learning relies on memorization of knowledge packets , such as standard programming techniques .
Differences and Conflict
A trait of packer thinking that frustrates mappers is that packers appear to have no interest in finding the flaws in their own logic .
Worse still , they may be happy to accept flaws when they are pointed out to them on the basis of convenience – so what ?
The evidence that is tangibly before them is less important than behavior ingrained through repetition .
This is one example of problems arising from the different approaches .
To summarize further deviations and points of conflict :
Packing is the social norm and the world is set up for packers
The results of mapping are called `common sense ’ , which is n’t so common
Mappers think packers are cynical or intellectually lazy
Packers think mappers are unfocused and irrational
Packers spend much of their time playing politics , where reason matters little
Packer psychology is usually understood by packers but less so by mappers
Mapper psychology is often understood by mappers but never understood by packers
Mappers are guides by reason rather than culture
Mappers teach themselves , which packers struggle with , but also learn from others .
Information Systems
Information is the data which have been processed into a form which is meaning full to the recipient and which is of real or perceived value for the intended purpose which , as for as the management is concerned , is likely to be for planning , control or decision making .
Thus data are the raw materials from which information is produced .
An organization ’s information systems might be used to perform a number of tasks simultaneously :
Initiating transactions Recording transactions as they occur Processing data Producing reports .
Responding to enquiries .
Nature of Information Processing
The term “ information processing ” is more appropriate than the outmoded term “ data processing ” as it recognizes that it is information which is important to the management processes of business planning , decision making and control ( techopedia ) .
The preparation of the reports containing information involves subject to the basic facts , i.e. the data , to a number of processing operations which typically include : verification ( when data has been subjected to data conversion into a machine sensible form ) , validation , sorting merging , computing , comparing , updating and printing .
Source of Information
It is important to become aware of all of the potential sources of information available .
Decision making efforts can be hampered if you do not know where to get the information you need or fail to realize that certain information exists .
Observation is the method of obtaining information about tangible things as well as statistics from government agencies , trade publications , and research reports .
Information can be acquired from two basic sources – Internal and External .
Internal sources are with in an organization .
Common internal sources are internally generated documents , observations , and internal surveys .
Internal documents found in most businesses include a balance - sheet , an income statement , employ files , schedule and unscheduled and other files and reports .
Such documents can supply a great deal of information about how a business operates and what its financial condition is .
External surveys are similar to internal surveys except that the individual surveyed are outside the organization that is conducting the survey .
Government agencies compile large amount of information about a wide variety of topics , including gross national product ( GNP ) and population estimates , which can be very important to some businesses .
Most of the information collected by the government agencies is available on request .
Types of Information
There are three types of information : operational , tactical and strategic .
1. Operational Information ( OI )
Operational information ( OI ) is used to ensure that specific tasks are planned and carried out properly with in a factory or office and may feed directly into operating systems .
In the office of payroll , for example , operational information might include the time worked each week by each employ , time each person spend upon individual jobs during the week .
More urgent operational information such as the amount of raw material being put to a production process , may be required daily , hourly , or in the case of automated production , second by second .
2. Tactical Information ( TI )
TI is used to decide how the resources of business should be employed , and to monitor how they are being , and have being employed .
Such information includes productivity measurement budgetary control or variance analysis , and cash flow forecasts , manning levels and profit results with in a particular department of the organization , labor turn over statistics with in a department and short term purchasing requirements .
Tactical Information therefore :
Is primarily generated from internal sources ;
Is summarize although a report might include raw data as backup ;
Is relevant to the short and medium term ; Describes or analysis activities or departments ;
Is based on quantitative measures .
3. Strategic Information ( SI )
SI is used to plane the objectives of their organization and to access whether the objectives are being met in practice .
Such information includes over all profit ability , the profit ability of different segments of business , total manning levels and capital equipment needs .
Strategic Information is therefore :
In a recent article , “ Will the U.S. Defend Itself ? ” , economist Walter Williams seems to make a case for nuclear war on Syria and Iran .
His case cries out for a response .
Here ’s mine .
I preface by noting that Williams and I both earned our Ph.D.s in economics at UCLA and that he is one of my colleagues with the Hoover Institution .
He is also one of my favorite writers on popular economics topics .
He virtually always upholds the principles of economic freedom in his writing and does so crisply , cleanly , and powerfully .
In this recent article , Williams at first seems to be advocating dropping nuclear bombs on Iran and Syria .
Later in the article , Williams retreats briefly from this viewpoint , sort of .
Williams writes :
“ Currently , the U.S. has an arsenal of 18 Ohio class submarines .
Just one submarine is loaded with 24 Trident nuclear missiles .
Each Trident missile has eight nuclear warheads capable of being independently targeted .
That means the U.S. alone has the capacity to wipe out Iran , Syria or any other state that supports terrorist groups or engages in terrorism  without risking the life of a single soldier .
. . .
I ’m not suggesting that we rush to use our nuclear capacity to crush states that support terrorism .
I ’m sure there are other less drastic military options .
What I am suggesting is that I know of no instances where appeasement , such as the current Western modus operandi , has borne fruit . ”
If Williams is not suggesting the use of nuclear weapons , then why did he use most of his article to suggest it ?
And if he thinks “ other less drastic military options ” might work , why does n’t he tell us what these options are ?
A reasonable conclusion is that he might actually want the U.S. government to drop nuclear bombs on people , but does n’t dare say so until he sees what the reaction is .
What is Williams ’s argument for having the U.S. government drop nuclear bombs on people in the Middle East ?
He does n’t really give one .
Williams does n’t bother to establish in what way terrorists in Syria or Iran are a threat to Americans .
The closest he gets is to say that Hezbollah , backed by Iran , was responsible for the 1983 murder of 241 U.S. military members in their barracks in Beirut .
That was a horrible act , but it was an action against Americans on Hezbollah ’s own soil .
If a U.S. terrorist group had attacked and killed 241 Iranian military members that had established barracks in , say , New Jersey , would Williams think that , 23 years later , the Iranian government would be justified in dropping nuclear bombs on people in the United States ?
I think he would n’t .
But why not ?
As long as I have known him , Walter Williams has argued from principle .
What principle would he use to say that it ’s wrong for the Iranian government to bomb Americans in that hypothetical situation ?
If one wants to make a case for dropping nuclear bombs on people in other countries , one has to face up to the Hiroshima problem : was the U.S. government ’s nuclear attack on Hiroshima and Nagasaki justified ?
Williams realizes this and does not hesitate to justify these attacks .
The concern about the innocent lives lost , he writes ,
“ would have fallen on deaf ears during World War II when we [ note his use of “ we ”  to see what ’s wrong with that , go to my ‘ Who is “ We ” ? ’] firebombed cities in Germany and Japan .
The loss of lives through saturation bombing far exceeded those lost through the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki . ”
Williams is right on two out of three facts .
He ’s right about the relative numbers of deaths from fire - bombing vs. atom bombs .
He ’s also right that few U.S. military decision makers during World War II worried about the hundreds of thousands of innocent Japanese killed by the fire - bombing .
He ’s wrong , though , about the atom bomb .
While it ’s true that Secretary of State Jimmy Byrnes and President Harry Truman were particularly hard of hearing on the issue of innocent people being killed by the atom bomb , a large swath of senior U.S. military men thought it was horrible .
I document this in my article , “ Remembering Hiroshima . ”
But notice that Williams avoids making his case .
To say that an objection would have fallen on deaf ears at some time in the past is not to say that the objection has no merit .
Williams would have never made this rhetorical mistake in writing about , say , minimum wage laws .
He , as do I , opposes the minimum wage .
[ For Williams ’s case , see his “ Minimum Wage , Maximum Folly . ”
For my case , see “ If Only Most Americans Understood . ” ]
Williams argues , correctly , that the minimum wage keeps many unskilled workers out of work .
If he were told that such objections fall on deaf Congressional ears , as they seem to lately , he would n’t change his position one iota .
He has never judged a policy by whether he can persuade others .
I think Walter Williams would passionately oppose the minimum wage even if no one listened to him .
And kudos to him .
Why do his standards for argumentation fall so low when he gets to foreign policy ?
And it ’s not just Williams ’s standards for logical argument that seem low when it comes to foreign policy .
One wonders where Williams gets his facts .
Consider this quote from his article :
“ After the battle of Midway , and the long string of Japanese defeats in the Pacific , including Guam , Okinawa and the Philippines , had today ’s Americans been around , they ’d be willing to negotiate with Japan for peace , pointing to the additional loss of lives if we continued the war .
More than likely they would have made the same argument in 1945 , when German defeat was imminent .
Of course , had there been a peace agreement with Japan and Germany , all it would have achieved would have been to give them time to recoup their losses and resume their aggression at a later time , possibly equipped with nuclear weapons . ”
But the U.S. won the battle of Okinawa in June 1945 , when Japan was on its last legs .
The Japanese government was already interested in ending the war , and the main sticking point was whether the “ unconditional surrender ” desired by the U.S. government meant that Japan would have to give up its emperor .
Ironically , after Truman steadfastly refused to let the Japanese know that unconditional surrender did not necessarily mean giving up the emperor  a clarification that would have obviated the need for dropping the bomb  Truman let Japan keep its emperor anyway .
Williams ’s idea that surrendering and keeping the emperor in June or July of 1945 would have allowed the Japanese to “ recoup their losses ” in any militarily threatening way has no support .
In the previous quote , and in the rest of his article , Williams uses the term “ today ’s Americans ” in a denigrating way .
He writes , “ Today ’s Americans are vastly different from those of my generation who fought the life - and - death struggle of World War II . ”
That ’s true in certain ways , but not in the way that ’s most relevant to his argument .
As I document in " Remembering Hiroshima , " Dwight Eisenhower , Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz , Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King , General Douglas MacArthur , Ambassador Joseph Grew , and former president Herbert Hoover , to name a few , all opposed dropping the bomb .
They did so on humanitarian grounds .
Even Curtis LeMay , although he had no humanitarian objection , claimed that the atom bomb had not been necessary for winning the war without invading Japan ’s main islands .
Finally , with regard to minimum wage laws , why does Williams care about unskilled youths not being able to find jobs ?
I think it ’s because he ’s a compassionate man who cares about people trying to make their way in what is often a tough world .
It would be nice if he had the same compassion for the millions of innocent people in Iran and Syria who are trying to make their way in countries that have really horrible governments .

What It Means To Be An Intellectual
A friend sent me an email this morning and at the end of it , almost as an afterthought , he responded to a quote I ’d sent him from an author praising books .
“ He would say that , ” my friend replied , “ he ’s a writer . ”
I want to quibble with this statement — how is it that we can dismiss someone ’s argument simply because of their job ? — but doing so would seem bizarre .
There ’s a social norm that how much we discuss something should be roughly proportional to its importance .
Mountains of print may be spilled on the issues of international relations but spending a couple emails discussing punctuation would seem dreadfully bizarre .
There ’s just one problem : I enjoy deep discussions of punctuation and other trivialities .
I could try to justify this taste — some argument that we should think about everything we do so that we do n’t do everything we think about — but why bother ?
Do I have to justify enjoying certain television shows as well ?
At some point , is n’t pure enjoyment just enough ?
After all , time is n’t fungible .
But of course , the same drive that leads me to question punctuation leads me to question the drive itself , and thus this essay .
What is “ this drive ” ?
It ’s the tendency to not simply accept things as they are but to want to think about them , to understand them .
To not be content to simply feel sad but to ask what sadness means .
To not just get a bus pass but to think about the economic reasons getting a bus pass makes sense .
I call this tendency the intellectual .
The word “ intellectual ” has a bit of a bad rap .
When I think of the word I hear a man with a southern accent sneering at it .
But this stain seems appropriate — the idea has a bad rap .
And why is that ?
One reason is that many people simply do n’t like to think about things .
Perhaps it reminds them of school , which they did n’t enjoy , and they do n’t want to go back there .
Another is that they ’re busy people — men of action — and they do n’t have time to sit and think about every little detail .
But mostly it ’s just because they think it ’s a waste of time .
What ’s the point ?
What difference does it make what you think about punctuation ?
It ’s not going to affect anything .
This is the argument that ’s often used when demonizing intellectuals .
As Thomas Frank summarizes the argument :
The same bunch of sneaking intellectuals are responsible for the content of Hollywood movies and for the income tax , by which they steal from the rest of us .
They do no useful work , producing nothing but movies and newspaper columns while they freeload on the labor of others .
( 116 )
When I think of intellectuals , though , I do n’t really think of Hollywood producers or politicians or even newspaper columnists .
But the people I do think of seem to have something else in common .
They do n’t just love thinking , they love language .
They love its tricks and intricacies , its games , the way it gets written down , the books it gets written into , the libraries those books are in , and the typography those books use .
Upon reflection this makes perfect sense .
Language is the medium of thought and so it ’s no surprise that someone who spends a lot of time thinking spends a lot of time thinking about how to communicate their thoughts as well .
And indeed , all the intellectuals that come to mind write , not because they have to or get paid to , but simply for its own sake .
What good is thinking if you ca n’t share ?
This contrasts with how intellectuals are commonly thought of — namely as pretentious elitist snobs .
But real intellectuals , at least in the sense I ’m using the term , are anything but .
They love nothing more than explaining their ideas so that anyone who ’s interested can understand them .
They only seem pretentious because discussing such things is so bizarre .
This stereotype actually seems more like the caricature of the academic than the intellectual .
( It ’s perhaps worth noting that most of the intellectuals I can think of are n’t academics or at least have left the academy . )
Far from being intellectuals , academics are encouraged to be almost the opposite .
Instead of trying to explain things simply , they ’re rewarded for making them seem more complicated .
Instead of trying to learn about everything , they ’re forced to focus in on their little subdiscipline .
Instead of loving books , they have to love gabbing — up in front of class or at office hour with students or at professional conferences or faculty meetings .
Not that there ’s anything wrong with that .
At the beginning I declined to justify my being an intellectual on any grounds other than pure personal enjoyment .
And here , at the end , I ca n’t think of any better justification .
Certainly people should think deeply about their actions and the world ’s problems and other important topics .
But the other ones ?
That ’s little more than personal preference .

That maple tree in your front yard may be magnificent this time of year , cloaked in the colorful robes of splendor that herald the transition from one season to the next , but you might want to give it even more respect .
It could be a killer .
Researchers at New York 's Colgate University have found evidence that the brilliant red hues of autumn are n't just there for our personal enjoyment .
They 're engaged in a kind of chemical warfare , releasing poisons that could kill off the competition .
Thus maple trees , and probably some other species that turn crimson in the fall , join a growing list of plants that do n't just beat around the bush when other plants start intruding into their space .
They kill them off .
Scientists call it " allelopathy . "
For years scientists have known that black walnut trees are lethal when it comes to protecting their turf .
And more recently , the mighty chestnut tree that once blanketed the Appalachians has come under suspicion .
But the maple tree adds a surprising twist .
How could anything that lovely be deadly ?
Caught Red-Leafed
It all began when Colgate biology professor Frank Frey and a former student , Maggie Eldridge , started looking into a peculiarity involving plants that turn red in the fall .
The predominant colors of autumn break out when chlorophyll in the leaves breaks down and exposes remaining pigments , which are often yellow or orange .
But it takes a different process to produce red .
That is n't a pigment that is left over when everything else is gone .
Instead , it 's produced in the fall , at the very time when the tree is struggling to cope with the energy demands of a changing and challenging season .
Why , Frey and Eldridge wondered , did the maple go to all that trouble at a time when it needed its metabolic energy for other purposes , like stimulating the growth of its root system ?
So they collected chemical extracts from red and green maple leaves and yellow and green beech leaves and poured it over lettuce seeds .
Some previous research had shown that wood extracts from red maple and red cedar inhibited the growth of lettuce .
But Frey and Eldridge found that red maple is the clear winner .
It " dramatically reduced germination and growth compared to all other treatments , " they say in a study that is soon to be published .
" When scarlet - tinted autumn leaves are dropped in the fall , it appears that anthocyanins ( molecules that produce the red color ) leach from the leaves into the soil and protect seedlings and saplings from interspecific competition the following spring , " Frey says .
In other words , no one but maples allowed .
All of this has a practical purpose .
As Frey notes , other research shows that anthocyanins may inhibit the growth of some cancer cells in vertebrates , so eventually there may be a medicinal application .
Other researchers see this kind of chemical warfare as a possible pathway to better weed control .
And it has opened a surprising window on just how ruthless some species may be when it comes to protecting their turf .
Combative Chestnuts
For decades scientists thought that the dominance of the chestnut tree in the Appalachian forests was due to its own personal majesty .
It was a fast grower , rapidly shading any competing trees .
It resisted rot and fire , and was happy in poor soil .
But along comes ecologist Barry Clinton of the U.S. Forest Service 's Southern Research Station in North Carolina with some shocking news :
The mighty chestnut , it turns out , was engaged in a little skullduggery .
Clinton and colleagues at Clemson University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill tested the effects of fallen chestnut leaves on five tree species that competed for the same space .
They found that an extract from the leaves inhibited germination of the competing trees -- particularly eastern hemlock , a major species along mountain streams in the Appalachians .
It also curtailed the growth of a native rhododendron .
But that colorful shrub may have won out in the end .
The chestnuts were wiped out by a blight years ago , and since that time the rhododendrons have flourished .
The rapid encroachment of this shrub " may be largely due to the end of the tree 's allopathic influence , " Clinton says .
Other Botanical Killers
Other trees known to poison their competitors include sycamore , eucalyptus , hackberry , and the notorious black walnut .
Black walnut produces the chemical juglone , which can spell trouble for a wide variety of trees and plants .
Researchers have found , for example , that black walnut can inhibit corn production even if the trees are some distance from corn stalks .
However , lest we be accused of slamming only deciduous trees , it should be noted that even pine trees are not without their chemical weapons .
Pine needles decompose after falling to the ground , releasing an acid that leaches into the soil .
That keeps almost anything from sprouting near the tree 's roots .
And lastly , the next time someone tells you how broccoli is good for you , tell them that broccoli plants leave a residue in the soil that makes it difficult for some other crops to follow .
It may be a super - food , but it 's not without its faults .

Miers withdraws Supreme Court nomination
Troubled pick faced opposition from conservatives , liberals
Bush nominated Miers on October 3 , and the nominee ran into opposition almost from the start .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush on Thursday accepted the withdrawal of Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers after weeks of opposition from both liberals and conservatives , who questioned her qualifications and record .
In her withdrawal letter to the president , Miers said she was " concerned that the confirmation process presents a burden for the White House and its staff and it is not in the best interest of the country . "
In a statement , Bush said he " reluctantly accepted " her withdrawal .
The White House said Miers had to withdraw over concerns that senators wanted documents of privileged discussions between the president and his top lawyer .
( Watch video : Withdrawal accepted -- 1:38 )
" It is clear that senators would not be satisfied until they gained access to internal documents concerning advice provided during her tenure at the White House -- disclosures that would undermine a president 's ability to receive candid counsel , " Bush said in the statement .
( Full statement ) ( Miers ' letter )
Bush vowed to fill the vacancy " in a timely manner . "
( View potential nominees )
" Harriet Miers ' decision demonstrates her deep respect for this essential aspect of the constitutional separation of powers -- and confirms my deep respect and admiration for her , " Bush added .
Bush 's decision to nominate Miers , 60 , White House counsel and a longtime adviser , had divided his supporters , many of whom wanted a nominee with a clear record of opposition to abortion and solid views on other legal issues important to conservatives .
( Read more on why Miers withdrew )
The White House learned from a key Capitol Hill ally Wednesday night that opposition to the nomination was building , CNN's Ed Henry reported .
( Watch an overview of what can be learned from Miers ' nomination -- 1:53 )
In a blunt assessment , Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas , Miers ' main advocate in the Senate , told high - level White House aides that the nominee faced stiff opposition from conservatives , and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist called White House Chief of Staff Andy Card to tell him that Miers did not have the votes to be confirmed , sources told Henry .
However , Ed Gillespie , a Republican strategist heavily involved in Miers ' nomination and the previous one for Chief Justice John Roberts , maintained that the nomination process forced her to withdraw , not opposition from conservative activists .
" I do n't think there was a mistake , and we 're not red - faced at all , " Gillespie said .
" She , I think , rightly and in a principled manner came to the conclusion that there was about to be a conflict between her role as nominee and the principle she 's espoused as White House counsel and counsel to the president . "
Gillespie said if the White House released communication between Miers and the president it " would compromise the integrity for the ability of her staff to have a candid conversation with any future president . "
But Democratic and Republican senators said that they had n't asked for privileged documents .
" We were not asking for documents regarding attorney - client privilege -- or privileged communications , " Judiciary Committee member Sen .
Sam Brownback , R - Kansas , said .
" We were saying , ' Show us documents of policy issues discussions , ' so we could get some framework of her policy views . "
Withdrawal applauded
Sen . Trent Lott , R- Mississippi , said Miers ' withdrawal was probably for the best .
" I think she made the right decision , and I think she deserves a lot of credit for realizing that this was going to be very difficult , particularly in view of her position as White House counsel , " Lott said .
( Watch video : Sen . Lott 's statements -- 5:40 )
" I just was concerned that she was not strong enough , dynamic enough and had enough experience in the constitutional area to be on the Supreme Court .
It was not a philosophical , regional , religious thing with me . "

Miers ' withdrawal also was applauded by conservative activists , many of whom opposed the nomination from the beginning .
" The president did the right thing in withdrawing her and saving her from further embarrassment , " the Eagle Forum 's Phyllis Schlafly said .
" I now hope he 'll deliver on his campaign commitment to pick a judge in the mold of [ Clarence ] Thomas and [ Antonin ] Scalia . "
( Read more reaction from conservative activists )
In a statement , the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition said : " These have been a difficult few weeks as the Senate and the public measured Harriet Miers and her fitness to serve on our nation 's highest court .
...
" As the president considers a new nominee for the court vacancy , I trust that he will find someone who , like him , is a person of strong and identifiable principles -- one who has participated fully in the important public policy debates . "
Some conservatives argued that Bush could have prevented this impasse over the nomination .
" It was avoidable had the president nominated someone who fit his own description of the kind of judicial philosophy he preferred .
If he 'd done that , this would not have happened , " said Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council .
" I do n't think that anyone knew where she stood and that was the problem . "
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid , who said he had recommended that Bush nominate Miers , blamed " the radical right wing of the Republican Party " for killing her nomination .
( Watch video : Democrats ' statements -- 3:40 )
" Apparently , Ms. Miers did not satisfy those who want to pack the Supreme Court with rigid ideologues , " the Nevada Democrat said .
Charges of cronyism , questions on qualifications
CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the questions about her lack of experience in constitutional law , her closeness to the president and conservative activists ' unhappiness ultimately led to Miers ' withdrawal .
" The Republicans would welcome an ideological fight , " Toobin said .
" The problem was Harriet Miers did n't present that sort of clean fight . "
Bush nominated Miers on October 3 to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , often a moderate swing vote , on the high court .

O'Connor will stay on the court until the Senate confirms her replacement .

Days after announcing her nomination , Bush defended Miers against Democratic charges of cronyism and conservatives ' questions about her record , saying she shared his legal philosophy .
" I picked the best person I could find , " Bush said .
" People are going to be amazed at her strength of character and her intellect . "

Guriya completed five years of study in nine months
Two years ago , she could not read or write .
This week she addressed a United Nations children 's conference in London where she was hailed as a model in self - improvement .
The unassuming , giggling teenager is from one of India 's poorest states , Bihar .
The UN 's children 's fund ( Unicef ) chose her to represent the socially excluded children of India - those who have been deprived because of poverty and their social class - at the launch of Unicef 's report on The State of the World 's Children 2006 .
' Purdah '
Guriya is one of six children from a poor Muslim family in the Karmadi village in Gaya district of Bihar state .
She has seen dire poverty .
Guriya had been a child labourer since she was nine - years old
Her father , Mohammad Salim Ansari , is an unskilled labourer , working across the country in Mumbai ( Bombay ) .
Her mother , Rehana Khatoon , is a farm labourer in the village .
When Guriya turned nine , she started working as a labourer on the farm with her mother .
Her younger sister took over Guriya 's role of looking after the home and the other children .
Guriya says she had always wanted to study but she faced stiff opposition from her family .
" My mother said we are Muslims and in our community girls are kept in purdah so how dare I speak of studying and moreover we could not afford it ... we are too poor . "
But Guriya 's insistence paid off and she was sent to a local Islamic school ( madrassa ) for four hours every day .
But she had to promise her mother that she would do all the household chores after school .
But after only a few months her parents found they could no longer afford the school fees .
After returning to work as a child labourer , Guriya got her chance to study when volunteers from a women 's development programme , Mahila Samakhya Samiti , visited the village to speak about free education .
Guriya convinced her mother to let her go to the organisation 's informal residential school for nine months in September 2003 .
Long walk to school
At the school she met other girls from similar backgrounds .
Guriya walks eight km everyday to her school
In nine months she completed five years worth of studies and learned to read , write , as well as karate , yoga , painting , embroidery and other skills .
After completing the course she joined a regular government school in the next village and is now in seventh standard .
Seeing Guriya 's transformation , four of her friends from the village were also enrolled in school and now three of her sisters and a few cousins have started their education .
Guriya is prepared to put up with hardship .
" I walk eight kilometres to school every day with my friends and then in the afternoon we all sit in our courtyard and I help others with their school work , " she says .
Anupam Srivastava is the communications officer for Unicef in Bihar and says Guriya 's spirit set her apart .
" We were looking for someone who can represent socially excluded children in India .
Guriya has individual strength by which she has overcome her circumstances but what makes her special is that she is committed to helping other children in her village study and learn "
Karate
Guriya is prepared to be tough with adults .
Guriya wants to be a karate teacher
" My friend was being married off , so I told her father that if you get her married before she is 18 , the police will come and get you for breaking the law , so do you want to go to jail ?
I told my parents the same thing , " she laughs .
Today Guriya dreams of being a karate teacher .
" I want to teach karate , I am teaching the girls in my school as well .
You need to learn to protect yourself or else you will be always scared .
I also want to go to college eventually but I do not plan that much for the future . "
During her first time in London she was not nervous , but excited about the prospect of addressing a huge audience .
" I told the governments and especially the parents that they should send their children to school .
" I told children that even if you are faced with millions of troubles and poverty there is no reason to be scared as you have to be brave and it feels nice at the end . "
With an enthusiastic ' yes ' she finished her interview , perhaps the only word in English she picked up for her trip to London .
Unicef and the Bihar government have promised to help her continue her studies .
So it seems Guriya may actually realise her dream of teaching karate and going to college .
You know the War Party is in trouble when a prominent Republican like Senator Chuck Hagel ( R - Nebraska ) starts criticizing their policies of endless war and repression on the home front , as in this Fox News interview .
Notice how the Fox News war - bot , Chris Wallace , tries to trap him in a partisan vise :
“ Let ’s go over some of your positions and put them up on the screen .
You favor direct talks with Iran , Syria and Hamas .
Three weeks ago you called for an immediate truce with Hezbollah , saying the Israeli offensive was hurting our standing in the Middle East .
You ’ve been very critical , as we ’ve just heard , of U.S. policy in Iraq .
And you have problems with NSA wiretaps and parts of the Patriot Act .
When it comes to national security , are you closer to John Kerry than you are to George W. Bush ? ”
Wallace also tries to paint Hagel as a Ned Lamont clone , but the Senator  and , we ’ll bet , the voting public  is n’t buying it :
“ I do n’t base my analysis and judgment and votes on war , national security , on a party position .
I do n’t think that ’s the right thing to do .
I do n’t think Americans really want us to do that .
“ Now , if you look at my record , my voting record  I ’ve been in the Senate 10 years .
Do you have any idea what my voting record is in support of the Bush administration position the last six years , the Republican Party ?
It ’s about 95 percent over 10 years .
My record is about as conservative as any conservative Republican in the United States Senate .
It is constantly  the American Conservative Union constantly rates me as one of the highest .
So I do n’t apologize , Chris , to you or anyone else for my position .
My conservative credentials are pretty clear . ”
Right on , Senator !
You do n’t have to apologize to the neocons for your critique of their eminently anti-conservative foreign policy : after all , what could be more revolutionary , more destabilizing , more antithetical to the conservative agenda than a crusade to conquer the world ?
And , from what I hear , their conservative credentials are n’t all that solid : how many of these guys were Trotskyites ( or , at best , Scoop Jackson Democrats ) only up until relatively recently ?
Hagel , widely expected to launch a bid for the White House , is n’t alone on the Right in opposing the neocons ’ war .
George Will has recently excoriated the War Party for its hubris , its blindness , and for what he calls its “ unrealism . ”
The American Conservative magazine has been among the best of the antiwar periodicals , building up an intellectually substantial  and growing  base of foreign policy “ realists ” who oppose the neocon agenda .
Pat Buchanan , a founding editor of TAC , was against the Iraq war  including Iraq War I  from the beginning .
What is interesting , however , is that the Republican base is beginning to crack .
A majority believe the President has made a lot of mistakes when it comes to the war : Hagel , who has said that the White House is “ completely disconnected from reality ” on the question of foreign policy , senses the shifting mood of conservative voters , and is moving to position himself as the only realist in the GOP pack .
It is going to be a winning position , as the war in Iraq goes from bad to worse and the prospect of war with Iran darkens the political horizon .
The American people are war - weary , and not without reason : they see that the occupation of Iraq is winning us nothing but more enemies , and is n’t making us any safer here at home .
Yet the War Party shows no signs of being properly chastised .
In response to Will ’s critique , White House strategic initiatives director Peter H. Wehner declared : “ Mr. Will ’s kind of ‘ stability ’ and ‘ realism ’  a kind of world - weary belief that nothing can be done and so nothing should be tried  would eventually lead to death and destruction on a scale that is almost unimaginable . ”
What is almost unimaginable is the extent to which this administration is so completely the captive of its own hyperbolic rhetoric : to these people , there are no ordinary disasters , only “ death and destruction ” on a Wagnerian scale .
These people have what George W. Bush called in his infamous second inaugural address “ a fire in the mind , ” which is , in reality , a fever in the brain  a sign of profound dysfunction .
Just how unhinged the neocons have become is exemplified by their calls for yet more wars  with Iran , Syria , and god - knows - who - else , when a full 61 % of the American people oppose the current war .
What world are these people living in ?
We are on the brink of disaster in Iraq , and the situation in Lebanon threatens , daily , to veer out of control and spark a wider war .
Yet there is hope : Hagel ’s dissent , and the growing disharmony on the Right over the war is an indication that the War Party ’s support is plummeting where it counts  in the Republican heartland .
Once these people desert the President , and his neoconservative confreres , it is the beginning of the end for them .
On the receiving end of a strong right hook , the neocons are staggering and may yet fall .
That is why we at Antiwar.com have always emphasized  even over - emphasized  opposition to our interventionist foreign policy coming from the Right side of the political spectrum .
Here , listen to what Senator Hagel has to say about the link between foreign and domestic policy , and see if you do n’t think , as I do , that it has genuine appeal , and not just to conservatives and antiwar liberals :
“ Where is the fiscal responsibility of the party I joined in ’ 68 ?
Where is the international engagement of the party I joined , fair , free trade , individual responsibility , not building a bigger government , but building a smaller government ?
I think we ’ve lost our way . ”
God bless Senator Hagel , and let us hope he has the courage to take his campaign for realism in foreign policy to the American people .
They are certainly ready for it : I know I am .
Apple has apparently begun bundling a soft fabric slip - case with its iPod Nano , recent buyers of the diminutive digital - music player have claimed .
According to a forum post on iPod fan website iLounge , the new cases are white and stamped with the iPod logo .
Essentially it 's the same type of case that ships with the new video iPod , but slimmed down so the Nano fits more snuggly .
A series of pictures of the case have been posted here .
So is this tacit recognition on Apple 's part that the Nano is particularly scratch - prone ?
' Tacit ' it certainly is - there 's no mention of the case on Apple 's iPod Nano website or on the AppleStore Nano purchase page .
The latter fact suggests the company has n't reprinted the box art , just simply tucked the case in among the carton 's other contents .
Whether it's an admission that there 's a problem or not , the move should ensure that virgin Nanos remain less likely to be scratched by users who treat them less carefully than other iPod owners do .
Apple 's spreadsheets no doubt show it 's cheaper to give away the free case than than take the cost of replacing scratched Nanos , no matter how few are returned . ®

It 's been a while since I submitted a story ... here is some food for thought !
What will programming look like in 20 years ?
Maybe it will be based on a " definitive language " like the speculations of the article Convergence in language design : a case of lightning striking four times in the same place ( FLOPS 2006 ) .
Such a language will have a layered structure and its handling of concurrency is important .
( Whether it is dynamically or statically typed is of absolutely no importance , BTW . )
How will we program with such a language ?
Maybe we will program with feedback loops , as explained in Self management and the future of software design ( FACS 06 ) .
This seems to be one way to handle complexity , the inevitability of software and hardware faults , and managing global behavior of a system .
I am coordinating a new project , SELFMAN , that is looking at this .
Comments ?
The POST method is vastly overused in HTML forms , with negative consequences for the user experience .
POST requests cannot be bookmarked , linked to , indexed , searched , or cached .
For example , recently I wanted to link to a list of top independent albums from RIAA Radar .
However I could n’t becuase the search request was sent via POST .
The URL was http://www.riaaradar.com/search.asp, but there was nothing in the URL to indicate whether I was searching for Black Box Recorder or Britney Spears .
All safe requests should be done with GET .
GET is vastly friendlier to users and dramatically improves your search engine placement .
( In fact , form results sent with POST might as well be invisible to search engines . )
POST should only be used for requests that cause some action to be taken : a book to be ordered , a page to be printed , a contract to be signed , etc .
Search results and many other things do n’t fall into this category .
I later discovered that there are URLs for the searches I was trying at RIAA Radar that do include all relevant information in the URL so I can link to them .
However the fact remains that at least one form on their site specifies POST for search requests .
Out of curiosity I saved a local copy and changed the method to GET .
Would n’t you know it ?
The form worked .
That is , their specific server side script accepts the same requests via GET or POST .
This dual method approach is a common antipattern in web apps .
You should never have the same script that blithely accepts the same parameters via GET or POST and returns the same value .
The script should pick one and stick to it .
If the script is safe , then use GET .
If the script is unsafe ( i.e. has side effects ) use POST .
However it is not appropriate to pick both .
That either loses search engine juice and linkability ( using POST where GET is called for ) or opens security holes ( using GET where POST is called for ) .
On rare occasions you will see a script that does different things when invoked via GET or POST .
For instance , a GET to http://www.example.com/forums/birds might return an index page showing the current posts in the forum , while a POST to that page might add a new entry in the forum .
However , a different script is used ( or at the very least a different action is taken ) and different parameters are sent depending on whether a GET or POST is sent to that URL .
It would still be wrong if one could add the POST ’s parameters to the URL ’s query string , and thereby add a new entry in the forum .
Many sites still tell you , incorrectly , that whether to use GET or POST has something to do with how much data you ’re sending .
That ’s false .
It ’s a statement based on bugs in early browsers that has n’t been true any time this millennium .
Choosing GET or POST has nothing to do with how much data you ’re sending and everything to do with whether you want readers to be able to find you .
GET allows bookmarks , links , and search engine placement .
POST does n’t .
It ’s as simple as that .

The world 's smallest known fish can measure as little as 7.9mm
Individuals of the Paedocypris genus can be just 7.9 mm long at maturity , scientists write in a journal published by the UK's Royal Society .
But they warn long - term prospects for the fish are poor , because of rapid destruction of Indonesian peat swamps .
The fish have to survive in pools of acid water in a tropical forest swamp .
" This is one of the strangest fish that I 've seen in my whole career , " said Ralf Britz , a zoologist at the Natural History Museum in London , UK .
" It 's tiny , it lives in acid and it has these bizarre grasping fins .
I hope we 'll have time to find out more about them before their habitat disappears completely . "
The new fish was discovered by Maurice Kottelat ( from Switzerland ) and Tan Heok Hui from the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research in Singapore , while working with colleagues from Indonesia and with Kai - Erik Witte from the Max Planck Institute in Germany .
Ralf Britz helped analyse the animal 's skeleton and the complex structure of the pelvic fin .
Human threat
Paedocypris can sustain their small bodies grazing on plankton near the bottom of their water pools .
To keep their size down , the fish have abandoned many of the attributes of adulthood - a characteristic hinted at in their name .
Their brain , for example , lacks bony protection and the females have room to carry just a few eggs .
The males have a little clasp underneath that might help them fertilize eggs individually .
Being so small , the fish can live through even extreme drought , by seeking refuge in the last puddles of the swamp ; but they are now threatened by humans .
Widespread forest destruction , drainage of the peat swamps for palm oil plantations and persistent fires are destroying their habitat .
Science may have discovered Paedocypris just in time - but many of their miniature relatives may already have been wiped out .
There have been claims for even smaller fish but some researchers dispute whether the specimens measured were truly adult forms .
It might seem strange now that they were happy to take on a random applicant with absolutely no experience in computer programming .
But in those days , almost nobody had any experience writing code .
The discipline did not yet really exist ; there were vanishingly few college courses in it , and no majors .
( Stanford , for example , did n’t create a computer - science department until 1965 . )
So instead , institutions that needed programmers just used aptitude tests to evaluate applicants ’ ability to think logically

How spamgourmet works
If you give your email address to everyone , you are bound to receive spam emails , and you wo n't know where they came from .
Would n't it be convenient to give a different email address to every business or web site , while getting all your email as before ?
Would n't it be easiest to assume the address will be given to spammers , and have it work as a spam blocker by shutting off automatically unless you decide otherwise ?
That 's exactly what spamgourmet offers !
There is nothing to install on your computer , and once you 're set up , it 's likely you wo n't ever have to come back here .
This is what makes spamgourmet one of the most convenient and effective anti-spam tools available .
Protect yourself from spam in three easy steps : 1 . If you have n't done it yet , create a spamgourmet account .
Enter your user name and the email address you want to be protected .
You will be asked to identify the word in a picture and pick a password .
2 . Spamgourmet will forward to this address all the emails sent to your spamgourmet addresses -- that way you do n't have to tell anyone else what it is -- this is why it 's called the protected address .
Of course , this protected address must exist .
That 's why you have to confirm it .
You 'll receive an email asking you to confirm .
3 . After you have confirmed your protected address , you can give out self - destructing email addresses whenever you want .
The spamgourmet addresses are like : someword.x.user@spamgourmet.com where someword is a word you have never used before , x ( optional ) is the number of email messages you want to receive at this address ( up to 20 , and the number 3 will be used if you leave it out ) , and user is your username .
For example , if your user name is " spamcowboy " , and BigCorp wants you to give them your email address ( on the web , on the phone , at a store - it does n't matter ) , instead of giving them your protected address , give them this one : frombigcorp.3.spamcowboy@spamgourmet.com
( and frombigcorp.spamcowboy@spamgourmet.com will work the same way )
This spamgourmet email address will be created here the first time BigCorp uses it ( you do n't have to do anything to create it ) , and you 'll receive at most 3 messages , forwarded to your protected address .
The rest will be indelicately consumed .

It 's Easy If You Know How !
In the last two years , everyone flying on a commercial airline has stepped up to an airline 's ticket counter and heard the agent recite a familiar litany .
The monologue goes , " has your bag been unattended ; have you accepted gifts from a stranger ; can I see your identification please ? "
The traveler docilely murmurs answers , and produces a driver 's license or some equivalent .
As a die - hard Constitutionalist , I believe that we still have an absolute , unfettered , God - given right to travel from point A to point B without permission from the state -- in the air , as well as on land .
This Nazi procedure of " your papers , please " has never been appropriate for our country .
I have had occasion to travel a good deal in the last several months , and on those trips I decided to research and test this issue about the necessity for producing identification .
I have talked with agents , and their supervisors , of several major airlines in cities across America , and have gradually pieced together a rather complete picture of the real legal situation regarding our right to travel .
Next , I tested this finding with several airlines .
When asked for identification , I produced only my Sam's Club card , or my travel agent 's ID card , or a Costco card .
These are all picture ID 's , but they are privately issued , and do not even have a signature on them .
The airline agents just freaked out , and demanded to see some state - issued ID .
They routinely told me that " it was federal law ! "
The government absolutely required me to cough up an " official " ID card , without which the agent could n't even THINK of letting me on the plane .
I told the agents that I could not find any federal regulation mandating that type of identification , and then asked them to cure my ignorance and please cite the regulation .
Now , at this point , individual airline agents have reacted differently .
Some called in their supervisor .
Alaska
Air employees were the most gracious ; Northwest agents were the worst -- they were rude , belligerent and hostile brats .
But they all folded , every time .
A particularly nasty Northwest employee marched me all the way back to the electronic detection equipment , made me pass through it a second time , and had the guard thoroughly search my carry - on bag .
The same airline agent - from - hell actually made rude and demeaning remarks to me as we trudged back to the counter -- and then she let me on the plane .
Alaska
Air was much more reasonable -- the agent just issued my seat pass , and commented that some people seem tenaciously to hold the thought that they have the right to travel without producing government ID -- to which I responded , " yes , amazing , is n't it -- and I 'm one of them . "
In Seattle , an agent said AS HE HANDED ME MY TICKET , " you know , if you do n't show me any government - issued ID , I can't let you board the plane . "
I replied , Yes , I understand .
But I did n't , and you are .
With a smile , he just said , " have a nice trip . "
So I have flown several times using only my meager privately issued picture ID cards .
Every time I used this strategy , I noticed that the agent put an orange sticker on my checked bags , and also on my seat pass on the ticket .
Several agents divulged that this is the policy they are supposed to follow when a person does not show government ID .
The bags simply wait in the baggage room until the person presents the matching seat pass as he / she actually boards the plane ; then the bags go on board .
On my next trip , I decided to push the envelope even further .
When the Alaska Air agent made the usual perfunctory request for identification , I put on my best face , smiled sweetly , and said , " Gee , I 'm so sorry , but I just do n't have any ID I could show you . "
To my speechless astonishment , the agent just said , " no problem -- just fill out this simple form , and present it to the counter at the airplane gate . "
I watched as the familiar orange sticker again went on my bag .
I repeated the same scenario with Horizon Air on another trip .
I have now flown twice without producing any identification whatsoever .
Northwest was actually instrumental in advancing my education about this issue .
I was so aggravated by the insolent and hostile treatment that their employee gave me , ( hopefully former employee , after the blistering letter I sent to the company president ) , that I demanded to see a supervisor on the spot .
I then demanded that he produce the relevant federal regulations RIGHT NOW , or face personal liability for authorizing an unreasonable search and seizure , dereliction of duty , fraud , conspiracy , civil rights deprivation and any other legal buzz words I could think of at that moment which would justify a lawsuit against him personally , as well as his employer .
Like everyone else , he could n't show me any statute or regulations .
He even admitted that there are none .
However , he did produce a copy of Security Directive 96- 05 , which the Federal Aviation Agency issued to all airlines in August of 1996 .
Its wording is very instructive ; it reads as follows : 1 . IDENTIFY THE PASSENGER - A. ALL PASSENGERS WHO APPEAR TO BE 18 YEARS OF AGE WILL PRESENT A GOVERNMENT ISSUED PICTURE ID , OR TWO OTHER FORMS OF ID , AT LEAST ONE OF WHICH MUST BE ISSUED BY A GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY .
B. THE AGENT MUST RECONCILE THE NAME ON THE ID AND THE NAME ON THE TICKET -- EXCEPT AS NOTED BELOW .
C. IF THE PASSENGER CANNOT PRODUCE IDENTIFICATION , OR IT CANNOT BE RECONCILED TO MATCH THE TICKET , THE PASSENGER BECOMES A " SELECTEE . "
CLEAR ALL OF THEIR LUGGAGE AS NOTED IN SECTION 6 , BELOW .
6 . CLEAR SELECTEE'S CHECKED AND CARRY -ON LUGGAGE , AND SUSPICIOUS ARTICLES DISCOVERED BY THE QUESTIONS ASKED ; A. IF THE SELECTEE IS ON A FLIGHT WITHIN THE 48 CONTINENTAL US STATES , OR TO MEXICO , OR TO CANADA , ITEMS CAN BE CLEARED BY EITHER OF THE FOLLOWING METHODS : 1 . EMPTY THE LUGGAGE OR ITEM AND PHYSICALLY SEARCH ITS CONTENTS BY A QUALIFIED SCREENER , OR ; 2 . BAG - MATCH -- ENSURE THE BAG IS NOT TRANSPORTED ON THE AIRCRAFT IF THE PASSENGER DOES NOT BOARD .
B. IF THE SELECTEE IS ON AN INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT -- CHECKED LUGGAGE , CARRY -ON LUGGAGE , AND SUSPECT ITEMS CAN BE CLEARED ONLY BY THE FOLLOWING METHOD ; EMPTY THE LUGGAGE OR ITEM AND PHYSICALLY SEARCH ITS CONTENTS BY QUALIFIED SCREENERS .
This document apparently goes on for ten more pages ; the Northwest supervisor gave me only the first page , which contains the information printed above .
The next time I refused to produce ID and the agent freaked , I told her , " just tap up Sec - Dec 96 - 5 on your computer , and go to Paragraph 1 , Section C. Designate me as a ' selectee , ' and proceed accordingly .
She apparently thought I was an FAA undercover employee , because she said that she was " tired of you federal guys coming around " and literally spying on airline agents , " coercing us into lying to people , and essentially being the ' bag man ' for an activity which has no legal requirement . "
I told her that I could not agree more .
Another airline employee later confirmed that FAA agents often engage in such entrapment activities , to make sure that airline agents parrot the government party line about state - issued ID .
I also hit pay dirt in a discussion with another , much nicer Northwest agent on the East coast .
In a candid conversation , he told me that FAA personnel had held training sessions with all airline agents in the fall of 1996 .
Agents were informed directly by the FAA that they absolutely could not bar an American citizen from boarding a plane , even if a passenger refused to produce any identification at all !
I understand Delta Airline is facing two large lawsuits because employees twice denied this reality , and actually twice kept off a plane a passenger who had only private ID to show .
Anyone want to own an airline , courtesy of a judge ?
I have personally flown Delta with only a private travel card , so I guess they already had their hand slapped .
Yet another agent in the Midwest admitted that airline personnel were deliberately and knowingly coercing people into showing government ID by saying " it 's the law . "
According to him the reality is that the companies are simply tired of people selling their frequent - flyer tickets .
The airlines wanted to stem this practice by checking everyone 's ID , but knew there would be BIG problems if they instituted this procedure as a private corporate policy .
It was so much more convenient to say it was federal law and make the government the scapegoat .
So this policy meets the airlines ' private financial goals , and the government 's goal of ever - increasing social control .
If no one complains or asserts their rights regarding travel , then another freedom is " poof " gone .
Our children watch this happen , and grow up thinking that the state has both the right to define our identity by issuing documents saying who we are , and also the right to require us to produce them on demand .

A new study suggests that private schools are not inherently better than public schools .
Surprised ?
Enough people were such that the study , funded by the US Department of Education , has created a stir in the education arena , as well as in the national news .
But I want to argue that the results are meaningless , and for reasons not having to do with the methodology employed in the study .
The authors of Comparing Private Schools and Public Schools Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling analyzed math and reading scores of nearly 7,000 public schools and more than 500 private schools on the 2003 National Assessment of Educational Progress at the fourth and eighth grades .
NAEP was the chosen assessment tool since it is considered to be the national achievement test and is used to assess student academic performance against national standards .
Though the title sounds impressive , the findings simply suggest a conclusion .
Nothing has really been proven and no new truths exposed .
I could begin by questioning the whole concept of empirical studies that suggest this or suggest that .
I could ask , " What truths have been brought to light by any study that is couched in such a vague qualifier ? "
I could attack all the assumptions that went into the model and then list those that did not .
Had I gone that route , I hopefully would have raised enough doubt in the reader that the study would be discarded as worthless .
But the real error here is more philosophical than empirical .
Studies such as these simply show that a deeper ill exists , a malaise caused by government interventionism .
Consider Consumer Reports
The popular magazine reviews consumer goods based on a proprietary set of standards .
They test , analyze , test , analyze , etc. , until they are satisfied as to the quality of the products under review .
CR then assigns individual product ratings and notes one product as a best buy .
Though most Americans accept CR 's results as being of excellent quality , the noted best buy is not usually the market best - seller .
Yes , I will occasionally look at CR prior to purchasing a good , but I almost never buy the best buy .
I agree that the CR results are scientifically valid based on their standards , but that does n't mean I am in the market for the scientifically valid , CR best - buy product .
Though it may only last six months , I want the new hairdryer complete with the latest features , bathed in the hottest colors .
That 's my choice .
My preference rank for features and colors is above that for durability .
Who is to say that I am wrong ?
In a free market , anyone .
But , they can not force me to act otherwise .
What would happen if Consumer Reports had legislative and regulatory authority akin to government ?
We would all be forced to purchase the best buy and we would all spend our lives unsatisfied .
On the surface it sounds great to have a leading research organization controlling the market for " the general good and welfare , " but consider your own actions vis - à - vis CR 's best buys .
The same holds for a government - run education system .
Even if the federal government mandated a set of standards that were scientifically valid according to the DOE national outcomes , the set of standards and outcomes would not be the standards and outcomes most Americans would choose as acting individuals .
Scientific research can create goods that are bigger , smaller , faster , slower , etc .
But just because research can create the good does n't mean that there is a market for it .
No one wants a hypodermic needle that is rougher , wider , longer , etc .
The superlatives associated with improvements and innovations from scientific research are not always desired by consumers .
In education , the best that DOE could be is a truly benevolent authority .
It could gather the nation 's greatest thinkers to divine standards of education outcomes and employ the top psychometricians , statisticians , etc. , to create assessments that are mapped to those standards .
At its hypothetical best , this brain - trust would simply function as CR does in the products market .
The assessments would be scientifically valid and could rank achievement and note the educational best buy — based on the arbitrary set of DOE standards .
But parents and students , as well as community members , teachers , and radicals , etc. , would be unsatisfied ; just as the consumer would be unsatisfied having to always purchase the CR best buy .
So , what 's the solution ?
Simply , let the market reign .
A free market system of education would create for those who seek different options a system that encourages the implementation of the spectrum of educational choices — best viewed as experiments , just as each new product , service , store , etc. , is a market experiment .
The successful experiments become the market standard that new entrepreneurs seek to surpass .
These choices would involve all aspects of education — including pedagogies , methodologies , etc. — which would afford all parents the ability to satisfy their desires for their children 's education .
Each idea would be evaluated by the parent , the education consumer , ex ante over the summer according to individual preferences and ultimate goals , and once again ex post at the end of each school year .
Parents would choose their standard of results and they would seek out entrepreneurs who would then hire teachers and administrators that could deliver the parents ' vision .
The entrepreneurs would purchase products to implement the vision and the science community would be engaged to improve old products and innovate new ones — all due to the market pressures of the freely acting parents , the consumers .
This is the proper direction of improvements and innovations , from the consumer back to the scientist , engineer , researcher , etc .
The standards set by the parent would drive the research that would deliver the product , not the reverse .
Currently we have a system where the standards are set by a myriad of governments and agencies — standards no one wants or agrees with — and we have a spectrum of research whose real goal is to drive the standards and grab the tax dollars .
There are scientific winners in the field of the delivery of quality , basic education , such as Direct Instructions , etc. , but we know a significant number of parents , teachers , and administrators do n't give a hoot about reading , writing , and arithmetic .
They want affective learning — the feel - good , progressive educationist - babble currently in favor — and long for the ideal child , the product of the latest version of Trotsky 's proletarian paradise .
I disagree with them , but their solutions may actually end up being correct , or they will fail .
Only a market can show whether a solution is right or wrong .
That said , we have to keep in mind that Consumer Reports creates valid ratings that we mostly ignore , and we are all better off because we continue to make our own choices .
Our individual wants drive improvements and innovations to provide for our greater satisfaction .
Why should education be any different ?
Candidate spends concession urging opponent to convert RAW STORY
Published : Friday November 17 , 2006 Print This Email This After Minnesota State Senator Satveer Chaudhary defeated challenger Rae Hart Anderson , he received a rather unexpected congratulatory email , RAW STORY has learned .
Anderson , an apparently devout Christian , spent most of the concession urging Chaudhary , a practicing Hindu , to convert to Christianity .
The full text of the email , as obtained by RAW STORY , follows : # Congratulations on winning the District 50 senate race .
Your phone is " busy " ... no doubt with good wishes !
I 've enjoyed much of this race , especially the people I 've met ... even you !
I see your deficits -- not all of them , and your potential -- but not all of it .
Only your Creator knows the real potential He 's put in you .
Get to know Him and know yourself ... you 'll be more interesting even to you !
The race of your life is more important than this one -- and it is my sincere wish that you 'll get to know Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior .
He died for the sins of the world , yours and mine -- and especially for those who accept His forgiveness .
His kingdom will come and His will be done -- on earth as it is in heaven .
There 's more .... I love belonging to the family of God.
Jesus is the way , the truth and offers
His life to you and each human being .
Pay attention ... this is very important , Satveer .
Have you noticed Jesus for yourself ... at some moment in time , yet ???
God commends
His love to us , in that while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us .
Romans 5:8
Death came upon all and was defeated by the superiority of Jesus ' life and His tomb is empty .
God in Christ is reconciling the world back to Himself , with offered forgiveness -- this is one choice we get to make nose to nose with the living God -- fear Him and you need fear no other .
Become
His family and know the love of God that passes knowledge .
See Isaiah and the Gospel of John ... good reading while waiting for fishes to bite .
God sent not
His son into the world to condemn the world , but that the world through Him might be saved .
John 3:17 Jesus Christ lives in His earth family by His Spirit .
He said He'd be back , and He said it first .
You could invite Him to make the race of your life ' eternal ' .
God waits to be gracious to each person that knows they need to be forgiven .
Do you ?
I think you do .
Just ask .
Christ won eternal life for you and said so .
Take Him at His Word .
Take some time to get acquainted with this power - filled Jesus ... God with us .
You could be a temple of the living God , by invitation --- yours , TO GOD . :)
There 's nothing like belonging to Christ ... not winning , not money , not degrees ... it 's the best .
Good wishes and better wishes ... until you wish for the best !

California 's Proposition 87 promises to reduce oil consumption in California , at no expense to the consumer .
I am quite sympathetic to the goal of reducing petroleum dependence .
This is a goal to which we should all aspire .
But I have my doubts that the promises being made by the Proposition 87 campaign can be kept .
I also dispute many of the claims made by the Prop 87 proponents .
Finally , I have a problem with the way the oil industry is being portrayed in order to win support for this measure .
While I do not intend for this to be a point by point rebuttal of Ana Unruh Cohen 's recent essay in support of Prop 87 , I do intend for it to debunk a number of claims from the Yes on 87 campaign .
As I turn a critical eye toward the claims of the pro-87 contingent , I invite Ana to do the same to the anti-87 contingent if she wishes to write a follow - up to this essay .
It is not actually my intent to argue that you should vote one way or the other , even though it may sound like I am staking out a solid No on 87 position .
My intent in this essay is to look into my crystal ball to see what Prop 87 will really do , and to set the record straight with respect to the oil industry .
My prediction is that Prop 87 will receive at least 60 % of the vote , but that 10 years from now California will still be just as dependent on oil as is the rest of the country .
Where I'm Coming From
I struggled with whether to put this section at the beginning or the end .
Ultimately , I decided to open up with it , because I want you to know up front where I am coming from .
You may consider this section a personal rant , designed to explain why I get upset with some of the rhetoric that is directed at my industry .
I understand that this rhetoric plays well in Peoria , and everywhere else for that matter , but as an oil company employee I feel that this is unfair to a great many people .
Many people think of oil companies and see the face of Lee Raymond , ExxonMobil 's recently retired CEO .
I see the faces of the many men and women who work very hard to make sure the transportation industry can get the fuel they need to deliver food around the globe .
I see the faces of many people who juggled operations to make sure that the airplanes recently used to fight fires in Montana and Washington had the aviation fuel they needed to do their jobs .
I admit that my views are shaped from working inside the oil industry .
But that does n't mean that my views are wrong .
When people write that oil companies are evil incarnate , they are n't just talking about Lee Raymond .
In fact , they are talking mostly about people like Tim Crank .
Let me tell you about Tim .
Three years ago , Tim was working on a pump at a refinery in Ponca City , Oklahoma .
A release occurred while he was working , which resulted in an explosion and fire .
Tim died from injuries received as a result of the fire , leaving behind a wife and two young children .
This tragic incident will always be imprinted in my mind , because I witnessed it .
I know how his family struggled to cope with his death .
Furthermore , I know that just about everyone in this industry can tell a similar tragic story .
While some may see this personal story as a cynical or insincere ploy to generate sympathy , the reason I told this story is to let you know why I get angry when my entire industry is characterized in venomous terms .
The vast majority of oil companies are made up of people like Tim Crank , just trying to do their jobs , and tragically sometimes losing their lives in the process .
People outside the oil industry often view us with disdain , because they think of Big Oil and see Lee Raymond .
I get defensive because I see Tim Crank , out there working to make sure the public gets their fix of cheap gas .
That 's why I wo n't sit idly by while people speak of my industry with contempt .
The Prop 87 campaign has been guilty of this , and this is why they have my undivided attention .
Fact or Fiction ?
One of my biggest pet peeves has to be misleading claims or fiction that masquerades as fact .
Following are some examples from the " Key Facts " page at the Yes on 87 site .
Yes on 87 " Fact " : Oil companies that oppose Prop 87 posted record - setting profits in the last five consecutive quarters -- $ 78.3B in 2005 and $ 20.5B in the first quarter alone of this year .
Reality : Oil companies have in fact done very well lately .
The oil industry is cyclical , and the current 10 % earnings on sales is much better than the historical 5 - 7 % earnings on sales .
Of course these numbers pale in comparison to companies like Microsoft , who are earning 26.5 % on sales .
Microsoft recently had profits of $ 2.89 billion on revenues of $ 10.9 billion .
Oil companies would love to see those kinds of margins .
The overall numbers are larger for many oil companies , simply because the companies are much , much larger even than Microsoft .
But record - setting profits are pretty meaningless unless placed in context .
Yes on 87 " Fact " : CA is the third largest oil - producing state , but the only one where the oil companies do n't pay oil drilling fees like they do in other states .
Reality : This claim is false .
There are a number of states in which no drilling fees are paid .
Furthermore , according to this article :
Except for California , most oil producing states rely on a severance tax for the majority of oil revenues .
Yet contrary to popular belief , California does not place an abnormally light tax burden on crude oil producers .
Considering both tax and royalty revenues , state government revenues from oil production in California amounted to 13.4 percent of the value of nonfederal production in the state , well above comparable rates for Oklahoma , Texas , and Wyoming .
Yes on 87 " Fact " : Oil companies are gouging California consumers at the pumps with the highest prices in the nation .
Reality :
As you will learn in this essay , the reason Californians pay some of the highest gas prices in the nation is that they have some of the highest gasoline taxes in the nation .
Besides that , I dispute that anyone is being gouged .
First , provide a definition of " gouging " , and then I will get back with you on that one .
I suspect we would find that pretty much anyone who sells into a rising market would be guilty of the same kind of gouging .
Most people in California who have sold a home at a nice profit would certainly be guilty of gouging .
Yes on 87 " Fact " : Oil companies are blocking our access to cleaner , cheaper fuels .
Reality : This is a ludicrous claim .
Oil companies have made big investments into solar , wind , and biofuels .
In fact , the only company running a large scale cellulosic ethanol trial , Iogen , is receiving major funding from Shell .
Yes on 87 " Fact " : Prop 87 makes it illegal for oil companies to raise gas prices to pass the cost along to consumers .
Reality : Prices are affected by supply and demand , not by propositions that declare it illegal to raise gas prices .
Hawaii recently tried an experiment in price controls , despite warnings that consumers would be harmed .
When the warnings came true , Hawaii abandoned this experiment .
Yes on 87 " Fact " : Requires strict accountability ; nonpartisan , expert oversight and no new bureaucracy .
Reality :
Where I see no accountability at all is if this measure fails to achieve the desired results .
In my opinion , it will raise gasoline prices for California consumers , while penalizing shareholders of oil companies .
Where is the accountability to those groups for their lost dollars should this measure fail ?
Yes on 87 " Fact " : California deserves its fair share and the oil companies can afford to pay it .
But the opposition is lining up , contributing millions of dollars to spin , scare and deceive voters .
Reality : Following this essay , you can decide whether California is getting a " fair share " .
You will also see that some Prop 87 proponents are guilty of spin and deception .
Truth in Advertising
I am confident that Prop 87 will raise gas prices in California .
That 's fine with me , because this should increase conservation .
However , the Prop 87 proponents are promising Californians that there will be no increase in gas prices .
Californians are being promised a free lunch ; that in fact this new $ 4 billion tax will be borne entirely by oil companies .
I do n't see it that way .
Each year , oil companies decide where they will allocate capital based on expected returns for various projects .
After the initiative passes , it will be less profitable to extract oil in California .
The expected returns for some capital projects in California will decrease .
California will get just a bit smaller capital allocation from corporate budgets , which over time will squeeze supplies .
Not only will the returns from California be lower , but initiatives such as this are viewed as hostile toward the industry , providing another disincentive for investing capital in California .
As investment slows and gasoline capacity fails to keep up with demand , higher prices will result .
Some proponents have declared this scenario unrealistic , because oil and gas prices are set on the global market .
For example , in a recent report , ABC news reporter Mark Matthews asked the following question : " But will 87 raise the price of gas ? "
He then answered the question with " The price of oil is set on a world market , not state by state . "
What many people do n't seem to understand is that there is n't a single price for oil .
Oil prices vary greatly in different locations based on a number of factors , as Ana rightly pointed out in her previous essay .
Prop 87 will improve the economics for importing oil into California , simply because it will increase the operating costs for California oil producers .
So , even though West Texas Intermediate , for example , is set on the world market , the price for crudes produced in California will reflect California 's specific circumstances .
And those specific circumstances are set to change with passage of this proposition .
In fact , it seems that the only people who think gas prices wo n't be impacted are the Prop 87 proponents .
According to California Politics Today :
Proposition 87 may prohibit an " oil tax pass - through , " but everyone but its sponsors agrees it will raise gas prices at the pump .
Protecting consumers from price increases at the pump based on the levying of this tax is the implicit promise of Proposition 87's proponents and the form in which they are promising California voters the always - popular something for nothing , not to mention , as will be heard in the interviews below , promising to repeal the basic economic law of supply and demand , which , in this context , amounts to the same thing .
Making " it illegal to pass the cost to us " is not the same as guaranteeing that passing Proposition 87 wo n't , on its own , cause gasoline prices to rise .
As can be heard in the four interviews below with a range of experts and advocates in the fields of energy and economics , adding to the cost of oil produced in California cannot help but cause an increase in the price to consumers in California of gasoline .
So , in the interest of truth in advertising : Prop 87 will widen the gap between gas prices in California and the national average .
Guaranteed .
Not that there 's anything wrong with that , since this will promote conservation .
Make Them Pay Their Fair Share .
And Then Some .
Proponents of Prop 87 paint a picture in which oil companies operating in California are not paying their fair share for extracting California 's resources .
They will note that Texas has an extraction fee , and argue that California is getting a raw deal from the oil companies .
However , to get an accurate comparison , we have to look at the entire taxation picture .
There are a number of ways that states receive revenue as a result of oil and gas transactions .
Extraction taxes are but one example .
Corporate income taxes are another example .
So , even though Texas has an extraction tax of 4.6 % , versus none for California , Texas does not charge oil companies a corporate income tax .
California , on the other hand , charges oil companies an income tax rate of 8.84 % , one of the highest in the nation .
When times are good and oil companies are making big profits , states like California share in the " windfall . "
According to the Long Beach Chamber of Commerce :
Oil producers pay the state corporate income tax on profits earned in California .
California 's corporate income tax rate is among the highest of the top producing states .
Texas , in fact , does not have a corporate income tax at all which provides producers a competitive advantage over California in trying to attract capital investment .
California producers also pay a regulatory fee to the Department of Conservation ( regulates oil production in the state ) that is assessed on production , with the exception of production in federal offshore waters .
So , despite the claims that oil companies in California are not paying their fair share , they already pay a much greater percentage of their income to the state than they do in Texas .
I bet oil companies would have no problem at all with the proposed extraction tax if California wants to waive the corporate income tax as Texas does .
Of course taxes on gasoline sales also provide a large revenue stream for state governments , but these taxes are paid directly by consumers .
In California , not only does the state get $ 0.14 a gallon , they also assess a sales tax of 8.75 % .
When gasoline is $ 3 a gallon , this means that California receives $ 0.32 a gallon in combined sales and excise taxes .
Here is the breakdown of gasoline taxes , according to the San Francisco Chronicle :
If you 're paying about $ 3 a gallon at the pump in Alameda County where the sales tax is 8.75 percent , here is an estimated breakdown of who gets what : -- Fuel price per gallon : $ 2.40 -- Federal Excise Tax : $ 0.18 -- State Excise Tax : $ 0.18 -- Sales tax for state government : $ 0.14 -- State bond debt payment : $ 0.01 -- Sales tax for local government : $ 0.10
I can tell you without a doubt that the government take is significantly higher than the income that oil companies earn in California .
In fact , according to the same article :
Since 2002 , sales tax revenues on gas have been growing annually by $ 300 million to $ 400 million to reach $ 2.86 billion in 2005 , according to the California Board of Equalization .
" There 's a lot of blame to go around ( when it comes to high fuel prices ) , but the government certainly should be on the list , " said Bill Leonard , a member of the Board of Equalization .
" The government is the biggest profiteer of them all . "
Higher prices at the pump are one reason the state will see a sizable revenue windfall this year .
When Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger updates his budget proposal Friday , he is expected to announce that the overall tax revenue is expected to be $ 5 billion more than his earlier estimate in January .
Is n't it interesting that the government is receiving the biggest windfall of all ?
It would seem that the logical place for the Prop 87 proponents to grab alternative energy funds would be some of this government windfall , given that this tax is already in place .
It also appears that the high state gasoline tax is the primary reason per capita usage of gasoline in California is low .
After all , there is a very strong correlation between the states with the highest gasoline taxes - New York , Hawaii , California , Nevada , and Illinois - and the lowest per capita users of gasoline .
While low per capita gas usage is certainly a good thing , it indicates that high state taxes result in lower product sales for oil companies in California than if California had Texas ' $ 0.20 / gallon gasoline tax rate .
Again , I am sure oil companies would n't object much to Prop 87 if there was going to be a reduction to the sales tax rate , because they would sell more product .
But the point is that the high gasoline tax is also affects the profits of oil companies in California .
The bottom line ?
Texas adopted one model :
No corporate income tax , low gasoline taxes ( leading to higher consumption ) , but an oil extraction tax .
California adopted a different model : High corporate income tax , high gasoline taxes ( leading to lower consumption ) , but no oil extraction tax .
To suggest that oil companies are not paying their fair share in California simply because they do n't pay an extraction tax is a grotesque mischaracterization of the actual tax situation .
A Transfer of Wealth
While the stated intent of Prop 87 is to make California less dependent on petroleum , let 's be clear on exactly what it will do .
Prop 87 is a transfer of wealth from one industry to a competing industry .
In most cases , various subsidies are funded by taxes that we all pay in , and in fact many of the alternative technologies that Prop 87 would fund already receive very generous government subsidies .
But on top of that , the proponents argue that it is appropriate to take from one special interest and give to another , because oil dependence is not good for us .
Let 's put this in perspective .
Fast food is n't good for us .
Would most people consider it appropriate to place an additional tax on McDonalds and Burger King , and funnel the proceeds into health food stores ?
Would it be appropriate if I funded an initiative to achieve this , while at the same time investing in the health food stores that would benefit ?
Does anyone have a problem with that ?
Would n't it be more effective to assess a tax on the people who frequent McDonalds , if my goal is to reduce dependence on McDonalds ?
Why is it appropriate to assess an additional tax burden on one industry and funnel the money to a competitor ?
Why is it not more appropriate to funnel the windfall that government has received to fund alternative energy projects ?
Most supporters of this transfer of wealth do n't have a problem with it , but the money will mostly come from average working families and retirees who invested their money into company shares or into a mutual fund that owns company shares .
These are the owners of Big Oil .
It is n't primarily the Lee Raymond 's that you are taking money from .
The $ 4 billion comes from shareholders , and the " free lunch " comes at their expense .
And where is the accountability here ?
Let 's say that Prop 87 does not have the desired effect of reducing petroleum consumption .
Furthermore , let 's say that it does indeed increase gasoline prices for California consumers , despite the assurances of the proponents .
Ignoring for now the fact that Big Oil will of course be blamed for the increase in gas prices , how will Prop 87 proponents rectify this with the people of California ?
How will they rectify it with the shareholders from whom they extracted the $ 4 billion ?
The truth is , they wo n't be accountable for the failure of this measure .
It will just be a $ 4 billion " oops " , that is going to end up financially hurting a lot of people .
Lessons from Proposition 42
In 2002 , California voters approved Proposition 42 .
According to this analysis of Proposition 42 :
Proposition 42 would permanently dedicate revenues from the state 's share of the sales tax on gasoline to transportation projects .
This sales tax on gasoline is already collected at the pump and generates roughly $ 1.3 billion a year .
Now that seems like a pretty good proposition to me .
Take the sales tax that is being collected , and dedicate some of those funds to reducing the demand for petroleum ( sort of like Prop 87 , except you are n't taking money from the shareholders ) .
20 % of the funds were supposed to be spent for mass transit and intercity rail .
Fast forward to 2006 :
Sales Tax on Gasoline a Bonanza for State
We find that the words " permanently " and " dedicated " are quite easily dispensed with :
Revenue from state sales tax on gasoline is supposed to go for transportation projects under Proposition 42 , which voters approved in 2002 .
But in recent years , legislators and the governor have invoked special provisions of the ballot measure that allowed them to dip into that fund , moving about $ 2.5 billion to pay for other expenses .
Hopefully , Prop 87 funds can't be similarly diverted .
But it does make me wonder whether the legislature might be able to divert these funds into other areas .
Conclusion
I predict Prop 87 will pass , primarily because people see it as a way to stick it to Big Oil .
I think the measure will decrease gasoline consumption in California , by making gasoline more expensive .
Furthermore , I predict that the measure will be abandoned well before $ 4 billion is raised as the price disparity in California 's gasoline market widens over the national average .
I actually favor higher gas prices , though .
I think that will extend our supplies of oil .
But I do have a problem with deceptive claims , especially when they are aimed at my industry .
If I was in California , I am still not sure how I would vote .
I think proponents missed an opportunity to write a much better proposition .
I understand their need to write a politically palatable initiative , but I am turned off by hollow political promises .
In conclusion , if you cast your vote for Prop 87 , at least make sure you are voting based on facts , and not on spin .
Disclaimer :
Once again , I want to make it clear that to my knowledge , my company is not fighting this measure , nor have they contributed any money toward doing so .
I do n't believe that we extract oil from California ..
So , I have nothing to gain financially from supporting or opposing this measure .
I am also not a resident of California , so my comments are those of an unaffected party .
" Do n't work too hard , " wrote a colleague in an e-mail today .
Was she sincere or sarcastic ?
I think I know ( sarcastic ) , but I 'm probably wrong .
According to recent research published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , I 've only a 50 - 50 chance of ascertaining the tone of any e-mail message .
The study also shows that people think they 've correctly interpreted the tone of e-mails they receive 90 percent of the time .
" That 's how flame wars get started , " says psychologist Nicholas Epley of the University of Chicago , who conducted the research with Justin Kruger of New York University .
" People in our study were convinced they 've accurately understood the tone of an e-mail message when in fact their odds are no better than chance , " says Epley .
The researchers took 30 pairs of undergraduate students and gave each one a list of 20 statements about topics like campus food or the weather .
Assuming either a serious or sarcastic tone , one member of each pair e-mailed the statements to his or her partner .
The partners then guessed the intended tone and indicated how confident they were in their answers .
Those who sent the messages predicted that nearly 80 percent of the time their partners would correctly interpret the tone .
In fact the recipients got it right just over 50 percent of the time .
" People often think the tone or emotion in their messages is obvious because they ' hear ' the tone they intend in their head as they write , " Epley explains .
At the same time , those reading messages unconsciously interpret them based on their current mood , stereotypes and expectations .
Despite this , the research subjects thought they accurately interpreted the messages nine out of 10 times .
The reason for this is egocentrism , or the difficulty some people have detaching themselves from their own perspective , says Epley .
In other words , people are n't that good at imagining how a message might be understood from another person 's perspective .
" E-mail is very easy to misinterpret , which not only triggers flame wars but lots of litigation , " says Nancy Flynn , executive director of the e-Policy Institute and author of guidebooks E - Mail Rules and Instant Messaging Rules .
Many companies battle workplace lawsuits triggered by employee e-mail , according to Flynn .
People write absolutely , incredibly stupid things in company e-mails , " said Flynn .
The ' Flying Carpet ' of Seyed Alavi
Can you imagine walking the route that your plane will take - on your way into the airport from the parking lot ?
Artist Seyed Alavi has created a 150 foot ' flying carpet ' that has a digital copy of the course of the Sacramento River woven into it .
The carpet shows approximately fifty miles of the river , starting just outside Colusa , CA and ending about six miles south of Chico .
If I 'm doing my math right , that means that a six foot tall person walking on the carpet is seeing the carpet ' landscape ' from an apparent height of about two miles .
Science fiction fans could have great fun with this carpet , which was installed this past summer in the Sacramento airport .
It might remind you of the view of Larry Niven 's Ringworld from space .
The same novel offers teleportation pads called stepping discs that allow you to literally cover miles with each step , like the twenty - league boots of old ; walking on this carpet would feel like that .
Another thing that fascinates me with this idea is that it is the opposite of the micro-miniaturized displays , like the data goggles of Neal Stephenson 's Snow Crash or the somewhat retro eyephones from William Gibson 's Idoru .
Seyed Alavi remarks " it was my intention with this project to present a fun and humorous situation for laughter and play , where travelers will feel rejuvenated and reminded of the magic of flight . "
I 'll bet it works .

And increasingly across the country , questions are being asked : " How could this happen ? "
" Why is help taking so long ? " and " How can thousands of Americans be stranded ? " .
It is hot and humid in the city 's stadium and toilets are overflowing
President George Bush was visiting some of the devastated areas of the south on Friday amid growing anger over the federal response to the disaster .
Officials insist their response has been effective - rejecting widespread criticism that the administration was too slow to react to the crisis .
There has also been criticism from opposition politicians and members of the public that spending on the war on Iraq diverted money away from flood - control projects .
New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin has angrily accused Washington of not having a clue about what was going on .
On Thursday , he issued what he called a " desperate SOS " for help for up to 20,000 refugees stuck in a convention centre in New Orleans which he said was " unsanitary and unsafe " and running out of supplies .
I was in the tsunami region , and this response is incredibly more efficient , more effective and under the most difficult circumstances
Michael D Brown
Emergency response head
On Friday , authorities in Louisiana were trying to crank up the rescue operation .
Convoys of school buses were trying to ferry out the thousands of people sheltering in the convention centre and the nearby New Orleans Superdome amid the filth and the dead .
The questions being asked focus on why it has taken so long to get those buses on the road - and why thousands of people sheltering in the places where they were told to take refuge are now going hungry and thirsty .
Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco says she has asked for a " Berlin drop " of food and water .
In an interview with Good Morning America on Friday , she said that they were finally starting to see the response from the federal authorities .
The task on the ground has been complicated by the frustration and despair felt by survivors who have gone days without essential supplies .
Much of the frustration has been directed at the national authority , the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( Fema ) .
This is a national disgrace - we can send massive amounts of aid to tsunami victims , but we can't bail out the city of New Orleans
Terry Ebbert
" This is a national disgrace .
Fema has been here three days , yet there is no command and control , " Mr Ebbert said .
" We can send massive amounts of aid to tsunami victims , but we can't bail out the city of New Orleans . "
One man , George Turner , who was still waiting to be evacuated , summed up much of the anger felt by the refugees .
" Why is it that the most powerful country on the face of the Earth takes so long to help so many sick and so many elderly people ? " he asked .
Tens of thousands of people are still waiting to be evacuated
" Why ?
That 's all I want to ask President Bush . "
And John Rhinehart , the administrator of a New Orleans hospital without power and water , said : " I 'm beginning to wonder if the government is more concerned about the looting than people who are dying in these hospitals . "
There is widespread agreement among commentators that somewhere there has been a breakdown in the system .
The Biloxi Sun Herald in Mississippi asked : " Why has n't every able - bodied member of the armed forces in south Mississippi been pressed into service ? "
And on Friday the Washington Post wrote : " Though experts had long predicted that the city , which sits below sea level and is surrounded by water , would face unprecedented devastation after an immense hurricane , they said problems were worsened by a late evacuation order and insufficient emergency shelter for as many as 100,000 people . "
Volunteer effort
The BBC's Jamie Coomarasamy in Baton Rouge says that on the ground in some areas , it is largely volunteers , including those from the Red Cross and other organisations , who are leading the relief efforts .
But he said these efforts were fairly haphazard , with local radio and television stations putting out requests for people to do what they could .
Fema head Michael D Brown has defended the federal response , saying that his agency had prepared for the storm , but that the widespread flooding had hampered the operation .
Could more have been done ?
I would say every society in the world is not preparing adequately for catastrophic events
Jan Egeland
UN emergency relief co-ordinator
" What the American people need to understand is that the full force of the federal government is bringing all of those supplies in , in an unprecedented effort that has not been seen even in the tsunami region , " he said .
" I was in the tsunami region , and this response is incredibly more efficient , more effective and under the most difficult circumstances . "
Jan Egeland , the UN emergency relief co-ordinator has written to US ambassador to the UN John Bolton offering help .
" I understand people 's frustration , but I also know from bitter experience that this , the fifth and the sixth and the seventh days are always among the worst , because it is before you reach , really , the largest amount of people , " he told the BBC .

Hell , why stop there ?
Why not have ad campaigns targeted towards specific people ?
Judy Smith , where were you when you found out your child had leukemia ?
Joe Anderson , where were you when your wife was killed by a drunk driver ?
Let 's have ad campaigns to remind all of us all the time about every single loved one who died tragically .
And not a campaign to remind you of the loved one and how great they were - oh no - a campaign to remind you of the horrible moment of their horrible death .
It 's like memorializing your dead mother each year not by recollecting about how she used to bake those wonderful ginger cookies , but rather , making an annual ritual out of talking about how every bone in her body was smashed by a semi-truck .
What a great way to remember mom .
What the hell is our obsession withSeptember 11 ?
We remember it , ok .
I do n't need a TV commercial to remind me of that day or how I felt .
I was there .
It took me a long time to get over it .
And I most certainly do n't need my politicians , or anyone else , trying to drag me back to that day kicking and screaming several times a year as if I do n't remember it , and as if it 's somehow healthy to keep bringing it up .
Last year when I was in Paris I was out to dinner with friends at a really nice restaurant .
Suddenly right behind me an entire tray of dishes went smashing to the floor .
I jumped , like anyone would , but then I felt more .
My head started to go a little numb and I started to feel boxed in by the booth I was sitting in .
My friends continued jabbering away , but all I could think of was how the hell I was going to get out of that restaurant as quickly as possible .
Well , I was boxed in by other diners , there was clearly no escape , so I broke into tears .
I do n't cry , it was very weird .
And I immediately knew that I was having a September 11 flashback - no question at all .
I do n't need anyone reminding me of September 11 , thank you very much .
In fact , as last summer 's plate crashing episode reminded me , I could still use a little more forgetting about September 11 .
Unfortunately we live in a country and a society where the dead are n't just eulogized , they 're propagandized .
You want an ad campaign ?
Here 's an ad campaign :
' IBM Corporation today announced its smallest , lowest - priced computer system - the IBM Personal Computer , ' ran the press release 25 years ago this week .
' Designed for business , school and home , the easy - to - use system sells for as little as $ 1,565 .
It offers many advanced features and , with optional software , may use hundreds of popular application programs . '
On 12 August 1981 no one could guess quite how profound an impact the announcement from International Business Machines would have on hundreds of millions of lives .
Nor how wildly divergent would be the fortunes of three men who were there at the genesis of the IBM PC 5150 - a invention to rank in importance with the motor car , telephone and television .
One of those men was David Bradley , 57 , a member of the original 12 engineers who worked on the secret project and who is still amazed by its profound consequences , from email and iPods to Google and MySpace .
Speaking from his home in North Carolina last week , he said : ' Computers have improved the productivity of office workers and become a toy for the home .
I do n't want to assert that the PC invented the internet , but it was one of the preconditions . '
The man with perhaps most cause to toast the industry standard PC 's 25th birthday on Saturday , even more than the engineers who built it , is Bill Gates .
His software for the IBM PC , and nearly all the computers that followed it , made him the world 's richest man .
But for IBM , the story was arguably one of defeat snatched from the jaws of victory .
Bradley was also working on a similar machine when , in September 1980 , he was recruited to the IBM team and sent to Boca Raton in Florida to come up with a PC that would rival the pioneering Apple II .
A few months later the team had grown and got its leader - Don Estridge , a photographer 's son from Florida who had worked for the army and Nasa .
Racing against a 12 - month deadline , the engineers scoured the country for components , and asked Intel , then a manufacturer of memory chips , to deliver the central processing unit , or ' brain ' .
IBM also needed operating system software .
The man in the right place at the right time was a young geek who had dropped out of Harvard .
Bill Gates of Microsoft specialised in more modest computer languages but assured the IBM team that he could come up with an operating system for their new machines in just a few days .
After Estridge 's task force had left for their hotel , Gates went around the corner to a tiny company which had written a system for the Intel processor and bought it out for £ 26,000 .
He then customised the system for IBM and sold it to them for £ 42,000 .
Critically , Gates retained the right to license the system to other manufacturers who could , and would , clone the IBM design .
A quarter of a century later , he has an estimated wealth of £ 26bn .
IBM 's failure to secure exclusive rights to Gates 's software is often regarded as a blunder comparable to that of the music executives who spurned The Beatles .
But Bradley disagrees , saying that there was a higher purpose - he and his colleagues used ' open architecture ' , off - the - shelf parts which others could acquire , and so defined a standard that allowed others to build compatible machines capable of running the same software .
Experts generally regard this as the result of haste rather than altruism on IBM 's part , but Bradley points out that in the spirit of openness it published technical manuals to explain how the PC worked .
Unlike Apple , who stuck by its proprietary system and lost the lion 's share of the market , the IBM PC was an invitation to rivals eager to imitate and improve upon it .
Bradley said : ' I believe the primary reason it was so successful is that it was an open system .
There was a microprocessor from Intel and an operating system from Microsoft .
We published everything we knew so that if you wanted to work on an application program you had all the information to do it and you could be reasonably confident IBM would n't change things later .
' The participation of the rest of the industry was important because IBM alone could not possibly have invented all the applications that people would want . '
The IBM PC 5150 weighed 25 lbs , stood just under six inches high and had 64 kilobytes of memory and a five - and - a- quarter inch floppy disk drive .
Initial sales forecasts expected 242,000 to be sold over five years , but the figure was exceeded in single month .
It was a personal triumph for Estridge , the ' father of the PC ' , but he would not live to see its full legacy in the democratisation of computing .
On 2 August 1985 Estridge was on Delta Air Lines Flight 191 from Fort Lauderdale , Florida approaching Dallas - Fort Worth airport .
It was caught in a freak wind and plummeted to the ground , bursting into flames .
Of 152 passengers on board , 128 died , including 48 - year - old Estridge , his wife and several IBM executives .
IBM was overtaken in the PC market by Compaq in 1994 .
IBM sold its PC division to Chinese giant Lenovo for £ 628 m last year .
' I 'm sad and disillusioned that IBM got out of the computer business since I was there at the very beginning , ' added Bradley .
' But as an IBM stockholder I think it was an extremely sensible business decision . '
Bradley quit IBM in 2004 after 28 years and lives in comfortable retirement .
He mused : ' I have no regrets about what happened .
I was there when it was just a glimmer in everybody 's eye and it's a privilege to still be here to talk about it .
And no , I do n't envy Bill Gates . '

( h/t Mike Legra for helping out with the post )
The tribal chiefs , in traditional robes and chequered headdresses , emerged from the dust stirred up by their convoy of pick - up trucks and walked towards the big white tent , gesturing welcomes to each other as they sat .
Accompanied by about 500 clansmen and a gaggle of local journalists , the 35 Sunni sheikhs - from Mosul , Tikrit , Samarra and Hawija - converged last week on Hindiya , on the scrappy western edges of Kirkuk , to swear their undying opposition to " conspiracies " to partition Iraq and to pledge allegiance to their president , Saddam Hussein .
Under banners exalting the man now standing trial in Baghdad for war crimes and genocide , the gathering heard speeches from prominent northern Iraqi sheikhs , Sunni Arab politicians and self - declared leaders of the Ba'ath party calling for the former dictator 's release .
" If the Iraqi government wants national reconciliation to succeed and for the violence to end , they have to quickly release the president and end the occupation , " said Sheikh Abdul Rahman Munshid , of the Obeidi tribe .
" But most important of all , " he added , " Kirkuk must never become part of Kurdistan .
It is an Iraqi city , and we will take all routes to prevent the divisions of Iraq . "
The heated debate about federalism in Iraq is no better exemplified than in Kirkuk .
Though largely free of the sectarian wars taking place in Baghdad and its surrounding area , observers say the ethnic faultlines running through the city , which lies atop Iraq 's second largest oilfield , make it a ticking time bomb that could pit Kurd against Arab and draw in neighbours such as Iran and Turkey .
" There are few more sensitive issues in Iraq today than what happens to Kirkuk , " said a western diplomat in Iraq who works closely with the issue .
" All eyes are on it , and all the ingredients for either consensual agreement or a devastating discord are there .
If Kirkuk survives , then there 's hope for Iraq . "
As if to reinforce that message , within hours of the Sunni gathering a wave of suicide bombs rocked Kirkuk 's city centre , including one in a crowded market and another in front of a women 's teaching college .
At least 15 civilians were killed and scores wounded .
Despite the oil riches that lie beneath , above ground Kirkuk appears a forlorn and neglected city .
Street after street consists of humble two - storey dwellings with barely a modern building in sight .
Litter is strewn everywhere , and there are huge queues at the petrol pumps .
The tumbledown shops and market stalls in the centre of the city sell cheap consumer goods from Iran and Turkey .
The city 's ancient citadel lies in ruins .
The governor , Abdul Rahman Mustapha , a Kurd , blames the dilapidated state of the city on years of Ba'athist misrule .
Neither does he have a good word for the current government in Baghdad .
" They have ignored us and set so many obstacles in the path of our progress and reconstruction , " he said .
Only now , three years after the end of the war , is money beginning to filter through for much - needed infrastructure work .
In partnership with the US Provincial Reconstruction Team ( PRT ) and US Army Corps of Engineers ( USACE ) , the provincial government has undertaken projects to provide fresh water to the mostly Arab south of the city , as well as garbage collection and treatment and the renovation of schools .
" A good sign is that Kurds , Turkomans and Arabs still eat in the same restaurants , and mix together , " said Mr Mustapha .
Yet , as with so many other of Iraq 's major cities , the trauma of history is close to the surface .
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the Ba'ath party systematically drove out as many as 200,000 Kurds and Turkomans from urban and rural Kirkuk to weigh the city 's ethnic balance towards the Arabs and ensure strategic control of the oil fields .
After the fall of Saddam 's regime , thousands of Kurds returned to the city , demanding the restitution of their land and property and the right to vote for Kirkuk to join the Kurdish autonomous region in the north .
The Iraqi constitution promises to remove Arab settlers , who would receive compensation , and return Kurds to Kirkuk - an explosive issue for many non-Kurds .
" It will be disastrous , " said Ali Mehdi , a Turkoman member of the provincial council .
" The people wo n't accept the rule of the Kurdish parties .
A civil war could break out any minute . "
He said Kirkuk should achieve special independent status unallied to any regional blocs .
Kurdish leaders insist , however , that they are neither after ethnic supremacy nor Kirkuk 's oil , which could give them an economic base for future independence .
Instead they are seeking to right historical wrongs .
" We want to see the issue resolved in a legal and peaceful way , as designated in the constitution , " said Fuad Hussein , a senior aide to the Kurdish president Massoud Barzani .
" Kirkuk is historically part of Kurdistan , but we will make sure it is well - run and safe for everyone regardless of race or religion . "
But he expressed dismay at the Sunni leaders ' meeting .
" Ba'athists meeting openly under the nose of Americans is not a good sign for the future , " he said .
Relatively peaceful in the first two years after the fall of Saddam - defying observers who said civil war would start here - Kirkuk is witnessing an alarming increase in bloodshed as the political tensions rise .
The wave of violence is terrifying residents and testing to the limit the fragile relations among its Kurdish , Arab and Turkoman residents .
The US military in Kirkuk says the city has been hit by 20 suicide bombs and 63 roadside bombs in the past three months .
Local police and community leaders have been assassinated and politicians attacked .
This despite a series of security sweeps by US and Iraqi forces and the digging of a large trench ringing Kirkuk 's southern approaches , designed to funnel traffic into the city through official Iraqi army checkpoints .
Colonel Patrick Stackpole , who commands 5,000 US troops in a province of about one and a half million people , said the " violence is mainly by outsiders , though undoubtedly they have facilitators inside the city " .
" Jihadis from east and west , belonging to groups such as Ansar al - Islam and Ansar al - Sunnah , are targeting the city , trying to stoke civil war , " he said .
" But there 's also a large element of former regime loyalists who do n't want the city to succeed . "
Nevertheless , he described himself as " guardedly optimistic " and offered rare praise for the province 's security forces .
" They are taking over more and more functions , leading operations , and performing more effectively without the scale of problems of corruption and disloyalty seen in other forces in Iraq , " he said .
" We have n't seen death squads . "

大学であった Guy Steele 氏の講演を聴いてきました。お題は 、Sun で今研究開発中の " Fortress " という新しい言語に ついて。キャッチフレーズ は
" To Do for Fortran What Java Did for C " だそうで、 基本は、大規模な科学技術計算・並列計算のための（つまり、Fortranがこれまで担ってきた
作業をするための）言語です。ただ、それを実現する枠組みはもっとgeneralな何かになって いるよ、と 。
並列計算特有の話はほとんどなくて、「 言語設計のやり方 」 的な内容をお話しされていて、 まさにそれが聴きたかったのでとても面白かったです。以下雑メモ。
この問題提起に対する答えは当然
コンパイラに組み込む機能は最小限にとどめる
できる限りライブラリによって何もかもを実現するべし
実際のアプリケーションを眺めてみて「言語にこんな機能があったらここはもっと
楽に書けるなあ」と思ったら、そんな機能をコンパイラに実装する……という方法は
もちろんとらない。そんな機能を実現するライブラリを書く。コンパイラ/言語実装者の
視点で見るときであっても、「そんな機能を実現するライブラリを書きやすくする
ような言語の拡張はなんだろう？」という視点で考える。
ライブラリでやる、というアプローチに対する批判も当然ご想像の通りのがあるわけで
それはちゃんと効率の良いプログラムになるのか？
最適化の技術は日々進歩している。特に、Java VMが成し遂げた実行時JIT最適化
のような分野。ライブラリによる、クラスや関数やメソッドを使った動的な実装を、
コンパイラ組み込みの知識によって静的に展開されるような実装と同等の
パフォーマンスにまで持って行く最適化は"
実現できる" 、というスタンス。
プロジェクト的に一つの年限が2010年らしく、まあ2010年を待っててくれよ的スタンス。
私(k.inaba)は、この徹底してライブラリでやるというスタイルがとても好きなのですが、
同時にそのスタイルを批判している言語をメインで使っている人でもあって、なかなか考えさせられます。 リンク先の批判の 「 5 : 結局 " 標準 " ライブラリとなってしまえばエンドユーザにとって
柔軟性は何も変わらない 」 については同じ懸案事項ではあるようで、「 Fortressで は Monolithicな標準ライブラリは持たずに、常にライブラリの各部分をいろんな実装に
取っかえひっかえすることをむしろ推奨すらする」いう方針を明確にしていました。
「 1,3,4,6 ... 効率や使い勝手を真に組み込みの機能に並べることは難しい」という点は、
「 それを実現するのだ」というのがまさにFortressのチャレンジングなところであって、
「 それが実現できる」という言葉に期待ですね。「2 : ライブラリで実装した機能を間違って 使ったときに、コンパイラ組み込みの実装並のわかりやすいエラーメッセージが出せますか？ 」 というのが一番面白い問いだと思うけれど、どうなんだろう。閑話休題。
他に、ライブラリで実現された機能って言語組み込みの機能より読みにくいし
使いにくいよね、的な話もありまして。
どこ のJavaのどこのBigDecimalの話かは言いませんが、かけ算するのに x.multiply (y ) って、もうやってられませんよね。
って、もうやってられませんよね。 そこで演算子オーバーロード。
ちなみに Fortress ではかけ算は x*y と書く必要すらない。 x y です 。
Generalized Overloading ｷﾀｺﾚ !!
… っていうか、並置の意味の オーバーロードはマジメな話本気でやりたいのでこれは個人的には嬉しい方向。
C++の演算子オーバーロードはダメダメだった。何故か。
使える演算子の数が、定義済みの10数個しかなかったからだ。なので、その分野に
とって自然な演算子は使えず、C++に既にある別の演算子で代用しないといけなかった。
結果として、記号を見ても何が行われるかわからない多重定義された演算子が溢れる。
しかし今や時代 はUnicodeである。 ASCII に縛られなければ、自然な記号は 次々手に入る。括弧なんか29種類もありますよ。
特に数値計算で出てくるような記号… α , ρ , π のようなギリシャ文字はある。normを 意味するのに便利そうな ∥x∥ みたいな記号もある。総和を取る演算子に Σ。 集合演算∪∩∈なども一通り。などなどなど 。
そもそもかけ算も * じゃなくて ・ や × もあるし 。
もちろん記号が溢れているからって乱用するのはダメ。ちゃんと、その記号が
その分野で普通に使われているものなら導入し、そうでないなら導入しない、という
ことには注意しないといけない。
できるだけスタンダードな数式に近い表現を可能とする方向へ。
「 スタンダードな数式っぽい書き方というと単に記号の問題だけでなくて、例えば
0 < x < 1 みたいな表記の問題もあると思うけど、そういうのは どうするんでしょう？ 」 って質問したら 「 その書き方は既にFortressでサポートされてます 」 って返されました。うへ。そういうのは演算子オーバーロードの枠組みは越えるけれど、
数式の書き方としてよく使われているものだし、これは個別にサポート、とのこと。
他に、内包表記 { f ( x , y ) | x←S , y←A , x≠y} なんかも、それが数式としてスタンダードな 表記なのでこれはこれで対 応
。A^2と書くと行列Aの2乗だけれど、A^Tと書くと行列Aの転置に なるようになっていたりする、と。（最後の例は識別子Tに特別な意味を持たせれば普通に 演算子オーバーロードの範囲内だと思うけど、そういうのは嫌ったのかな…？）
他の人からの質問で 、 「 我々にはこの10本の指しかないわけですが(^^;、それでASCIIの範囲で プログラムは書けて もUnicodeをフルに使ってプログラム組むのは、それは本当に生産性 あがるのでしょうか？ 」 というのもありました。「一度その記号を打ったらあとはコピペ 」
で割と困らないよ、というのが回答の一つ、あとはスタンダードに、「代替記法」を用意。
α でも alpha でも同じ意味になるようにする。各種括弧については、ASCII で書けるような 記法を用意しておく、etc。打ち込むのはASCII な方で、開発環境がpretty printしてくれる とか … Wikiっぽいイメージ？とかそんなこんな。
プログラミング言語ではないけど、MathML が Unicodeで記号を入れることを許す 言語なんですが、自分の経験ではあれは割とややこしい気がしていました。 ギリシャ文字のΣと数学記号の∑( ∑ ) は素敵なことに別の文字で、 （実装によるのかもしれないんですが）後者は総和演算子扱いされて添え字が∑の真上と
真下につくんですが、うっかりそのつもりでギリシャ文字のΣを使うと悲惨なことに なっちゃったり。" 代替文字 " をちゃんとunifyしてくれれば無事なんでしょうが、さてさて。
続き
それでなんだっけ、一晩寝たらほとんど忘れたよ。 「 コンパイラは簡潔に、アプリケーションコードも簡潔に、全てのノウハウ的なものは
ライブラリ部分に突っ込む」のだという話でした。 他にはFortress言語自体のもうちょい詳しい話。
Traits ベースのオブジェクト指向 を採用する 。
Traits の多重継承 もOK 。そういうのを活用して、 「 ライブラリによる プリミティブっぽい機能の実現」を実現していく感じ。（" Printable " とか " Immutable " と言っ たTraitsを例に挙げてました。）
Traitsはフィールドを持たない。クラス階層（Traits階層？）の末端に来る具体的な
実装クラスにだけフィールドを置いてよい。
並列計算の扱い方はどんな風になるのか。
for i←1 : m , j←1 :n do a [ i , j ] := b[ i ] c[j ]
end
1 :m や 1 :n は " generator " 。もちろん、コンパイラ組み込みの機能ではなくて、
ライブラリで定義される。
for ... do ... end は " reducer " 。これももちろんライブラリによって定義される。
generatorがreducerを制御する、という関係になる。
標準ライブラリの一番スタンダードなgeneratorである 1 : m は、Fortress が 計算用言語であることからして、 各CPU各スレッドに処理をばらまいて並列にreducerを
実行する、というgenerator。どのように処理を分散するかetcはgeneratorのライブラリの
コードとして記述されている。
並列実行generatorを受け取って逐次実行generatorを返すseqという関数があって、
for i←seq ( 1 :m ) , j←seq ( 1:n ) do a [ i , j ] := b[ i ] c[j ]
end
とすると、逐次実行されるループになったり。
reducerはもちろんfor文だけではなくて 、( Σ[ k ← 1:n ] a[k ] ) の様に和を取るreducerや、 MAX ...のように最大値を取るreducerなど色々考えられる。
seqのようなものは、各iterationが始まる前に直前のiterationが完了していることを
ちゃんと保証しておかないといけないわけだけど？という質問があって、そう、そういう
ことをライブラリでseq関数としてきちんと全部記述してやるのだ、という回答、だったと
思う（ちゃんと聞き取れてなかったかも）。
並列処理というと同期とかロック処理とかの話は…
データベースなどでよくあるような、トランザクションによる管理を基本とする。 atom do ... end というブロックで囲むと一つのトランザクション 。
ここ数年、効率的にトランザクションを実現する技術はいい感じに進歩している。
SunのFortress も、IBMのX10 も、 Cray のChapel も、 同じ目的に向けて独立に作られている言語だけれど、どれもトランザクションを 採用している。時代はトランザクション 。
そんなところで 。

Many were n't included because of either clumsy ASCII output , or requiring a dictionary .
Perhaps a dictionary module could be created and those problems attacked in a unified fashion .
Sept. 20 , 2006  --
So will the third time be the charm for the Atlantis crew ?
They spent Tuesday night trying to determine what the mysterious object was that was seen floating away from the shuttle early Monday morning .
The Mission Management Team has now ruled out that something hit the shuttle as it was in orbit .
The sensors that indicated " hits " were reacting to the Forward Control System maneuver , which is part of the preparation for landing .
But did that same maneuver knock something lose from the shuttle ?
That 's what the crew will be looking for in their inspection .
Space Station Program Manager Wayne
Hale admits this is n't something they could have , or would have done before the Columbia accident .
" We never were able to do this before , but now that we can , we might as well .
It is better to take a look than wonder what we might have missed , " Hale said .
So the Atlantis crew will unberth the space shuttle robotic arm and survey the orbiter 's skin .
This additional inspection is something this crew has already done twice .
It is tedious and time consuming , because the crew and those who analyze the data that is down - linked , or looking for the tiniest of cracks that could allow damaging heat to penetrate the shuttle during re-entry .
The orbital boom sensor system was designed after the Columbia accident to help NASA see what could not be seen on Columbia .
After the Columbia accident , investigators were initially skeptical that the 1.67 - pound hunk of foam that struck Columbia 's left wing could have brought down the orbiter over Texas in 2003 , killing its crew of seven .
Subsequent tests , though , proved even a much smaller piece of debris could cause catastrophic damage under the worst circumstances .
Inspecting an orbiter when it is flight adds days to each mission , but it is time well spent , Hale said .
The objects that were seen by Mission Control and the astronauts on Atlantis are gone .
So analysts are left with video images to determine what was floating off the shuttle .
Hale says it is too early to dust off the other contingency plan -- the safe haven , or rescue plan .
Nov. 11 is the day NASA has circled as a launch date for STS 300 if Discovery needs to be launched to save Atlantis .
The question still haunts many to this day :
What could have been done to save Columbia 's crew ?
Was a rescue even possible ?
Admiral Hal Gehman , who headed the Columbia Accident Investigation Board , told ABC News during the investigation , the question of what could have been done -- if anything -- bothered him for months .
" If something could have been done , then all of a sudden , it 's not just a golden opportunity that was missed .
It actually is a very very serious , very very serious failure of the system , " Gehman said .
It goes without saying that the flight directors , engineers , and astronauts at NASA would have done anything within their power to save the crew of Columbia -- if they had known how much damage had been done to Columbia .
The plan developed by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board was risky -- but many wanted to believe it could have succeeded .
NASA would have raced to launch the shuttle Atlantis with a skeleton crew .
It would have rendezvoused with Columbia , orbiting as close as 50 feet away , each shuttle 's open payload bays facing one another at a 90 - degree angle .
A tethered astronaut would carry two spacesuits to Columbia 's crew , and then escort them two at a time back to Atlantis .
Once empty , Columbia would have been sent plummeting into the ocean by remote control .
If a rescue was n't feasible for the crew of Columbia , what about future crews who might face the possibility of flying home in a crippled space shuttle ?
NASA now has a rescue plan on the drawing board for every shuttle mission it launches until the shuttle fleet quits flying in 2010 .
A crew of four from the nest shuttle mission STS 116 , which is scheduled to launch in December , has already trained for a rescue mission , and they would be ready to launch in Discovery if the call came from NASA headquarters .
Flight Director Paul Dye trained to run a rescue mission for STS 114 .
He says the clock is already ticking to process Discovery for a possible rescue mission .
" I think that the pressure where absolutely everything needs to go right , of course there is some margin , down at the Cape -- processing a vehicle and making sure everything comes together for launch day is really going to be incredible , " Dye said .
Commander Steve Lindsey flew STS 121 earlier this summer , and trained as a rescue crew for STS 114 .
" Everybody in our office would volunteer to do this if it needed to happen , because the other crew members that are up there are our friends , " he said .
He sees this as a mission that is -- in some ways -- routine business for an astronaut .
" Because the crew would have been on orbit probably close to 60 days by the time we get them down , in 45 to 60 days they are probably going to be de-conditioned much like space station crews are , so the plan is we are actually going to fly all of the crew members down on the mid deck on the lower deck in recumbent seating flat out and they will have the full crewing , full oxygen suits , " he said .
" On orbit , because you are in zero G [ gravity ] , you should n't think square footage but you should think volume -- in terms of volume we have plenty of space for 11 people on board .
Obviously when we hit the G field it will be a little different , but they will all be strapped in , but we have a planned place to deal with that and we think we can get everybody down OK , " he said .
A possible rescue mission would be a race against time .
Atlantis would have to be processed and rolled to the launch pad , then launched safely , to retrieve a crew that is seeking " safe haven " on a space station that is barely able to house two crew members , without the burden of seven more .
Wendy Lawrence flew on STS 114 and also trained to be part of the rescue crew on the other end .
She knows it would n't be easy .
" As soon as we dock , in essence the clock is ticking , but we know the number of days and the estimate is the space station could support us for 43 days , " she said .
" That number gets folded back into the processing flow for the next shuttle .
Part of our launch decision is making sure the next shuttle could launch within that 43 - day period . "
Lawrence was in charge of figuring out where to put everyone on her mission .
" We will be packed in there like sardines -- but it 's funny , because three of us were in the astronaut class of ' 92 and we were called ' the sardine class , ' so it 's only appropriate , " she said .
" But it will be a sea of astronauts in orange spacesuits packed in pretty tightly . "
But the pressure to pull off the impossible would be intense .
Think back to the effort to save the crippled Apollo 13 , 25 years ago .
The entire world was glued to the unfolding drama for days .
Dye said he understands the pressure : " First off , if we need [ to do it ] , it has to work .
I mean we are going to be going up to bring home a crew that has no other way to come home . "
But even if Atlantis had to be jettisoned into the ocean because it is damaged too badly to fly back to earth , it still might not mean the end of the shuttle program .
" We would still have a couple of orbiters , " Dye said .
" I remember people saying after the Challenger crash that if we ever lost another vehicle , we would never fly again . "
But now the space shuttle has a shelf life of just three more years .
It will stop flying in 2010 .
NASA needs to fly 15 more missions to finish the International Space Station , and would like to fly two missions to stock the ISS with spare parts .
Then there is the question of the Hubble space telescope .
Hubble 's batteries are running low and it wo n't survive 2007 without a rescue flight from a space shuttle , a flight NASA wo n't commission until the successful landing of the next shuttle flight .
Langa Letter : XP's Little - Known ' Rebuild ' Command
There 's an easy fix for " Missing HAL.DLL , " " Invalid Boot . Ini , " and several other fatal startup errors , Fred Langa says .
It usually takes a lot to stop XP in its tracks .
Even in those rare cases when the operating system is badly damaged , you 'll usually at least have the option of booting into the " Last Known Good " configuration , or to Safe Mode .
But sometimes , especially after major hardware failures or part swaps ( e.g. moving the operating system to a new hard drive ) , or after problems with dual - or multi-booting software , you may encounter seemingly intractable errors such as " Missing or corrupt HAL.DLL , " " Invalid Boot .
Ini , " or " Windows could not start ... "
These problems can seem hard to get past .
For example , the first time I got a " Cannot find \ Windows \ System32\hal.dll " error message , I thought I 'd be clever and replace the missing file via a simple Copy command from the Recovery Console .
I booted the PC , switched to the \ Windows \System32 folder , and there it was :
The HAL.DLL was already there .
It was n't missing at all .
Why could n't the operating system find it ?
I tried copying a fresh version of the file to \ Windows \ System 32 .
No dice .
I tried renaming it all uppercase and then all lowercase .
Nothing .
I put a copy in the root directory .
No effect .
I tried everything I could think of , but nothing worked .
Then -- doh !-- I stopped thrashing and did what I should have done initially : I dug into the Microsoft Knowledge Base and learned about XP 's built - in Rebuild command .
It can often easily fix " Missing HAL " and similar problems in just a minute or two .
If you know about this command and how to use it , you can potentially save yourself hours and hours of manually reinstalling or rebuilding a failed operating system .
The Rebuild command -- technically a software " switch " used with XP 's Bootcfg tool -- automatically searches a hard drive for valid startup information and files , letting you choose the correct ones .
This has the effect of removing and repairing any references to whatever invalid , missing , or corrupt startup information was preventing normal booting .
As is true of so many technical topics , this one actually takes far longer to describe than to implement , so please do n't be put off by any seeming complexity in this discussion .
Once you know the process , it 's actually quite straightforward and takes only a minute or two to run to completion .
For example , if you already have some knowledge of the commands involved , many " Missing or corrupt HAL.DLL , " " Invalid Boot .
Ini , " or " Windows could not start ... " problems can be fixed with these five shortcut steps :
Boot from your XP Setup CD and enter the Recovery Console
Run " Attrib - H - R - S " on the C : \Boot.ini file
Delete the C:\Boot.ini file
Run " Bootcfg / Rebuild "
Run Fixboot
It really can be as simple as that !
But the first few times you try this repair , it makes sense to use the slightly longer but more certain " official " method , as outlined by Microsoft in a number of separate Knowledge Base articles .
To save you time , we 'll concatenate the instructions here .
We welcome your comments on this topic on our social media channels , or [ contact us directly ] with questions about the site .

Wal - Mart is one of the great shining examples of what a market economy can achieve .
If I were to give a tour of the United States to visitors from a socialist country , who are used to experiencing chronic shortages of almost everything , Wal - Mart would be one of the first places I would take them .
It is a perfect symbol of one of the most remarkable things that we have — an enormous variety of high quality , low cost products that are available to virtually everyone throughout the United States .
Wal - Mart stores are indeed impressive sights , housed in gigantic structures , capable of serving many thousands of customers every day .
Wal - Mart 's most common type of store — the Supercenter — offers customers an indoor , air - conditioned shopping area larger than three football fields .
These shopping behemoths provide so much — such a staggeringly huge range of well - made products — that a person could practically live his whole life without having to shop anywhere else .
Walk into a Wal - Mart Supercenter and look around ; the place is amazing !
It boggles the mind to think of the enormous complexity that must be involved in running a store that accomplishes all this , which is truly responsible for an improvement in our standard of living .
For Wal - Mart to provide so much , for so many , as efficiently , reliably , and inexpensively as it does is an economic miracle .
Never in human history have so many people had such affordable and convenient access to all the products that Wal - Mart offers , and the number of people with this access is growing all the time .
As Wal - Mart 's late founder Sam Walton said :
" … we 'll lower the cost of living for everyone , not just in America , but we 'll give the world an opportunity to see what it 's like to save and have a better lifestyle , a better life for all .
We 're proud of what we 've accomplished ; we 've just begun . "
This is a company that deserves to be praised and admired the world over .
Wal - Mart's Critics
In spite of Wal - Mart 's outstanding achievements and tremendous benefits to the public , a determined group of Wal - Mart critics has appeared on the scene .
These people have made it their life 's mission to smear and obstruct Wal - Mart at every turn , many of them behaving with the same passion that one might expect from religious fanatics .
The critics are utterly ignorant of economics , yet they pretend to be authorities on the subject , and loudly proclaim such things as : " Wal - Mart causes unemployment , " " Wal - Mart lowers wages , " and " Wal - Mart reduces access to healthcare . "
In addition to these alleged economic sins , they say : " Wal - Mart destroys communities , " " Wal - Mart treats its female employees unfairly , " " Wal - Mart causes greedy consumerism , " " Wal - Mart desecrates sacred ground . "
To listen to these critics , one might think that Wal - Mart was the source of all evil .
Every time Wal - Mart tries to open up a new store , there is a good chance that these anti-Wal - Mart crusaders will be there to interfere , attempting to persuade zoning boards and local governments to intervene and make it impossible for Wal - Mart to operate .
They 've created websites such as Wakeupwalmart.com and Walmartwatch.com that provide " public education " on their incorrect version of the economic effects of Wal - Mart .
They 've held anti-Wal - Mart demonstrations , and put out advertisements , books , and movies .
They 've called for crippling regulation of Wal - Mart , and increased taxes on Wal - Mart .
One of their favorite activities is to point to someone who they believe has been , or could be , negatively affected by Wal - Mart 's success — no matter how temporarily — misinterpret the meaning of this phenomenon , and proceed to work themselves into a frenzy because they are convinced that this proves that Wal - Mart is destroying the world .
All of their objections are based on profound ignorance of Wal - Mart 's actual economic significance , and their behavior is destructive to themselves and everyone else .
The huge amount of media attention given to these critics by many willing accomplices has strengthened their negative influence .
The critics have succeeded in making themselves impossible to ignore .
They have dragged Wal - Mart 's good name through the mud , causing the general public to associate Wal - Mart with the endless list of accusations , rather than with the incredible service they provide .
High profile individuals such as Theresa Heinz Kerry , who came very close to being first lady of the United States , have taken public stances in favor of these critics .
According to a recent Zogby poll , 56 % of Americans now believe that " Wal - Mart is bad for America . "
Wal - Mart managers now have a new challenge ; not only do they have to run one of the biggest organizations in the world ; they have to do it with an army of fools waging a constant war of propaganda against them .
They are forced to waste an increasing amount of their time and company 's resources defending their highly efficient , very successful , and perfectly legitimate organization against these vicious saboteurs .
Wal - Mart's Response
Wal - Mart 's response has been superficial and somewhat counterproductive .
At times Wal - Mart accepts the false premises put forth by the critics , and thereby allows the debate to be improperly cast .
Instead , it should boldly dispute the false premises of its critics and confidently present its justification for the Wal - Mart business model .
This essay will attempt to expose the erroneous views of the critics , as well as present an accurate picture of the economic significance of Wal - Mart .
To make my case , I rely extensively on some of the economic ideas developed by George Reisman in his book Capitalism .
Wealth
To understand Wal - Mart 's economic significance , the concept of wealth must first be understood .
Economic progress means an increasing level of wealth , both for the individual and for the entire economic system .
Wealth , in an economic sense , is material goods that have been produced by human labor .
This includes cars , houses , lipstick , silverware , garden hoses , television sets , and anything else that has been taken from nature and changed by man into something that is more valuable to man .
It can include land or natural resources to the extent that humans perform labor to make them useful .
Wealth is not the same thing as money .
Money is simply a medium of exchange for wealth .
Money derives its value from the wealth available for trade in an economic system .
For example , if someone were stranded alone on a desert island with few supplies , it would not be accurate to call this person wealthy even if he had $ 5 million in cash with him on the island .
His money is valueless here because there is no wealth on the desert island for him to buy .
Since money derives its value from wealth , as an economic system produces more total wealth , its money supply becomes more valuable .
To learn what policies would create the most wealth is the most fundamental concern of economic science .
It is not primarily concerned with consumer spending , or jobs , or interest rates , but with wealth .
And it is not about how to make some particular group wealthier ; rather , it is about how to make the entire economic system wealthier .
It is no coincidence that one of the most influential economics books ever written is titled The Wealth of Nations .
This innovative work was one of the first to focus not on the wealth of steelworkers , or the wealth of blacksmiths , but on the wealth of entire nations .
We should use this same focus in deciding whether or not " Wal - Mart is bad for America . "
Productivity
There are many reasons why Wal - Mart has been so successful .
It offers a wide variety of products , it has customer - friendly service , it effectively communicates its value through advertising and promotions , it selects merchandise that people want , and much more .
But the major reason that Wal - Mart has had such a meteoric rise is that it offers its products for consistently lower prices than its competitors .
Its motto is " Always Low Prices .
Always . "
And it has lived up to that promise .
Wal - Mart customers have come to expect good deals on virtually all Wal - Mart products at all times .
Its lower prices have attracted large and growing numbers of customers , and have resulted in large and growing volumes of sales .
These lower prices are possible because Wal - Mart is more productive — more efficient — than its competitors .
This gives it lower costs than its competitors and because its costs are lower than theirs it is able to charge less than they do while still making a profit .
To increase productivity is to increase the amount of wealth that can be produced per unit of input .
To illustrate this concept , consider the effect of a modern technology like telecommunication .
Before the telephone , telegraph , or radio were invented , communications had to be physically carried from the communicator to the recipient either in person or through letters .
When telecommunications became widespread , people were able to instantly communicate with each other from all over the country .
Imagine all the labor that was saved from no longer having to physically carry all communications from one party to another .
This caused a vastly increased ability to produce more total wealth .
The economy could produce everything that it could before , plus whatever could be produced with the labor that was no longer needed to carry communications .
This is an increase in productivity .
It is an increase in the ability to produce .
It is more wealth with less expense .
Increases in productivity are achieved economy - wide , by single businesses , and by individuals .
They can be as simple as a hot dog stand owner finding a more efficient way to cook his hot dogs .
Anyone who has figured out a way to produce more with less has found a way to increase productivity , and all increases in productivity cause an ability to produce a larger total amount of wealth in the economic system as a whole .
The history of Wal - Mart is a history of increases in productivity .
Wal - Mart started off buying products in larger volumes to get them cheaper per unit .
It was one of the first to use self - service in its stores for goods other than groceries , thereby saving money on employees .
It opted for less extravagant store presentation in favor of lower prices .
Wal - Mart saved money through the years simply by being frugal when it came to its manager 's accommodations .
It prefers to have small and cheap offices in cheap locations .
It has been known for requiring managers to fly coach on business trips , stay two to a room in cheap hotels , rent cheap cars , and eat at cheap restaurants .
Wal - Mart increased productivity through new methods of training its employees .
It used its own central distribution centers and trucking to improve the efficiency of its flow of incoming inventory .
As its business grew and volumes of sales continued to increase , Wal - Mart began utilizing advanced technology to help it further increase productivity .
It was one of the first to use electronic scanners to capture the movement of an item at the point - of - sale .
It was one of the prime movers in the push for the development of the Universal Product Code ( UPC ) , which increased productivity for retailers all over the world by streamlining the processing of orders , management of inventory , and tracking of sales .
Wal - Mart was one of the first to use Electronic Data Interchange , which allowed it to transmit purchase orders , invoices , and other communications electronically with suppliers .
It created a system called Retail Link , which integrates all its suppliers directly with its computer system so they can coordinate more efficiently .
Wal - Mart owns the largest private database in the world , along with the largest private satellite system in the world .
This has linked every Wal - Mart store directly with the home office .
This has sped up its communications , integrated virtually its entire business , allowed it to automate an increasing number of processes , and enabled it to analyze business and sales data to an unprecedented degree .
Wal - Mart is now the driving force behind a movement towards RFID ( Radio Frequency Identification ) technology as the successor to bar codes .
This involves the use of identifying tags inside the packaging of each item that can be detected by radio frequency .
Instead of having to scan each item by putting its bar code in the line of sight of an optical scanner , with RFID , many items can be scanned at once simply by being in their proximity with a tag reader .
This could potentially increase productivity in many ways .
It could revolutionize the tracking of items through the supply line .
Whole truckloads of products could be accounted for in seconds .
RFID technology could enable customers to purchase all their products by walking past a tag reader without having to stop and have each item 's barcode individually scanned .
Since RFID tags can be hidden in packaging , shoplifting could be virtually eliminated , and the management of inventory could be radically improved .
All of the foregoing merely scratches the surface of everything Wal - Mart has done or plans to do to increase productivity .
The meaning of all these increases in productivity is increases in our ability to produce more wealth .
The result of this process can be seen in the history of many products , such as television sets .
When the television set was first invented , it was very expensive to produce , and only a few people could afford it .
As productivity increased in the television industry , television sets became cheaper to produce , more plentiful , better , and more inexpensive .
More and more people could afford better and better television sets .
Today television sets are everywhere .
This phenomenon was humorously highlighted in the movie Back to the Future .
When the main character travels back in time from 1985 to 1955 ; as he 's eating dinner with the 50's family , he mentions that he has two television sets and they assume that he 's either joking or rich .
The same thing can be said about radios , cars , computers , refrigerators , air - conditioners and countless other products .
A recent example is mobile phones .
When the technology for their creation was first available , they were expensive to produce and rare so only a few people could have them at high prices .
Increases in productivity caused them to be made more cheaply and in abundance , so virtually everyone could have them at much more affordable prices .
The effects of increases in productivity are easiest to detect in new products since their supply starts at zero and often multiplies quickly .
But this same phenomenon happens for all products in which productivity increases .
Wal - Mart 's major economic significance is that it is increasing the abundance of , and access to , not cars or air - conditioners , but to many of the most basic shopping goods , such as groceries , clothes , drugs , beauty products , toys , sporting goods , home appliances , and much more .
Because of its efforts , more of these goods exist for everyone .
As it continues to produce more , and brings prices ever lower , an increasingly large group will have increasingly inexpensive access to these goods .
Who knows ?
In the future , if Wal - Mart is allowed to continue on this path , grocery shopping might one day be as simple and inexpensive as ordering a pizza is today .
Prices
The significance of lower prices must be emphasized .
Without considering prices , many people confuse money with wealth , and thereby make themselves susceptible to serious errors in judging an action 's or policy 's effect on wealth .
Income is typically thought of in nominal terms .
Nominal income is the quantity of monetary units ( e.g. , dollars ) of income .
Real income is the amount of wealth that can be acquired with income ; it is the ratio of nominal income to prices .
So , for example , if a person makes $ 50,000 a year and the prices of everything he buys fall by 50 % , his nominal income has not changed , but his real income has doubled since he can buy twice as much wealth .
If he gets a pay raise from $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 and the prices of everything he buys also double , his nominal income has doubled , but his real income has not changed since he can't buy any more wealth .
To determine the level of wealth that income represents , real income should be considered and not nominal income .
Prices are equally as important as dollar incomes ; they are half the equation .
To a person 's well - being , a fall in prices ( other things unchanged ) is the equivalent of an increase in pay ( other things unchanged ) .
As will be shown , Wal - Mart critics are completely ignorant of the fundamental significance of prices for real incomes .
The abundance of wealth and consequently lower prices , for which Wal - Mart is responsible , causes an increase to the real incomes of all its customers .
It allows them to acquire more wealth with the money they have .
Of those customers , the ones whose real incomes increase by the highest percentage are those who spend the highest portion of their incomes on Wal - Mart products .
This group is made up primarily of people with lower incomes .
Wal - Mart offers a good portion of what you need to get by in this world , and if you have a low income , Wal - Mart is your best friend .
By shopping there , even with the lowest of wages , most people can afford to live pretty well , or at least much better than they otherwise could .
Poverty
One of the Wal - Mart critics ' chief strategies is to pretend that they are on the side of the so - called " poor " in our country , and allege that Wal - Mart is an enemy of the poor .
The truth is the other way around .
Due to our increasingly large production of wealth ( due to a long line of innovators like Wal - Mart ) true poverty in America has been largely eradicated .
" Poverty " here is n't like poverty in the past or in most other places in the world .
For example , starvation was a constant danger for most of humanity since time immemorial , but it is almost unheard of today in America even with all its three hundred million occupants .
Most people " below the poverty line " here have access to running water , modern plumbing , electricity , refrigeration of food , a bed , furniture , air - conditioning , products for personal hygiene , cleaning products , cooking and eating utensils , plenty of warm clothing , and more than sufficient food to stay healthy .
In addition to these goods that satisfy the more basic needs , virtually anyone can save enough to have access to modern goods like television sets , telephones , DVD players , washing machines , personal computers , books , radios , CD players , and microwave ovens .
Many of these goods , not long ago , either did n't exist or were only accessible to a wealthy few .
This high and rising standard of living for even those with comparatively modest incomes is possible because of radical increases in the production of all these products .
The " rich " of the past could n't have dreamed of having all this .
If policies like those advocated by the critics had been pursued in the past , this economic progress for the poor would never have occurred .
Wal - Mart 's Critics on Wealth
Wal - Mart 's critics are oblivious to the fact that Wal - Mart is responsible for a significant increase in total wealth , and that the greatest beneficiaries of this increase are those with the lowest incomes .
In fact , they do n't even seem capable of understanding that it is possible to create more total wealth .
They care nothing about the increases in productivity that Wal - Mart has achieved , nor do they see any significance in Wal - Mart 's lower prices .
The critics believe that any person or company who becomes wealthy is immorally taking an excessive share of the fixed amount of wealth that is available .
A book written by one of the critics called The Case Against Wal - Mart begins with the following quote : " Behind every great fortune there is a crime . "
This speaks volumes about the motivations of many of Wal - Mart 's critics .
It shows that they do n't have an open mind about whether or not Wal - Mart is good or bad .
They have an agenda against Wal - Mart and all their accusations and methods are used to further that agenda , which is to punish the company for being so big and successful .
If there is a crime behind every great fortune then Wal - Mart must be the biggest criminal of them all .
These critics fail to see that the great fortunes of businessmen and companies are built by producing wealth for everyone else , and not by taking wealth from others .
Since the critics can't imagine creating wealth , they react to those who are wealthy with jealous rage .
Their only solution to anyone 's desire for more wealth is to seize already existing wealth from one party — in this case Wal - Mart — and give it to another .
Unfortunately , not only does such a practice fail to create more total wealth , it causes the destruction of wealth and of our ability to create more total wealth .
Capital
Wealth can be used in basically two ways .
It can be consumed in personal use , or it can be employed in production .
For example , sunflower seeds are consumed in personal use by being eaten , or they can be employed in production by being planted in the ground to grow a larger number of seeds .
When we utilize wealth in personal use it is consumed in present enjoyment .
When we employ wealth in production we forego present enjoyment for more wealth in the future .
In the context of a modern division of labor economic system , all the wealth that is used personally outside of a business is being consumed for personal use and reduces future wealth for the sake of present enjoyment .
All the wealth that is used for business investment purposes is employed in wealth creation for the future and is called " capital . "
Contrary to what the critics probably imagine , Wal - Mart does not hold its wealth in huge piles of cash for greedy fat cats to sit atop as they light their cigars with burning hundred dollar bills .
Wal - Mart holds the vast majority of its wealth in capital , i.e. , material wealth employed in the production of more wealth .
This can include things such as buildings , trucks , tools , ships , cranes , telephones , mops , conveyor belts , welding torches , parking lots , distribution centers , computers , and forklifts .
A large portion of Wal - Mart 's capital is made up of inventories .
Without capital , man could only produce what he could make with his bare hands .
For food , he could n't do much more than pick fruits and nuts off of wild plants .
Capital vastly increases the ability of man to produce .
As our capital stock becomes larger and more technologically advanced , our wealth - creating abilities increase .
Progressively rising capital accumulation is responsible for our rising levels of productivity and standard of living .
Just as an individual can waste his wealth by consuming too much and not saving and investing enough , so can an entire economic system waste its wealth by consuming too much in personal use and investing too little in capital .
Wage earners typically consume the vast majority of their incomes , and large companies typically use a large portion of their incomes to accumulate capital .
When Wal - Mart critics try to take wealth from Wal - Mart to give to wage earners they are attempting to take wealth out of productive employments to be consumed non-productively .
In the sunflower seed example , it would be like forcibly taking seeds away from someone who plans to keep replanting them to make the seed supply grow exponentially larger , and giving them instead to someone who plans to eat them right away .
If the seed planter were allowed to continue as he was , he could produce more than enough seeds for everyone to eat , which he would make available to everyone else through trade .
In the same way , if every producer were allowed to produce like this , there would be more of everything for everyone no matter what his place in the economic system .
If we allow companies to keep and invest their wealth in capital accumulation , our wealth - creating ability progressively increases and thus everyone 's real income progressively increases .
If we forcibly take from those who accumulate capital , and redistribute their wealth to those who consume their wealth , as the Wal - Mart critics propose to do , we destroy the engines of future wealth creation for one group 's larger current consumption .
Without such interference , total wealth for everyone would go on progressively increasing , and everyone 's real income — including the supposed beneficiaries of redistribution — would quickly surpass what could have been achieved with redistribution .
Wal - Mart 's critics are preoccupied with the idea of " corporate greed , " of which Wal - Mart is alleged to be the poster child .
When they consider the large amounts of wealth held by corporations as compared to lower income individuals , they take this as proof that corporations are unnaturally and immorally obsessed with making money to the detriment of everyone else .
They fail to see that businesses — mainly corporations — are the source of all our wealth .
Take a look around your house and consider where all the products that you own came from .
For me , as I look around from my chair right now , I see a computer , paper , a desk , carpet , mini- blinds , a sofa , a television set , and a refrigerator .
I can't make any of these things myself .
All of these products were produced by a corporation and are available to me because corporations have produced such an abundance of them that it has brought down their price to a level such that I can easily afford to have them all .
To attack corporations that produce these products is to attack these products .
For example , if we wanted to , we could surely cripple the corporations that specialize in making , selling , or installing carpet , but this would thereby cripple everyone 's ability to obtain carpet .
The result would be less carpet available , and consequently much higher carpet prices .
Carpet would once again be something that only the wealthy could afford .
By attacking the " greedy " carpet corporations , the people with the lowest incomes would suffer the most because they are the ones who would lose the ability to buy carpet .
The same goes for every other corporation and the products they sell .
By their attempts to cripple Wal - Mart , the critics are thereby attempting to cripple consumers ' ability — especially lower income consumers ' ability — to obtain the products that Wal - Mart sells .
Incidentally , this is precisely what has happened recently in the oil industry .
Governments and the environmental movement put up endless obstacles to the production of oil and , lo and behold , so restricted the supply of oil in the face of rising demand that we now have sharply increased oil prices .
To add insult to injury , those responsible for this state of affairs blame the high oil prices that they have caused on oil company " greed . "
Jobs
While increases in productivity , such as those achieved by Wal - Mart , always cause a net gain to the economic system , they also , in many cases , cause a shift in the points of the economic system where human labor is most valuable .
Every time some new innovation in technology or organization enables people to produce more with less , the landscape of the market changes .
Some jobs disappear , while some jobs come into existence for the first time .
When the automobile was invented , it caused a radical increase in productivity for businesses throughout the economic system by allowing almost everything to be transported much more easily .
But it did not arrive without causing problems for some people in the short - term .
Countless people employed in businesses that depended on the widespread use of horses and buggies were left without a job , but this did not represent any kind of net loss to the economic system .
That Americans no longer needed to dedicate a large part of their labor force to producing and maintaining horses and buggies was an advancement , not a setback .
The resources saved by increased productivity were used to build up other industries and create whole new industries .
The displaced workers quickly found work in other areas of the economic system where their efforts became more valuable .
Some took jobs in the new industries such as producing or maintaining automobiles , some took jobs in already existing industries that were enabled to become larger , and some replaced workers who had moved to the new or larger industries from jobs that were still in demand .
Shifts like these , caused by increases in productivity , do not cause long - term unemployment .
As I will explain below , artificial interference with the market causes long - term unemployment .
If increases in productivity caused unemployment , the unemployment rate would be increasing all the time .
But the unemployment rate in this country is about the same today as it was a hundred years ago .
The actual effect of these shifts is a constant repositioning of human effort from less productive points to more productive points , and consequently an overall ability to produce more total wealth per person .
It means increasingly more and better products becoming increasingly more affordable to more people , which is nowhere better exemplified than at Wal - Mart .
Just as the Wal - Mart critics cannot comprehend our ability to increase total wealth , they also cannot comprehend our ability to create new forms of employment .
When a job becomes obsolete because we have discovered a way to do things more productively , the Wal - Mart critics believe that we have squandered a precious commodity , jobs .
They believe that the challenge of economics is not to find a way to produce more wealth , but to make sure that everyone has something to do .
All of their endless hand - wringing over Wal - Mart " shipping jobs overseas , " and " closing down local businesses " is based on the mistaken belief that when someone loses his job he has forever lost his only possible employment .
In reality , a job becoming unnecessary is merely a signal that there are more productive things to do .
There is no limit to our need for human labor since there is no limit to our desire for more wealth .
The fact that human beings " always want more , " no matter how wealthy they become , is often cited as if it were a sad fact of human nature .
But it is this fact that guarantees that we will never run out of employment opportunities .
The Wal - Mart critics spend half their time worrying about something that is taken care of automatically by human nature .
Worrying about running out of things for the economy to do is like worrying about the sun not coming up tomorrow .
The possibilities for new products , businesses and entire industries are infinite .
Just as it would have been difficult for someone a hundred years ago to imagine all the things that our economy does today , it is difficult for us to imagine today all the new things that the economy will do in the years to come .
Most people could n't have predicted the Internet just a few years ago ; since then , it has totally reshaped our economy .
In addition to the potential of new technologies , there is unlimited potential for employment in the already existing lines of production .
Virtually everyone would like to have five to ten times the real income he now has .
Almost everyone would like the larger homes , the second and third homes , the swimming pools and tennis courts , the luxury cars , the better wardrobes , the restaurant meals , and the travel that is today enjoyed almost exclusively by the very well - to - do .
The production of these goods in the quantities people would like to have of them , using today 's methods of production , would require more labor than people are capable of performing .
As the productivity of labor rises , more labor is made available to expand the production of what had previously been luxuries .
The only thing that prevents us from taking advantage of possibilities like these is the lack of available resources to devote to them .
As increases in productivity free up resources , the economy will always expand into new areas . [ 1 ]
Wages
Perhaps the favorite complaint of the critics is that " Wal - Mart lowers wages . "
Wal - Mart 's critics believe that a warm and fuzzy employer will pay his employees more , while a cold - hearted exploiter will pay his employees less .
The critics believe that Wal - Mart is an unusually malicious cold - hearted exploiter , and that it gained a large part of its advantage by immorally " squeezing " money out of its employees .
They believe that this will encourage other companies to start squeezing their employees , and thus an epidemic of meanness to employees and lower wages will occur throughout the economic system .
This view , which is so central to their belief system , could n't be more wrong .
An employer is not a caretaker of his employees ; he is a purchaser of the services they are selling .
Companies do not have arbitrary power over the wages that they pay their workers .
Any rational company should want to pay its employees as little as possible to adequately perform the job , and any rational employee should want to be paid as much as possible .
If an employer does not offer enough money to a potential employee , the potential employee will choose not to work for him .
If an employee insists on more money than the employer can find another qualified worker for , the employer will choose not to hire him .
An arrangement that is acceptable to both parties is where they must end up in order for them to agree to work together .
The level of pay is determined by all the factors that go into supply and demand , just as with all other goods .
The economics of selling labor services can be accurately compared with the economics of selling a used car .
When selling a used car , the relevant factors in determining market price are the supply of the type of car for sale , and the demand for that type of car .
Individuals who are interested in selling their cars wish to receive as much as possible , just as individuals selling their labor services wish to receive as much as possible .
At any given point in time there is a certain number of used cars of any specific type available for sale .
The supply of that type of car is a given , and the sellers desire to maximize their selling price is a given .
So how is the market price determined ?
It is determined by the competition of buyers for that limited supply of cars .
In some circumstances , that competition will be more intense , and in other circumstances it will be less intense .
When a person sells his car , he gives it to the party that makes the highest offer , just as people do when selling their labor services .
To successfully purchase a car , even though a buyer wants to pay as little as possible , he must bid higher than every other potential buyer of that car .
It makes no difference how nice or mean a potential buyer is ; his bid is what counts .
He must be the highest bidder to acquire the car .
Wal - Mart 's critics worrying about Wal - Mart driving wages down , is as preposterous as worrying that some group that buys cars will decide to drive the prices of cars down .
Every car buyer would love to drive the prices of cars down , but they can't .
If some buyer tried to be mean to sellers of cars by refusing to outbid other potential buyers of those cars , the sellers of those cars would cease selling them to that buyer .
The same thing can be said about employers purchasing labor services .
They do n't pay their employees a certain amount because they 're nice or mean .
They pay their employees the least they can to outbid competing businesses .
If their offer is n't enough , the potential employee is free to try getting a higher offer somewhere else .
Wal - Mart 's critics get the economics of the labor market confused when they see examples of Wal - Mart paying employees less than competitors for similar type positions .
They mistakenly believe that this proves Wal - Mart has arbitrary power over wages and chooses to pay less .
If it is the case that Wal - Mart workers receive lower wages than workers with similar positions at other businesses , it does n't mean that it is " squeezing " its employees ' incomes .
A number of market forces can cause this to happen .
It can mean that there are too many employed in the industry and that the lower wages are a signal to workers to do something else , or that Wal - Mart has simplified the necessary jobs to run a Wal - Mart store and can use less qualified job applicants .
In the case of Wal - Mart , simplified jobs are probably at least partially responsible .
As Wal - Mart has advanced technologically and organizationally , on average , its employees ' jobs have become less complicated than its competitors .
Because less qualified individuals need to accept lower wages to be able to compete with more qualified individuals , Wal - Mart can pay less than competitors if it is able to use less qualified workers .
For example , by using an elaborate computer system integrated with suppliers , Wal - Mart has radically simplified the demands on employees to track and order new inventory .
Every time a cashier processes the sale of any product , the exact effect on store inventory is instantly recorded electronically , and a computer program manages reordering .
Imagine what it would take to manage inventory in a store like Wal - Mart without the aid of computers .
It would no doubt require the efforts of many far more capable people working around the clock .
To attract such people it would have to offer much higher wages , but Wal - Mart has made the system ingenious so its employees do n't have to be .
This is why it 's very common to see individuals with modest qualifications working for Wal - Mart , such as teenagers and those with little education or experience .
In spite of their modest qualifications , they can still be relied upon to perform the relatively simple jobs that Wal - Mart requires .
This does not represent a driving down of wages , but a driving up of less qualified individuals ' ability to accomplish more productive tasks .
Wal - Mart 's simplification and automation of processes could go so far as to one day eliminate the need for most of the human labor presently employed in Wal - Mart stores .
Cashiers will probably be the next position to be completely automated .
One day machines may even take over the stocking of inventories .
This would be beneficial in the same way that eliminating our need to expend labor on horsewhips and buggies was beneficial .
The workers who no longer worked at Wal - Mart would then quickly find more productive things to do and total wealth would thereby increase .
It is a waste of time for the Wal - Mart critics to worry about average wages falling too low .
Average nominal wages on an economy - wide basis will always tend towards the level of full employment .
If average wages go higher or lower than this point , the market automatically works to bring them back to this level .
At any given time , there is a certain quantity of total dollars of demand for labor services by all employers in the entire economic system .
Average wages at full employment will be at the level of the total amount of monetary demand for labor services divided by the total number of people who choose to sell their labor services .
When the average wage rate is forced above the full employment level there is not enough total monetary demand for labor to pay all those who want to work at this higher average .
If , for example , in a hypothetical small economy , the total monetary demand for labor is $ 1 billion , and the total number of workers seeking employment is one million , the average wage must be $ 1,000 to reach full employment .
If the average wage is forced higher than this point — say to $ 2,000 — then employers could only hire 500,000 workers .
Without artificial interference with average wages , such as minimum wage laws or labor union coercion , unemployed workers would outcompete the employed by accepting lower wages .
If the average wage was $ 2,000 , an unemployed person could outcompete an employed person by offering his services for $ 1,500 .
The next unemployed person could get a job by accepting $ 1,400 .
As wages fell , employers could hire more total workers .
This would happen throughout the economic system until the average wage rate was back at $ 1,000 , at which point there would be enough total monetary demand to hire all one million workers .
Freedom in the labor market is all that is required to reach full employment .
It is in the self - interest of employers to keep wages from falling below the point of full employment because any lower wage would cause a shortage of labor services for employers .
The lower average wage would allow employers who could n't previously obtain employees to be able to afford them .
This would leave many employers who were willing and able to pay higher wages without the employees they desired .
In response to this imbalance , the employers who needed more labor services , and were willing and able to pay higher wages , would simply offer higher wages and outbid the employers who were n't able to pay the higher wages .
This would happen throughout the economic system until the average wage was back up at the point of full employment .
The critics grand idea for fixing the non-existent problem of economy - wide falling wages is essentially the same as that of labor unions , namely , to harass , intimidate , or force companies — in this case Wal - Mart — into handing over higher nominal wages to their employees .
Not only is such a practice morally repugnant , it is ineffective as a way to improve the lot of wage earners .
Artificial increases of nominal wages cause unemployment , and by attacking the producers , the labor unions and Wal - Mart critics attack the economic system 's ability to accumulate capital and produce wealth .
They may succeed in getting certain favored groups more wealth in the short - term , but this is at the cost of less wealth for everyone in the long - term .
Wal - Mart 's critics are far too focused on nominal wages when they should be focused on production , for it is the capacity of businesses as producers that can make us all richer , and not their capacity as employers .
As stated before , there are two parts to real income , nominal wages and prices .
Just as Wal - Mart 's critics are ignorant of the possibility of creating more total wealth and of the existence of potentially unlimited employment opportunities , they are also ignorant of the fundamental effect of prices on real incomes .
The part that they myopically focus on — nominal wages — is the part that it is useless to focus on changing .
Prices are the part that can change in a significant way to make us all increasingly richer .
While increased production can cause prices of goods to fall , raising everyone 's real incomes potentially without limit , it is impossible to make every wage earner wealthier by causing everyone to receive higher nominal wages .
Everyone cannot get a raise without an increase in the total quantity of money .
But an increase in the total quantity of money does not increase real incomes one bit .
No extra wealth has been produced by such an increase .
Prices would rise as much as dollar incomes and thus real incomes would be left unchanged .
If the critics want to help wage earners , they should find ways to increase production .
Probably no company has accomplished this in recent years to a greater degree than Wal - Mart .
Healthcare Benefits
Wal - Mart improves access to healthcare by raising the real incomes of all the millions of people who are its customers or the customers of its competitors , whose prices are lower because of its powerful competition .
This allows people to be able to afford healthcare more easily than they otherwise could .
In spite of this fact , another one of the Wal - Mart critics ' favorite complaints is that Wal - Mart " reduces access to healthcare . "
The Wal - Mart critics believe this because Wal - Mart does not offer substantial healthcare benefits to all its employees .
Employees who do n't have substantial healthcare benefits are often unable to afford healthcare on their own , and thus they are left with little or no access to healthcare .
Wal - Mart is blamed for their plight since the company is allegedly capable of offering more healthcare benefits but chooses not to .
In part the critics are right ; access to healthcare is becoming more problematic , but this is not caused by Wal - Mart or by " corporate greed . "
It is the result of an irrational healthcare system that causes us all to suffer , including Wal - Mart .
This is not an article on the problems in our healthcare system .
So I can only deal with that subject very briefly here .
Many people are under the false impression that employers are responsible for the healthcare costs of their employees .
The reason that so many people have this misconception is due to government intervention .
For several decades , the government has put pressures — mainly powerful tax incentives — on companies to offer healthcare as a fringe - benefit .
It has artificially created a system in which it is cheaper for an employer to purchase healthcare for an employee than for that employee to buy healthcare for himself with take - home wages .
This has caused healthcare fringe - benefits to become so widespread for so long that most people have forgotten that they are fringe - benefits ( i.e. , an alternate way to pay wages . )
Instead , many people incorrectly believe that healthcare benefits for employees are a moral duty of employers in addition to wages .
But healthcare costs are not the responsibility of employers any more than the costs of food or clothing or anything else are .
The disastrous byproduct of healthcare fringe - benefits being offered on such a widespread basis is that healthcare costs have become collectivized .
Employers cannot directly pay unlimited amounts for all the healthcare any employee would ever desire , so instead they routinely contribute amounts into employee health " insurance " policies .
Employees spend money for healthcare out of giant pools of these contributions .
If employees bought healthcare with take - home wages , they would have no reason to collectivize all their healthcare costs in health insurance policies .
Many employees would get health insurance for catastrophic events , but not for routine health expenses .
Unfortunately , collectivization turns economic progress on its head .
Healthcare is a product of human labor .
Just as we can improve our ability to produce all other products through increases in productivity , we can improve our ability to produce healthcare .
The same market mechanisms that caused television sets to become increasingly better and more affordable can cause all healthcare to become increasingly better and more affordable .
But instead of becoming more and more inexpensive as time goes by , healthcare in our country is becoming more and more expensive , a typical result of collectivization .
Since money for healthcare is spent out of giant pools of contributions , for the most part , people do n't feel any direct financial effects from their healthcare expenditures .
Therefore , an individual has little reason to show any restraint in his healthcare spending , and few people do when they know " insurance is paying for it . "
Furthermore , there is no limiting force on prices of healthcare .
Healthcare providers want prices going up higher and higher without limit , and healthcare buyers who do n't feel the direct financial effects of buying healthcare have no reason to exert pressure on providers to keep prices down .
Mainly for these reasons , healthcare costs are sharply rising .
The fundamental problem with access to healthcare in this country has nothing to do with employers who may or may not choose to offer healthcare fringe - benefits in the face of sharply rising healthcare costs .
The fundamental problem is : healthcare costs are sharply rising .
As healthcare costs rise , it will become increasingly difficult for companies and individuals to afford , and paying for it will become more of a drag on the rest of the economic system .
The sensible solution is not to pressure companies like Wal - Mart to attempt to clean up the government 's mess by dumping more and more money into the bottomless pit of healthcare collectivization as it gets more expensive .
The sensible solution is to eliminate healthcare collectivization altogether , the cause of sharply rising healthcare costs .
We must get the government out of healthcare , and we must expose as false the idea that employers have a moral duty to provide for their employees ' healthcare costs .
In the absence of government pressure , healthcare collectivization would end .
Healthcare fringe - benefits would be dramatically reduced , take - home wages would increase , health insurance would be used primarily for catastrophic events , and most people would buy healthcare with take - home wages just as they buy almost everything else with take - home wages .
Most importantly , the healthcare industry would get back on a path of economic progress , and healthcare would become increasingly better and more affordable for everyone as time went by .
Executive Wages
Wal - Mart 's critics often complain that while many employees make too little , top executives in the company make too much .
In a recent speech , Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic leader in the US House of Representatives , said the following :
" I was told that an entry level person at Wal - Mart , who works his or her entire career at Wal - Mart , would make as much as the CEO makes in two weeks .
A lifetime of work versus two weeks in the executive suite – this is not America , this is not fairness , this is not the basis of a strong middle class that is essential for our democracy .
We must change that in our country . "
This speech was reported in a CNSNews.com article titled " Pelosi Hints at Democrats ' ' Unified ' Agenda . "
The quote is part of what the article describes as a " draft version " of the Democrats ' " election - year agenda . "
If this article is correct , promoting aspects of the Wal - Mart critics ' destructive agenda may become a central goal of the Democratic Party .
Executive wages are subject to the same types of market forces as any other types of wages .
Pelosi makes the same mistakes that so many other Wal - Mart critics make .
She believes that wages are a charity fund and that Wal - Mart has a twisted and immoral preference in how it chooses to dole out its charity .
Why , she wonders , should a company give so much charity to its top executives when the people at the bottom need it more ?
Once again , the answer to this question is that wages are n't charity !
Wal - Mart owners would love to pay their executives less , just as they would love to pay all their employees less .
The reason they pay executives so much more than cashiers is because the position is so much more important to the business .
Is n't it obvious that the job of a CEO for one of the largest companies in the world is quite a bit different than the job of a cashier ?
The job of a cashier can be performed well by the vast majority of people even with very modest qualifications and skills , but the job of leader of the entire company should only be entrusted to one of the most qualified people available in the whole world .
He should possess the most extraordinary motivation , experience , and ability .
To obtain people of this caliber , Wal - Mart must offer sufficient wages .
A CEO can make or break a company .
For a company the size of Wal - Mart , choosing the right person for CEO can cause it to make many billions of dollars more than it otherwise could , and choosing the wrong person for CEO can cause it to lose many billions of dollars .
Because of the crucial importance of top positions such as this , it is not surprising that Wal - Mart is willing to pay many millions of dollars to obtain the very best .
If the government forces Wal - Mart to pay its top executives less , it will reduce Wal - Mart 's ability to obtain the people it wants to manage its company .
Why Pelosi says the success of the leader of one of America 's greatest companies is " not America " is unclear .
Maybe she meant to say " this is n't what should happen in North Korea . "
In America we have the American Dream , which is the idea that in our market economy , with hard work , it is possible to achieve extraordinary things .
Everyone has a shot at improving his situation and at possibly achieving huge success .
The success story of Wal - Mart 's CEO Lee Scott is a perfect example of the American Dream coming true .
Scott did not come from an elite background .
He was the son of a gas station owner in Kansas .
He paid his own way through college and got a management training position at a trucking company after college .
Scott first came into contact with Wal - Mart when his company had a dispute with Wal - Mart over a $ 7,000 bill .
David Glass , who later became CEO of Wal - Mart , met with Scott about the dispute .
Glass refused to pay the bill but was impressed with Scott and offered him a job .
At first Scott declined , but he later changed his mind and took a job managing Wal - Mart 's transportation department in 1979 .
Over the years he performed very well and was given increasing levels of responsibility .
In 2000 , Scott became CEO of the entire company .
He has led the company to tremendous success and today he makes many millions of dollars a year .
Some of the employees that Pelosi says will only make in their entire lives what the CEO makes in two weeks may in fact be Wal - Mart 's future CEO 's or other top executives .
Scott 's story should serve as an inspiration for such people to work hard and try to achieve as he has .
Instead , Pelosi prefers to encourage people to feel jealous of this level of success and calls for forcible government intervention to prevent it from being possible in the future .
That is un-American .
Conclusions About the Critics
Many of Wal - Mart 's critics are socialists who probably resent the fact that Wal - Mart provides an increasingly clear example of how capitalism can shower abundance on its entire population , as their socialist utopias never could .
Many of the critics seem to be motivated by fear of change and fear of economic progress .
They have a deep distrust of economic freedom and see doom and gloom around every corner as an economy is advancing .
In the past , people like this denounced innovations like the assembly line and mass production for many of the same reasons that they denounce Wal - Mart today .
They said that these new methods of production would reduce us all to miserable cogs in a machine enslaved to our employers .
It is ironic that their intellectual descendants now panic at the thought of losing assembly - line manufacturing jobs overseas because of Wal - Mart .
The next generation of ignorant critics will probably complain about the loss of Wal - Mart jobs to more efficient producers .
The truth about Wal - Mart 's critics is that they are n't really interested in economics at all , but they know that in order to be taken seriously they have to pretend to be addressing the issue from a rational point of view .
Economic science is complicated and poorly understood by most people , so propagandists often use it as a tool to lend credibility to their arguments .
By misusing economic concepts , terminology , and statistics , Wal - Mart 's critics have been able to give many people the impression that they are on the side of science .
I hope this essay has demonstrated the utter fallaciousness of that impression .
The Wal - Mart critics ' understanding of economics is n't much better than could be expected of a small child .
They are incapable of seeing anything except the most direct effects of an action or policy in the short - term .
If a child sees something he wants , he takes it , and so do Wal - Mart 's critics .
Never mind if this causes destruction and decline in the long - term for the economic system as a whole and unemployment and impoverishment for those they are allegedly trying to help .
Everything that the critics claim to be against is caused by the policies that they seek to enact .
They claim to be against unemployment , but then seek to avoid unemployment by enacting the very thing that causes unemployment .
They claim to be against wage earner impoverishment , but then seek to enact policies that would cause such impoverishment .
Wal - Mart 's critics are the economic equivalent of hysterical quack doctors running around trying to cure an imaginary health epidemic by injecting people with real diseases .
A Proper Wal - Mart Response
Unfortunately , Wal - Mart , even with all its resources , has failed to make a strong case on its own behalf .
In defending itself , it has made superficial arguments , and worse , it has accepted many of the false premises on which its critics ' arguments depend .
For example , to show that it is good for the economy , Wal - Mart often claims to be an engine of job creation .
This argument hurts Wal - Mart by accepting and lending credibility to the false premise that jobs , and not production , are the precious commodity that we should all be worried about .
When the critics condemn Wal - Mart for paying its employees too little , Wal - Mart responds by claiming that it pays its employees more than the critics say .
This argument hurts Wal - Mart by accepting and lending credibility to the false premises that wages are a charity fund , and that the higher the nominal wages a company pays its employees , the better for wage earners as a whole .
Wal - Mart has also advocated a higher federal minimum wage , presumably to try to ingratiate itself with the critics .
This strategy hurts Wal - Mart by accepting and lending credibility to the false premise that government interference with market wages — such as the kind the critics seek to unleash on Wal - Mart — is a sensible policy .
Wal - Mart should know better than to try to appease these vicious critics , who will never be satisfied until Wal - Mart is completely destroyed .
Wal - Mart versus its critics is an intellectual battle and must be fought on intellectual terms .
The anti-Wal - Mart crusade is growing and if the Democratic Party decides to get behind it , there is no telling what kind of disastrous policies might be enacted against the company .
Wal - Mart 's current strategy to defend itself is insufficient ; a new and principled strategy is desperately needed .
The first thing Wal - Mart senior management should do is learn more about economics .
The company has plenty of financial firepower , but more importantly , it needs intellectual firepower .
While the critics have brought the equivalent of a popgun to the fight , Wal - Mart has brought even less .
To start , Wal - Mart executives should read Henry Hazlitt 's Economics In One Lesson , Frederic Bastiat 's Economic Sophisms , and especially Capitalism by George Reisman .
Simply reading these three books will go far towards giving them the tools they need to strengthen their position .
When Wal - Mart began using advanced technology , senior management made it a point to keep informed of the technology available and how it could help .
The same should be done with the intellectual defense of the business .
A proper understanding of economics will clearly show that Wal - Mart has right on its side , which , to counter the attacks of the critics , should be communicated as far and wide as possible .
The critics should be exposed for the fools that they are , and treated as such .
Wal - Mart should stop apologizing and acquiescing ; it should stand proud , for it is the true champion of a better way of life for all .
[ 1 ] I am especially indebted to George Reisman for his suggestions concerning this paragraph .

The attorney general believes the camp should close
He is reported to have serious doubts about whether the indefinite detention of " enemy combatants " is legal or fair .
In a speech in London , he said the camp had become a symbol of injustice and its existence was " unacceptable " .
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the US did not want to release people who might " end up on the battlefield " or commit terrorist acts .
UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has called the camp in Cuba an " anomaly " .
But in the strongest worded condemnation yet from a British government minister , Lord Goldsmith said : " The existence of Guantanamo remains unacceptable .
The historic tradition of the United States as a beacon of freedom , liberty and of justice deserves the removal of this symbol
Lord Goldsmith
Transcript of speech in full Call shows ' significant shift '
" It is time , in my view , that it should close .
Not only would it , in my personal opinion , be right to close Guantanamo as a matter of principle , I believe it would also help to remove what has become a symbol to many - right or wrong - of injustice .
" The historic tradition of the United States as a beacon of freedom , liberty and of justice deserves the removal of this symbol . "
Around 490 detainees are in Guantanamo Bay , which opened in January 2002 .
There has been international criticism of conditions at the US camp and the length of time detainees have been held there without trial .
Rights groups have said the detainees , held on suspicion of involvement in terrorism , are mistreated through cruel interrogation methods - a charge the US denies .
Fair trial
Lord Goldsmith told the Royal United Services Institute there was a case for limiting some rights for collective security .
Fundamental rights must be protected if we are to preserve our democracies but given the current threat to our national security we have to be flexible
Lord Goldsmith
But he said the right to a fair trial should never be compromised .
Nine British nationals at Guantanamo were returned to the UK in 2004 and 2005 after government intervention .
Lord Goldsmith said the UK was " unable to accept that the US military tribunals proposed for those detained at Guantanamo Bay offered sufficient guarantees of a fair trial in accordance with international standards " .
He went on to defend the European Convention on Human Rights and the UK's Human Rights Act .
" Fundamental rights must be protected if we are to preserve our democracies but given the current threat to our national security we have to be flexible about how we achieve this , " he said .
' Right balance '
Despite recent legal challenges to control orders , Lord Goldsmith contended that the protection of the public from the risk of terrorism " by means of civil orders and the use of secret intelligence to make out the case is untouched " .
And he said deportation agreements with countries with a record of human rights abuses meant to guarantee a returnee 's safety were a way of achieving the " right balance between collective security and fundamental liberties " .
Lord Goldsmith also defended the creation of new criminal offences in the Terrorism Act 2006 to counter " some features of al - Qaeda type terrorism which distinguish it from other forms of crime " .
" Where we depart from traditional ways of guaranteeing civil liberties we should be clear that our actions are proportionate to the threat and needed to meet it , " he said .
The fact of the matter is that the people there are dangerous people
Sean McCormack
US State Department spokesman
Echoing the words of US President George W Bush - who in a TV interview on Sunday said he would like to " end " the detention centre - spokesman Mr McCormack said the US would " like nothing better than at some point in the future to close down Guantanamo " .
" Nobody wants to be a jailer for the world , " he added , saying " many detainees " had moved back to their countries of origin .
" But the fact of the matter is that the people there are dangerous people .
" One thing we do n't want to do is release people now who might at some point in the future end up on the battlefield facing our troops or somebody else 's troops , or committing acts of terrorism against civilians . "
If you ’re like thousands of other designers , programmers and other creative professionals out there , at one point in time you ’ve considered starting your own business .
Unlike most , you ’ve gone against common sense and decided to open shop for yourself .
And not just freelance full - time , mind you , but file for the company name , get some stationery , and wade through the legal mumbo- jumbo .
Maybe even get a real office with a water cooler .
Article Continues Below
This article offers real - world advice from the trenches of a small start - up , and is applicable to designers , web developers , copywriters , usability experts and all manner of service providers .
Freelancers take heed : there are several items that are just as pertinent to your profession .
Write a Business Plan#section2
The most important thing you can do to prepare for starting and operating your own business .
Developing a business plan requires a lot of time and energy , but it ’s invaluable for one primary reason — it forces you to come to terms with your business idea .
You must decide how you will generate income , what your expenses will be , who your competitors are , and most important , WHAT YOUR BUSINESS DOES .
This may seem obvious to you now , but write it down .
Think about it .
What sets your business apart ?
What service do you offer that is superior or unique ?
What ’s going to put you ahead of the competition ?
Beyond the mental exercises , a good business plan will give you a much better chance of getting a small business loan from a bank than walking in and saying , “ I like Photoshop and maybe a can do some websites or something .
Gimme money . ”
A few years ago , new age business rhetoric said forget the business plan and just run with it .
Obviously , that did n’t work out so well , so if you go that route , God bless you .
The business plan exists for a reason .
There are libraries of books written on them and huge websites devoted to developing good ones .
Some resources :
Take a few weeks and develop a strong and thought - out plan .
Give it to friends , co-workers , even family to read .
Your business will be immeasurably stronger because you took the time for this step .
File for a Fictitious Name#section3
A fictitious name ( called a doing - business - as or DBA in some states ) is the government ’s term for your company name .
If you choose HyperGlobalMegaSoft as the start - up ’s name , it has to be registered with the state to ensure no one else is using it .
This will cost about $ 100 , but prevents you from accidentally using someone else ’s registered name , or from someone else using YOUR name .
Also note that two companies can usually register the same name for different industries .
For instance , Luigi ’s ( design studio ) and Luigi ’s ( pizza joint ) .
Note the fictitious name is not the same thing as a registered trademark .
A trademark involves a whole separate process , more paperwork and additional fees .
Unlike a fictitious name , however , a trademark is not required .
This is a pretty involved topic , and enough books and articles have been written about it to make for years of boring bathroom reading .
Advice in a nutshell : start the business with your own savings or borrow from a bank .
I highly recommend the former or a combination that includes it , since it makes you pinch your pennies a little more .
If you go the bank route , make sure the business plan is polished to a high shine .
This may be a good time to hire a professional business plan writer / editor .
There is one Golden Rule :
Do n’t borrow money from family or friends .
99 % of the time , you wo n’t be able to pay them back , and on the off - chance you are , it wo n’t be for months or years .
The amount is irrelevant ; $ 1,000 or $ 100,000 can quickly create bad blood .
Get an Accountant#section5
In starting your business and maintaining its future financial health , there is no greater ally than an accountant .
He or she ( or they if you go with a firm ) will be able to give advice on innumerable aspects of your new venture .
They can advise on what type of business entity to start with , setting up bank accounts , a means of invoicing and collecting , and more .
Most importantly , they also guide you on paying taxes properly and punctually .
Brief advice on accountants :
Go with an accountant or a firm in your state .
Each state has different laws .
Make sure the accountant knows business taxes .
Do not hire a family - oriented accountant .
Unless , you are really , really strapped for cash , hire an accountant who is not a family member .
While it may be tempting to get a family discount , it is better to have an unbiased viewpoint about your finances , and also better to keep your family ’s nose out of your funds in general .
Try to trade services !
Maybe your accountant wants a new logo , website , or brochure .
Start with a Partner#section6
If you can , start the business with a partner .
This person should be another designer or programmer with a level of experience equal to or greater than your own , but with a different skill set .
If you ’re the God of Annual Reports , your partner can be the Overlord of Identity Design .
Having two Annual Report Gods will make for some lacking identity work when the client requests it .
And for the record , once again , it will be better if this person is n’t family .
“ But why a partner ? ” you ask .
“ I ’m a darn good designer , and I ’m really really gonna do this right . ”
A partner will keep you on your toes .
When you want to buy that $ 2,000 scanner , he or she should question why .
If you want to design a promotional piece , it should be a group effort to get the best results .
If you start to slack off , he or she will be there to remind you of business priorities .
No one can do everything , and two complementary skill sets create an asset that cannot be reproduced when flying solo .
About Your New Office#section7
When you start a business , the option of setting up an office outside your home has dramatic pros and cons that must be weighed carefully .
Good :
You have a place for clients to visit if they are local .
Reinforces good image ( see below ) .
Proper presentation goes a long way , and making your office appear as if you ’ve been in business for years ( you did n’t tell them you were a start - up , did you ? ) helps build client trust .
You can write off all office expenses ( rent , repairs , phone , etc ) .
This will affect your bottom line drastically .
Gets you out of the house .
Having a real place to go to work makes the business more real , and forces you to take it that more seriously .
Not -So -Good :
Money out the window .
Renting an office costs $ 250 - $ 10,000 a month , not including the initial deposit .
This is a lot of money if you have a thin or inconsistent client base .
Requires additional expense .
You will need to get a fire inspection and a certificate of occupancy , not to mention additional phone lines , Internet connection , furniture , etc .
Setting up an outside office for a new business is a case - by - case situation , and depends almost entirely on start - up money and cash flow .
Some businesses truly require a place to host clients ( ad agencies ) , and for others it ’s not as important ( web development ) .
Weigh the advantages carefully against capital , because being locked into a lease without a means to pay is no fun .
Retain a Good Paper Trail#section8
Make sure to keep a solid paper trail with clients , and that means a real , physical file with hardcopies of proposals , contracts , invoices , time sheets and anything else you can think of that relates to the project .
This also includes all financial records , bank statements , receipts , deposit slips , etc .
Before beginning your business , establish several important things .
First , design a consistent and scalable filing system for all the forms .
Whether you organize by client or project is irrelevant , but make sure you can find the information when you need it .
Second , make sure to have airtight contracts .
I advise against writing them yourself .
There are many places on the net where you can get generic forms , such as www.creativepro.com.
You will also need to look for NDAs ( non-disclosure agreements , for contracting work out to other freelancers ) , RFP ( request for proposal ) templates for clients to fill out , expense reports , invoices , and time sheets .
Every project is different , so be prepared to make changes on these forms .
And please , when you sign a contract with a client , make sure you have a copy with BOTH signatures .
Seems like an obvious thing , but you ’d be surprised .
Do n’t do any work without one , because legally , you will have a very hard time forcing a delinquent client to pay without one .
Part of maintaining a solid paper trail is having a good invoice system ready to launch at a moment ’s notice .
Make sure your invoices arrive in the client ’s mailbox while the project is still fresh .
Every invoice should clearly mark the amount to be paid and terms of payment ( 30 days , etc. ) , and clearly indicate any additional fees resulting from delinquent recompense .
If payment is late , do n’t be afraid to call the client .
Sometimes they just misplaced the invoice .
Other times they do n’t have the money and are trying to slink away .
Sometimes , “ the check is in the mail . ”
Regardless , the business that does not call to get paid wo n’t get paid !
Start Small , Conserve Loot#section9
Consider working from your house / apartment to start , especially if you have clients that will never visit you , or if you live in an expensive metropolis ( NYC , LA , Chicago , San Francisco , etc ) .
Keep your expenses down !
Do n’t buy a new quad Xeon workstation if your current machine can cut it , or a truckload of networking equipment for two computers .
Be cheap !
Look for sales at OfficeMax , clip coupons , and just shop smart .
You ’re going to need the start - up capital down the road , so do n’t drain it on frivolous expenditures .
( And yes , the folded die - cut business card with the metallic ink counts as a frivolous expenditure . )
Do n’t Undercharge , but Be Flexible #section10
If there ’s one thing to remember from this article , it should be this point .
Proper pricing is the one thing that keeps the business alive , on multiple levels .
When you charge appropriate amounts for the work , the client will feel like they hired the right people ; when you undercharge , the client will know this and take advantage of you by demanding similar rates in the future .
If you give every client a discount just to get the job ( and this will be tempting , especially in the beginning ) , you ’ll find yourself working twelve - hour days and not being able to pay the bills .
Undercharging hurts the industry in general as well ; undercharged clients come to expect and request absurdly low prices .
Legal Software#section11
Make sure all the copies of your software are retail versions .
Do not use “ educational ” or pirated software .
This is very important , and should be part of the start - up budget .
Separate Personal and Business Finances#section12
Nothing much else to say about this .
It will save you innumerable headaches come tax season .
Even the most reliable clients have dry spells , so make sure you are constantly putting your company ’s name in the marketplace .
Word of mouth is the best , but getting truly fresh work usually requires spending money .
The Importance of Image#section14
The importance of maintaining a positive image in the eyes of your clients and potential clients cannot be overstated .
Know your firm ’s identity so you can project that identity to the customer .
The visual identity is critical .
Get business cards , letterhead , and envelopes .
Design a good logo or pay someone to do it if you ’re not a design firm .
Dress the part .
When meeting with a client , look like someone who ’s come to do business , not some clichéd black - turtleneck half - shaven graphic designer who ’s gracing them with your presence half an hour late .
It sounds exaggerated , but it happens all too often .
Make the office welcoming .
If you entertain clients , keep the office clean , organized and hospitable .
Make good coffee .
Purchase comfortable chairs .
Make sure they have a place to park .
Use Outside Resources#section15
Running a business takes long hours and a willingness to learn .
However , there are many services that exist to help businesses succeed and get work .
For instance :
Your local Chamber of Commerce
SCORE
Attend business seminars .
You can learn a lot and do some powerful networking .
Many are free .
Creativepro.com .
Full of valuable resources like stock photos , business contracts , freebies and more .
$ 29.99 / year .
Elance.com .
A cause of dissention among many designers for the ridiculously low rates you have to work for , but a good place to find work when the rest of the world has shut its doors .
If you still decide to start a business , there ’s nothing more I can say except good luck .
You ’ve got to have the “ fire in your belly , ” or you will fail .
There are long hours , hard work , and incredibly frustrating and stressful times ahead .
But the rewards — being your own boss , being able to work on a variety of projects , feeling that proverbial sense of accomplishment — these are all very real results .
A Special Note for Those Still in School#section16
When I was in school , what I wanted more than anything was to start a business creating customized audio solutions for multimedia content creators .
I asked my teachers — they said it was a good idea .
I asked my classmates — they thought it was a good idea .
Then I took a six - month internship at a “ new media ” company whose focus was streaming audio and met people so poor they slept in the warehouse with the equipment because they did n’t have the experience to succeed in what they were doing .
( Incidentally , they did n’t have a business plan either . )
Before you start a business fresh out of school , wait and get some real world work experience first .
I started my design company when I was 23 , and the business clearly suffered because of it .
Not because I was young and dumb ( well , not that young and dumb anyway ) , but simply because I did n’t have enough street smarts to REALLY succeed .
Technical knowledge and raw talent only go so far .
When working at a company , you see how established businesses function : how workflow is managed , how clients are dealt with , how managers treat workers , and the absolutely critical nature of deadlines , no matter how tight .
These are invaluable lessons that school does not teach .
The US wants to expand its missile defence system
During their week - long mission the 22 experts examined three military training grounds .
The US is considering building its first anti-missile base in Europe on the territory of either the Czech Republic , Hungary or Poland .
It will be designed to shoot down long - range missiles before they reach their targets in the US or Europe .
The US team told the Czech authorities that all three sites inspected were suitable for a future base , a Czech Defence Ministry spokesman , Jan Pejsek , told the BBC News website .
Sensitive issue
The issue is controversial in the Czech Republic .
According to a recent opinion poll , quoted by the Associated Press news agency , a majority of Czechs oppose the plans for such a base .
The defence ministry official said the US experts ' mission followed two years of talks between the two countries and was part of the security strategy adopted by the Czech government in 2004 .
US experts have already been in Poland and are expected to go on a similar fact - finding visit in Hungary .
The base , designed to neutralise a missile attack on either the US or Europe , would employ up to 1,000 people , and though controversial , would bring substantial economic benefits to the host country .
Czech authorities stressed that the visit was purely technical , and any decision to set up an anti-missile base would be a political one .
However , the Czech Republic 's chances of winning the contract for the base are being damaged by the ongoing political stalemate , BBC's Rob Cameron reports from Prague .
It is eight weeks since inconclusive parliamentary elections and there is still no new government in Prague .
With a decision on the new base due in September , time is running out .
The Hurting Folk
The lunch rush has come and gone .
I ’m sitting in the back sipping espresso and reading the newspaper when Rolando , our fabulous Chileno busboy , interrupts me .
“ You got a table up front , ” he says , unenthusiastically .
“ How many ? ” I ask , looking over the top of my paper .
Rolando holds up a single digit .
“ Uno . ”
I put down the paper and look at my watch .
“ I bet I know who it is . ”
“ You psychic now ? ” Rolando asks .
“ Its that fat old man , ” I say .
“ The one who always eats alone . ”
Rolando looks at me in surprise .
“ You ’re right . ”
“ Does that guy come here often ? ”
“ No . ”
“ He ’s been here every lunch I ’ve worked . ”
“ Maybe he likes you papi , ” Rolando snickers .
“ Maybe you two are gonna get engaged . ”
“ Do n’t be jealous Rolando , ” I reply , getting up from my chair .
“ I ’m not jealous baby , ” Rolando laughs , sashaying in the opposite direction .
“ Nobody ’s better than me . ”
I walk into the main dining room .
The old mans sitting on Table 73 , picking at something on the table cloth .
Three women on Table 65 , their bill already paid , talk animatedly while they finish their coffee .
“ Good afternoon sir , ” I say to the man .
“ May I get you something from the bar ? ”
Fat , bald , and jowly , the man looks like he has n’t shaven in a couple of days .
Tiny yellow globules , remains from an earlier encounter with an egg , struggle to maintain their equilibrium on top of the whiskers surrounding his mouth .
The wrinkled grey sweat suit hes wearing is stained with greasy spots and a streak of dried ketchup .
“ Root beer , ” the man growls , not looking up .
“ Yes sir . ”
I return with a bottle of root beer and a glass of ice .
As I pour the soda I ask the man what he ’d like to order .
“ Zuppa di Pesce , ” the man barks .
“ Very good sir . ”
The man says nothing else .
I ’ve waited on him three times already .
I know he ’s not a conversationalist .
I place the half empty root beer bottle on the table and walk away .
“ He ’s a real sweetheart , no ? ” Rolando whispers as I key the man ’s order into the POS system .
“ I ’ve dealt with guys like him before . ”
“ Always nasty that one .
Siempre infeliz . ”
“ Every restaurant has people like him Rolando .
Every one . ”
“ Ai n’t that the truth . ”
I go back into the dining room .
The old man ’s staring off into space .
His watery blue eyes remind me of a fearful child scanning the horizon , wondering who ’s going to be the next person to hurt him .
He looks like the world broke him like a dollar bill and did n’t give him back any change .
The world ’s full of people like him , hurting folk who , for whatever reason , are profoundly cut off from the human race .
Unable to form or maintain relationships , but craving social contact nonetheless , they hang around the periphery of normal human activity .
You see them all the time , walking around the mall , eating alone in diners , hanging out in Starbucks – surviving off the residual energy of other peoples lives .
Relationships for these people are superficial encounters with waiters and cops , doormen and librarians , pretty girls who , trying to feel better about themselves , toss them two minutes of conversation while waiting in line for caramel lattes .
Every restaurant has at least one customer fitting this description .
Maybe it ’s an old widower who sits at the same table and orders the same thing every week .
Maybe it ’s the uptight Yuppie guy hiding behind a book or the daytime spinster drowning nightly dreams of Mr. Right under a sea of Cosmopolitans .
I can tell this old man is n’t coming here just for Zuppa di Pesce .
He ’s trying to satisfy a hunger no amount of food will sate .
I have no idea why this man is the way he is .
Maybe he ’s a veteran of war , still hearing wounded men screaming for their mothers like it was yesterday .
Maybe he lost his wife in an accident or his best years in prison .
Maybe his infant daughter drowned in a bathtub while her mother talked to a salesman hawking vacuum cleaners at the front door .
Maybe he was a drunk or a junkie .
Ill probably never know .
He is who he is .
The kitchen bell rings .
The man ’s soup is ready .
As I carry the bowl into the dining room the three lunching ladies are noisily getting up from their table , kissing , laughing , and promising to meet again .
They ’re all slightly drunk .
“ Your Zuppa di Pesce sir , ” I say , placing the bowl on the linen covered table .
The man just grunts .
“ Can I get you anything else sir ? ”
“ I ’m just glad those people are leaving , ” he says loudly , gesturing towards the three women .
My head swivels towards the ladies ’ table .
One of women heard the old man and looks like she ’s about to say something .
Luckily I catch her eye and shake my head .
Warned off , the woman satisfies herself by giving the old man a withering glance .
I watch the ladies until they walk out the front door .
Unpleasantness diverted , I turn back to the old man .
He ’s busily sucking out the innards of a clam .
His eyes look like he really did n’t want the women to go , but they did .
“ Enjoy your lunch sir , ” I say .
“ The man , of course , says nothing . ”
As I walk back to my newspaper I listen to the sound my footfalls make as they echo off the tiled floor .
There were people like this old man at The Bistro and theres sure to be more people like him here .
I ’m suddenly reminded of that line from the Gospels , “ The poor will always be with you . ”
Scriptural reflection aside , I ’m happy to leave the old man to his soup .
I ’m not in the mood for hurting folk today .
A Russian company labelled by the music industry as as an " unlawful " operation was nonetheless second only to iTunes as the favoured destination of UK digital music buyers during April 2006 , figures from UK - based market watcher XTN Data reveal .
According to XTN , Apple 's iTunes Music Store accounted for 44 per cent of music download purchases in the UK last month .
AllofMP3.com came in second , with a 14 per cent market share .
That puts it ahead of Napster ( eight per cent ) , Wippit ( six per cent ) and MSN ( six per cent ) among the nation 's top - five digital music suppliers .
XTN 's figures are based on a regular poll of 1,000 British music buyers , it said .
The methodology chosen highlights consumer activity rather than industry - supplied sales figures .
Because of AllofMP3.com 's uncertain legal status , it 's generally not included in ' official ' , music industry - sourced statistics .
Indeed , XTN has only recent begun counting use of the site in survey responses .
But whatever AllofMP3.com 's legal status , XTN's Greig Harper , told us today , crucially a significant number of British digital music buyers are purchasing music from the Russian site .
AllofMP3.com first came to UK music consumers ' attention in 2004 .
The site claims legality through a licence agreement struck between its parent company and two organisations , the Russian Multimedia and Internet Society , and the Rightholders Federation for Collective Copyright Management of Works Used Interactively .
Under Russian law , the licence permits the company to sell any song in any format , the site claims , without necessarily first obtaining the permission of the copyright holder .
That , says the music industry , puts the site beyond the pale .
But while the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) is certainly keeping its eye on the site , it has yet to take any direct action against it .
Last year , it made a formal complaint to the Russian authorities , only to see Moscow prosecutors drop the case because a loophole in the country 's copyright laws , which are geared toward the protection of content of physical media .
Despite the controversy , XTN 's numbers show a good proportion of Britain 's downloaders are using AllofMP3.com , which charges not by the track but the size of the download .
Users can download songs in a variety of formats and at a range of bitrates .
The higher the level of compression , the lower the audio quality , but the more you can download for the same amount of money .
Typically , a four - minute song encoded at 192 Kbps in the MP3 format costs just $ 0.11 .
No wonder the site is popular the same costs $ 0.99 on iTunes and other commercial music services .
How much of the 11 cents makes it back to the artist , however , is open to question , not matter how legal the site 's sales may be . ®
Some say casual sex can be a wonderful adventure
Nine out of 10 women interviewed in - depth about their views said they thought one night stands were immoral .
The researchers investigating female attitudes to sex and sexuality found most women had more traditional views of casual sex than they expected .
The results of the Sheffield team 's study of 46 women is presented at a psychology conference on Friday .
They found only 10 % of the women aged 23 to 83 who were interviewed at length thought " no strings " sex was acceptable .
' Looking for love '
Dr Sharron Hinchcliff will tell the British Psychological Society conference in Cardiff it made her question whether women have really gained the sexual freedom they are supposed to have enjoyed since the 1960s .
The team from the University of Sheffield asked women about their general attitudes to sex and concerns about casual sex emerged .
They found that although participants thought one - night stands were immoral , they did not condemn women for having them as many of them had indulged themselves .
But there was a view that those that did had " something lacking in their lives " .
' Emotional involvement '
She said the results did not fit in with images of today 's independent woman who can go out and get sexual fulfilment without the ties of a relationship .
She told the BBC News website : " Women positioned sex very much in the context of an intimate relationship .
" But when they talked about casual sex they did n't give those reasons .
" Rather it was because they were looking for something - looking for love or because they had got drunk or were high on drugs .
" There was a real sense that they were out of control . "
She added : " Sex is an emotional experience for women so how could they have sex without being emotionally involved ? "
' Wonderful adventure '
Dr Tuppy Owens , of the Sexual Freedom Coalition , said casual sex could be an empty experience if there was no mental connection .
Dr Owens added : " However , if you go out wondering what might happen , ready to give as well as receive , you might have the most wonderful adventure . "
The results of the research appear to clash with the results of a national survey in 2000 which found Britons are more promiscuous than ever before .
The National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles 2000 ( Natsal 2000 ) found that men and women have more sexual partners than they did 10 years ago and are more likely to be unfaithful .
So much bad and ugly code is being spewed out every day all over this planet that entire websites are dedicated to the preservation of the worst specimens .
In this post , I will show you simple ways to produce and maintain high - quality code because , firstly , this is one way of achieving Internet stardom that you probably want to avoid and secondly and more importantly , you know how painful it is to have to maintain bad code .
I will start by a disclaimer , using Douglas Adams words :
The problem with designing something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of a complete fool .
You can follow all the tips in this post and still end up with bad code , but you would have to be a very crafty fool !
1. Understand the problem
If this sounds like a duh - ism , that is because it is one .
If you do not understand what the code is supposed to do , you will not get it right .
Before you start coding , whether you face a blank sheet or whether you are maintaining code , sit down and think : what problem am I trying to solve here .
2. Write unit-tests
I could almost have numbered it 1 bis .
Unit tests show and validate how the code is supposed to be used .
Write the tests first if possible — unless you can get your hands on a time - machine , this is not an option when doing some maintenance .
The quality of your interfaces will improve dramatically because you will design them from their user ’s point of view .
3 . Talk to your cardboard friend
How many times were you stuck on a problem , decided to seek help from a nearby colleague , explain the situation and bingo !
the solution became obvious .
Your colleague has n’t even had time to pronounce one word , he probably did n’t even understand the question .
Articulating the problem solved it .
My nearby colleague calls this the “ cardboard friend ” because people drawn on cardboard tend to have the property of listening without interrupting .
4. Enforce a coding standard
I previously wrote about this but just in case you missed it : you need a coding standard to make your code homogeneous because reading code is hard enough , you do not need the distraction of multiple coding styles .
Once you have a coding standard , use tools to enforce it .
In Java , checkstyle rocks and if you use eclipse , be sure to check out this plugin .
There are similar tools in most languages , use them !
At first configure them to be a complete and utter pain and then relax the rules you believe are damaging .
5 . Use code analysis tools
Use any tool you can find to study and analyze your code .
If the language you are using is compiled , turn on all warnings on the compiler : use - Wall when you use gcc , open the preferences in Eclipse and activate most warnings for the Java compiler ( be pragmatic ) .
Use any lint - clone you can put your hands on for your language .
Here are the tools I recommend for Java : JDepend to measure the quality of my abstractions and to avoid cyclical dependencies , PMD to identify potential bugs and potential optimizations , FindBugs to ( coincidentally ) find bugs .
I should mention Checkstyle again since it can also detect bug patterns .
The situation is simple : the more code analysis tools you run on your code the more you will be able to fix problems before they bite you .
6 . Use a continuous integration system
I will unleash my secret finishing move on the next guy who tells me : “ but it works on my machine ” .
A continuous integration system is a referee .
If the ref says the build fails because it is broken or because some test fails , it ’s because it is .
So , go fix it .
The ref is always right even when “ it works on my machine ” .
How does it do that ?
At regular intervals , it tries to build the latest version of your code and if anything goes wrong , it fires notifications — generally emails — to whoever is concerned .
Receiving these notifications is not such a bad news : you have identified a problem in your code .
Use your continuous integration system to run the code analysis tools and fail the build if these tools report problems .
You can use CruiseControl , AntHill , DamageControl or write your own with cron+make + sendmail , but please use a continuous integration system .
7 . Write less code
Aspire at writing code like a Zen master writes a Koan :
Monk :
Does a dog have Buddha nature or not ?
Zhaozhou : Wú .
There are two principles to assist you in your quest for minimalist code : KISS and DRY .
“ Keep It Simple Stupid ” : do what is required and no more .
Focus on a clean and simple implementation .
“ Do n’t Repeat Yourself ” : avoid duplicating code .
Refactor mercilessly .
This will decrease the size of your code - base , which is a Good - Thing™ because the less code you write , the less bugs you write .
8. Performance is overrated
I will probably have a contract on my head after this point , that ’s what blogging is about , no ?
Writing fast code is a two step process :
get the code to work , stop .
In case this was unclear : do not optimize the code .
In the vast majority of cases , the code you are about to optimize is not a bottleneck .
Use a profiler on a system running realistic data and identify the bottlenecks .
Only then can you start working out how to eliminate them .
Very often you will not have to change a single interface , only the implementation will require changes .
9. Read , read , read
Read books about software development .
You must read the GoF book about Design Patterns and put it to good use .
You must pick up Martin Fowler ’s Refactoring , Code Complete by Steve McConnell .
There are countless others .
One of the first book to really open my eyes on developing good code was Writing Solid Code by Steve Maguire .
Read books about other programming languages too , you will frequently discover programming concepts that you might be able to port to your environment .
10 .
Use common sense
Common sense is your best friend to beat bad code and it ’s free !
Common sense is what dictates the previous nine points .
I hope you found these tips interesting and entertaining too !
I am looking forward to your comments .
I leave you with Zhaozhou to conclude this post : Wú !.

Complete List of Google Video Categories
Hidden Google Video Categories
Publishers have the option to select 38 different genres they 'd like to categorize their video in .
Many of these categories are not linked anywhere on the google video website .
Tricks and Application
For example say you 're looking for educational videos on alcohol or drinking , but you do n't want any drunk party videos or comedy vids .
Search for the keywords " alcohol genre:educational " instead of just alcohol .
If you search more specific keywords like alcohol effects you 'll miss videos titled " alcohol rehab center " , " Lecture on Alcohol Consumption " and a myriad of related educational videos that just do n't contain the keyword effects .
I thought the stock photography section was interesting too , because it 's formatted a little differently .
What Google Lists
On
It 's main page it lists just a few of the 38 indicated above .
Google Types
Google orders the videos by two queries .
Types and Genres .
The genres is what the publishers chooses ; the ones listed above .
Large video publishers like music corporations and news stations are categorized in the type section .
Differences Example
Notice that in the sports category on the front page the keyword is " type:sports OR genre : sports " including both genre and type .
Type List
Free Today : More Button
Clicking the more button will give you a bunch of free today categories , not a list of genres .
These are again listed under type because they are from large publishers .
I wont bother listing them here .
Go to the official freetoday page .
How were these found ?
At first it was just a guessing game actually .
I knew they existed because I had submitted videos and it seemed weird that google didnt have a way to search the categories .
I had to guess most of the queries at first .
Many are pretty straight forward .
Home video is genre search home_video .
But some were a little harder like Children & Family .
Children_fam , family , children ?
I could n't find what the category was .
I had the bright idea of searching the in edit video details html source , and sure enough there were all the category names .
< label for =" CHILDRENS " > Children & Family </ label >

Google Video By Ordered Country
Google video has top lists , movers and shakers , organized by country .
Compare what your country is interested in vs another country .
You can also use them to practice your foreign languages , but many times the videos are still just in english .
I found out shamefully after troubling myself to find as many countries as possible that google has a simple drop down button for country selection .
Oh well .
They 're here .
The Unofficial Google Video Sitemap
Google video is pretty huge .
Despite google having a popular sitemaps page google video doesnt have a sitemap of its own .
Cool Video Searches
There 's a lot of cool vids in google video and I can't wait until they give the option to search by rating .
Maybe someone viewing this blog can guess that query string ahead of time too ; ) .
Here 's some cool ideas for searches .
Check out my ( Collections of Google Videos I 've blogged about .
For some reason all these videos have been rated many times , and they all rock .
For cool pool trick shots .
Searching " pool trick shots " will also work .
See your old favorite games beaten in just minutes with these time attack videos .
Emulators are used and the game is saved and loaded until it looks flawless .
PC games are also time attacked .
Fifa world cup finals are around the corner .
Search soccer too .
There 's all kinds of skill videos to see that rock .
Google Video Language Query String
Google has an option in their video publisher section about what language the video is in .
It seems logical that google , currently in the process of a massive globalization , would have the option to see videos in native tongues .
I tried searching for google video in other languages , but have mostly failed in the process .
To find google videos in other languages lets look at how google in general sorts languages .
Google in other languages usually has a different URL tag .
For example spanish has the .mx tag at the end : http://www.google.com.mx/ .
I tried http://video.google.com.mx/ , but it doesnt exist .
In google news , google uses a query string to sort by language .
? ned=mx
For example .
Google news in english is http://news.google.com/news?ned=us
Google news for spanish is http://news.google.com/news?ned=es
( ES stands for Espanol . )
I tried a myriad of query strings but it seems google video sorted by language does n't exist .

Kulturschock im Kino
Nicht alle sehen den türkischen Film „ Tal der Wölfe “ mit gleichen Augen .
Deshalb schießt die Debatte um ein Verbot weit über das Ziel hinaus
Von DANIEL BAX
Jeder sieht den Film anders .
Viele Deutsche , die sich „ Tal der Wölfe “ aufgrund der Diskussionen der letzten Tage angeschaut haben , verließen das Kino verstört .
Die meisten türkischen Zuschauer , beileibe nicht alle , scheinen sich dagegen köstlich amüsiert zu haben .
Aber worüber ?
Zahlreiche Medien haben in den letzten Tagen auf diese Frage eine Antwort gesucht und ihre Reporter und Kamerateams vor den Kinosälen postiert , um die herausströmenden Zuschauer abzufangen .
Die Antworten fielen sehr unterschiedlich aus : Einige sagten , der Film zeige „ die Wahrheit “ und so seien „ die Amerikaner “ im Irak nun einmal .
Anderen gefiel einfach , dass mit dem Agenten Polat Alemdar ein türkischer Held die Hauptrolle spielt , zumal ihn viele aus der gleichnamigen TV - Serie kennen .
Dass er diesmal fiesen Amis das Handwerk legt und nicht , wie sonst , der türkischen Mafia , schien für sie keinen großen Unterschied zu machen .
Für viele Kritiker ist es die Szene mit dem jüdischen Arzt , die den Film vollends unerträglich macht .
Doch der antisemitische Subtext dieser
Szene scheint den meisten türkischen Betrachtern schlicht nicht aufgefallen zu sein .
Schwer zu sagen , ob dass am mangelnden Problembewusstsein liegt oder daran , dass die Ressentiments geteilt werden ; aber der antisemitische
Code ist eben nur für jene erkennbar , die ihn kennen .
Schwer überhaupt zu sagen , wie empfänglich die meisten für das platte Pathos der nationalistischen und religiösen Botschaften sind , die den Film durchziehen .
Dennoch überschlagen sich manche Journalisten und Politiker derzeit mit Diagnosen , die von einem simplen Reiz - Reaktionsmuster ausgehen .
Jugendliche würden durch den Film „ radikalisiert “ , glaubt der baden - württembergische Innenminister Rech , und dass ein paar Jugendliche in Berlin - Wedding nach der Vorführung „ Allah ist groß “ skandiert haben sollen , wurde gleich in mehreren Zeitungen kolportiert .
Nun sind Gejohle und Szenenapplaus im türkischen Kino keine Seltenheit und man würde sich einmal wünschen , manche der sensiblen Kritiker hätten sich mal in eine Nachmittagsvorstellung vom „ Schuh des Manitu “ gesetzt , dem erfolgreichsten deutschen Film aller Zeiten , bevor sie ihrer Paranoia vor aufgehetzten Türkenmassen freien Lauf ließen .
Grotesk ist daher , dass die Cinemaxx - Kinos „ Tal der Wölfe “ nun aus dem Programm genommen haben .
Auch wenn die Kinokette behauptet , dies habe keine politischen Gründe , dürfte der öffentliche Druck doch diese Entscheidung begünstigt haben .
Inzwischen wird sogar schon von Politikern in der Türkei verlangt , sie müssten sich erklären .
Dabei kann man sogar verstehen , warum die Frau des türkischen Premiers Erdogan „ Tal der Wölfe “ einen „ schönen Film “ nannte , wenn man ihn einmal gesehen hat , zeichnet er mit der Figur eines kurdischen Scheichs auch das Weichzeichner - Bild eines Islams , der Selbstmordattentate verbietet und die Menschen über alle ethnischen Differenzen zu vereinen vermag .
Diese Ablehnung der Gewalt ist keine bloß „ taktische Differenz “ zum Dschihadismus eines Bin Laden , wie Robert Misik kürzlich in der taz meinte , sondern eine moralische , und damit ein Unterschied ums Ganze : Denn so , wie Josef Joffe in der aktuellen Zeit die Folterbilder aus Abu Ghraib als „ Verrat an der amerikanischen Idee “ bezeichnet , sehen viele Muslime im Terror einen „ Verrat an der islamischen Idee “ .
Trotzdem lässt der durchschlagende Erfolg von „ Tal der Wölfe “ tiefer in den Gemütslage vieler konservativer und religiöser Türken blicken , als diesen lieb sein kann .
Sichtbar wird nicht nur ein tief sitzender Minderwertigkeitskomplex , der durch einen pathetischen Nationalismus kompensiert wird , sondern auch eine romantische Sehnsucht nach der guten alten Zeit des Osmanischen Reichs , als alles angeblich so viel besser war .
Auch an diese Zeit vor der säkularen Republik knüpft „ Tal der Wölfe “ mit der Figur des Scheichs nämlich an : Sie ist an den Großvater des Hauptdarstellers Necati Sasmaz und des Produzenten Raci Sasmaz angelehnt , dessen Andenken die beiden Brüder den Film gewidmet haben .
Dieser war ein Scheich des Sufi -Ordens der Kadiri , der wie alle anderen Derwisch - Bruderschaften einst von Atatürk verboten wurde .
In vielen türkischen Filmen der jüngeren Zeit macht sich jedoch eine Neubewertung des Islams bemerkbar , und „ Tal der Wölfe “ bringt sogar das religiöse Ritual des Ordens auf die Leinwand .
Zweifel sind jedoch angebracht , ob die Botschaft dieses letztlich doch sehr türkischen Films damit wirklich „ panislamisch “ und von Pakistan bis Casablanca anschlussfähig ist .
Denn an das Osmanische Reich hegt man in den meisten arabischen Ländern , die früher zu dessen Einflussbereich gehörten , eine weit weniger verklärte Erinnerung als in der Türkei .

I 'm thrilled over HBO doing this , it 's about time someone did !
However concerning time , it took 3 years to put it together WHY SHOW IT 5 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION ?
Nov 2nd ?
How about July 2nd or even Aug ?
Give people some time to react , and maybe even DO something about it !
Due to their timing it's " too little , too late " for 06 !

I hope the HBO documentary has the effect of catching attention like Michael Moore 's film did some years ago .
Now if they could just arrange to play to the two back - to - back and top it off with 9 - 11 Press for Truth !

They should run the trailer before showing Robin William 's new movie " Man of the Year " in the theaters .
Also agree with previous posts questioning why this movie is n't out informing ALL AMERICANS tonight !!!

Damn , I just lost HBO this month , because it is no longer offered as an analog station , and requires a digital cable box now , that would make the cable bill nearly twice as much for 3 TV's ( Time Warner ) .
Not that anyone cares ...
I am glad that the person that was doing this project has finally gotten a mainstream outlet for his important film .
I 'm also glad he decided to call the film " Hacking Democracy , " and not what he was leaning towards calling it , which was a bad pun that I can't remember now .
He asked which title we preferred at the San Diego Emergency town hall meeting in Oceanside a few months ago .
Almost everyone liked " Hacking democracy , " which was a much more straightforward title .
Did they really have to wait until Nov 2nd to release it , though ?
Sheesh .
They just have to deny everything in it for 5 days , until the election is " over . "
" Over , " of course being a relative term as there will be innumerous challenges to electoral results due to unanticipated " surprise " winners , and massive machine malfunctions .
And you know , I just got called a " conspiracy theorist " yesterday in jest .
lets see how funny they think it is on election day , when the ensuing electronic voting train wreck we all know about will happen .

It might not be all bad that it is coming out now ( rather than earlier ) .
We need everything we can get --- and should do everything we can do --- to make the nature of the election clear right now at the time of the election when it cannot fail to get people 's attention .
That necessity includes massive turnout voting for Democratic candidates to make theft as difficult as possible , detailed observation of what happens on election day , rapid analysis of results , and media works , such as this film to hammer in the truth .
I 'm not saying that electronic election fraud should not have been dealt with a long time ago .
I 'm saying that regardless of the difficulty of getting the word out previously , the election is now and it is time to make the issue clear to massive numbers of people who have been living in a fools paradise .

As everyone says , WHY just before the election ?
It may just cause our voters to give up and not vote !
In the long run , this is just what we need , as well as all the other coverage that 's been happening on Lou Dobbs .
But why Nov 2 ?
Woe is me .
Hey , Brad , should we still be pushing for the emergency paper ballots for Nov , or is it now a lost cause ?
Thanks

So glad to hear that they changed the name from " Votergate " to " Hacking Democracy " .
Everytime vote fraud is brought up , the repugs end up changing it from issues with the electronic voting machines to VOTER fraud - as in the issue being that people who do n't have a right to vote are able to cast their votes instead of the true issue where the votes are not really counted .

I do n't know --- maybe I hang around activists too much , but I find it difficult to fathom how specific knowledge of electronic fraud and the fact that it has occurred would cause people to say , " I give up " and hand it over to the crooks .
Seems to me it would make them mad .
That 's what we want .
Mad=activism , including , probably , going to the polls and saying , " OK , fraud that one , buddy " and being highly attuned to the " results " ... and more likely to challenge them .
From my experience , most grassroots Democrats are fired up and you could n't keep them away from the polls , and election fraud is a popular issue among them .

We must vote in numbers too big to ignore .
MAKE them steal it so obviously that DieBold , ES&S , and Sequoia executives and Republican Election Officials can be charged , tried , and convicted of treason by " The People 's Court " and their bodies strewn on The Barricades .
VOTE BIG !
VOTE EARLY !
Capture EVERYTHING on video or still and upload .

HBO ? .. / sigh ..
Oh well , guess I "ll have to see about getting a copy after it airs since I do n't have HBO .
Nov. 2nd ??
This should have been pushed on NATIONAL TELEVISION ( not that I think FOX would run it .. lol ) last month with repeats every week , 3 times a week .
They should have a radio version of it too , like the old story readings back in the day .
Being on HBO is great since it 's probably one of the only places it could get time , but being a primium outlet vastly limits the audience , and being so close to the election drastically reduces the amount of pirated material that will be floating around , which is how " most " people will end up seeing it ( I 'd guess ) .
The producers should offer a FREE DOWNLOAD ( still a limited audience , but bigger than HBO subscribers , I 'd venture ) starting ( now is nice ) as soon as possible .
I mean , people watching it on HBO will still watch it on HBO , they have no reason not to .
But the rest of us need to see this as well .
And , even if the info is " late in the game " , it could be enough to piss off enough people after the election when the Pugs " keep both houses " and all the machines seem to have " a few glictches " to encourage taking to the streets .
That guy who wrote " The J Curve " talked about how we 're passive in the face of these issues , he called us " stable " despite the problems .
I call us lazy and disinterested .. but that 's just me .
TO THE STREETS !
PAPER BALLOTS !

I 'm glad this is getting out , but realize it 's just in time for the repubs to scream " election fraud ! ! ! " when the dems win .
All they need to do is rig a couple races in the dems favor , that they would have won anyway , to make the whole thing look illegitimate .
Perhaps I 'm just paranoid , but they do seem to always accuse others of doing what they do .

I think the effects of this film will be : 1 . Many will stay away from the polls discouraged that their vote wo n't be counted properly anyway .
2 . Anywhere the Dems win the Repugs will cry election fraud .
Another problem might be that this will get knocked out of program because of R complaints that it is being shown too close to the election .
Hope I 'm wrong .

I can answer the question on the timing .
There were certain people who did not want this movie to ever see the light of day .
They nearly killed it .
HBO had the courage to pull the baby out and rush it to air --- I 'm quite sure the plan was to poison pill it to delay the film until after the election , when there would be less attention .
I do n't know if the story behind the story will ever be told , because it 's not mine to tell .
But believe me , there are people that were trying to kill this thing , and failing that , they were trying to delay it , marginalize it , and certainly they were trying to strongarm the filmmakers into cutting some of the most powerful scenes out .
I know that Rolling Stone got attacked by the Diebold lawyers , and I think we cannot emphasize enough that HBO showed both patriotism and great courage in taking this project on .
Here 's what I urge you to do : Have a House Party on Nov. 2 .
Watch the film .
Pass out the Black Box Voting Citizen 's Tool Kit modules for how to monitor the counting , how to audit an election , how to do public records requests .
You will find the Tool Kit in a red menu link on the right side of our home page .
This is the movie that Diebold and certain politicians have considered to be the most dangerous of all .
I have seen it .
And I 'll tell you why they do n't want it to be shown :
Because at last , it breaks down the complex issues of voting machines and hacking into a story , based on real - world characters like Ion Sancho .
It is watchable .
You do n't feel like you 're sitting through a lecture filled with talking heads , because so much of it was filmed out in the field .
Therefore , it will play a critical role in getting this nation to the tipping point on e-voting , because it will increase the size of the choir .
We can't keep preaching to the choir , and we have to recognize that most people get their information from TV , not from reading .
The HBO show will bring the issue home to people who are n't already in the movement .
I have already read one reviewer refer to Robin Williams ' new movie , which deals with a voting machine error that flips an election , as having " Wag the Dog " prescience .
The HBO film puts unspinnable facts into the public , backing up the powerful on - screen drama in the Robin Williams film , for a one - two punch that will mobilize America as never before .
Capitalize on that .
Get newbie friends in to watch and then hand them the Tool Kit modules on how to go out and collect evidence .

This is awesome news !
Make sure everyone you know is going to vote .
If the turnout is huge and the exit polls say we win ( individual races ) by 10 % or more than the hacked outcomes show , maybe , just maybe the average American 's anger will help him / her stiffen the spine enough so that they actually DO something --- like activists have in Mexico in the face of their recent stolen election .
The above statement assumes that dumbya will ALLOW an election to take place after they nuke Iran late this month .
Beware the chimp with his recently passed Enabling Act ( " Military Tribunal Act " ) that makes it legal for him to kidnap , torture , and murder anyone in the world ( including Americans ) for any reason he sees fit .

Get Ready for Another Stolen Election The Generic Polls showing a Democratic landslide assume a fraud - free election .
Will the GOP steal the election again ?
Does Diebold switch votes ?
Can there be any doubt ?
The Repugs have stolen the last three elections .
It 's the only way they can win .
Bush and Cheney are confident that they will retain the House and Senate .
Why ?
They have the means : DREs are certified to be hacked .
They have the motive : Fear of Democratic investigations into 9/11 , Iraq , torture , warrantless spying , the outing of Valerie Plame , etc… .
They have the opportunity : The Dems who could have done something are still drinking DLC kool - aid .
As you can see from the chart , over the past year the Democrats have had a 10.6 % average lead in the polls .
They 've won EVERY poll , except for ONE TIE .
The lead has been increasing over the past year .
The Democratic trendline has a positive slope while the Republican trend is flat .
But the latest Gallup poll has the Dems leading by 23 % !

The filmmakers have been thru hell the last 3 years trying to get this documentary out .
It is a miracle this film is being shown on a mainstream cable venue like HBO .
This is a HUGE breakthru for voting activists and America .
Go to a friends house and watch it .
Write HBO and thank them for having the courage to finally make vote fraud front page news .
Much of mainstream America has very little knowledge that e-vote fraud exists .
Now they will .
As for the timing , to me I am extremely grateful that HBO has the guts to show this movie .
When you have been working for election reform for years ANY time is a good time to let America know that we no longer have safe elections .
Unfortunately the media will not cover election topics in the news unless it is election season .
That is just how the media is .
And the media has certainly not covered e-voting election fraud until Lou Dobbs , Brad Blog and others kept forcing the topic .
This movie is going to blow peoples minds .
This is going to rip the sheets off of the vendors - Diebold , ES&S etc Hopefully it will cause the outrage that this issue deserves .
Thank Brad Blog and Bev Harris - go to www.blackboxvoting.org and download the " Citizens Toolkit " and take action !

Thank you Bev Harris for your much needed and appreciated comments , and your important suggestions .
Prior to the November release of the film to the general public there are actions people can take :
Go to blackboxvoting .org and download the toolkit , then join with fellow voting activists in your own county and put into action as many of the tools as possible .
Encourage your local party members , union leaders , and civic groups to watch the movie .
It will be shown multiple times .
Inform your political representatives ( especially your local county officials ) that you will be watching and would welcome them seeing it to .
Organize house parties as Bev suggested .
I too hope the truth of what delayed the film 's completion and release will someday soon be revealed .
The producers made and completed this film at great personal sacrifice and I hope that is eventually given the credit due and justice will be served .
In the meantime encourage as many to see the film as possible , and send a note to HBO thanking them for stepping forward and providing this national venue during prime time .
Finally , vote on November 7 and then be involved for the entire rest of the day and during the official canvass .

It is time citizens and media realized that the punch card morass created in the Florida 2000 election was primarily a distraction , that the core problem was in the optical scan systems as the 16,022 vote error revealed .
What is not known is how often that memory card " error " may have occured and was not caught .
That it is possible the punch card fiasco not only covered up other potential optical scan " errors , " but also " happened " to fascilitate the drive to all electronic voting .
Take one disaster and get multiple uses out of it .
Why did Florida have problems with punch cards when other counties across the nation managed quite well with them and continued to do so until HAVA required their replacement ?
Why did the officials who allowed the mess in Florida 2000 not suffer any consequences ?
Correct the message :
It 's not Voter Fraud , it 's ELECTION Fraud that is the problem .
Call for a full , independent investigation into the origins of The Election Center and how this non-federal organization came to hold so much power and judgement over electronic voting systems .
Contact all of your representatives and push for a paper ballot mandate for the 2006 elections and beyond .
You can use the upcoming airing of this movie as motivation .
Congress has a choice - they can either do nothing and by nonaction , be culpable ; or they can be proactive and protect the citizens most precious right , the right to have their votes counted as cast with a paper verifiable , hand auditable , ballot of that vote .
Does congress believe that voting belongs to the citizens of this country , or not ?
Here 's something else to digest : According to this study : http://www.rules.senate....ngs/2001/031401knack.htm
Given in testimony before the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate , in 2001 , " 5 . Because we elect Presidents by the electoral vote and not the popular vote , it 's also relevant to make these comparisons on a state - by - state basis .
It turns out that in the majority of states where some counties use punch cards and others do not , whites , the non-poor and Republican voters who are more likely to reside in punch card counties than African Americans , the poor and Democratic voters .
Unfortunately for Vice - President Gore , Florida happened to be one of the exceptions to this pattern . "
" 6 . Public resources do n't seem to matter much .
Counties with punch card systems actually tend to have higher incomes , higher tax revenues , and larger populations than do counties with more modern voting equipment .
In counties using electronic voting systems -- the most expensive type -- per capita incomes and property tax revenues are actually lower than in counties using punch card or any other voting technology .
Florida is actually one of the best examples of these patterns : the largest and richest counties tend to use punch - card equipment .
The Washington Post 's claim of November 11 that it is " mainly affluent counties that have switched " to newer technology turns out to be dead wrong . "
Is it possible that if a recount had occured in punch card - only counties in Florida , given the demographics , the outcome would have favored a Republican ?
And therefore , there was nothing to lose in that case if a recount had been allowed , in the punch card only counties ?
Correct my logic if needed .
This study would appear to support the kind of memory card hack found in recent tests , in just the demographics necessary .

I did n't get to watch the entire program .
Just bits and pieces with the intention of watching a replay on Sunday .
However , while catching one , five minute segment - and then rewinding my DVR to make sure I really saw it - I noticed that part of the videotape of the software screen showed the word " Memroy " instead of " Memory " .
That made me think of one of two possibilities .
Either the real Diebold software was so poorly quality controlled that such a spelling error was allowed to go out in a final product ( questioning , in my mind , the overall software quality ... sort of the point of the show ) , or the screen was a poorly done mockup by the show 's producers ... in which case , one might question the validity of the show if such mockups were not disclosed in the credits .

Googlespotting can be an amusing if sometimes tiresome game , with many stories ( such as the GoogleOS and Google Browser ) turning out to be nothing more than wishful thinking on the part of eager Internet denizens .
However , occasionally the rumors turn out to be true , especially if they are backed up by a reliable source .
In this case , the source is the Wall Street Journal , which has reported ( subscription required ) that Google is planning to release their own spreadsheet application to compete with Microsoft Excel .
This news comes on the heels of the company 's March purchase of the web - based word processing application Writely .
Writely was billed as " The Web Word Processor , " and used AJAX , XML , and ASP.
NET technology to deliver a fairly convincing simulation of a word processor , albeit a fairly feature - thin one .
The program allowed the import of Microsoft Word documents and featured the ability to easily collaborate with other users , as well as offering quick and easy publishing in HTML format for the web .
It is not known at this time whether Google is planning to purchase one of the existing web - based spreadsheet applications such as EditGrid or iRows , or whether the company plans to release their own version from scratch .
Given Google 's history , it seems that the former option is probably the most likely .
Although these applications are fairly simple to create — the company that created Writely had only four employees at the time of the Google purchase — it is still easier and faster to purchase an existing solution rather than rolling one 's own .
So what is the ultimate goal of Google in going after Microsoft Office replacements ?
Some may look at it as simply an opportunity to attack Microsoft by releasing free , web - based versions of their bread - and - butter applications that can be used on any platform .
However , Google did not get to be the company it is today by merely engaging in " Let 's attack Microsoft " thought patterns .
Microsoft is not easily hurt by the mere existence of free , cross-platform Office replacements — after all , OpenOffice has been around for a long time , and yet the company is still doing very well with Office sales .
Instead , I think Google 's approach is more clever .
By getting even a small number of people to do their word processing and spreadsheet creation online , the company could , in theory , leverage all sorts of useful data about the contents of these documents .
Just as Gmail messages are delivered with content - sensitive AdSense ads , so could documents .
For example , if a user starts creating a spreadsheet about Future Widget Sales Growth , the web - based application could load ads pointing to alternate Widget suppliers .
This would make AdSense even more desirable for potential advertisers .
Also , giving away a new free application would drive traffic to Google 's servers , which also increases their potential revenue stream .
Still , will people really start doing their spreadsheets online ?
Most people tend to be a little more protective of their spreadsheet data , often because the numbers represent data that is supposed to remain confidential within a company .
However , for casual users who use a spreadsheet simply to create and manage lists , a web - based option might be a useful one .
Every year , close to 1 million people around the world kill themselves .
Florida State University Bright - Burton Professor of Psychology Thomas Joiner has spent much of his career trying to find out why .
After all , lots of people are hopeless and depressed , many severely .
Why do some people choose to end their own lives and others do n't ?
The answer , he believes , could save lives .
" There 's an idea that suicide is a mode of death that stands apart from others , but there are clear reasons why people die by suicide , " said Joiner , an internationally recognized suicide expert .
" Just like heart disease , if you understand it , you can prevent it . "
In a groundbreaking theory outlined in his new book , " Why People Die By Suicide " ( Harvard University Press ) , Joiner says that those who kill themselves not only want to die , they have learned to overcome the instinct for self - preservation .
The desire for death , according to Joiner , is composed of two psychological states : a perception of being a burden to others and a feeling of not belonging .
Alone , neither of these states is enough to instill the desire for death , but together they produce a desire that can be deadly when combined with the acquired ability to enact self - injury .
So how does one overcome the natural instinct for self - preservation ?
In a word : Practice .
In Joiner 's theory , suicide victims literally " work up " to the act by getting used to danger , fear and pain .
They may do this in a variety of ways over their lifetime .
For some this practice is deliberate .
They engage in reckless behavior , cut or otherwise hurt themselves or have repeated suicide attempts .
Others may have a history of accidents or medical procedures while still others become inured vicariously .
Perhaps like physicians — who have an elevated risk of suicide — they are exposed through their work to pain and suffering on a daily basis .
Eventually , self - injury and dangerous situations become unthreatening and mundane , according to Joiner , making suicide easier to carry out .
" Some people think that those who commit suicide are weak , " he said .
" It 's actually about fearlessness .
You can not do it unless you are fearless , and this is behavior that is learned . "
Joiner 's theory explains why seemingly disparate groups of people , such as anorexics , athletes , prostitutes and physicians , have higher than normal rates of suicide .
The lifestyles of all of these people expose them to pain — either that of their own or others — and in a sense harden them against suffering , Joiner said .
It also explains why a relatively large number of people want to kill themselves but only a fraction do .
Likewise , many people are capable of killing themselves but most do not .
There are relatively few people in the dangerous convergence zone of desire and capacity for suicide , according to Joiner , and these are the people who are at greatest risk for serious suicidal behavior .
But knowing the risk factors makes prevention possible , Joiner said , noting that maintaining good interpersonal relationships is essential .
This is perhaps the downfall of many older white men — the demographic that has the highest suicide rates of all .
" If you think you belong or that you are contributing , you are going to be protected from suicide no matter what else is going on , " he said .
Scare campaigns such as those that are sometimes targeted at teenagers do not work as prevention tools and may , in fact , backfire because they further habituate the at -risk patient to the idea of suicide .
Joiner noted that rock singer Kurt Cobain repeatedly watched news footage of a government official who committed suicide during a news conference before carrying out his own suicide in 1994 .
While Joiner 's book is based on his own experience as a clinical psychologist as well as studies that he and other researchers have conducted , the book is also personal .
Joiner was a graduate student when his father took his own life — an event that came as a shock to his family and friends .
But Joiner now understands why it happened , and that 's information that he wants to share with the 2,500 other families who learn the news of a loved one 's suicide every day .
Perhaps , he said , one day that number will be less .
A trio of entrepreneurial hackers hope to do for the business of password cracking what Google did for search and , in the process , may remove the last vestiges of security from many password systems .
Over the past two years , three security enthusiasts from the United States and Europe set a host of computers to the task of creating eleven enormous tables of data that can be used to look up common passwords .
The tables - totaling 500GB - form the core data of a technique known as rainbow cracking , which uses vast dictionaries of data to let anyone reverse the process of creating hashes - the statistically unique codes that , among other duties , are used to obfuscate a user 's password .
Last week , the trio went public with their service .
Called RainbowCrack
Online , the site allows anyone to pay a subscription fee and submit password hashes for cracking .
" Usually people think that a complex , but short , password is very secure , something like $ FT%_3 ^ , " said Travis , one of the founders of RainbowCrack Online , who asked that his last name not be used .
" However , you will find that our tables handle that password quite easily . "
While security professionals have questions whether a business can be created by offering access to rainbow tables , the endeavor does highlight the weaknesses in security of password - only authentication .
History has shown that password systems are imminently breakable .
In August , a group of Chinese researchers found further breaks in a common hash function , the Secure Hash Algorithm or SHA - 1 , used by the U.S. government .
In September , researchers from the University of California at Berkeley published a paper that demonstrated that the sound of a person typing can reveal the content , including passwords .
Those technical breaks do not even account for the human factor :
People tend to pick simple passwords and disclose them frequently .
In fact , many viruses and worms have successfully spread by trying to log into administrator accounts using a small list of common passwords .
Because of the problems , the U.S. government is requiring that banks move towards two - factor authentication , where the typical password security is augmented by a biometric or a physical security device .
Some security researchers maintain that even adding a second type of security check is not enough .
The latest attack focuses on the hash functions used to verify passwords .
Because operating systems cannot keep a copy of the password on the disk without weakening system security , the software instead saves a statistically unique code generated from the pasword .
While the code , or hash , is computationally easy to create , reversing the process to recover the password is nearly impossible , given a correctly implemented hash function .
Rainbow tables side step the difficulty in cracking a single password by instead creating a large data set of hashes from nearly every possible password .
To break a password , the attacker merely looks up the hash to find the password that produces that code .
" Creating the tables takes much more time than cracking a single hash , but then you can use the tables over and over again , " said Philippe Oechslin , CEO of Swiss information - technology firm Objectif Sécurité and the inventor of rainbow tables .
" The advantage of rainbow tables is that once you have the tables it is faster than a brute force ( attack ) and it needs less memory than a full dictionary ( attack ) of the function . "
On the long drive back from Burning Man , my friend Patrick and I talked about our many experiences during our week on the playa .
We had a lot of laughs and a lot of Irritating Moments .
We decided to write up a review and post it on my blog to share with the world .
Achtung Hippie ! : Reflections on the Burning Man Scam
Patrick Mulroy & Tim Wayne
The idea of holding a massive event in one of the hottest nastiest driest places on the planet seems stupid on the face of it .
Why would almost 40,000 people pay over $ 200 for a ticket and probably $ 1000 - 1500 total to suffer in this godforsaken place for a week or more ?
For years my common sense kept me away , just as it has safely helped me avoid backpacking in Afghanistan , running an ultra-marathon in Death Valley or eating bacon wrapped hot dogs from the vendor carts in Tijuana .
Though my common sense seldom fails me , my friends often do and they conned me into wasting a week of my life and about $ 1500 to attend Burning Man 2006 .
To be fair , my friends had been conned themselves by glowing reports of the “ magic ” � of this overrated hippie love fest at the gates of Hell .
“ Burning Man changed my life , man ” � was the word .
Hey , we all want to change our lives : stop smoking , lose weight , quit drinking , fall in love .
The promoters of Burning Man promised all of this and more in their feel - good web accounts of dull people who now lead exciting lives , thanks to taking the Burning Man cure .
These absurd claims had the hollow ring of cult indoctrination , but I was hooked .
I wanted to drink the spiked kool - aid and search for magic in the nothingness of the Black Rock Desert .
Nothing could have prepared me for the stupidity of this event , except perhaps an honest account of how truly awful it was .
I ’ve been unable to find such an account , online or elsewhere .
I offer my dissent to the pretense that is Burning Man .
I hope that my eyewitness report will save potential burn victims a week of vacation and at least a grand in misspent cash .
Few communities want 40,000 yahoos drinking , drugging and fornicating in their backyard for a week .
I know I do n’t .
As such , Burning Man is held in a dry ancient lakebed known as a “ playa “ � in a state where gambling and prostitution are legal , respectable businesses and 24 hour boozing is a protected right : God Bless godless Nevada .
When the gold ran out and most of the Indians had been murdered , they turned to exploiting human weakness to earn their daily bread .
Promotion of vice is the state ’s stock and trade .
Whatever Burning Man supporters claim , know this , the event is a 24/ 7 bacchanal of booze , drugs , nudity , S&M , public sex , and bad art , all done in a scorching flat dry oasis of misery that reminded me of the surface of Mars .
This drug orgy is translated by event promoters on the BM website as a “ radical experiment in self - expression . ” �
Was n’t that Jeffery Dahmer ’s excuse when asked about the body parts in his fridge ?
From San Diego , the Black Rock Desert is exactly 900 miles on my trip odometer .
I arrived with two friends , Tim and Alex , just past sunset on the first official day , Monday the 28th of August .
As we descended onto the site , we could see the flat and vast playa , ringed by the Jackson Mountains and Black Rock Range .
Stark and beautiful , yes , but thousands of cars and RVs , combined with the constant wind , had kicked up a massive storm of alkali dust .
Dust masks are required gear at all times though many do not wear them .
Even with a mask on , it is impossible not to inhale alkali dust at Burning Man .
We waited in the Will Call ticket line for 30 minutes in this storm .
Most of the Burning Man staff are volunteers and seemed stoned and disorganized , though cheerful .
Most Burning
Man tickets go for $ 225 if you buy them a well in advance .
As “ the burn ” � approaches , the prices steadily ratchet upwards .
While we waited in line , a staff member announced that all the $ 325 tickets were sold out and that the price was now $ 350 , snickering as he made the announcement .
There was now little pretense that this was not a massive grift .
The only service included in your $ 225 -$ 350 admission is overflowing portapotties , often devoid of toilet paper .
That ’s it .
In what universe is that not a grift ?
Prior to entering the BM compound , all vehicles are searched : not for drugs , guns or explosives ( bring as many of those as you want ) , but for stowaways trying to avoid the $ 250 ticket price .
“ Do n’t try to grift a grifter ” � is the point here .
Finally reaching the front of the line , we were met by a greeter : “ Welcome home ! ” � she gushed .
Good acid , I thought .
She must have mistook us for black rock beetles , the only living thing that calls the playa home , surviving mostly on hippie skin and other organic matter blown by chance onto the playa .
After a two - hour traffic snarl at the gate , we arrived at our camp : exhausted , surly and coated with a fine layer of dangerous alkali dust .
If the founder and King Rat of Burning Man , Larry Harvey , had been present we would have gladly taken turns shocking his balls with a car battery , Abu Ghraib - style .
We were that pissed .
Larry was likely in St. Bart ’s spending our money , or perhaps in a fabulous underground lair built by enslaved hippies from previous burns , or maybe just laughing from his Lear jet above in his trademark white Stetson .
The man seems a curious cross between P.T. Barnum and Jim Jones , conning the same moon - eyed Bay Area seekers whom Rev. Jim hypnotized so tragically .
The first full day at BM felt like the worst jet lag of my life .
I was tired from the 900 - mile trip , exhausted from the heat , the dust and the 4,000 ft altitude and thin air .
The word “ nausea ” � barely covers the full body ache you feel when “ acclimating ” � to the Martian landscape and punishing heat of Burning Man .
You ca n’t move , you ca n’t escape the dust or heat and you are surrounded by some of the most perverse and deviant people you will ever meet .
Everywhere you look a “ porno - copia ” � of sagging balls , flopping peckers , hairy asses , flabby breasts and other uninvited unattractive nakedness will strip away any remnant of goodwill you may feel towards your fellow burners as the caustic alkali dust strips away your exposed skin .
What gives these naked perverts the right to expose their ugly fucked - out carcasses ?
If being forced to view hundreds of hairy ass cracks as you gag down breakfast sounds fun , Burning Man is for you .
In the mad heat of Burning Man at 2 pm on Tuesday , parachutes opened 6,000 feet above and I imagined that Pope Benedict , former child Nazi , had jumped in , leading a brigade of storm trooping Cardinals and castrated choir boys , his Vatican banners streaming yellow smoke from his Luft - Commando parachute , to lecture these folks on the spiritual benefits of wearing clothes .
The Black Rock Playa is about as far as you can get from the Garden of Eden and still be on the planet .
Adam and Eve were said to be naked and perfect as God made them .
Most of the Black Rock nudies were much less so , and could have hung signs around their necks reading “ Behold the Ravages of Time . ” �
At least viewing their tanned and leathery hides reminded me to apply sunscreen .
Then I saw a naked fat man walking alone across the playa into the dead oblivion of the Jackson Mountains , a Barbie doll sticking out of his ass .
Ok , I got dehydrated and imagined that one .
Still , the official Burning Man web site would welcome Barbie - Ass Man since “ There are no rules about how one must behave or express oneself at this event . ” �
When in human history has “ no rules ” � ever been a recipe for harmony or peace ?
The overheated Burning Man playa is subject to dust storms that may appear as slow whirling tornadoes or a massive wall .
Though you can often see them coming , escape is impossible and winds can top off at over 70 mph : hurricane force .
Shade structures and scaffolding with steel frames can be pulled from the ground and may hurt or kill you .
There are thousands of temporary steel framed structures , secured loosely to the playa , that may go airborne without warning as dust devils assault Black Rock City .
Note to future burners :
You may be injured or killed at Burning Man .
The climate and weather of the Black Rock Desert is wholly unsuited for an event of this size with thousands of steel framed shade structures .
Burning Man Wednesday to Friday was a cauldron of dust , heat and shabby monster trucks ( some absurdly labeled as “ art cars ” � ) crammed dangerously with partiers blasting bad music from blown speakers .
Every day the noise and number of yahoos increased as the weekend approached .
The post - apocalyptic spirit of Mad Max and Beyond Thunderdome were all around : monster cars , noise , chaos and intimidation .
Imagine a shabby , somewhat dangerous crew of NASCAR fans , bikers and other bullies looking to inflict their lifestyle on your camp site , then circling for hours and hours all night for another round of megaphone ranting and stupidity .
These are the people who tailgated us at 80 mph in overloaded RVs hurtling recklessly down the infamous Donner Pass toward Reno .
These are the people who complained when firearms were banned from Burning Man a few years ago .
If you want to live in a trailer park with 40,000 people where insane drinking , drugging , public nudity and lawlessness are the norm , Burning Man is for you .
The Department of Public Works ( DPW ) is the rowdy but hard - working crew of roughnecks that sets up and breaks down Black Rock City .
They spend months on the playa in rough conditions with low pay to build the city ’s infrastructure and return it to a pristine state , post - burn .
During one rare moment of comic relief during BM 2006 , the DPW paraded through the streets in their beat - down trucks , raiding each camp and demanding cold beer .
We gladly surrendered our beer to this heat - crazed and desperate bunch .
I have nothing but praise for them , as would anyone who prefers not to be tracked down and killed .
“ Fuck your day ” � was their motto : now it ’s mine too .
Despite its pretensions as a wacky art project , Burning Man is not about art .
Most of the art was terrible with garish acid-inspired images and other peeks into Hell .
Any random collection of Toto and Yes album covers would contain better trippy art than all of Burning Man .
A few of the “ art cars ” � were inspired and brilliant , though most were just chicken - wire enclosed golf carts kicking up dust on the esplanade and trailing a few Christmas lights and dusty faux fur .
Burning Man is not for non-conformists .
You must wear a Burning Man outfit or risk constant abuse .
I did not wear any silly costumes at Burning Man , or dress in drag , or hang my ass in the breeze , nor did my friends .
Surviving the heat was plenty : we had no spare energy for playing dress up .
For this breech in burner protocol , weirdoes in furry suits chided us that “ jeans are not a costume . ” �
These “ furries ” � dress in full fur suits , like comic characters in the Ice Capades or that big rat at Chucky Cheese , and like to do drugs and have sex in their suits while in character .
If there is anything worse than a pervert , it ’s a self - righteous druggie pervert , dressed as a chipmunk , offering unsolicited fashion tips .
If you want catty advice on how to dress from a crowd of Rocky Horror Picture Show rejects , Burning Man is for you .
Despite pretensions of forming an “ experimental community ” � the Burning Man demographic is whiter than the crowds at the Republican National Convention : Dick Cheney white and twice as mean .
I saw less than a half - dozen black people all week and only a few Asians .
This proves my theory that blacks and Asians have way more sense than whites .
The lack of diversity and total indifference to this lack seem odd considering the pretensions of many Bay Area residents and other burners to racial and ethnic inclusion .
There is nothing new or experimental about an all - white community .
I doubt that the white bullies who dominate Burning Man and define its aggressive personality make non-whites feel welcome or safe .
If you are white and prefer to party with whites only , Burning Man is for you .
The climax of this neo - hippie hootenanny is the burning of a 40 - foot wooden effigy , known as the Burning Man .
Before his destruction , this blue neon lit figure is the center of attention in the middle of the Esplanade , the central plaza .
I love fireworks and enjoy burning things so I had hoped that this final orgasm of flames and destruction would somehow mitigate the misery of my worthless trip .
The burning of the man is 90 minutes of fire dancers and neo -pagan ritual , all centered on a god - like central figure , with his arms raised in triumph towards a frenzied , expectant crowd , clearly united in some dark purpose .
This finale of Burning Man is a kind of hippie Nuremberg Rally .
As the Burning Man burns , both his arms eventually fall to his side .
Curiously , his left arm dropped first , leaving his right arm raised in a straight - armed Nazi salute .
At that moment , a spontaneous cheer went up a thousand right arms were raised as one over the smoky playa .
Heil hippie !

Despite my disdain for Burning Man , many claim that the event is “ magic ” � and “ life altering . ” �
For some , this “ magic ” � comes from their first Ecstasy , acid or mushroom trip .
Powerful mind - altering drugs are consumed in massive quantities at Burning Man .
People are very nostalgic about the first place they got really , really high .
This is part of the affection many have for the event : nostalgia for a first high .
Though not officially a sex party , Venus rules Uranus at Burning Man .
The young get laid because they are young and older horny guys can get laid using drugs and booze as a lure .
Sometimes their prey will stumble into camp pre-drugged , always a bonus .
For many creepy middle - aged guys , Burning Man is a week long frat party where they get their last real shot at nailing women half their age .
Lone women are easy prey .
The darkness , disguises , anonymous playa nicknames and extreme intoxication that occurs at Burning Man makes it a date rapist ’s Disneyland .
Of course , if sober and fully consensual sex is your thing , there are several approved swinger and sex - themed camps at Burning Man too .
If you did not get laid , high or loaded at Burning Man but still claim you liked it , then you may have been infected by their magic pods and are now a self - deluded supporter of the Burning Man cult .
The cult mantra is that Burning Man is “ magic . ” �
I guess , but so is cocaine if you do enough of it .
I imagine that the supernatural success of this event could not happened without some special help from the Devil himself , who I ’m told holds the deed to Larry Harvey ’s soul .
If Hell is half as nasty as Black Rock City at noon , I ’m going to start being good soon .
If you love the Devil and the events he supports , Burning Man is for you .
If you read my review of Burning Man and assume I ’m some hung - up religious prude , I can assure you this is not the case .
My factual description of the event is accurate .
I wrote this review because I could find nothing truly critical of Burning Man online .
This is incredibly suspicious .
Mother Teresa was considered a living saint yet there are many critical essays about her , but none on Burning Man ?
Many supporters of Burning Man defend the event as fervently as Tom Cruise defends Scientology .
Anyone that is critical simply does not “ get it . ” �
My friend
Tim responded in kind to a BM supporter when he replied “ Is it possible I got it , but “ it ” actually sucks ass ? ” �
Though a Burning Man “ virgin ” � , I ’ve been to a dozen weekend campouts with music and partying and have enjoyed each one immensely .
None of these events cost more than $ 75 and often included meals .
All were held in beautiful locations with plentiful water , usually in the mountains .
No profits were collected and none of us were burned .
Most of the participants were beyond friendly : downright open , affectionate and loving .
This was not the case at Burning Man .
Note to hippies : Burning Man is not run for hippies and not run by hippies .
It is run by thugs and bullies for the benefit of thugs and bullies .
It is a festival for the Freudian Id , the sub - basement of the human psyche .
Hermann Goring would have been in heaven here with the drugs , freaky sex , cool costumes and torch - lit rallies .
If we all spent one more week in this dark utopia , I ’m certain cannibalism and goose stepping would have been de rigueur , then mandatory .
Too many at Burning Man were not even civil or respectful of their fellow burners or themselves .
In a sad way , the event reflects our current national temper , a country controlled by red - state yahoos , led by a reckless bully who refuses to change course despite the pile of bodies in his wake .
Burn on W. Burn on .
* * *
We packed in darkness at 3 am Sunday morning , the day of resurrection .
The road was empty and I was exhausted and wanted to escape before anyone sobered up .
Perhaps this was the magic of Burning Man : surviving an annual death cult rally and returning to the joys of hot showers , air conditioning and dust - free living : civilization never seemed more splendid or necessary .
I reminded my passengers that we had spent one week in a desert hell but no one had shot at us or tried to blow us apart with an IED .
Servicemen in Iraq are deploying for a year or more and are in constant peril .
Severely injured and maimed Marines have become a common sight in my favorite Oceanside , California poker room .
Black Rock City is better than Baghdad , that ’s for sure .
The wind was rising , carrying the scent of the last bonfires into the Calico Mountains .
I murmured a prayer for everyone .
What else could I do ?
The whole world is bleeding but you can only burn off so much bad karma in a week .
The Buddha urges patience in these matters .
All is passing , everyone we love , the rights we enjoyed before 9/11 , basic civility and human decency , all gone now .
The America I was raised in is dead , replaced by a monstrous pretense of democracy .
I drank a Red Bull and kept my eyes on the road .
I could not stop crying .
As we headed for Reno across the Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation , my friends drifted to sleep as the muffled voices of Native American spirits reminded me to stay awake and the horizon glowed with the heartbreaking blue light of the desert before dawn .

With nearly 60 million registered users , 15 billion page views per month , and more than 150,000 new users signing up every day , MySpace is that rare social networking contagion that keeps spreading and growing .
Can this beast be stopped ?
Is there anyone out there that can challenge the leadership of MySpace ?
Can any of the many new upstarts , like Tagworld and MyYearBook lap MySpace into the pole position ?
With numbers like that , its safe to say that MySpace has essentially captured the entirety of Americas youth .
Moreover , these kids have created their own unique MySpace profile pages that are , in turn , rapidly becoming their personalized dashboards to everything that is important to them in their daily lives .
Currently , that includes social networks of their online friends , venues to communicate with them , and collections of their favorite music & videos .
But as they mature , and their hunger for new types of information , media , and social connections expand , they will want their dashboards to grow and morph with them , each personalized with only the items that they are individually interested in .
At the end of the day , services like MySpace have the rare opportunity to become the ultimate console for consumer control ( C3 ) .
Every media and technology company on the planet , both old and new , will eventually all be battling each other for presence on these millions of C3s .
The way I see it , C3s represent the killer app and the end - game for the alphabet soup ( e.g. XML , RSS , AJAX , etc. ) that is Web 2.0 , and the early adopters this time are proving to be the teenagers ( just like I grew up with the PC in my most formative years , these kids are the first generation to grow up with the Internet ) .
And as adoption moves beyond the teenagers to the mass market , C3s will become the platform of choice for media creation , consumption , and distribution .
In such context , how brilliant a move was it for Rupert Murdoch to have scooped up MySpace when he did ?
Conversely , how short - sighted is it for anyone who wants / needs significant share of the attention economy to * not* develop , or acquire , a similar strategic asset for their portfolio of web services ?
As unbeatable as MySpaces market position seems at this juncture , it behooves anyone eyeing this space to remember that consumers are faddish and fickle .
There is no demo where this more true than it is with teenagers .
This means there is still ample market opportunity to take market share away from MySpace , especially as everyone is trying to figure out what the ideal C3 platform will ultimately look like .
Recently , two fellow bloggers provided their unique perspectives on this general subject matter :
So in an effort to add to the conversation , let me chime in with my own thoughts .
From a strategic viewpoint , there are two fundamental qualifiers that anyone whos looking into this space should first consider :
look for social media services that specifically target the markets low - hanging fruit , specifically the teenage demographic ( e.g. the older the demo , the less valuable the property in this context ) ; and then further filter out the contenders by identifying those services that have successfully crossed the chasm of early - stage viral adoption ( the elbowof the hockey - stick adoption curve ) .
On the latter point , it should be emphasized that such adoption is not predictive … as Yahoo ! and Google are finding out with their social networking experiments , there is no proven transportable formula for creating the next viral mega - hit .
Rather , pinpointing such potential is almost a purely empirical exercise of wait - and - see… based on adoption / usage data , look for the services that have reached the inflection point .
The big reason why this is the case , more than ever , is due to the fact that a social media services competitive edge increasingly comes from the community itself , and not from central planning ( as I wrote in my previous piece here
In my own analysis of this space , there are a limited number of services that meet the aforementioned qualifications .
But thats only the first round .
If you then further refine the analysis with added criteria , one service stands outamong its peers … and thats myYearbook.com ( some recent growth numbers can be found here . )
So I recently met with the founders of myYearbook.com to get a closer look .
Not only do I think they represent the best contender to give MySpace a run for their money , I also believe they have a better model that is more solid and sustainable over time , and less vulnerable to consumer market volatilities .
As for why thats the case , youll have to wait until I post the second part of this story , which will be sometime in the next few days ( meanwhile , you can read what this week ’s edition of BusinessWeek had to say about them . )
As an exec at Delphi Internet Services , Robert Young played a key role in launching the industrys first nationwide ISP ( he then orchestrated the sale of Delphi to Rupert Murdoch ) .
Then as founder / ceo of Freemark Communications , he invented the business of free email and Pay - Per - Click internet advertising .
Robert is currently focused on superdistribution digital music pioneer , Weedshare.com , and is also in the process of starting up a new venture in the online video space .
The dirty secret behind Kyoto
The U.S. chose economic growth over reducing emissions - but so have many of the countries who actually signed on to the Kyoto treaty .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
The green fundamentalists have never been shy about casting the first stone .
If the world fries because of climate change , they thunder , it will be America 's fault .
Or , more specifically , George W.'s , because he took the Kyoto Protocol out of the desk drawer where Bill Clinton had stashed it for several years , and definitively binned it .
Indeed , the United States and Australia are the only rich industrial countries that have not signed on to Kyoto , the international treaty designed to slow down the rate of greenhouse gas emissions .
( President Bush said that meeting the target of reducing U.S. emissions by 7 percent from 1990 levels would be too much of an economic burden . )
This willful resistance of world opinion , say the Bush administration 's many environmental critics , is the classic example of how America is setting itself apart from mainstream thinking .
But is it ?
Take a close squint at the numbers , and frankly it looks as if many of the countries that did sign Kyoto share Bush 's concern that the economic pain might outweigh the green gain .
Look at those nice people north of the border : Canada agreed to cut emissions by 6 percent .
Whoops .
The country is running 24 percent ahead , a lot more than the United States , which is 15.8 percent above 1990 levels .
Japan has the same 6 percent target , and is also missing big , by about 13 percent .
Okay , how about the 15 western European countries that were Kyoto 's original members ?
Sorry , for the second year in a row , according to figures released in late June , emissions rose for the EU - 15 .
As a whole , the EU - 15 was supposed to cut its emissions by 8 percent ; just two years before the clock begins ticking ( the deadline is the average between 2008 and 2012 ) , it has cut emissions by less than 1 percent .
And even that is not as impressive as it may sound , since much of the reduction dates to the early 1990s , when Germany was shutting down filthy and unprofitable industries in the post - communist east and Britain was dashing for gas , as it scaled back its filthy and unprofitable coal industry .
About two - thirds of the reductions they have recorded so far occurred by 1995 - i.e. , two years before the Protocol existed .
To look at it another way , from 2000 to 2004 , U.S. emissions increased by 1.3 percent ; in the EU - 15 , they increased 1 percent .
In both places , the only time since 2000 that emissions actually fell ( 2002 in the EU , 2001 in the US ) have been recession years .
And there 's the rub .
The EU - 15 has done a far better job of weakening the link between emissions and economic growth - remember , it has in fact cut emissions a teeny little bit , while the regional economy grew 32 percent from 1990 - 2004 .
( The U.S. over the same period grew 52 percent and emissions rose almost 16 percent . )
But the link still exists .
And nowhere is anyone putting climate change ahead of the economy .
The German government , for example , has gone further than anyone to cut emissions ( minus 17.5 percent from 1990 ) .
But not only does it continue to subsidize its coal industry , but in late June scaled back the requirements for major industrial emitters and exempted new power plants from any limits until 2022 .
To make up the difference , German motorists will be asked to drive slower .
Hah !
And it is telling that one of the major reasons for the rise in EU emissions in 2004 was that high prices for natural gas prompted power producers to shift to coal , which is dirtier .
Given a choice , people decided to save money , not the planet .
Canada signed up to Kyoto , but it is still going full speed ahead developing Alberta�s oil - sands industry , which produces millions of barrels of oil - and millions of tons of GHG emissions .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper has said flat out that Canada will not meet its target .
Japan did n't manage to reduce emissions when it was in perpetual recession ; now that the economy is actually showing signs of life , no one is clamoring to take tough action to meet the requirements of a treaty signed in its own country .
No question : Japan and Europe are more efficient in their use of energy , and a couple of countries ( Denmark and Britain come to mind ) have been sincere , serious and successful in keeping their promises .
With the development of other climate strategies , such as trading and sequestration , the pace of compliance could quicken .
But that is speculative .
For now , the bottom line is this :
When the choice comes down to growth or Kyoto , the evidence is that the EU , Canada , Japan and the United States all go for their wallets .
In this sense , at least , the U.S. is very much in the mainstream of global climate policy .
The report regarding the Chancellor ’s five tests for joining the Euro might provide an impressive economic analysis ; yet as we all know it will be a pointless one too
The Treasury ’s assessment of the consequences of British membership of the euro is one of the most extensive cost / benefit analyses ever undertaken .
There will be numerous equations , copious data and thousands of pages .
The credentials of its authors suggest that the assessment will be carefully planned , technically skilled and as fairly presented as is possible on such a politically controversial subject : the epitome of what modern civil servants are proud to call evidence - based policy .
And yet we in Britain know that it is all a charade .
I have not met a single person who is genuinely waiting to read the assessment before deciding .
Not one .
I count some odd people among my friends .
People who tremble with excitement before the release of the third quarter ’s manufacturing figures .
People whose idea of a good night out is a session at the computer centre running econometric models .
But economists have been falling over themselves to take up positions in advance of the chancellor ’s statement .
And if that is true of economists , it is far more true of ordinary people .
Go down to the pub and ask what customers think about the euro .
You will get plenty of views but I bet not one of them will be : “ I want to see what the Treasury has to say about Gordon Brown ’s third test . ”
Most people , in fact , will judge the assessment by newspaper reports .
And we already know how UK newspapers will line up .
Proprietors , editors and journalists have already made up their minds and so have politicians .
The only exceptions are those that prove the rule : Labour members of parliament who are waiting to see which way the wind is blowing .
People will use the material in the assessment to reinforce the views they already hold , not to form their opinions , or to change them .
When Mr Brown discusses the way ahead with Tony Blair , it may be that their conversation runs : “ I think the amplitude of the Belgian trade cycle has fallen slightly since 1999 , Gordon . ”
“ Yes , Tony , but are you sure the statistic is robust ? ”
But I suspect these are not the kind of exchanges they have .
Big decisions in politics and business are the result of political horse - trading and are based on partial information , visions and prejudices , hopes and fears .
We Britons are taught that matters should be different .
We would prefer to think that the right answer is deduced from dispassionate technical analysis .
And that is why our leaders pretend that is what they are doing .
They assure us that the government ’s decision on euro membership will be based on an objective application of Mr Brown ’s five tests .
Businesses tell us that they decide on big investments , on strategic acquisitions , only after they have calculated the discounted cash flow and undertaken extensive scenario modelling .
But any competent civil servant or business analyst knows that his job is to work out the answer the boss wants and adjust the assumptions accordingly .
It can never be otherwise .
A British decision to join a single currency , or stay out of it , will last for ever .
Even with 50 years of hindsight , we shall not know the answer .
How can we ever tell what would have happened in an alternative scenario ?
The eurozone economies have performed poorly since the euro was launched .
But perhaps they would have done worse if it had not been formed .
The only thing we know for sure is that the assertions of those who foresaw either triumph or disaster were wrong .
Some Britons are instinctively internationalist ; others regard national identity as vital .
Some are natural Europeans ; others feel more at home with the US .
There is nothing shameful about emotions of liking and disliking , nothing inappropriate about basing judgments on instincts about who can be trusted .
Business people as well as politicians use the language of economics to make exaggerated predictions about matters of which they can have very little knowledge .
We should resist the pressure to cloak these judgments in the language of economic costs and benefits .
Such analyses may be helpful in framing our thoughts and revealing inconsistencies in our arguments but they should not be the basis of our decisions .
And , in reality , they never are .
December 20 , 2005 , 8:42 am
After you finish this post , I have an updated post on the same topic here .
Well , the US trade deficit is up again , and you can be sure the news was accompanied by a lot of moaning and groaning and soul - searching .
The main reason that all the media and the majority of Americans freak out over large trade deficit numbers is that they look at the American economy as a large bank vault with a fixed supply of money on the shelves .
They reason that if more money is going out of the vault to buy things than is going back in from sales , then eventually the vault will go empty and we will be bankrupt .
Either implicitly or explicitly , those who fear trade deficits perceive the trade imbalance to be red ink , something bleeding out of a fixed supply .
This view of the trade deficit as a being a growing and unsustainable debt is wrong .
I will try to explain in a couple of ways .
The micro view
Lets first look at it from the perspective on one individual .
Lets say Fred made $ 50,000 this year , and lives in a US where , before he makes his spending decisions , trade is exactly in balance with China .
Fred spends some of his income on rent , and invests some in some nice US equities .
And he takes $ 1000 of what he just made that he might have saved and buys himself a nice Chinese - made plasma TV so he can really enjoy the Superbowl next year .
So , where 's the debt ?
One can argue that net savings is lower ( perhaps - we have n't gotten yet to where the Chinese are spending their extra US dollars ) , but Fred seems to have increased the trade deficit without incurring any debt .
In fact , Fred is actually better off , since in a free society no one engages in a transaction that does n't return more value than one spends .
In this case , the plasma TV provides more than $ 1000 of value back to Fred , or else he would not have engaged in the transaction .
Yes , many people are buying Chinese TV's with consumer debt , but these same people are buying much more American stuff with consumer debt as well .
To the extent that there is or is not a " problem " with people taking on too much consumer debt , this problem is absolutely unrelated to the country of origin of the goods they are buying .
You can max out your Visa card on American stuff just as easily as on Chinese stuff .
But wait , you say .
The reason the debt is not obvious is from the way I structured the problem .
I assumed the rest of the economy was static while Fred was making his decision .
But if Fred had bought American , somewhere in the US economy there must have been less debt .
So we will tackle this next .
The Economy is Not Zero Sum
Repeat please :
The economy is not zero-sum .
Never has it been so hard to convince people of a concept that should be so obvious .
I used up bushels of electrons explaining why the economy is not zero sum here , but the short proof is easy : Look at the world in 1900 .
Look at it today .
The world as a whole and most every individual is far richer .
The fact is that economies create wealth every day , and free economies create a LOT of wealth .
At the heart of every argument that the trade deficit is bad is the mercantilist notion that the US economy is a bank vault leaking funds .
But this analogy that seems to be in everyone 's head is flawed .
The supply of money or wealth in the US , in the vault , is constantly growing .
If you really have to think of it as a vault , then think of what 's inside as rabbits rather than gold bars .
Does anyone doubt that if you start with a hundred rabbits and every year sent a few to China that you might still have more rabbits than you started with in the vault ?
A free economy is like a group of rabbits on Viagra .
Even if the Chinese took billions of dollars they got from selling goods to the US each year and burned the money in a big bonfire , the US still would be growing in wealth .
Of course , the vault analogy sucks for a larger reason , that the US economy is deeply integrated with that of the rest of the world .
In fact , much of the wealth creation comes from this very integration , providing a more robust division of labor and a deeper well of creativity and entrepreneurship than any one country could achieve on its own .
And the dollars we send overseas do n't stay there , they come back .
But we will address this next .
So What do the Chinese do with Those Dollars ?
OK , so we are all short - sitedly ( at least according the the " progressive " intelligentsia ) sending dollars to China to satisfy our consumerism .
So what do those Chinese do with those dollars ?
They can't spend them domestically , because stores and vendors in China do n't accept dollars any more than the Wal - mart down the street from me accepts Yuan .
Most all the dollars have to come back to the US , or the person in China holding them gets no value .
You could say , well that person can take them to the bank and exchange them for Yuan , and that is true .
But that bank would not accept the dollars for exchange unless it knew it could get them back to the US , or had another client that needed them to make a purchase in the US .
So , the dollars will have to come back to the US to purchase something .
Some of the dollars come back to purchase US goods and raw materials , but of course this is less than the total dollars the Chinese have to spend , or else there would be no trade deficit .
In fact , this all that the words " trade deficit " really means .
It means that of the dollars the Chinese receive from sales to the US , only a portion is used to buy American goods that are shipped back to China .
The rest goes to buy American .. something else .
What ?
Well , some of it goes to purchase American goods that stay in the US .
Lets shamelessly steal an analogy from Don Beadreaux and Jack Wenders .
If Chinese companies buy American steel and lumber and ship it to China , it shows up in the trade balance .
If they buy the same products and build a factory in the US , it does not .
The Chinese use a lot of their dollars to invest in buildings , real estate , capital assets , factories , production facilities , etc. in the US .
And this is bad , how ?
I know that since the Japanese investment boom of the eighties , there are lots of folks who call themselves " liberal " who suddenly got very upset about foreigners owning US - based assets .
It is impossible for me to see this concern as anything but xenophobia and racism , since hundreds of years of Dutch , Canadian , and British investment never worried a soul but Japanese and Chinese investment has everyone in a lather .
By the way , if you worry about China as a security threat , would n't you rather see them invested in the US economy , and therefore have a strong interest in our continued prosperity ?
One could easily wonder why Saudi Arabia does not use their power over oil reserves to screw with the US like they tried to do in the early 70's .
The reason is that all of their wealth is invested in dollar and euro - denomitated assets .
People worry about the power the Saudis may have to mess with our economy , but their reinvestment of dollars back in our economy has made this a game of mutual assured destruction .
The same thing is occuring with China .
The other thing the Chinese do with the money is invest in dollar - denominated financial assets , which in many ways is just an indirect way of investing in the same capital assets listed above .
They will invest dollars in equities and , yes , debt securities .
But the fact that the Chinese choose to spend their dollars on debt securities does not mean that the trade deficit is causing the debt .
If the Chinese had a predilection for debt securities , more so than say an American holder of dollars , one might argue that this predilection drives down interest rates a bit and therefore might increase total debt , but this is a fairly tenuous chain of causation and not , I think , what seems to be bothering folks who panic over the trade deficit .
In fact , one can argue that the causation runs more strongly the other direction , that the large US budget deficit keeps the dollar higher than it might otherwise be , increasing the trade deficit .
So when people lament that " we now consume much more than we produce " , they are making a meaningless statement because the we in the first part are not the same as the we in the second part .
The US and the Chinese are sending equal amounts of money back and forth - its has to be , over the medium to long term , or exchange rates would crash .
All the trade deficit means is that there is a difference in WHERE Chinese and Americans consume the goods .
Americans consume Chinese goods in the US .
The Chinese consume some of the US goods it buys in China , and then consumes the rest in the US .
The trade deficit represents the net amount of American goods and services the Chinese buy in the US and choose not to haul back to China .
Instead , they take ownership of the American goods here , in the form of capital assets or financial securities that represent ownership or calls on the cash flow of these capital assets .
Anyway , you can find more here at Cafe Hayek .
Postscript :
By the way , the US has run a trade deficit of a magnitude that panics people for over two decades .
If this is bad , surely we would be able to find the damage somewhere .
But the US over the last two decades has had the strongest economy in the world .
I suspect that a lot of people would answer " we have run up a huge debt " .
But any increase in total debt in the US is not relevant to the trade deficit , or only tangentially related as discussed above .
The Federal debt is run up because the politicians are all spending whores who support their reelection with " good works " paid for with our money .
Consumer debt , which may or may not be " too high " , is based on individual spending and saving choices , and is unaffected by whether a person buys an American or Chinese TV .
Blonde Haare kamen ursprünglich durch eine seltene Genmutation zustande .
Wie sich die Haarfarbe in der Eiszeit so schnell in Europa ausbreiten konnte , war bisher ein Rätsel .
Jetzt vermuten Forscher : Es lag am Nahrungsmangel - und vor allem an der Lust auf Sex .
Nicht nur mancher Gentleman der Neuzeit bevorzugt Blondinen - schon Höhlenmänner fanden die Vorgängerinnen von Marilyn Monroe , Brigitte Bardot und Scarlett Johansson besonders attraktiv .
Zu diesem Schluss kamen jetzt Forscher zweier britischer Universitäten .
Schuld sei die Evolution : Gegen Ende der Eiszeit hätten sich blondes Haar und leuchtend blaue Augen bei Frauen als Reaktion auf Nahrungs - und Männermangel herausgebildet , glauben Forscher der renommierten Universitäten St. Andrews in Schottland und Central Lancashire in Nordwestengland .
Mag die Theorie anfangs auch abwegig klingen , sie stützt sich auf Fakten .
Denn bei bitterkalten Temperaturen in der Eiszeit litten die Menschen in Nordeuropa Hunger ; auf Nahrungssuche stürzten sie sich in immer gefährlichere Großwildjagden , bei denen viele Männer den Tod fanden .
Die Frauen fanden oft keinen Ernährer und Sexualpartner mehr .
Diese missliche Lage habe einen " starken Druck der sexuellen Selektion " ausgelöst , sagt der Leiter der Studie , der kanadische Anthropologe Peter Frost .
" Ein mögliches Ergebnis war das Auftreten ungewöhnlicher Farbeigenschaften der Haare . "
Ihre außergewöhnliche Haarfarbe brachte den Blondinen offenbar bessere Chancen auf Fortpflanzung .
Nur so könne er sich erklären , warum sich blondes Haar , ursprünglich eine seltene genetische Mutation , in einer vergleichsweise kurzen Zeit in Nordeuropa ausgebreitet habe , sagte Frost .
Zudem sei bekannt , dass bei sexuellen Selektionsmechanismen Farbmerkmale häufig eine Rolle spielen .
In Europa siegt die Vielfalt
Eine separate Untersuchung nordeuropäischer Gene an drei japanischen Universitäten stützt Frosts These : Nach Angaben der britischen Tageszeitung " Times " kamen die japanischen Forscher zu dem Schluss , dass vor etwa 11.000 Jahren die genetische Mutation einsetzte , die zur Herausbildung blonder Haare in Nordeuropa führte .
Dieser Zeitpunkt fällt genau mit der Eiszeit zusammen .
Auch Frosts Kollege John Manning von der Central Lancashire - Universität hält den damaligen Männermangel für den Grund , warum " Haar - und Augenfarbe in anderen Teilen der Welt eher einförmig sind , während es in Europa viele Variationen gibt " .
In Europa kommen allein sieben verschiedene Blondschattierungen vor - bisher war es Wissenschaftlern ein Rätsel , wie sich eine solche Vielfalt in relativ kurzer Zeit entwickeln konnte .
Blondes Haar steht für Sex - Appeal , dunkles für Verstand
Echte Blondinen mögen sich in ihrem Selbstbewusstsein durch die Ergebnisse der anthropologischen und gentechnischen Studien gestärkt fühlen , die im Detail in der nächsten Ausgabe des Fachmagazins " Evolution and Human Behavior " veröffentlicht werden .
Doch auch für alle Brünetten gibt es nach Angaben des " Times " einen Trost : Eine Studie der Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO geht davon aus , dass es künftig keine naturblonden Haare mehr geben wird , weil der Genpool dafür immer mehr schrumpft .
Allerdings werde es erst in rund 200 Jahren soweit sein , dass die Nichtblonden wieder unter sich sind .
Forscher der City University of London fanden außerdem bereits im vergangenen Jahr heraus , dass moderne Männer auf Fotos brünetter und rothaariger Frauen positiver reagieren als auf Fotos von Blondinen .
" Die Erwartungen der Männer an Frauen haben sich geändert " , sagte der Psychologieprofessor Peter Ayton , der die Studie leitete , der Tageszeitung " The Independent " .
" Sie suchen nach intensiven , gleichberechtigten Partnerschaften . "
Payton vermutet , dass die männliche Psyche Dunkelhaarige mit Verstand assoziiere , während blonde Frauen eher mit körperlichen Reizen in Verbindung gebracht würden .
オープンソースのロボット・ツールキット
仮想的な場を使ってロボット・アルゴリズムをテストする
ソフトウェア・ロボットとは ワシントン大学 ( University of Washington ) の研究者達は、ソフトウェアとロボットを組み合わせてSoftbot という言葉を作り出しました。またインテリジェント・エージェントという言葉は、特にインターネット対応のエンティティーという意味合いで、一般的に使われるようになってきています。1996 年、Franklin と Graesser は、初めてエージェント分類を導入し、ウィルスを自律エージェントに分類しました。
従来のロボットは多種多様ですが、ソフトウェア・エージェント ( 仮想ロボットに対応するもの ) の登場によって、ロボットの種類はさらに増えました。物理的なロボットの特性の多くは、仮想領域でのロボットにも当てはまります。例えば、物理的なロボットの持つ可動性という特性は、何らかの移動運動を意味しています。一方、モバイル・ソフト・ロボット
( あるいはエージェント ) も、可動性を持つことができます。ここで言う可動性とは、ネットワーク上のホスト間を移動できる機能、という意味です。図 1 は、物理的な世界と仮想の世界での自律ロボットの大まかな分類を示したものです。この記事では、合成環境でのロボットをシミュレートする機構として、ソフトウェア・エージェントに焦点を当てます。
図 1 . 自律ロボットの大まかな分類
ロボットの要 素
物理的なロボットであれ、仮想的な ( ソフト ) ロボットであれ、基本的な概念は同じです。ロボットは、自分の置かれた環境を認識するためのセンサーや環境を操作するためのエフェクターを持ち、またロボットが意志を持った有益な動作をするためのコントロール・システムを持っています ( 図 2 ) 。
図 2 . すべてのロボット・システムの基礎となる要素
物理的な世界では、消火活動をするロボットは、温度センサーや赤外線
( IR : infrared ) センサー 、GPS ( Global Positioning System ) などを使って自分の置かれた環境を認識し、またモーターや、場合によっては消火器をエフェクターに使って環境を操作します。一方、仮想検索エージェントは、Web サーバーや HTTP インターフェースを使って環境 ( インターネット ) の認識、操作の両方を行い、またコンソールをエフェクターに使ってユーザーと通信を行います。
図 3 に示すシステムは、閉ループのシステムです。このシステムでは、センサーがコントロール・システムに入力を与え、コントロール・システムが環境に変化を与えます。もう
1 つの見方として、この図をフィードバックの点から考えることもできます。環境を変化させる動作をコントロール・システムが規定すると、センサーはその変化を検証し、新しい環境の状態をコントロール・システムにフィードバックします。オープン・ループのシステムでは、動作によって環境状態を無事変更できたものと想定せざるを得ませんが、それは望ましいことではありません。
図 3 . 環境との間のループを閉じる
ロボットを構築する場合、センサーやエフェクター、そしてコントロール・システムを、全体として考える必要があります。この記事では、コントロール・システムについて、また物理的なロボットに組み込む前に、コントロール・システムのシミュレーションと検証をどう行うべきかを中心に説明します。
ロボット技術とシミュレーション
Linux とロボット技術 Linux は、ロボット技術用のオペレーティング・システムとして一般的ですが、これは
Linux のルーツがロボット技術の歴史と似ているためです。つまりロボット技術は実験の世界であり、最適化をし、新しいことを試し、そして将来に向かって進化することでもあります。Linux も、その核心は非常に似ています。初期のロボットは単に風変わりなものであり、実際的なアプリケーションはほとんどありませんでした。Linux も同様に、ホビーストのオペレーティング・システムとして始まりましたが、小さな組み込みデバイスからスーパーコンピューターに至るまで ( そして多くのロボットにも ) 使われる、強力で安定したオペレーティング・システムに成長しています。
ロボット技術の分野では、シミュレーションは重要な役割を果たします。これは、他の方法では高価で時間のかかる可能性のある実験を、シミュレーションで済ませられるからです。シミュレーションでは、動的な合成環境の中で概念を実験できる一方、刺激への反応データを収集することによって、コントロール・システムの質を判断することができます。またシミュレーションでは、 ( 遺伝子アルゴリズムの場合でも見られたように ) 何世代ものコントロール・システムをランダムに組み合わせることによって、ロボット用のコントロール・システムを進化させることができます。
シミュレーションが最も力を発揮するのは、マルチ・ロボット環境の場合です。こうした環境の好例は、ロボット・サッカーです。ロボット・サッカーでは、シミュレーションあるいは物理的なロボットによって、あるロボット・チームが別のロボット・チームと、サッカーという世界的な人気スポーツで対戦します
( そのため世界的なゲームとして理想的です)。ロボット達は自分のチームの他のロボットと
( 場合によっては通信によって ) 協力しながら相手チームと戦い、また、相手チームのロボット達とは敵対して動作する必要があります。そのため、ロボット動作のテストとしては非常に高度なものです。
しかしシミュレーションには欠点もあります。現実の世界は整理されておらず、ノイズだらけのことが多く、また合成環境は基本的にモデル化が困難です。しかも、現実の世界のセンサーは非常に多様な、予期せぬ特性を示しがちなため、ロボットのシミュレーションは困難なことが普通です。こうした欠点はありますが、合成環境でロボットをシミュレーションを行うことで、多くを学ぶことができます。
Linux 用のオープンソース・ツールキッ ト
ロボットによるコントロール・システムの構築に利用できるオープンソースのツールキットは、いくつかあります。この記事では、移動ロボット・シミュレーターと、物理計算のモデリング・システム、そして最後に、シミュレートされたコントロール・システムを物理的なロボットに組み込めるシミュレーターについて見ていきます。こうしたツールキットの圧倒的大部分は
Linux 上で実行しますが、これはそれらが基本的にオープンソース・モデルに基づいているためです。オープンソース・ソフトウェアは、迅速に、かつ少ない手間でソフトウェアを開発できるプラットフォームであるため、ロボットには理想的です。また
Linux では、他のオペレーティング・システムでは不可能なカスタム化
( 例えばカーネルの最小化や拡張など ) が可能です。こうしたツールキットや他のツールキットへのリンクは、この記事の最後にある 参考文献 のセクションを見てください。
ODE
Russell Smith による ODE ( Open Dynamics Engine ) は、連結剛体 ( articulated rigid body ) の動作力学をシミュレートできるオープンソースの物理計算エンジンです。これを利用すると、現実の世界の物体の力学をグラフィックス・ライブラリーとは独立にシミュレートすることができます
( グラフィックス・ライブラリーとして は OpenGL を使うことができます ) 。ODE を使うと、合成環境におけるあらゆる種類の物体
( 3 次元ゲーム環境での人物や、ドライビング・シミュレーションでの車など ) をモデル化することができます。ODE は高速な上、リアルタイム・シミュレーション用の衝突検出もサポートしています。
連結剛体 ( articulated rigid body ) とは何か 連結剛体というのは、様々な種類のジョイントで接続された様々な形状からなる構造を言います。例えば、脚を構成する関節や、車のシャーシ、サスペンション、ホイールの要素を考えることができます。ODE はこうした要素を、摩擦モデルを含めて効率的にモデル化することができます。
ODE は現在、ジョイントとして、玉継手 ( ball - and - socket ) 、ヒンジ ( hinge ) 、スライダー、軸 ( fixed ) 、角度モーター ( angular motor ) 、ヒンジ 2 ( hinge - 2 : 車のジョイント ) などをサポートしています。また、様々な衝突要素
( 球や平面など ) や、いくつかの衝突空間もサポートしています。
ODE は主に C++ プログラミング言語で書かれていますが、アプリケーションとの統合用に、C
と C++ によるクリーンなインターフェースを公開しています。ODE がさらに魅力的なのは、GNU LGPL ( Lesser General Public License ) と BSD ライセンスの条件でライセンスされている点です。このライセンス条件に従う限り、商用製品にも
ODE のソースを無料で使うことができます。そのため ODE は、様々な商用ゲームやフライト・シミュレーター、バーチャル・リアリティーのシミュレーションなどで使われています。
リスト 1 のソース例は、火星の重力と、現在ある速度で上昇している球、という単純な世界を示しています。この世界に重力があることを考えると、この上昇速度は長くは持続しません。やがて球は頂点に達し、下降を始めます。初期化が完了すれば
( つまり、この世界で物体を作成し、それらの属性が設定されると)、この世界の物理学を、dWorldStep
を呼ぶことでシミュレートすることができます。何が起きているのかを理解するには、定期的に
dBodyGetPosition を呼び、その球の識別子を渡します。そうすると、その球の現在の位置を得ることができます。
リスト 1 . 重力のある世界での球を使った、ODE
による単純な実験
#include < iostream > # include < ode/ode.h > # define time_step ( float ) 0.1 int main ( ) { dWorldID myWorld_id ; dBodyID mySphere_id ; dMass sphereMass ; const dReal * pos ; float time =
0.0 ; /* Create a new world */ myWorld_id = dWorldCreate ( ) ; /* Create a sphere in the world */ mySphere_id = dBodyCreate ( myWorld_id ) ; /*
Set the world 's global gravity vector ( Mars ) -- x , y , z */ dWorldSetGravity ( myWorld_id , 0 , 0 , - 3.77 ) ; /*
Set the Sphere 's position in the world -- x , y , z */ dBodySetPosition ( mySphere_id , 0 , 0 , 100 ) ; /*
Set the Sphere 's mass ( density , radius ) */ dMassSetSphere ( &sphereMass , 1 , 2 ) ; dBodySetMass ( mySphere_id , &sphereMass ) ; /*
Give the sphere a small amount of upward ( z ) velocity */ dBodySetLinearVel ( mySphere_id , 0.0 , 0.0 , 5.0 ) ; /*
Run the simulation */ while ( time < 5.0 ) { /*
Simulate the world for the defined time - step */ dWorldStep ( myWorld_id , time_step ) ; /*
Get the current position of the sphere */ pos = dBodyGetPosition ( mySphere_id ) ; std:: cout << " position ( " << pos [ 0 ] << " , " << pos [ 1 ] << " , " << pos [ 2 ] << " )
" ; /* Next time step */ time += time_step ; } /* Destroy the objects */ dBodyDestroy ( mySphere_id ) ; dWorldDestroy ( myWorld_id ) ; return 0 ; }
つまり、移動ロボットや無人航空機を現実的な環境でシミュレートするための
( Linux や他のプラットフォームで動作する ) 産業グレードの物理計算エンジンが必要な場合には、ODE
は理想的な選択肢なのです。ODE を OpenGL API ( application program interface ) と組み合わせると、リアルな物理計算によってリアルなグラフィックスを作り出すことができます。
Simbad ロボット・シミュレータ ー
Simbad は、Java ® プログラミング言語で書かれた 3 次元ロボット・シミュレーターです ( つまり JVM ( Java virtual machine ) をサポートするプラットフォームであれば 、Linux、およびその他のプラットフォームで実行することができます)。しかしこのシミュレーターには、( Jython によって )
Python スクリプト言語のサポートも含まれているのです 。Simbad は自律ロボットのための人工知能 ( AI : artificial intelligence ) アルゴリズムを学ぶために作られたものであり、その表現力豊かな GUI ( graphical user interface ) は、ロボットの動作だけではなく、ロボットの視点から見た様子も視覚化することができます。
Simbad の興味深い点は、使い方が単純なこと、そして新しいロボット動作を素早く作成できることです。しかし、Simbad の開発は単純なだけではなく、実はロボット・シミュレーションのための拡張可能なフレームワークでもあるのです。
このシミュレーターでは、環境を作成したり調整したりすることができる上、様々なセンサーを使ってロボット・コントローラーを開発することができます。利用可能なセンサーとしては、視覚センサー
( カラー単眼カメラ ) 、レンジ・センサー ( ソナーと IR 検出器 ) 、また衝突検出用のバンパーがあります。
センサー用の API は簡潔で、直感的に使うことができます。リスト 2 に示す例は、ソナーの使い方と、衝突検出の仕方 ( 検出された物体 ) を示しています 。
リスト 2 . ソナーの使い方のシミュレーションを示すコード・スニペット
int sonar_id , total_sonars ; //
If at least one sensor has a hit if ( sonars.oneHasHit ( ) ) { //
Find out how many sonars are on the robot total_sonars = sonars.getNumSensors ( ) ; //
Iterate through each sonar for ( sonar_id = 0 ; sonar_id < total_sonars ; sonar_id++ ) { //
Does this one have a hit ? if ( sonars.hasHit(sonar_id ) ) { //
Emit the details ( angle , range ) System.out.
println (
" Sonar hit at angle " + sonars.getAngle( i ) + " at range " + sonars.getMeasurement( i ) ) ; } } }
Simbad で利用可能な他のセンサーも同じパターンに従っており、直感的な
API を構成しています 。
Simbad で特筆すべき点は、そのロボット・シミュレーションと視覚化のためのコンソールです。図

図 4 . Simbad のロボット・シミュレーターと視覚化コンソール
また Simbad には的確なドキュメンテーションやチュートリアルも用意されており、Java を使った場合でも Python を使った場合でも、すぐに使いこなすことができます。また、1 つのロボットのシミュレーションだけではなく、複数のロボットを同時にシミュレートすることもできます。全体として、
Simbad シミュレーターは、インテリジェントなロボット・アルゴリズムの概念テストには素晴らしい環境と言うことができます。
Simbad は GPL オープンソース・ライセンスの条件で使用することができます。
TeamBots
TeamBots は、移植可能なマルチエージェント・ロボット・シミュレーターであり、動的環境でのマルチエージェント・コントロール・システムを視覚的にシミュレーションすることができます。TeamBots が
Simbad など他のシミュレーターと比べてユニークな点は、コントロール・システムが移植できることです。つまり、コントロール・システムを開発してシミュレーター上で検証した後、そのコントロール・システムを、( Nomadic Technologies 社の Nomad 150 ロボットを使って ) 実際の移動ロボットでテストできるのです。
TeamBots の API には、コントロール・システム用の抽象化レイヤーが用意されています
( 図 5)。そのためコントロール・システムは、自分が合成環境
( TBSim ) でのシミュレーター上で実行しているのか、あるいは現実の環境でのロボット・プラットフォーム
( TBHard ) 上で実行しているのか、まったくわかりません。
図 5 . コントロール・システムに対する TeamBots API の抽象化レイヤ ー
TeamBots のシミュレーション環境は非常に柔軟であり、様々な物体や他のロボットを持つ合成環境を容易に構築することができます。壁や任意の物体、道路などの追加も容易であり、また同じ、あるいは異なるコントロール・システムを実行する他のロボットを追加することも容易にできます。これを利用して、( 1 つの例として ) 追跡者と獲物というシミュレーションを構築することができます。また、物体は静的である必要はありません。環境の中を動き回る物体や、ロボットに軽く押されると動く物体
( 例えばボールなど ) を使うこともできます 。
TeamBots を利用すると、様々なタイプのロボット・シミュレーターをモデル化することができます。例えば
1997 年にジョージア工科大学 ( Georgia Tech ) は、TeamBots を使って動的環境で獲物を探す 2 台の Nomad 150 ロボットをシミュレーションし 、AAAI ( American Association for Artificial Intelligence ) の移動ロボット・コンテストで優勝しました。このコンテストのゴールは、2
台のロボットが環境を検索し、青色の物体を拾って青色の入れ物に戻し、またオレンジ色の物体を拾ってオレンジ色の入れ物に戻す、というものです
( 図 6)。少し複雑にするために、オレンジ色のボールは動的であり、常に環境の中を動き回ります。
図 6 . 獲物探し動作を TeamBots でシミュレーションす る
図 6 では、移動ロボット 1 は青色の物体を持っており、青色の入れ物に物体を入れようと、その方向に移動しています。ロボット 0 は検索を行っています。
TeamBots は、ロボット・サッカー・プレーヤーの開発にも使うことができます。サッカーは国際的な人気スポーツなので、国際的な大学間、グループ間でのコンテスト用のプラットフォームとして理想的です。ロボット・サッカーのルールは、( 特に、2 足か Sony Aibo かなど、移動ロボットのプラットフォームを考慮すると ) 異なるかもしれませんが、ゲームの基本的なモデルは共通です。
図 7 で、ロボット 1 ( 黄色と白 ) は、ゴールに入れようとボールに向かって移動しています。ロボット

TeamBots にはサッカー用の Java API が用意されており、それを使うとプレーヤーの「頭脳」に集中することができます。エフェクター
API を使うと、ロボットの向きを変えたり、あるスピードで移動したり、ボールを蹴ったり、あるいは単純にボールを移動したりすることができます。センサーは上位レベルで作られており、ボールに向かうベクトルや、他のプレーヤー ( 自分のチームと相手チーム ) に向かうベクトル群、現在の方向、相手ゴールへのベクトルなどを判断するための

TeamBots の配布は、移動ロボットのプロトタイプ化にもシミュレーションにも、また
TBHard 環境と実際のロボットを使って移動ロボットを実行するためにも素晴らしい環境です。TeamBots はオープンソースであり ( ジョージア工科大学 の Tucker Balch と、カーネギー・メロン大学によって開発されました)、教育用や研究用として自由に使うことができます。このシミュレーターは
Java 言語で開発されており、完全なソースコードといくつかのサンプルが付属しているため、すぐに使いこなすことができます。
他のツールキッ ト
最もよく知られた移動ロボット・プラットフォームの 1 つであり、無数のシミュレーターが作られているものとして、Khepera があります。残念ながら Khepera は商用ソフトウェアへと進化し、オープンソースではなくなりました。しかし幸いなことに、KControl などは 、Khepera 用のコントロール・システム をLinux で開発するためのツールキットとして、まだ入手が可能です。
動作力学をサポートした興味深い 3 次元ロボット・シミュレーターとして入手可能なものが、Gazebo です 。Gazebo は標準のロボット・センサー ( 慣性測定ユニットや GPS レシーバー、単眼カメラなど )
をモデル化するだけではなく、現実の世界の剛体物理もロボット環境でモデル化することもできます。Gazebo はプラグイン・モデルをサポートしており、新しいロボット・センサー・モデルを環境の中に動的にロードすることができます。
最後に、便利なロボット・ナビゲーション・ツールキットとして、Carmen ( Carnegie Mellon Robot Navigation Toolkit ) があります 。Carmen は、障害回避や経路計画、マッピングなど、基本的なナビゲーション要素を提供するモジュラー・アーキテクチャーを実装しています。Carmen は 2 次元のシミュレーターを提供しているだけではなく、Linux を実行する物理的なロボット・プラットフォームも、いくつかサポートしています。
Linux ロボットを構築す る
Linux ベースのロボットの構築は、想像するほど難しくはありません。実際、一部の高校の理科の授業では、Linux と普通に入手可能なハードウェアとを Linux ベースのロボットのコアとして使っています。例えば、システム・コアとして古い
PC マザーボードを使い ( 古いラップトップならもっと良いですが ) 、USB ドライブ ( 消費電力 は CD - ROM やハードディスク、フロッピー・ドライブなどに比べ圧倒的に少ないです ) から Linux をブートすることができます。オンボードのパラレル・ポートは、手軽に様々なデバイスに変身させることができます
( 例えばディスクリートの入出力、ステッパー・モーターの駆動など)。シリアル・ポートは、GPS
座標の取り込み用に、あるいはA/D ( Analog to Digital ) や D/A ( Digital to Analog ) コンバーターなどの外部デバイス用に使うことができます。そして最後に、安価な
USB
Web カメラを購入すれば、ロボットに見る機能を与えることができます。
しかし、この領域での Linux の最大の魅力は、環境を単純化できることです。つまり

Hi folks .
The House Republican leadership scurried up to the Rules Committee hearing room for an EMERGENCY meeting they convened with 5 minutes notice .
Literally .
Wonder where the fire was ?
Well the topic Republicans chose for EMERGENCY consideration ... H.R. 5638 , the Republican Estate Tax Relief bill , designed to further reduce the estate - tax after the year 2011 .
Yes , estate - tax reduction , which would benefit less than 1 % of the population , was more important to this Republican Leadership than passing a minimum wage increase , extending the voting rights act , or having a real , substantive debate on the war in Iraq .
The rhetoric you will hear from the House Republicans who have a history of selling out to special interests is that repealing the estate tax is critical to small businesses and family farmers .
The reality could n't be more different .
The Democrats support tax relief for small businesses and farmers , while Republicans are slashing taxes for multi-millionaires , heaping more debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren .
Here is some information on Republican rhetoric v. reality on estate tax that you may find useful :
* The new Thomas estate tax bill ( H.R. 5638 ) will cost the American people $ 762 billion , in just the first 10 years ( 2012 to 2021 ) - nearly as much as full repeal .
[ CBPP , 6/20/06 ]
Permanent repeal of the estate tax would cost the American people nearly $ 1 trillion .
[ CBPP , 4/28/06 ] *
Less than 1 percent of estates will pay taxes in 2006 under this year 's exemption and only 7,500 nationwide will pay estate tax , under the $ 3.5 million exemption which will take effect in 2009 .
[ Center for American Progress , 5/17/06 ; Joint Committee on Taxation , Memo to the Ways and Means Staff , 10/18/04 ] * President Bush , Vice President Cheney , and the Cabinet stand to gain between $ 91 million and $ 344 million if the estate tax is permanently repealed .
The current CEOs of the five largest U.S. oil companies and Lee Raymond , the former CEO of Exxon Mobil , would likely receive a windfall of up to $ 211 million , with Raymond himself potentially receiving a tax break worth more than $ 160 million .
[ House Government Reform , 5/30/06 ] *
If the estate tax is repealed , 830 of the wealthiest estates in the country would split an estimated $ 14 billion in tax breaks each year , or $ 16 million per estate .
[ Center for American Progress , 5/17/06 ] *
Almost no working farmers ever pay the estate tax .
Under the $ 3.5 million exemption to take effect in 2009 , the number of family farms required to pay any taxes in 2000 would have been just 65 , along with 94 small businesses .
[ Congressional Budget Office , 7/05 ] * Democrats have supported providing immediate estate tax relief for 99.7 percent of estates , by raising the amount of the estates excluded from taxes to $ 6 million per couple and increasing this to $ 7 million by 2009 .
Not only did this provide relief for small business and family farmers , but it would not have heaped more debt onto our children and grandchildren -- costing less than $ 75 billion over 10 years .
[ H.R. 8 , Vote 101 , 4/13/05 , 194-238 ] *
One prominent Iowa economist actually searched for families who had lost their farms to estate taxes , but failed to find a single one .
When the New York Times sought to write a real - life feature about a farmer hit by the estate tax , the American Farm Bureau was unable to produce one farm that was lost because of estate taxes .
[ New York Times , 4/8/01 ]
This is one of those moments that cuts through the spin , and clearly demonstrates what today 's Republican Party is really about , and for whom they are really fighting ... and it is not the average American or their family .
They are fighting for the richest of the rich at the expense of everyone else .
They have no shame .

My guesses at what some of the top web stories will be in 2006 .
Naturally , the real top 10 stories of 2006 will probably be ones that are impossible to predict , but that does n’t mean it is n’t fun to try .
These predictions are in no particular order :
1. RSS will become two - way with the help of Simple Sharing Extensions from Microsoft .
This will open up a whole new set of features in our favorite web applications , as well as pave the ground for a plethora of new applications .
A related and equally large story is Microsoft becoming a big player in the newer web technologies with their Live platform .
2. Social news site Digg will expand into other content areas and media types and then will be acquired .
Digg is a useful site that is already profitable just from ads , and they ’re not taking full advantage of what their system and community can do .
Expanding into other content areas will grow their userbase and revenues , and they ’ll be acquired by a major news player or portal .
3 . Web 2.0 will be looked down upon as a buzzword , and it ’s usage will drop off dramatically .
It ’s already happening , but people will grow tired of the term Web 2.0 and the hype surrounding it .
4. Face - recognition photo application Riya will be acquired by a major player .
Even though the early rumors did n’t turn out to be true , Riya will execute well enough on their plan that they will be very compelling for one of the top web companies to pass up .
Another possible acquisition target would be the Robot Co - Op and their fun sites 43things.com , 43places.com , 43people.com , and AllConsuming .net .
5 . Some ecommerce shopping applications using the more recent advancements in social web technologies will be developed and will succeed .
There has n’t been a ton of traction in the ecommerce world for tagging , blogging , social networking , ajax , and other newer technologies .
These tools are going to break out of the “ geek ” world and start to hit other industries , and shopping is naturally one where there is money involved , so it will be attractive .
6. Google Analytics will again drop the hammer on the web analytics industry .
After quietly humming along for half of 2006 , Google will release new features that will put them on par with all the top web applications , and provide integration with other Google applications that make it an even more compelling offering .
7 . A forward thinking company will build technology to support transparency , efficiency , and relationships in the online advertising business .
The online advertising industry needs to break out of exclusive relationships , deceptive practices , and closed - walled worlds to provide a true advertising marketplace that uses technology to improve efficiency and confidence from all parties .
8. Microsoft will launch a contextual advertising network that will either be huge , or fail miserably .
Microsoft will use it ’s Adcenter advertisers to power a contextual competitor to Adsense and YPN .
It will either be a big success from capitalizing on what Adsense and YPN are doing wrong , or it will lack advertisers and publishers will not want to support Microsoft causing it to fail .
9 . Two to three new startups will be so cool and successful they will make the heroes of 2005 like Flickr and del.icio.us seem small and insignificant .
Flickr and del.icio.us had the buzz , but in monetary terms they were pretty small acquisitions by Yahoo , and neither is really a game - changing application .
2006 will have some game - changers .
10 .
The venture capital investments and acquisition bubble will heat up even more , then deflate in the 2nd half of 2006 after a number of companies fail ..
There has been a lot of venture capital activity in 2005 , and not all of these companies will succeed in their goals to make viable business models from their cool applications or get acquired .
There ’s only so much acquisition the big players can do , and so many of the applications do n’t look too close to a viable business model .
After a few of them go down in flames , the investments will cool off and things will be a bit more sane .
Happy 2006 !
Art imitates life , and life imitates art .
Fans of ABC 's Boston Legal may recall a recent episode where a man sued a company over a dating website that was purportedly ruining his reputation .
Now a similar complaint has been filed in the " real world . "
This time James Spader is nowhere to be found , however .
Todd J. Hollis , a Pennsylvania lawyer and " victim " of what he sees as malicious gossip , has sued both several users and the proprietor of dontdatehimgirl.com , which calls itself " a powerful online resource that lets women out the men who have cheated on or lied to them ! "
Founded by former Miami Herald columnist Tasha Joseph , the site provides women with the opportunity to create profiles of men and then populate those profiles with ( usually ) unflattering assessments of their once - suitors .
A quick perusal of the site shows common themes ranging from attacks on men's , um , fortitude to questions about their sexuality , intelligence , fidelity , and even their wives and families ( in some cases fictitious , in other cases not ) .
Hollis was similarly " outed " on the site , where three women made various claims against him , including implying that he carries sexually transmitted diseases , is a failed professional wrestler , and a womanizer .
While Hollis is named and identified , his accusers are free to remain anonymous and Hollis contends that not enough is done to verify their identify or the truth of their statements .
The site 's only attempt to solicit truthful information is a " checkbox " that users check before submitting information .
For Hollis , this is an unacceptable situation , and his suit charges that the proprietor " conspired with disingenuous people whose only agenda is to attack the character of those individuals who have been identified on her site . "
Things do n't look so good for Hollis ' case , however .
The 1996 Communications Decency
Act has again and again been interpreted by the courts as absolving both ISP and website operators for complete responsibility of the materials posted by third parties to the site , although this does not mean that the third parties themselves are necessarily protected .
According to Lida Rodriguez - Taseff , one of the lawyers representing Ms. Joseph , holding the site proprietor responsible for the comments of its users is akin to holding a coffee shop owner responsible for what their patrons say .
Hollis and his representation see the matter differently , arguing on their website that the service could be considered " an aid to the promotion of hate literature or slanderous material . "
Our cursory investigation of the site did turn up some questionable policies , including a prohibition against posting the names and pictures of women who are known to be cheating .
" www.DontDateHimGirl.com is for women to post the pictures and profiles of men who have allegedly cheated on them , NOT vice versa , " according to the site 's rules .
The website also forbids accused men from fully participating in the discussion , instead only allow them to e-mail rebuttals to the site 's administrators , which they say they will post for the men in question .
Whether or not this or any other facet of the site could land the website in hot water remains to be seen .
Those who post defamatory materials could be in trouble , however .
Website or not , knowingly posting false information with the intent to harm the reputation of another person can be illegal .
In this case of " He said / She said , " it may take a real judge to settle matters .
I think this may have been mentioned before on LTU , but I thought I would post the link again as I found this series of lectures by JÃ¼rgen Giesl great for learning Haskell .
The lectures are 2005 - SS - FP.V01 through 2005 - SS - FP.V26 .
Videos 2005 - SS - FP.U01 through 2005 - SS - FP.U11 are exercise answer sessions , so you probably do n't want those .

The New Road to Serfdom : A Negative - Equity Mortgage ( May 9 , 2006 )
The current issue of Harper 's features a lead article entitled " An Illustrated Guide to the Coming Real Estate Collapse " by Michael Hudson .
Here is a precis of the piece .
Thanks to Marinite , proprietor of the Marin Real Estate Bubble blog , I read a lengthy 2003 interview of economist Michael Hudson on Alexander Cockburn 's always - provocative website Counterpunch : The Coming Financial Reality .
Hudson is a big - picture guy with a non-standard view of our economic system and the housing bubble .
Hudson identifies several key points in all great speculative bubbles : a government which fosters the conditions for a bubble , and a speculative mindset which eschews actual investment for " making money with money . "
Referring to the classic South Seas Stock Bubble , he says :
Every stock market bubble in history , starting with the South Sea and Mississippi bubbles in the 1710s in Britain and France , has been sponsored by government .
The driving force has been the government 's attempt to cope with debt obligations beyond its foreseeable ability to pay .
Creating a bubble has been a way to solve their public debt problem -- and to pay off political insiders at the same time , thereby killing two birds with one stone .
Modern governments are not politically able to simply default on their debts -- at least , not debts owed to their own bondholders in their own currency .
The problem has to be solved through " the marketplace . "
Stocks in the South Sea and Mississippi Companies were issued in tranches , permitting people to buy on margin with only a small proportion as down payment , so that they could quickly double their small initial payment as the stocks were engineered upward in price .
It seemed that money could be made off money itself .
This is a basic illusion that is necessary for bubbles to take off .
Saving , stock and bond speculation and real estate speculation do not by themselves lead to new investment .
In fact , the higher speculative and financial returns are , the less incentive there is to actually tie down money in building new factories and expanding business .
Hudson makes many other fascinating points in the interview , but for now , let 's focus on the connection to the housing bubble .
What can be gleaned from his analysis ?
The Federal Reserve engineered the housing bubble by lowering interest rates to an inflation - adjusted rate of zero .
With legitmate investments earning low returns compared to housing , the mindset of money for nothing , i.e. a " free lunch , " became embedded in the real estate market .
In the euphoria of profiting from high leverage , i.e. putting no or low money down and leveraging the value of real estate with an interest - only mortgage , people have forgotten that the borrowed money has to be paid back .
As housing values decline , they fall below the amount due on mortgages -- negative equity , in which the hapless homeowner owes more than his house is worth .
Here is a list of the article 's 20 illustrated points :
1 . Mortgages account for most of the net growth in debt since 2000 2 . A $ 1,000 monthly payment can carry different levels of debt 3 .
Interest rates have been falling since 1981 4 .
Corporations hide their real estate profits behind depreciation 5 .
The tax burden has shifted from property to labor and consumption 6 .
Real estate prices have far outpaced national income 7 .
Capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ever 8 .
Housing prices have far outpaced consumer prices , even as monthly payments remain affordable 9 .
Mortgage debt is rising as a proportion of GDP 10 .
The production / consumption economy 11 .
The Keynesian economy 12 .
The FIRE economy 13 .
The miracle of compound interest 14 .
The rentier economy 15 .
Rich people are getting a bigger share of overall economic rent 16 .
The miracle of compound interest will inevitably confront the S - curve of reality 17 .
In Japan , real estate prices fell as quickly as they rose 18 .
Interest rates are on the rise 19 .
The annual sale of existing homes has more than doubled since 1989 20 .
Negative equity traps debtors
This is the conclusion to the great housing bubble Hudson foresees : millions of indebted households paying interest on mortgages which are greater than the value of their homes .
The interest will be collected by a new " rentier " class of mortgage holders who are not even capitalists , in the sense that they are not creating value or wealth with their capital and knowledge , but living off the " new serfs " who will struggle for decades to pay off their massive mortgages .
Bleak , it 's true -- especially if it turns out to be true .

So , you 're experienced ?
Before you advertise this in your resume , be sure you can prove it .
Often , when job seekers try to sell themselves to potential employers , they load their resumes with vague claims that are transparent to hiring managers , according to Scott Bennett , author of " The Elements of Resume Style " ( AMACOM ) .
By contrast , the most successful job seekers avoid these vague phrases on their resumes in favor of accomplishments .
Instead of making empty claims to demonstrate your work ethic , use brief , specific examples to demonstrate your skills .
In other words , show , do n't tell .
Bennett offers these examples : Instead of ...
" Experience working in fast - paced environment " Try ... " Registered 120 + third - shift emergency patients per night " Instead of ...
" Excellent written communication skills " Try ...
" Wrote jargon - free User Guide for 11,000 users " Instead of ...
" Team player with cross- functional awareness " Try ...
" Collaborated with clients , A/R and Sales to increase speed of receivables and prevent interruption of service to clients . "
Instead of ...
" Demonstrated success in analyzing client needs " Try ...
" Created and implemented comprehensive needs assessment mechanism to help forecast demand for services and staffing . "
The worst offenders
It 's good to be hard - working and ambitious , right ?
The hiring manager wo n't be convinced if you can't provide solid examples to back up your claims .
Bennett suggests being extra-careful before putting these nice - sounding but empty words in your resume .

Blowing in the Wind
The generals who told President Bush before the war that Donald Rumsfeld ’s shock - and - awe fantasy would not work were not enough to persuade him to change his strategy in Iraq .
The rise of the insurgency did not do the trick .
Nor did month after month of mounting military and civilian casualties on all sides , the emergence of a near civil war , the collapse of reconstruction efforts or the seeming inability of either Iraqi or American forces to secure contested parts of Iraq , including Baghdad , for any significant period .
So what finally , after all this time , caused Mr. Bush to very publicly consult with his generals to consider a change in tactics in Iraq ?
The president , who says he never reads political polls , is worried that his party could lose some of its iron grip on power in the Congressional elections next month .
Many of us over the last few years have been speculating over Bush and the neocon ’s sick obsession with Iraq .
While Righty pundits deny it now , we all have plenty of evidence directly from the horses mouth that they tied Iraq in various ways to September 11 , 2001 .
BushCo and just about every segment of the media called Iraq the front in the “ war on terror ” – a strategic impossibility , but made for the kind of nice mindless sound bite that has feed the conservative rise to power , like so many lame soulless cliches .
It has to fit on a bumper sticker stupid .
Though Bush and his Cult of followers may still kneel and face K - Street as they cross their little hearts and hope to die that the “ fly - paper ” will still work , we all know that even a fly would n’t buy into that crack - pot scheme to rid the world of terrorism – it was just a fall back rationale anyway – British officials believed the U.S. favored military force a year before the war , documents show .
Just a month ago Bush has once again made the rounds making the claim that he will “ stay the course ” and that there will be troops in Iraq as long as he is president .
Now a few weeks before elections Bush is consulting his generals .
Which is a lot like pulling out your tonsils with a pair of pliers and then calling your doctor ; given the Republican record of dismal failure wrapped in happy talk this development is n’t shocking to most people .
Americans with even a modicum of common sense have been looking at the actions of Bush and his supporters with a cock - eyed disbelief for at least two years now .
We ’re all parents now and we ’re hoping the that at the very least the kids wo n’t burn down the house .
But the way this sudden change of heart has come about , after months in which Mr. Bush has brushed off all criticism of his policies as either misguided , politically motivated or downright disloyal to America , is maddening .
For far too long , the White House has looked upon the war as a tactical puzzle for campaign strategists .
The early notion of combining Iraq and the war on terror as an argument for re-electing Republicans robbed the nation of any serious chance for a bipartisan discussion of these life - and - death issues .
More recently , the administration seems to have been working under the assumption that its only obligations were to hang on , talk tough and pass the problem on to the next president .
That pretty much wraps up the current appearance of bold new plans .
The war has simply been part of an election strategy .
Americans are dying because Republicans are literary willing to have America ’s children and spouses die to hang on to power .
They got that power based on lies about the economy , ethnocentrism , institutionalized elitism , perverse religious dogma , and various brands of paranoia all in a nice half baked shell of extreme nationalism .
Its all worked before , power is a high and like cocaine its very addicting .
So addicting that if the lies , the greed , the half baked ideas worked why not shoot up a little more , up the ante .
They used a completely unnecessary and counter productive war to feed their habit , the habit of winning at all costs .
American lives and taxpayers money have become mere political currency .
The way the Bush team is stage - managing the president ’s supposed change of heart about “ staying the course ” is unfair to the Americans who have taken him at his word that real progress is being made in Iraq — a dwindling but still significant number of people , some of whom have sons and daughters serving in the conflict .
It is a disservice to the troops , who were never sent to Iraq in sufficient numbers to protect themselves or the Iraqi people .
And it is a disservice to all Americans , who have waited so long for Mr. Bush to act that all that is left are a series of unpleasant choices .
And it is happening in the midst of a particularly ugly , and especially vacuous , election season .
There is probably no worse time to begin a serious discussion about Iraq policy than two weeks before a close , bitter election .
But now that the discussion has begun , it must continue , as honestly and openly as possible .
It is time for the American people to confront all the things that the president never had the guts to tell them about for three and a half years .
These miscreants will steer a few degrees further one way or the other , but to be “ as honestly and openly as possible ” would require a complete one - eighty .
That would mean Bush and Republicans would have to exercise some humility and good judgement , something that their record proves they are utterly incapable of doing .
They ’ll continue to wag the electorate until the electorate stands up and and says no more .
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky ?
Yes , ‘n ’ how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry ?
Yes , ‘n ’ how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died ?
The answer , my friend , is blowin ’ in the wind ,
The answer is blowin’ in the wind .

The Virgin boss said he would commit all profits from his travel firms , such as airline Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Trains , over the next 10 years .
" We must rapidly wean ourselves off our dependence on coal and fossil fuels , " Sir Richard said .
The funds will be invested in schemes to develop new renewable energy technologies , through an investment unit called Virgin Fuels .
One of the UK's best known entrepreneurs , Sir Richard made the announcement in New York on the second day of the Clinton Global Initiative , an annual conference hosted by former US President Bill Clinton .
Sir Richard , 56 , said that transport and energy companies " must be at the forefront of developing environmentally friendly business strategies " .
Planes and trains
Virgin Trains operates two UK rail franchises
Sir Richard recently launched a new Virgin Fuels business , which will invest up to $ 400 m in green energy projects .
It has already announced its backing for a California firm , Cilion which plans to make bio ethanol from corn .
Friends of the Earth broadly welcomed Sir Richard 's announcement , but the environmental pressure group warned that the continued fast growth in air travel could not be maintained " without causing climatic disaster " .
Worth an estimated £ 3bn , Sir Richard started his career in the record industry before moving into everything from mobile phones to credit cards .
He established his main airline Virgin Atlantic in 1984 , starting services between London and New York .
He also owns two low - cost airlines , Virgin Express in Europe and Virgin Blue in Australia .
His Virgin Group owns a 51 % stake in UK train company Virgin Trains .
This firm operates the UK's West Coast Main Line franchise between London and the west of Scotland , and the cross country franchise between the south west of England and Scotland .
Major donations
Mr Branson 's investment pledge comes after US billionaire investor Warren Buffett announced in June that he was donating $ 37bn to charity .

Mr Buffett gave the money to the charitable foundation run by Microsoft founder Bill Gates , which works to reduce global poverty and improve health and access to education .
Mr Gates himself said in July that the charity , the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , was pledging $ 287 m in a bid to speed - up the development of a vaccine for the HIV / Aids virus .
Sir Richard has previously given money to educational charities in Africa .
Ever wonder why office - supply stores will offer a ream of paper or $ 3 for empty inkjet printer cartridges ?
It turns out there is a booming trade in empty cartridges , which are much sought after by the original manufacturers , such as Hewlett - Packard Co. and Lexmark International Inc. , and by companies that refill old cartridges for resale .
`` There 's a world market for empties , " said Jim Forrest , an analyst at Lyra Research , which tracks the printing industry .
`` Prices vary day to day , just like for any other commodity . "
Cartridges that fit popular printer models usually sell for about $ 7 , Forrest said .
This cost is a key consideration for companies that refill and resell the ink tanks , such as Cartridge World .
Forest said refillers figure on spending $ 7 for the container and $ 1 for the ink , which pushes their cost close to $ 10 after including labor and packaging .
That does n't leave much margin for profit , considering that refillers try to keep their prices well below the price of the brand - name cartridges , he said .
Even damaged cartridges are worth something .
Ray Kendall , a Cartridge World franchisee in Grapevine , Texas , has a cardboard box in the back of his shop labeled ``bad cartridges . "
Some have fouled print heads , and others are missing the tiny plastic tab found on the underside of ink cartridges .
But they do n't get thrown out .
``I sell `em to the remanufacturers for about 20 cents each , " Kendall said .

Google 's unknown artist has huge following By David E. Williams
CNN
Dennis Hwang has been drawing Google 's logos since 2000 .
YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Google Inc. Dennis Hwang Arts , Culture and Entertainment Art Museums or or Create Your Own ( CNN ) -- Dennis
Hwang may be the most famous unknown artist in the world -- his work does n't hang in galleries or museums , but it 's been viewed hundreds of millions of times .
The 28 - year - old webmaster designs the whimsical logos that decorate Google.com 's otherwise Spartan Web site on special occasions .
" It 's always a fun kind of challenge to incorporate the logo into the design .
Over the years , just because I kind of push myself to use different types of design if I can , " Hwang said .
( Have a look at Hwangs 's Google logos )
He has been manipulating the six letters in the Google name into shamrocks , fireworks , hearts and goblins since shortly after he got an internship there in 2000 .
Company founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin found out that he was an art major in college .
" They said ' Hey Dennis , why do n't you give this a shot , ' and I 've been doing it ever since , " he said .
Now he 's in charge of all Google 's webmasters , and designing the logos is only about 20 percent of his job -- but that does n't mean it 's not a lot of work .
Hwang said he had to do a string of all - nighters after he had what he called his " brilliant " idea to do individual designs for each of the 32 teams in this year 's World Cup soccer tournament .
The logos link to Google search results about the topic , which can drive a lot of traffic to unsuspecting sites .
" Sometimes we unfortunately take some sites down , so we have to cycle through different search queries midday , " he said .
" But , yeah , it 's kind of the fun aspect of it that users can do more research about a topic or find out more about it on their own if they 're not as familiar about what we 're recognizing . "
John Malyon , president of the online art guide Artcyclopedia.com , said his site got a huge surge in traffic in April when Google featured Spanish surrealist painter Joan Miro .
He said he got tens of thousands of extra clicks .
" It did n't cause any server problems or anything .
It just took me a while to track down what was happening , " Malyon said .
" You sort of come in , you turn on your server and look at your stats and they 're wildly inflated , so you then have to do some detective work . "
Malyon said most of the traffic appeared to be " curiosity clicks " -- people who were more interested in the logo than in the artist 's work .
He said the surge probably did n't help his business much , but he appreciated the interest .
" I 'm quite happy , and every webmaster in the world is happy to have as many people as possible see their babies , but it's not the most targeted traffic in the world , " he said .
Hwang said users e-mail from all over the world to praise the designs or petition for new ones .
Hwang said they did a logo for the Persian New Year after a huge online campaign and that the National Library Day design was very popular .
" That one was a huge hit among librarians across the whole country , " he said .
They even sent me library - related cool toys and hats things like that .
One was even a librarian action figure with ' shushing action ' so that was really funny . "
He said he meets a few times a year with a small group of Google staffers to decide which events to cover .
" We talk about interesting holidays that are coming up , or various international holidays or any current events or news events that we think are cool and geeky or ' Google - y ' in some sense and then we just sort of give it a go , " he said .
Hwang said his favorite was the birthday series honoring Michelangelo , Picasso , Van Gogh and other famous artists .
" Having been a student of art history for a long time those are a little bit more personal , " Hwang said .
" Of course , trying to mimic the style of a master is always difficult and humbling , so it does take a lot more time to do those , but it 's also a lot more fun . "
But , like any proud parent , he would not say which one was his favorite .
" If you had me picking just one , I do n't think I could .
They 're just all kind of special in their own little way . "

U.S. - Backed Israeli Policies Pursuing “ End of Palestine ”
Noam Chomsky interviewed by Amy Goodman & Juan Gonzalez
Democracy Now , July 14 , 2006
AMY GOODMAN : We ’re joined on the phone right now by Noam Chomsky , professor of linguistics and philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , author of dozens of books .
His latest is Failed States : The Abuse of Power and the Assault on Democracy .
In May , he traveled to Beirut , where he met , among others , Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah .
He joins us on the phone from Masachusetts .
We welcome you to Democracy Now !
NOAM CHOMSKY : Hi , Amy .
AMY GOODMAN : It ’s good to have you with us .
Well , can you talk about what is happening now , both in Lebanon and Gaza ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Well , of course , I have no inside information , other than what ’s available to you and listeners .
What ’s happening in Gaza , to start with that — well , basically the current stage of what ’s going on — there ’s a lot more — begins with the Hamas election , back the end of January .
Israel and the United States at once announced that they were going to punish the people of Palestine for voting the wrong way in a free election .
And the punishment has been severe .
At the same time , it ’s partly in Gaza , and sort of hidden in a way , but even more extreme in the West Bank , where Olmert announced his annexation program , what ’s euphemistically called “ convergence ” and described here often as a “ withdrawal , ” but in fact it ’s a formalization of the program of annexing the valuable lands , most of the resources , including water , of the West Bank and cantonizing the rest and imprisoning it , since he also announced that Israel would take over the Jordan Valley .
Well , that proceeds without extreme violence or nothing much said about it .
Gaza , itself , the latest phase , began on June 24 .
It was when Israel abducted two Gaza civilians , a doctor and his brother .
We do n’t know their names .
You do n’t know the names of victims .
They were taken to Israel , presumably , and nobody knows their fate .
The next day , something happened , which we do know about , a lot .
Militants in Gaza , probably Islamic Jihad , abducted an Israeli soldier across the border .
That ’s Corporal Gilad Shalit .
And that ’s well known ; first abduction is not .
Then followed the escalation of Israeli attacks on Gaza , which I do n’t have to repeat .
It ’s reported on adequately .
The next stage was Hezbollah ’s abduction of two Israeli soldiers , they say on the border .
Their official reason for this is that they are aiming for prisoner release .
There are a few , nobody knows how many .
Officially , there are three Lebanese prisoners in Israel .
There ’s allegedly a couple hundred people missing .
Who knows where they are ?
But the real reason , I think it ’s generally agreed by analysts , is that — I ’ll read from the Financial Times , which happens to be right in front of me .
“ The timing and scale of its attack suggest it was partly intended to reduce the pressure on Palestinians by forcing Israel to fight on two fronts simultaneously . ”
David Hearst , who knows this area well , describes it , I think this morning , as a display of solidarity with suffering people , the clinching impulse .
It ’s a very — mind you — very irresponsible act .
It subjects Lebanese to possible — certainly to plenty of terror and possible extreme disaster .
Whether it can achieve any result , either in the secondary question of freeing prisoners or the primary question of some form of solidarity with the people of Gaza , I hope so , but I would n’t rank the probabilities very high .
JUAN GONZALEZ : Noam Chomsky , in the commercial press here the last day , a lot of the focus has been pointing toward Iran and Syria as basically the ones engineering much of what ’s going on now in terms of the upsurge of fighting in Lebanon .
Your thoughts on these analyses that seem to sort of downplay the actual resistance movement going on there and trying to reduce this once again to pointing toward Iran ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : Well , the fact is that we have no information about that , and I doubt very much that the people who are writing it have any information .
And frankly , I doubt that U.S. intelligence has any information .
It ’s certainly plausible .
I mean , there ’s no doubt that there are connections , probably strong connections , between Hezbollah and Syria and Iran , but whether those connections were instrumental in motivating these latest actions , I do n’t think we have the slightest idea .
You can guess anything you ’d like .
It ’s a possibility .
In fact , even a probability .
But on the other hand , there ’s every reason to believe that Hezbollah has its own motivations , maybe the ones that Hearst and the Financial Times and others are pointing to .
That seems plausible , too .
Much more plausible , in fact .
AMY GOODMAN : There was even some reports yesterday that said that Hezbollah might try to send the Israeli soldiers that it had captured to Iran .
JUAN GONZALEZ : Well , Israel actually claims that it has concrete evidence that that ’s what was going to happen .
That ’s why it ’s attempting to blockade both the sea and bomb the airport .
NOAM CHOMSKY : They are claiming that .
That ’s true .
But I repeat , we do n’t have any evidence .
Claims by a state that ’s carrying out the military attacks do n’t really amount to very much , in terms of credibility .
If they have evidence , it would be interesting to see it .
And in fact , it might happen .
Even if it does happen , it wo n’t prove much .
If Hezbollah , wherever they have the prisoners , the soldiers , if they decide that they ca n’t keep them in Lebanon because of the scale of Israeli attacks , they might send them somewhere else .
I ’m skeptical that Syria or Iran would accept them at this point , or even if they can get them there , but they might want to .
AMY GOODMAN : Noam Chomsky , we have to break .
When we come back , we ’ll ask you about the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations comments about Lebanon .
We ’ll also be joined by Mouin Rabbani , speaking to us from Jerusalem , Middle East analyst with the International Crisis Group .
Then Ron Suskind joins us , author of The One Percent Doctrine : Deep Inside America ’s Pursuit of its Enemies Since 9/11 .
Stay with us .
AMY GOODMAN : Our guest on the phone is Noam Chomsky , professor of linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
His latest book is Failed States : The Abuse of Power and the Assault on Democracy .
I wanted to ask you about the comment of the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations .
He defended Israel ’s actions as a justified response .
This is Dan Gillerman .
DAN GILLERMAN : As we sit here during these very difficult days , I urge you and I urge my colleagues to ask yourselves this question :
What would do you if your countries found themselves under such attacks , if your neighbors infiltrated your borders to kidnap your people , and if hundreds of rockets were launched at your towns and villages ?
Would you just sit back and take it , or would you do exactly what Israel is doing at this very minute ?
AMY GOODMAN : That was Dan Gillerman , the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations .
Noam Chomsky , your response ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : He was referring to Lebanon , rather than Gaza .
AMY GOODMAN : He was .
NOAM CHOMSKY : Yeah .
Well , he ’s correct that hundreds of rockets have been fired , and naturally that has to be stopped .
But he did n’t mention , or maybe at least in this comment , that the rockets were fired after the heavy Israeli attacks against Lebanon , which killed — well , latest reports , maybe 60 or so people and destroyed a lot of infrastructure .
As always , things have precedence , and you have to decide which was the inciting event .
In my view , the inciting event in the present case , events , are those that I mentioned — the constant intense repression ; plenty of abductions ; plenty of atrocities in Gaza ; the steady takeover of the West Bank , which , in effect , if it continues , is just the murder of a nation , the end of Palestine ; the abduction on June 24 of the two Gaza civilians ; and then the reaction to the abduction of Corporal Shalit .
And there ’s a difference , incidentally , between abduction of civilians and abduction of soldiers .
Even international humanitarian law makes that distinction .
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about what that distinction is ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : If there ’s a conflict going on , aside physical war , not in a military conflict going on , abduction — if soldiers are captured , they are to be treated humanely .
But it is not a crime at the level of capture of civilians and bringing them across the border into your own country .
That ’s a serious crime .
And that ’s the one that ’s not reported .
And , in fact , remember that — I mean , I do n’t have to tell you that there are constant attacks going on in Gaza , which is basically a prison , huge prison , under constant attack all the time : economic strangulation , military attack , assassinations , and so on .
In comparison with that , abduction of a soldier , whatever one thinks about it , does n’t rank high in the scale of atrocities .
JUAN GONZALEZ : We ’re also joined on the line by Mouin Rabbani , a senior Middle East analyst with the International Crisis Group and a contributing editor of Middle East Report .
He joins us on the line from Jerusalem .
Welcome to Democracy Now !
MOUIN RABBANI : Hi .
JUAN GONZALEZ : Could you tell us your perspective on this latest escalation of the conflict there and the possibility that Israel is going to be mired once again in war in Lebanon ?
MOUIN RABBANI : Well , it ’s difficult to say .
I could n’t hear Professor Chomsky ’s comments .
I could just make out every sixth word .
But I think that Israel is now basically , if you will , trying to rewrite the rules of the game and set new terms for its adversaries , basically saying , you know , that no attacks of any sort on Israeli forces or otherwise will be permitted , and any such attack will invite a severe response that basically puts the entire civilian infrastructure of the entire country or territory from which that attack emanates at risk .
Judging by what we ’ve seen so far , it more or less enjoys tacit to explicit international sanction .
And I think the possibilities that this conflict could further expand into a regional one , perhaps involving Syria , is at this point quite real .
AMY GOODMAN : And can you talk about the UN resolution , a vote in the draft resolution , 10 - to - 1 , on Gaza with the U.S. voting no and for countries abstaining — Britain , Denmark , Peru and Slovakia ?
MOUIN RABBANI : Well , I think it would have been news if that resolution had actually passed .
I think , you know , for the last decade , if not for much longer , it ’s basically become a reality in the United Nations that it ’s an organization incapable of discharging any of its duties or responsibilities towards maintaining or restoring peace and security in the Middle East , primarily because of the U.S. power of veto on the Security Council .
And I think we ’ve now reached the point where even a rhetorical condemnation of Israeli action , such as we ’ve seen in Gaza over the past several weeks , even a rhetorical condemnation without practical consequence has become largely unthinkable , again , primarily because of the U.S. veto within the Security Council .
AMY GOODMAN : Mouin , what do you think is going to happen right now , both in Gaza and in Lebanon ?
MOUIN RABBANI : Well , I think it ’s probably going to get significantly worse .
I mean , in Lebanon , it seems to be a case where Hezbollah has a more restricted agenda of compelling Israel to conduct prisoner exchange , whereas Israel has a broader agenda of seeking to compel the disarmament of Hezbollah or at least to push it back several dozen kilometers from the Israeli - Lebanese border .
You know , the Israeli and Hezbollah perspectives on this are entirely incompatible , and that means that this conflict is probably going to continue escalating , until some kind of mediation begins .
In Gaza , it ’s somewhat different .
I think there Hamas has a broader agenda , of which effecting a prisoner exchange with Israel is only one , and I would argue , even a secondary part .
I think there Hamas ’s main objective is to compel Israel to accept a mutual cessation of hostilities , Israeli - Palestinian , and I think , even more important , of ensuring their right to govern .
And I think , at least as far as the Israeli - Palestinian part of this is concerned , Hamas ’s main objective has been to send a very clear message , not only to Israel , but to all its adversaries , whether Israeli , Palestinian or foreign , to remind the world that political integration and democratic politics for them are an experiment , that they have alternatives , and if they ’re not allowed to exercise their democratic mandate , that they will not hesitate , if necessary , to exercise those alternatives .
AMY GOODMAN : Finally , Noam Chomsky , right now industrial world leaders gathered in St. Petersburg for the G8 meeting .
What role does the U.S. have in this ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : In the G8 meeting ?
AMY GOODMAN : No .
What role — they ’re just gathered together — in this , certainly the issue of Lebanon , Gaza , the Middle East is going to dominate that discussion .
But how significant is the U.S. in this ?
NOAM CHOMSKY : I think it will probably be very much like the UN resolution that you mentioned , which is — I ’m sorry , I could n’t hear what Mouin Rabbani was saying .
But the UN resolution was — the veto of the UN resolution is standard .
That goes back decades .
The U.S. has virtually alone been blocking the possibility of diplomatic settlement , censure of Israeli crimes and atrocities .
When Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 , the UN vetoed several resolutions right away , calling for an end to the fighting and so on , and that was a hideous invasion .
And this continues through every administration .
So I presume it will continue at the G8 meetings .
The United States regards Israel as virtually a militarized offshoot , and it protects it from criticism or actions and supports passively and , in fact , overtly supports its expansion , its attacks on Palestinians , its progressive takeover of what remains of Palestinian territory , and its acts to , well , actually realize a comment that Moshe Dayan made back in the early ’ 70s when he was responsible for the Occupied Territories .
He said to his cabinet colleagues that we should tell the Palestinians that we have no solution for you , that you will live like dogs , and whoever will leave will leave , and we ’ll see where that leads .
That ’s basically the policy .
And I presume the U.S. will continue to advance that policy in one or another fashion .
AMY GOODMAN : Noam Chomsky , I want to thank you for being with us .
His latest book is Failed States : The Abuse of Power and the Assault on Democracy .
And Mouin Rabbani , senior Middle East analyst with the International Crisis Group , joining us from Jerusalem .
Thank you both .
Yes , we 've seen the projection clock , the pong clock and the venerable atomic clock , but leave it to our pals at Ambient Devices to come up with a way to combine a chronometer with a glanceable display , not unlike their previous orb and analog dial panel .
Assuming that you keep your schedule in Google Calendar ( and really , who does n't these days ? ) , you can link it up the Ambient Clock ( via Ambient 's " nationwide wireless network " ) to find out what your schedule is .
Meaning , a quick glance will help determine when you have scheduled events ( the block rectangles on the clock ) and the clock itself will change color if you have an upcoming appointment .
As of right now the Ambient Clock is n't actually in production , although there is an online beta so you can get a feel for the features and help the engineers decide certain aspects of the build .
Still , we 're not convinced that this will revolutionize time management , but if you have a penchant for post - modern analog clocks , then maybe you 'll appreciate it .
What do you do ?
Seriously , on your business card there is a title .
Say it out loud .
“ Senior Manager of Engineering ”
“ Industrial Data Analyst ”
“ Human Factors Specialist ”
Is that what you actually do ?
Try this : think about the last four hours of your job and give yourself a title .
Mine would be “ Sr. Meeting Wrangler ” or perhaps “ Guy Who Listens ” .
Last week it would ’ve been “ White Board Operator ” .
When you graduated from college , when you got your first job in your chosen profession , did you think you ’d be doing this ?
No .
Whatever you thought you ’d be doing when you looked forward to being an “ Associate Software Engineer ” is not what you ended up doing .
You ’d think this title dissonance issue would be a problem .
You ’d think that the fact that what you thought you ’d be doing has nothing to do with what you do would turn into angst , but it turns out , as long as everyone is clear what your secret title it is … we ’re cool .
This is a piece on micromanagement .
In hell , there are two rooms with the Rands name on them .
Room number one is a room where you are constantly nauseated .
If you want to torture me , if you want to make my life miserable , get me sick to my stomach .
I will do anything , including shoving my fingers down my throat , in order to get out of a nauseated state .
I would rather you shove bamboo shoots under my fingernails than spend a night in bed about to throw up .
The other room contains a single person .
This is the one guy who , in my fifteen years of management , attempted to micromanage me .
The walls of this room are white boards covered with to do lists and at the top of each list is a poorly drawn picture of me … crying .
In my mind , the use of micromanagement techniques has exactly one goal .
You want the target of your micromanagement to leave the building screaming .
There is no good micromanagement approach because WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND would want to spent their day managing the minutiae of SOMEONE ELSE ’S job .
For those of you who have n’t been micromanaged , here ’s a short list of questions to figure out where your manager stands on the management spectrum :
When your boss asks you to do something , what level of detail does he use to describe his request ?
Does your boss ask you questions regarding the task ?
Once you ’ve begun the task , how often does your boss follow up ?
Do you feel the urge to check in with your boss whenever you are faced with a decision ?
What is your boss ’s reaction when you deviate from his prescribed means of making progress ?
Micromanagers are managers who describe their requests in great detail , leaving little room for original thought .
They devise endless checkpoints to determine that their plan is being followed which scares the individuals involved into vetting all decisions with their manager .
When deviations from the plan do occur , the micromanager fucking loses it .
Can you imagine working in such a soulless environment ?
Can you see why this is my personal hell ?
It ’s not just the utter lack of respect for co-workers ; it ’s the idea that the manager ’s vision is infallible .
My job as a manager is to move the group forward , but they choose the direction because THEY ARE DOING THE WORK .
I ’m calming down now .
The common assessment of why someone is being micromanaged is , “ Well , my manager does n’t trust me ” .
That ’s kind ’a sort ’a right , but the phrase is missing a key element .
What is it that your manager does n’t trust you to do ?
He does n’t trust you to do your job because he does n’t actually know what your secret title is .
Chances are , he knows your official title , but the fundamental problem with micromanagers is that they do n’t grok secret titles .
I inherited my micromanager via a re-org .
My VP was leaving , and my development team was dispersed across the organization .
I was dropped into this core technology group working on integration with an early version of Java .
I was working for a first - time Director ( uh oh ) who had ten direct reports ( crap ) and the word in the hallway was that his project was shaky ( screwed ) .
Our first 1 - on - 1 was scheduled at 9 am on the first day I worked in the new group .
He began with , “ Rands , before you meet the team , I ’d like to successfully fix 50 bugs in the code base and I ’d like to be the code reviewer for each of your fixes .
After that , let ’s see about you and writing specifications . ”
This was ten years ago , but what do you think my secret title was ?
Probably “ Organic People Manager ” or maybe “ Osmosis Hallway Guy ” .
Anyone who regularly reads my stuff knows that my approach involves stumbling around the hallway asking people what the hell is going on .
Yes , the new Director did n’t trust me , but , more importantly , he did n’t trust me to be what I ’m actually good at , which is a “ Osmosis Hallway Guy ” .
A micromanager does not trust .
That is correct , but , more importantly , they do not know .
They do not have an impression … a profile of the person they are managing , so they ignore the person and focus on the tasks .
This creates a terrific negative feedback loop where an employee becomes demoralized because they believe the manager does n’t trust them , so they stop thinking and start waiting for the dim - witted , micromanaged cues from this emotionally inept manager who is waiting for … what ?
Hard work ?
Inspiration ?
What exactly did they do to create an environment of inspiration ?
The only inspired work that ’s going on is the employee ’s desperate search for a job where they ’re going to be treated like a human being .
Yes , this pisses me off .
Even hypothetically .
Fortunately for my situation , the company was crumbling around me , so the Director had his hands full poorly managing a series of layoffs .
I escaped a month later for a start - up , swearing that if I ever saw this guy in a bar , I ’d give him a drunken earful .
I still scan the room each time I walk into a bar around Sunnyvale .
I ’m going to try to save this article which turned into a rant by giving you three pieces of advice .
First , regarding new hires .
Managers with new hires who are straight out of college often try micromanagement as means of molding new hires .
This is a management sin .
Yeah , I know they do n’t know anything about anything , but there is a massive difference between teaching someone about their job and mandating their direction .
If you believe that in the virgin career state that they ca n’t ask bright questions , you ’ve forgotten what it means to learn .
Think back to college , did you learn more in the lectures or in the lab with the teaching assistant ?
The lab , you say ?
Why ?
Simple , you can test your knowledge by asking questions .
Second , regarding Senior VPs .
At some point of your career , you ’re going to run into a VP of Engineering who randomly swoops into a development team and starts meddling with things .
Get a pencil ready because I ’m going to give you a piece of advice that I want you to write down and stick in your wallet .
All engineering managers miss building stuff .
Forget about whatever political intrigue brought this VP to your doorstep .
He was a developer at some point and when he is meddling with your stuff , he is telling you , “ I used to code and I miss it ” .
Once you ’ve identified one of these repressed coding types , the solution is easy .
Schedule a meeting once a week where you give him a demo .
Do n’t prepare for the demo , just bring whatever bits you ’ve got and head over to the VPs office .
Tell him , “ This is what we did this week , ” and this is the important part , “ And what you do think ? ”
Yes , you ’ve lost an hour a week , but these meetings do n’t usually last more than a month .
VPs have a full docket of stuff to do and once they ’ve scratched their programming itch with your product , they ’ll move on .
Besides , you got some face time with the big boss .
How can that hurt ?
Third , and lastly , learn how to Say No. Another VP took a stab at micromanaging at a previous gig .
It was a less dire situation than the first time because this guy was simply socially awkward .
It took us a good two years to have a “ How was your weekend ? ” conversation without odd pauses and stuttering .
In our first few weeks of 1 - on - 1 , he tried some of the same moves as my first micromanager .
I drove home after one of these meetings in a cold sweat .
See , I loved the job which meant I had to figure out how to manage this guy .
The weekend before our next meeting , I developed an early version of my communication template .
When the 1 - on - 1 started , I did n’t give him a chance to say anything .
It was 30 minutes of me listing off everything I knew about what was going on with my organization and my products and I did it in a very Rands - like people - focused tone .
I was showing this manager my secret title : “ Guy who knows the people are the business ” .
Daly said he became mesmerized by her videos after recently stumbling upon them online .
" The Internet has become a new platform for identifying emerging artists such as Brookers .
I hope to give her the opportunity to expose her talent on a much larger scale , " he said .
While Brodack is n't the first talent to surface from the Web -- MTV star Andy Milonakis got his start with online video sketches -- hers is one of the first deals struck based on YouTube popularity .

Never Underestimate the Power of Fun
There 's been a very active discussion among Sun 's " Java Champions " ( Sun 's program for external Java developer / evangelists , of which I 'm a member ) talking about why the Java programming language has lost some luster and Ruby is getting all the coder love .
I commented to the group , " Never underestimate the power of fun . "
We can talk all day about how much more powerful Java is ( true ) , how it has orders of magnitude more resources , APIs , frameworks , etc. ( true ) , and how it 's been used to solve some of the most complex , highly - scaled systems imaginable ( true , think Orbitz ) .
But in the end , even programmers are still human .
And human ( mammal ) brains are tuned for play .
Evolution favored those with a high play drive , because play=learning , play=practice , and learning / practice=survival .
Play -- and laughter -- sends a signal to the brain that " this is good , and it matters " , which is why we 're often more likely to remember especially funny things than neutral or annoying things .
But this is n't a post about programming -- it 's a follow - on to my previous post on brainstorming with EQ sliders .
It 's about adding a slider for humor or fun , where it is n't necessarily expected .
One innovative city government did just that , and they 're earning a reputation as a city that does things governments " just do n't DO . "
If you can imagine a city government trying to help its citizens " kick ass " , well , that 's what Bryan , Texas appears to be doing .
Jay G. Socol , the city 's Public Information Officer , explained it to me :
" All cities with populations of 3,000 or more are required by law to publish and distribute ( yawn ) drinking water quality reports .
Cities hate doing them , and residents throw them away , often without a glance .
Bo-ring .
This year , we developed a mid-year calendar ( who sends out a calendar in July ??? ) that featured fun photos of out Water Services employees -- guys who never , ever get the spotlight or recognition .
Yet they perform a mega-essential service .
So imagine what people thought when they opened their mailboxes and found a calendar that has a cover photo of water guys synchronized swimming in a pool ?
You have to open something like that and see what 's inside .
And that 's exactly what people did .
They loved the concept , the fun photos and ... they even read the boring legal information .
I move around town and quite often see the calendars hanging in businesses or in homes .
We 've had tons of requests for this thing -- even from other cities .
And I believe it will change the way cities approach publications like this because they never knew that they could show a sense of humor . "
( You can see some sample pages of the calendar on the Bryan government page . )
Seeing this made me think about ways to add a " fun " slider to places where fun has diminished over time ( like with Java ) , or into places it 's never been ( city government ) .
( I recommend the A Smile in the Mind book for inspiration . )
Way to go Jay Socol !
I hope the next city I live in has a government with this much spirit .

Fun is essential , so let 's set the " fun " slider to 400 .
Pat Kane ( author of The Play Ethic ) put it like this :
Welcome to the play ethic .
First of all , do n't take ' play ' to mean anything idle , wasteful or frivolous .
The trivialisation of play was the work ethic 's most lasting , and most regrettable achievement .
This is ' play ' as the great philosophers understood it : the experience of being an active , creative and fully autonomous person .
...
So to call yourself a ' player ' , rather than a ' worker ' , is to immediately widen your conception of who you are and what you might be capable of doing .
It is to dedicate yourself to realising your full human potential ; to be active , not passive .
The quote is from this excellent article : http://observer.guardian.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,386013,00.html

And yet every aspect of your work wants you to * work * .
Everytime someone in the group starts playing , having fun and is on a high .
s/he is in for all kinds of surprises like hatred , jealousy , sloppy managers getting surrounded by the big black cloud of FUD and wanting to stop you from playing .
I ask , WHY ?
And I have never been able to get an answer .
Most of my energy / drive I derive from the time that I DON 'T work .
Which is good ( for me ) and so very bad for the employer .

" I think that it 's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing .
When it started out , it was an awful lot of fun .
Of course , the paying customers got shafted every now and then , and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously .
We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful , error - free perfect use of these machines .
I do n't think we are .
I think we 're responsible for stretching them , setting them off in new directions , and keeping fun in the house .
I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun .
Above all , I hope we do n't become missionaries .
Do n't feel as if you 're Bible salesmen .
The world has too many of those already .
What you know about computing other people will learn .
Do n't feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands .
What 's in your hands , I think and hope , is intelligence : the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it , that you can make it more . " -- Alan Perlis
I know your post is n't about programming but , I was under the impression that Orbitz use LISP ( see http://www.paulgraham.com/carl.html) for their heavy algorithms and Java ( see http://lemonodor.com/archives/000071.html) for their website .
Speaking of Java vs LISP , ... , hmm , ... , lets see , ...

I really could n't believe how much more fun Ruby was than Java .
I think it all stem 's from Matz 's decision to focus Ruby around how a he feels when programming .
The goal was to design a language that he would have fun programming , and it just so happens other people do to .
Many languages have pretty similar " fun " settings to each other .
If they do n't vary noticeably , you do n't realize that they can .
Putting " fun " into an already established language is probably quite hard though .

Kathy :
Just a thought from my lisp - programming days - we all used to compare hacking lisp with making music .
Programming was like jamming ; improvisation grounded in a tremendous amount of practice .
Is there something intrinsic to music that brings the work and play of music so close together , or is it something about our cultural expectations of musicians ?
And , if it 's the latter , how can we foster a culture of " jam - band coders ? "

Indeed Kathy ,
Look at this example about having fun and EVERYONE is happy .
I was approached by a leading site ( well , it 's the best DBA support site on the planet ) to write some articles .
What were my options ?
-- I had the liberty to choose what articles I could write .
-- I follow the tech trends keenly so I knew what I SHOULD pick .
I 've just done 4 articles and it 's getting raving reviews ( It 's about Oracle RAC Clustering on VMwareVMware ) and all the revednorsvednorsicles .
Well it 's not ALL about recognition ( we all need recognition and acceptance ) but about plain good old fun .
Computing should be fun .
Doing business should MAKE sense .
Warm blood needs to flow in your veins ( for you to survive ) .
People should keep talking .
BTW : Anyone interested in those articles / technology can easily find it on google .

Care to comment on what you mean by " how much more powerful Java is ( true ) " ?
In what ways is Java " more powerful " than Ruby ?
I 'll acknowledge that Java probably does have " orders of magnitude more resources , APIs , frameworks " , but I 'm a bit more skeptical about it necessarily being a compelling reason for chosing Java over Ruby for any given problem .
I 'd pick a language in which it was easy to build things over a million frameworks that did stuff I do n't need any day .
Also the fact that Java has " been used to solve some of the most complex , highly - scaled systems imaginable " is only ( anecdotal ) proof of Java 's suitability for solving such problems , not proof against Ruby 's suitability for them .
Scalability is easy to mention to scare people off unfamiliar technology , but I 've seen dynamic languages scale massively too .
I think your point about Ruby becoming popular because it 's fun is true , but Logo is fun too , and it 's not causing the kind of excitement that Ruby is .
Ruby is attracting programmers away from Java because it 's fun * in addition * to being powerful and suitable for solving many of the same problems , not in spite of it .

The comments to this entry are closed .
In 1982 , my family took delivery of the very first IBM - PC in Israel .
We actually went down to the warehouse and waited while our PC was delivered from the port .
Somehow , I convinced my dad to get the fully - decked out version , with two floppy disks , 128 K memory , and both a dot - matrix printer ( for fast drafts ) and a Brother Letter - Quality Daisy
Wheel printer , which sounds exactly like a machine gun when it is operating , only louder .
I think we got almost every accessory available : PC - DOS 1.0 , the $ 75 technical reference manual with a complete source code listing of the BIOS , Macro Assembler , and the stunning IBM Monochrome display with a full 80 columns and … lower case letters !
The whole thing cost about $ 10,000 including Israel ’s then - ridiculous import taxes .
Extravagant !
Now , “ everybody ” knew that BASIC was a children ’s language that requires you to write spaghetti code and turns your brain into Camembert cheese .
So we shelled out $ 600 for IBM Pascal , which came on three floppy diskettes .
The compiler ’s first pass was on the first diskette , the second pass was on the second diskette , and the linker was on the third diskette .
I wrote a simple “ hello , world ” program and compiled it .
Total time elapsed : 8 minutes .
Hmm .
That ’s a long time .
I wrote a batch file to automate the process and shaved it down to 7 1/2 minutes .
Better .
But when I tried to write long programs like my stunning version of Othello which always beat me , I spent most of the time waiting for compiles .
“ Yep , ” a professional programmer told me , “ we used to keep a sit - up board in the office and do sit-ups while we were doing compiles .
After a few months of programming I had killer abs . ”
One day , a spiffy program called Compas Pascal appeared from Denmark , which Philippe Kahn bought and renamed Borland Turbo Pascal .
Turbo Pascal was sort of shocking , since it basically did everything that IBM Pascal did , only it ran in about 33 K of memory including the text editor .
This was nothing short of astonishing .
Even more astonishing was the fact that you could compile a small program in less than one second .
It ’s as if a company you had never heard of introduced a clone of the Buick LeSabre which could go 1,000,000 MPH and drive around the world on so little gasoline than an ant could drink it without getting sick .
Suddenly , I became much more productive .
That ’s when I learned about the concept of the REP loop .
REP stands for “ Read , Eval , Print ” , and it describes what a lisp interpreter does for a living : it “ reads ” your input , evaluates it , and prints the result .
An example of the REP loop is shown below : I type something , and the lisp interpreter reads it , evaluates it , and prints the result .
On a slightly larger scale , when you ’re writing code , you are in a macro-version of the REP loop called the Edit - Compile - Test loop .
You edit your code , compile it , test it , and see how well it works .
A crucial observation here is that you have to run through the loop again and again to write a program , and so it follows that the faster the Edit - Compile - Test loop , the more productive you will be , down to a natural limit of instantaneous compiles .
That ’s the formal , computer - science -y reason that computer programmers want really fast hardware and compiler developers will do anything they can to get super - fast Edit - Compile - Test loops .
Visual Basic does it by parsing and lex-ing each line as you type it , so that the final compile can be super - quick .
Visual C++ does it by providing incremental compiles , precompiled headers , and incremental linking .
But as soon as you start working on a larger team with multiple developers and testers , you encounter the same loop again , writ larger ( it ’s fractal , dude ! ) .
A tester finds a bug in the code , and reports the bug .
The programmer fixes the bug .
How long does it take before the tester gets the fixed version of the code ?
In some development organizations , this Report - Fix - Retest loop can take a couple of weeks , which means the whole organization is running unproductively .
To keep the whole development process running smoothly , you need to focus on getting the Report - Fix - Retest loop tightened .
One good way to do this is with daily builds .
A daily build is an automatic , daily , complete build of the entire source tree .
Automatic – because you set up the code to be compiled at a fixed time every day , using cron jobs ( on UNIX ) or the scheduler service ( on Windows ) .
Daily – or even more often .
It ’s tempting to do continuous builds , but you probably can’t , because of source control issues which I ’ll talk about in a minute .
Complete – chances are , your code has multiple versions .
Multiple language versions , multiple operating systems , or a high - end / low - end version .
The daily build needs to build all of them .
And it needs to build every file from scratch , not relying on the compiler ’s possibly imperfect incremental rebuild capabilities .
Here are some of the many benefits of daily builds :
When a bug is fixed , testers get the new version quickly and can retest to see if the bug was really fixed .
Developers can feel more secure that a change they made is n’t going to break any of the 1024 versions of the system that get produced , without actually having an OS / 2 box on their desk to test on .
Developers who check in their changes right before the scheduled daily build know that they are n’t going to hose everybody else by checking in something which “ breaks the build ” — that is , something that causes nobody to be able to compile .
This is the equivalent of the Blue Screen of Death for an entire programming team , and happens a lot when a programmer forgets to add a new file they created to the repository .
The build runs fine on their machines , but when anyone else checks out , they get linker errors and are stopped cold from doing any work .
Outside groups like marketing , beta customer sites , and so forth who need to use the immature product can pick a build that is known to be fairly stable and keep using it for a while .
By maintaining an archive of all daily builds , when you discover a really strange , new bug and you have no idea what ’s causing it , you can use binary search on the historical archive to pinpoint when the bug first appeared in the code .
Combined with good source control , you can probably track down which check - in caused the problem .
When a tester reports a problem that the programmer thinks is fixed , the tester can say which build they saw the problem in .
Then the programmer looks at when he checked in the fix and figure out whether it ’s really fixed .
Here ’s how to do them .
You need a daily build server , which will probably be the fastest computer you can get your hands on .
Write a script which checks out a complete copy of the current source code from the repository ( you are using source control , are n’t you ? ) and then builds , from scratch , every version of the code that you ship .
If you have an installer or setup program , build that too .
Everything you ship to customers should be produced by the daily build process .
Put each build in its own directory , coded by date .
Run your script at a fixed time every day .
It ’s crucial that everything it takes to make a final build is done by the daily build script , from checking out the code up to and including putting the bits up on a web server in the right place for the public to download ( although during the development process , this will be a test server , of course ) .
That ’s the only way to insure that there is nothing about the build process that is only “ documented ” in one person ’s head .
You never get into a situation where you ca n’t release a product because only Shaniqua knows how to create the installer , and she was hit by a bus .
On the Juno team , the only thing you needed to know to create a full build from scratch was where the build server was , and how to double - click on its “ Daily Build ” icon .

There is nothing worse for your sanity then when you are trying to ship the code , and there ’s one tiny bug , so you fix that one tiny bug right on the daily build server and ship it .
As a golden rule , you should only ship code that has been produced by a full , clean daily build that started from a complete checkout .
, so you fix that one tiny bug right on the daily build server and ship it .
As a golden rule , you should only ship code that has been produced by a full , clean daily build that started from a complete checkout .
Set your compilers to maximum warning level ( - W4 in Microsoft ’s world ; - Wall in gcc land ) and set them to stop if they encounter even the smallest warning .
If a daily build is broken , you run the risk of stopping the whole team .
Stop everything and keep rebuilding until it ’s fixed .
Some days , you may have multiple daily builds .
Your daily build script should report failures , via email , to the whole development team .
It ’s not too hard to grep the logs for “ error ” or “ warning ” and include that in the email , too .
The script can also append status reports to an HTML page visible to everyone so programmers and testers can quickly determine which builds were successful .
One rule we followed on the Microsoft Excel team , to great effect , was that whoever broke the build became responsible for babysitting builds until somebody else broke it .
In addition to serving as a clever incentive to keep the build working , it rotated almost everybody through the job of buildmaster so everybody learned about how builds are produced .
If your team works in one time zone , a good time to do builds is at lunchtime .
That way everybody checks in their latest code right before lunch , the build runs while they ’re eating , and when they get back , if the build is broken , everybody is around to fix it .
As soon as the build is working everybody can check out the latest version without fear that they will be hosed due to a broken build .
If your team is working in two time zones , schedule the daily build so that the people in one time zone do n’t hose the people in the other time zone .
On the Juno team , the New York people would check things in at 7 PM New York time and go home .
If they broke the build , the Hyderabad , India team would get into work ( at about 8 PM New York Time ) and be completely stuck for a whole day .
We started doing two daily builds , about an hour before each team went home , and completely solved that problem .

ZFS : Ten reasons to reformat your hard drives
Last Updated on June 10 , 2008
The much anticipated release of the new ZFS filesystem in Solaris 10 will revolutionize the way system administrators ( and executives ) think about and work with filesystems .
Breaking free of the traditional volume or partition architecture , ZFS combines scalability and flexibility while providing a simple command interface .
Coined by Sun as the “ last word in filesystems , ” ZFS is already being ported to several Linux distributions and Mac OSX .
Designed to have at least a 30 year shelf life , this filesystem will make waves with its upcoming release in Solaris 10 .
We ’ve been playing with ZFS for several months and have written some recipes about its basic administration .
Here are ten reasons why you ’ll want to reformat all of your systems and use ZFS .
1 . So easy your mom could administer it
ZFS is administered by two commands , zpool and zfs .
Most tasks typically require a single command to accomplish .
And the commands are designed to make sense .
For example , check out the commands to place a quota on its size .
2. Honkin ’ big filesystems
How big do filesystems need to be ?
In a world where 640 KB is certainly not enough for computer memory , current filesystems have reached or are reaching the end of their usefulness .
A 64 - bit filesystem would meet today ’s need , but estimate of the lifetime of a 64 - bit filesystem is about 10 years .
Extending to 128 - bits gives ZFS an expected lifetime of 30 years ( UFS , for comparison , is about 20 years old ) .
So how much data can you squeeze into a 128 - bit filesystem ?
16 exabytes or 18 million terabytes .
How many files can you cram into a ZFS filesystem ?
200 million million .
Could anyone use a fileystem that large ?
No , not really .
The topic has roused discussions about boiling the oceans if a real life storage unit that size was powered on .
It may not be necessary to have 128 bits , but it does n’t hurt and we wo n’t have to worry about running out of addressable space .
3. Filesystem , heal thyself
ZFS employs 256 bit checksums end - to - end to validate data stored under its protection .
Most filesystems ( and you know who you are ) depend on the underlying hardware to detect corrupted data and then can only nag about it if they get such a message .
Every block in a ZFS filesystem has a checksum associated with it .
If ZFS detects a checksum mismatch on a raidz or mirrored filesystem , it will actively reconstruct the block from the available redundancy and go on about its job .
4. fsck off , fsck
fsck has been voted out of the house .
We do n’t need it anymore .
Because ZFS data are always consistent on disk , do n’t be afraid to yank out those power cords if you feel like it .
Your ZFS filesystems will never require you to enter the superuser password for maintenance mode .
5. Compress to your heart ’s content
I ’ve always been a proponent of optional and appropriate compression in filesystems .
There are some data that are well suited to compression such as server logs .
Many people get ruffled up over this topic , although I suspect that they were once burned by doublespace munching up an important document .
When thoughtfully used , ZFS compression can improve disk I/O which is a common bottleneck .
ZFS compression can be turned on for individual filesystems or hierarchies with a very easy single command .
6. Unconstrained architecture
UFS and other filesystems use a constrained model of fixed partitions or volumes , each filesystem having a set amount of available disk space .
ZFS uses a pooled storage model .
This is a significant departure from the traditional concept of filesystems .
Many current production systems may have a single digit number of filesystems and adding or manipulating existing filesystems in such an environment is difficult .
In ZFS , mounted in different places in the host filesystem .
7 . Grow filesystems without green thumb
If your pool becomes overcrowded , you can grow it .
With one command .
On a live production system .
Enough said .
8. Dynamic striping
On by default , dynamic striping automatically includes all deivces in a pool in writes simultaneously ( stripe width spans all the avaiable media ) .
This will speed up the I/O on systems with multiple paths to storage by load balancing the I/O on all of the paths .
9 . The term “ raidz ” sounds so l33t
The new RAID - Z redundant storage model replaces RAID - 5 and improves upon it .
RAID - Z does not suffer from the “ write hole ” in which a stripe of data becomes corrupt because of a loss of power during the vulnerable period between writing the data and the parity .
RAID -Z , like RAID - 5 , can survive the loss of one disk .
A future release is planned using the keyword raidz2 which can tolerate the loss of two disks .
Perhaps the best feature is that creating a raidz pool is crazy simple .
10 . Clones with no ethical issues
The simple creation of restored to the original filesystem to return to the previous state .
Snapshots can be written to other storage ( disk , tape ) , transferred to another system , and converted back into a filesystem .

If you want to take ZFS out for a test drive , the latest version of Solaris Express has it built in and ready to go .

Here are 20 things you can do to make your apache configuration more secure .
Disclaimer :
The thing about security is that there are no guarantees or absolutes .
These suggestions should make your server a bit tighter , but do n't think your server is necessarily secure after following these suggestions .
Additionally some of these suggestions may decrease performance , or cause problems due to your environment .
It is up to you to determine if any of the changes I suggest are not compatible with your requirements .
In other words proceed at your own risk .
First , make sure you 've installed latest security patches
There is no sense in putting locks on the windows , if your door is wide open .
As such , if you 're not patched up there is n't really much point in continuing any longer on this list .
Go ahead and bookmark this page so you can come back later , and patch your server .
You 'll need a way to know when new Apache Server vulnerabilities are published .
I like to use stack .
watch to notify me when new Apache httpd server vulnerabilities are published .
The service is free , and will send you an email whenever new vulnerabilities exist .
Hide the Apache Version number , and other sensitive information .
By default many Apache installations tell the world what version of Apache you 're running , what operating system / version you 're running , and even what Apache Modules are installed on the server .
Attackers can use this information to their advantage when performing an attack .
It also sends the message that you have left most defaults alone .
There are two directives that you need to add , or edit in your httpd .
conf file :
ServerSignature Off ServerTokens Prod
The ServerSignature appears on the bottom of pages generated by apache such as 404 pages , directory listings , etc .
The ServerTokens directive is used to determine what Apache will put in the Server HTTP response header .
By setting it to Prod it sets the HTTP response header as follows :
Server : Apache
If you 're super paranoid you could change this to something other than " Apache " by editing the source code , or by using mod_security ( see below ) .
Make sure apache is running under its own user account and group
Several apache installations have it run as the user nobody .
So suppose both Apache , and your mail server were running as nobody an attack through Apache may allow the mail server to also be compromised , and vise versa .
User apache Group apache
Ensure that files outside the web root are not served
We do n't want apache to be able to access any files out side of its web root .
So assuming all your web sites are placed under one directory ( we will call this / web ) , you would set it up as follows :
< Directory /> Order Deny , Allow Deny from all Options None AllowOverride None </ Directory > < Directory / web > Order Allow , Deny Allow from all </ Directory >
Note that because we set Options None and AllowOverride None this will turn off all options and overrides for the server .
You now have to add them explicitly for each directory that requires an Option or Override .
Turn off directory browsing
You can do this with an Options directive inside a Directory tag .
Set Options to either None or - Indexes
Options - Indexes
Turn off server side includes
This is also done with the Options directive inside a Directory tag .
Set Options to either None or - Includes
Options - Includes
Turn off CGI execution
If you 're not using CGI turn it off with the Options directive inside a Directory tag .
Set Options to either None or - ExecCGI
Options - ExecCGI
Do n't allow apache to follow symbolic links
This can again can be done using the Options directive inside a Directory tag .
Set Options to either None or - FollowSymLinks
Options - FollowSymLinks
Turning off multiple Options
If you want to turn off all Options simply use :
Options None
If you only want to turn off some separate each option with a space in your Options directive :
Options - ExecCGI -FollowSymLinks - Indexes
Turn off support for .htaccess files
This is done in a Directory tag but with the AllowOverride directive .
Set it to None .
AllowOverride None
If you require Overrides ensure that they cannot be downloaded , and / or change the name to something other than .htaccess .
For example we could change it to .httpdoverride , and block all files that start with .ht from being downloaded as follows :
AccessFileName .httpdoverride < Files ~ " ^\.ht " >
Order allow , deny Deny from all Satisfy All </ Files >
Run mod_security
mod_security is a super handy Apache module written by Ivan Ristic , the author of Apache Security from O'Reilly press .
You can do the following with mod_security :
Simple filtering
Regular Expression based filtering
URL Encoding Validation
Unicode Encoding Validation
Auditing
Null byte attack prevention
Upload memory limits
Server identity masking
Built in Chroot support
And more
Disable any unnecessary modules
Apache typically comes with several modules installed .
Go through the apache module documentation and learn what each module you have enabled actually does .
Many times you will find that you do n't need to have the said module enabled .
Look for lines in your httpd.conf that contain LoadModule .
To disable the module you can typically just add a # at the beginning of the line .
To search for modules run :
grep LoadModule httpd.conf
Here are some modules that are typically enabled but often not needed : mod_imap , mod_include , mod_info , mod_userdir , mod_status , mod_cgi , mod_autoindex .
Make sure only root has read access to apache 's config and binaries
This can be done assuming your apache installation is located at /usr / local / apache as follows :
chown - R root : root /usr / local / apache chmod - R o-rwx /usr / local / apache
Lower the Timeout value
By default the Timeout directive is set to 300 seconds .
You can decrease help mitigate the potential effects of a denial of service attack .
Timeout 45
Limiting large requests
Apache has several directives that allow you to limit the size of a request , this can also be useful for mitigating the effects of a denial of service attack .
A good place to start is the LimitRequestBody directive .
This directive is set to unlimited by default .
If you are allowing file uploads of no larger than 1MB , you could set this setting to something like :
LimitRequestBody 1048576
If you 're not allowing file uploads you can set it even smaller .
Some other directives to look at are LimitRequestFields , LimitRequestFieldSize and LimitRequestLine .
These directives are set to a reasonable defaults for most servers , but you may want to tweak them to best fit your needs .
See the documentation for more info .
Limiting the size of an XML Body
If you 're running mod_dav ( typically used with subversion ) then you may want to limit the max size of an XML request body .
The LimitXMLRequestBody directive is only available on Apache 2 , and its default value is 1 million bytes ( approx 1 mb ) .
Many tutorials will have you set this value to 0 which means files of any size may be uploaded , which may be necessary if you 're using WebDAV to upload large files , but if you 're simply using it for source control , you can probably get away with setting an upper bound , such as 10 mb :
LimitXMLRequestBody 10485760
Limiting Concurrency
Apache has several configuration settings that can be used to adjust handling of concurrent requests .
The MaxClients is the maximum number of child processes that will be created to serve requests .
This may be set too high if your server does n't have enough memory to handle a large number of concurrent requests .
Other directives such as MaxSpareServers , MaxRequestsPerChild , and on Apache2 ThreadsPerChild , ServerLimit , and MaxSpareThreads are important to adjust to match your operating system , and hardware .
Restricting Access by IP
If you have a resource that should only by accessed by a certain network , or IP address you can enforce this in your apache configuration .
For instance if you want to restrict access to your intranet to allow only the 176.16 network :
Order Deny , Allow Deny from all Allow from 176.16.0.0/16
Or by IP :
Order Deny , Allow Deny from all Allow from 127.0.0.1
Adjusting KeepAlive settings
According to the Apache documentation using HTTP Keep Alive 's can improve client performance by as much as 50 % , so be careful before changing these settings , you will be trading performance for a slight denial of service mitigation .
KeepAlive's are turned on by default and you should leave them on , but you may consider changing the MaxKeepAliveRequests which defaults to 100 , and the KeepAliveTimeout which defaults to 15 .
Analyze your log files to determine the appropriate values .
Run Apache in a Chroot environment
chroot allows you to run a program in its own isolated jail .
This prevents a break in on one service from being able to effect anything else on the server .
It can be fairly tricky to set this up using chroot due to library dependencies .
I mentioned above that the mod_security module has built in chroot support .
It makes the process as simple as adding a mod_security directive to your configuration :
SecChrootDir / chroot / apache
There are however some caveats however , so check out the mod_security docs for more info .

OK , I 'll make this short and sweet .
Here 's a screencast of me building a super simple blog in Seaside in 15 minutes , similar to the Ruby demo screencast .
I use two frameworks here , Seaside , and Magritte , with a few custom extensions to my code browser to generate accessors with Magritte descriptions for me .
I tossed in a few required fields , and one business rule about duplicate post titles , to demo Magritte 's abilities .
I used the image for persistence , something I think greatly enhances development speed and enables rapid prototyping in a pure OO fashion ; something you can't do if you 're futzing around with database mappings and schemas .
This is my first time using screencast software , so there 's no sound , and everything is real time , I did n't edit or speedup the video .
I used a freeware capture program called CamStudio , it 's very simple and does n't allow editing .
In the future , I think I 'm going to need to find some better screencast software , the whole experience was a bit painful , but this will do for now .
If anyone knows any better free screencast software or formats to use , drop me a line .
UPDATE : The screencast is now in Quicktime and only 7 megs thanks to a reader Manuel Blanc re-encoding it for me .
UPDATE : In the video , I use a method called #contains : on the BlogPost collection , this method comes from the Refactoring Browser and is for compatibility with Visual Works .
It may not be in your image , the equivalent Squeak method is # anySatisify : which #contains : simply delegates to .
UPDATE : For anyone who'd like an explanation of what I 'm doing , Kevin Kleinfelter was kind enough to transcribe all the steps as if I 'd done a voice over .

Notes
Enter functions in standard mathematical notation , using x as independent variable .
As evident from the examples on this page , arguments to helper functions must be enclosed into parentheses ( or braces or brackets ) .
Grouping symbols such as parentheses , and helper functions may be arbitrarily deeply nested .
Examples :
cos[atan ( 5 x ) ^4 ] or sqrt{16*[1-sec( x ) ^2/4 ] }
The function plotter engine follows the common rules of math .
notation and order of operation ; for example , expressions inside parentheses have increased precedence , * and / have higher precedence than + and - , etc. .
In case no grouping symbols are used , 2 * x - 3/ x evaluates as if it were ( 2*x ) - ( 3/ x ) .
Since horizontal fraction lines are n't available to clearly mark off fraction expressions composed by sub-expressions , is is recommended to insert numerator and denominator each completely into parentheses ( or brackets or braces ) .
For example , type in pi-( 5 - x ) / ( 3x ) * acoth ( x ) instead of pi-5 - x / 3 x * acoth ( x ) which otherwise would evaluate to pi-5 -( x /3 ) * x* acoth ( x ) .
Upper and lower case may be arbitrarily used and mixed , even for predefined constants .
Spaces may be used for clarity as you wish , but neither help nor harm ; the program engine ignores them .
Range of x ( x min to x max ) should not extend beyond minus 1012 and plus 1012 .
Range of y ( y min to y max ) is optional ; if not specified , the function - grapher engine tries to evaluate it for the specified x range .
Multiple Functions at Once
You may enter up to 5 functions simultaneously , each terminated by a semicolon .
Of course building the diagram then will take more time , possibly several seconds .
Example ( you may copy it into the function input ) :
sqrt [ 16*( 1-x² /2 ) ] ;
- sqrt [ 16 *(1-x² /2 ) ] ;
sqrt [2*(1-x²/16 ) ] ;
- sqrt[2*(1-x²/16 ) ]
Tara Krapes StoryTara Krapes , 33 , has a business that made at least $ 2.5 million in sales by the end of 2004 .
Not bad , considering she began her company in 2002 with $ 1,050 from her own savings .
Vesta Executive Housing , based in Cincinnati and named for the Roman goddess of hearth and home , offers executives temporary housing for 30 days or more .
Krapes has relationships with 42 top - notch apartment complexes in the area .
When a client comes to Vesta , Krapes either has space ready for them , or , more often than not , she has to lease a new apartment for 12 months and hope that after her tenant leaves , she can fill it quickly .
She almost always does — she currently has zero vacancies .
It seems impossible that she could have funded this business — with 12 employees and a second office in Lexington , Kentucky — with a paltry grand .
Until you learn how she did it .
It helped that Krapes had experience in her field already .
All she needed was one customer to begin , she figured .
Once she found one , she signed a lease at an upscale apartment complex and paid the first month 's rent — $ 1,050 .
From then on , whenever she worked with any client , she always asked for the money upfront .
Krapes would invest the money back into her business by purchasing furniture and other necessities for the living quarters or her company .
And the more apartments she would rent from a complex , the cheaper the rent and the more revenue her company could pocket .
But most important , by coming up with a formula that allowed her to always get her money first , she says , " We avoided cash flow problems .
From that $ 1,050 , we 've been able to grow very fast .
We 've never had any debt or loans . "
Krapes quickly took on two partners , Paul Pelnar , 39 , and Joel Makela , 30 , friends and colleagues who both had experience that she did n't .
They were also able to contribute some other items , like computer equipment , but no money .
" Eighty - five percent of people get their money from savings or the three F's : family , friends and fools , " says Sutton Landry , director of Northern Kentucky University 's Small Business Development Center in Highland Heights , Kentucky .
" For the [ others ] , some kind of bank loan is involved .
Very few people get VC funding or angel funding .
" If you 're wondering what the " slam - dunk qualifications " are for getting a big bank loan , Landry reels some of them off : " Typically , it 's someone who is between the ages of 35 and 50 , college - educated , and who has a net worth of a quarter of a million dollars — plus a Beacon [ credit ] score of 700 - plus — with a business plan .
It almost does n't matter how good the business plan is , as long as they have one .
Ideally , they 're going into a business where they have five to 10 years of experience — half of it in management .
Most banks will look at that type of profile , do the credit scoring , and say ' Yeah , these people would rather die than not pay a loan back .
'" But what if you 're 26 , utterly broke , and wishing you had gotten an MBA instead of a degree in American folklore ?
Landry says if your credit is halfway decent , you might be able to find somebody to cosign a loan — and " you 'll need a business plan , a good business plan , " he says .
Beyond that , you 're simply going to have to rely on that can - do spirit .
" Starting your own business involves sacrifice , " says Landry .
" Unfortunately , we 're not a society that 's much interested in sacrifice .
But on a practical side , that 's how most startup businesses begin .
They start part time , and they 're constantly re-investing money into the business .
It 's the same model that a lot of immigrants have when they come to this country , where people work three jobs to build the savings they need .
But instead of getting a second job , you 're running your business in the evenings and on weekends .
" Krapes echoes that thought .
She had one serious cash crunch when she discovered how few people need housing during the end - of - the - year holidays : " We did n't pay ourselves for a few months .
" More on this subject
Glenn Greenwald suggests that this is correct because the DOJ 's failure to address the merits should be seen as a tacit admission that the ACLU 's position is correct ; this seems quite bizarre to me , as surely the assertion of a legal privilege as to why a question should not be answered does not constitute an admission .
i.e .
Arguably , this gave the defendants an opportunity to present evidence to defeat the summary judgment motion , and they chose not to take it .
i.e .
UPDATE
At the rate things are going , Judge Anna Diggs Taylor is going to be due a serious apology some time soon , if she is n't due one already .
It turns out many of the " experts " who were widely cited to support the attacks on Judge Taylor 's opinion were actually themselves quite misinformed about the basic matters governing her rulings .
Here , for instance , is a post from Orin Kerr which reflects a deep misunderstanding of the issues which Judge Taylor ruled on .
I 'm not trying to single him out .
To the contrary , he 's been commendably candid about his lack of expertise in ( I would even say knowledge of ) how civil litigation works ( a modesty and candor which many lack ) .
Yet despite his self - professed unfamiliarity with civil litigation , he was one of the most widely - quoted law professors by those wanting to disparage the quality of Judge Taylor 's opinion , and the result of his lack of relevant knowledge ( about both civil litigation rules generally and the events in this case ) were some plainly misguided attacks .
In his post , Kerr responds to a point I ( and others ) have made -- that a principal reason why Judge Taylor was somewhat conclusory in her analysis of some issues , and the reason she repeatedly said that certain propositions were " undisputed , " is because the Bush administration either failed or chose not to dispute them .
Specifically , the Justice Department was so intent on telling the Judge that she had no right to even rule on these issues ( because the NSA program is a " state secret , " the legality of which the court cannot adjudicate without damaging national security and / or because the plaintiffs lack " standing " ) , that it basically chose not to address the merits of the plaintiffs ' case at all .
Indeed , as I wrote about here at the time it happened , the DoJ twice tried to convince Judge Taylor not to rule on the substance of the ACLU 's claim , but instead to rule first on the DoJ 's " state secrets " argument .
Twice , the court refused this request , ordering the DoJ to address the merits of the case ( this Comment to Kerr 's post , documents the case 's procedural history ) .
But the DoJ essentially refused to do so , and devoted almost all of its brief ( .pdf ) to arguing why the court lacked the power to adjudicate these issues , and almost none of its brief to arguing about the issues themselves .
As Marty Lederman put it once he read the DoJ's Brief : it " did not quite advance or support in any detail that argument -- or any other merits argument , for that matter .
" As this excellent Comment to Kerr 's post reflects , the Bush administration 's refusal to address the merits of the claims ( which is part and parcel of its general contempt for the role of the courts in scrutinizing its conduct ) meant that Judge Taylor was not only entitled , but was required by the Rules of Civil Procedure ( Rule 56 ) , to treat the ACLU 's factual claims as undisputed for purposes of deciding the motion .
But plainly , Kerr -- when issuing his widely cited condemnations of the court 's ruling -- had no idea ( a ) that any of this ( meaning the case 's procedural history ) had happened and ( b ) that on a Motion for Summary Judgment ( which is what the ACLU filed and the court decided ) , the most basic rule is that any fact that one party fails to dispute ( with evidence ) shall be deemed " undisputed . "
Thus , in response to the Comment documenting the procedural history , Kerr wrote : " Thanks a TON for the background of the case ; this is very helpful , and I hope to have an update or new post up soon about it . "
And in response to my pointing out the other day that the DoJ 's failure to dispute any of these factual assertions compelled the court to treat them as undisputed , Kerr wrote : But far from being " bizarre , " this proposition -- that facts which a party fails ( for whatever reasons ) to dispute on Summary Judgment are deemed " undisputed " by the court -- is one of the most basic principles of civil litigation in the federal courts , as any federal court litigator would know .
Someone ( such as Kerr ) who is unaware of those rules might find it " bizarre " that the court repeatedly labelled as " undisputed " facts and propositions which Kerr himself might want to dispute , but given the DoJ 's failure to dispute these propositions , the court was required to treat them as such .
How can someone who is ( a ) unfamiliar with the case itself and ( b ) unfamiliar with the rules governing the key issues before the court be cited as the preeminent expert to opine that the court 's opinion is so flawed ?
Then we have University of Wisconsin School of Law Professor Ann Althouse , who wrote a post last night citing to Kerr 's post and declaring that he " seems to be getting at what happened " in this case .
She then points to what she calls " the weird repetition of the strange word ' undisputedly ' throughout the opinion " and -- in bolded letters -- she criticizes the court for not even mentioning the DoJ 's motion for a " stay " ( its request that the court not rule on the substance of the claims until it decides the DoJ 's motion to dismiss on the " state secrets " ground ) .
But then , in an " Update , " Althouse has to correct herself because , apparently , she read the Comment section to Kerr 's post and realized that she was just wrong about what happened -- specifically , that the court did previously deny the DoJ 's request and ordered the DoJ to address the substance of the plaintiffs ' claims .
Learning about the procedural history of this case caused Althouse to write :
In other words , Kerr 's critique ( which Althouse endorsed ) of the court 's opinion is just wrong -- factually wrong .
The court directed the DoJ to address the substance of the claims and the DoJ simply failed and / or refused to do so -- facts which neither Kerr nor Althouse even knew when attacking the court 's opinion .
And there is nothing " arguable " about it -- if one party moves for Summary Judgment and presents competent evidence supporting its factual claims ( as the ACLU indisputably did here ) , and the other party fails to dispute those facts with competent evidence ( as the DoJ indisputably did here ) , then those facts are " undisputed , " by definition .
I seriously doubt based on their commentary that Kerr or Althouse ( and most , though not all , of the other law professor critics ) have been following this case at all .
They do n't seem to be aware of some rather critical events which are indispensable in understanding what the court did here -- or , at least , they were n't aware of those events at the time they were attacking Judge Taylor 's opinion .
What appears to have happened is that they read the opinion on the day it was issued and evaluated it without regard to ( or knowledge of ) the procedural history of the case , the rules of civil litigation , and the arguments advanced by the DoJ -- , they evaluated it the way a law professor would grade an exam or comment on a law review article , not the way a judicial opinion of this type must be understood ( which was part of what Professor Tribe was pointing out the other day ) .
It is true that there are parts of Judge Taylor 's opinion which are surprisingly conclusory , but that does not necessarily make it flawed .
It is amazing to watch virtually everyone who is trying to attack her opinion do so by making arguments which the DoJ never made in the case before her .
A basic familiarity with this case and with the rules of civil procedure -- both of which many of her critics clearly lacked -- would reveal that Judge Taylor 's opinion was infinitely more sound than the conventional wisdom ( thanks to many of these law professors ) now holds that it was .
Finally , for two critical , under - appreciated points concerning Judge Taylor 's decisions , see here : Add Law Professor Geoffrey Stone , former Dean of the University of Chicago Law School and current constitutional law expert , to the list of admirers of Judge Taylor 's opinion .
Professor Stone says that he is " confident Judge Taylor reached the right result " ( emphasis added ; h/t Mona ) , and that it took " a good deal of courage for a judge to hold unlawful a program that the President of the United States maintains is essential to the national security .
" It certainly did -- far more courage than almost anyone else has shown ( in the Congress , the courts or the media ) in the face of the administration 's endless exploitation of terrorism to claim virutally unlimited power .
It looks as though the little conventional wisdom claim that " All of the High Scholarly Distinguished Priests of Legal Wisdom Agree that this Decision is Undignified and Distasteful " is going to have to be re-written .
Some public recanting is in order .

How to Search the Invisible Web
by Wendy Boswell
September is in full swing , which means back to school , back to books , back to teacher 's dirty looks - well , hopefully not that last part .
School also means getting back to research papers , especially the super happy fun ten pagers on the environmental impact of Chicago 's wheat exporting industry with footnotes , for example .
The Web has become a big part of most students ' research processes ; in fact , more people look on the Web for answers before checking any other reference .
However , merely " Googling " something when it's an obscure topic or if you need targeted information with a particular focus does n't always turn up the best results .
That 's where the Invisible , or Deep Web , comes in .
What is the Deep Web ?
The term " invisible web " or " deep web " refers to the vast repository of information that search engines and directories do n't have direct access to , like databases at university libraries , sites that require passwords to view , or sites that for some reason do n't want search engines to crawl them .
Unlike pages on the visible Web ( that is , the Web that you can access from search engines and directories ) , information in databases is generally inaccessible to the software spiders and crawlers that create search engine indexes .

If you did n't know already , the Web is big .
Ginormous big .
And while search engines and directories do a pretty good job of indexing a lot of that material , there is a huge chunk that they just cannot wrap their little software -y arms around , and this chunk is the Invisible , Deep , or Cloaked Web .
It sounds pretty mysterious but it 's really not .
Think of it this way : Google , considered by most people in the know to have the largest search database , has about eight billion pages in its index .
Those eight billion pages seem like a lot until you consider that the Deep Web is estimated to be 500 times bigger than the searchable Web .
Multiply 500 by the 8 billion in Google 's index ... plus add in the fact that Google is only indexing a fraction of the searchable Web ( around 250 billion pages are on the Web today ) ... and you 'll get a whole bunch of math that makes my head hurt .
Suffice it to say that the Deep Web is worth looking into .

So How Do You Get To The Deep Web ?
There are a couple of ways you can get to the Deep Web .
It 's not that this information is necessarily closed off to users ; it 's just that it 's a bit trickier to tap into .
I 'll pick the topic : the life cycle of Botswana warthogs .

Search Engine Queries
You can use search engines , such as Google and Yahoo , to search the Invisible Web for database information , such as that from a college university or library .
Think of these general search engines as the tool you 're going to initially use to narrow down your search to Invisible Web databases .
My query , " the life cycle of Botswana warthogs " , returned way too many results .
So I truncated it to " warthogs database " instead , and got the following :

That 's one of the tricks you can use to find Invisible Web content
just put the word " database " in your query and more often than not you 'll come back lucky .
This Penn State database has more than enough searchable information regarding warthogs than I 'll ever need , plus , it 's an academic , accredited , footnote - able institution .
Way more worthy of a citation than say Billy Bob 's Guide To That Them There Hogs .
Let 's try another query : how about you 're doing an in - depth report on the past ten years of plane crashes in Argentina .
Try a query for " plane crash Argentina " in Yahoo and you 'll get mostly news items , which would take a long time to comb through .
Let 's try this query again : " aviation database " , and then we 'll work our way down to the plane crashes .

The fifth site on our list is the winner , and that is the NTSB Aviation Accident Database .
It took a bit of work to get there , but with the depth of search and information that this particular database offers , it was worth it .

Invisible Web Gateways
Maybe you do n't want to dink around with finding databases on the Web ; you would like to go straight to the databases themselves .
There are sites that serve as invisible Web " gateways " that will help you do this .

A missing notebook clutched by a Shropshire lad who circumnavigated the globe , returned to Britain , and demolished the Victorian hubris that humans stood alone as the pinnacle of creation is published for the first time today .
The original notebook , which documents Charles Darwin 's observations throughout his five - year voyage to the Amazon , Patagonia and the Pacific aboard HMS Beagle , is presumed stolen , but using a microfilm copy , Cambridge University scientists today make it available free online , along with the entire works of the scientist credited with the most important advance in science of the past 300 years .
The collection brings Darwin 's breathtaking range of writing together for the first time , with 50,000 pages of searchable text , and tens of thousands of images , many from previously unpublished manuscripts , together with notebooks , diaries and original publications such as The Origin of Species , The Voyage of the Beagle ( the Journal of Researches ) and The Descent of Man. Audio versions of key works will be free to download at the project website , darwin-online.org.uk .
" Nowhere possesses this complete collection .
It 's a complete run of his papers which has never been assembled in any form anywhere , " said John van Wyhe , director of The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online project .
Randal Keynes , Darwin 's great , great grandson , told the Guardian the project fulfilled the Darwin family 's long - standing aim to have all of the scientist 's work available for everyone .
" My Felon Americans : John Kerry and Hillary Clinton Want to Let Criminals Vote "
The 14th Amendment specifically permits states to disfranchise citizens convicted of " participation in rebellion , or other crime . "
In a Wall Street Journal editorial entitled , the Journal kicked into the propaganda mode by wrongfully asserting :
The 14th Amendment does say :
SECTION 2 .
But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States , Representatives in Congress , the Executive and Judicial officers of a State , or the members of the Legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the United States , or in any way abridged , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such State .
Section 2 , of the 14th is about 130 words , and deals with a burning issue in 1866 : how to " count " the citizens and voters in states that formerly were in rebellion to the Union for purpose of their representation in the Congress of the United States .
The important thing it does is to declare that if some citizens are denied the right to vote for reasons other than they participated in the ( Civil War ) rebellion the number of people in the state calculated for purposes of selecting the number of representatives shall be reduced by the same proportion as the number of Blacks disallowed from voting .
There was a concern that Southern states would deny blacks the right to vote in the post - Civil War South .
What is says any Southern state disenfranchises X amount of blacks will be penalized by a quid pro quo reduction in the same amount of citizens in the reapportionment count .
There was no question but that the Confederate states would be folded back into the Union , but how to do so was a matter of the most extreme delicacy .
One of the huge issues was how you counted citizens .
We know that slaves were originally counted as 3/5 of a person , but once they are declared to be citizens of the US and of their states , they must be counted as 1/1 person .
But do you appoint representatives based on male citizens of voting age ?
OR do you head - count it based or total number of based on male and female who were of voting age ( even though women did n't get the right to vote ) ?
In context , the 14th Amendment was n't even about denying the right to vote to convicted felons it was about enfranchising black voters without the fear of being denied the vote .
There is absolutely no language in the 14th Amendment that empowers individual states to pass laws denying convicted felons of the right to vote .
You have to grudgingly admire the bi-polar idiot / genius of the Republicans :
They have extracted a single esoteric phrase ( " except for participation in rebellion and other crimes " ) from the 14th Amendment passed to protect voting rights and on the basis of that 8 word passage , have transformed a voting rights law into a de facto voting suppression law , just as they have done with photo ID laws .
When you live under the Stupidity Paradigm it emboldens the terrorists , if ask messy questions .
Just close your eyes and trust the guys who marching us straigt toward the edge of the abyss .
If you read the Section 1 . of the 14th Amendment you will discover the true intent of the law before the GOP authorized themselves to use it to keep blacks from voting :
Section 1 .
All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside .
No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws .
Another " convenient fiction " courtesy of the GOP noise machine .
In the racially colorblind universe of Republican legal reasoning , the plain language of a law can be deconstructed to have any meaning .
It 's similar to the flat - out fiction by conservative fundamentalists that there is no language in the Constitution that separates church from state .
Who cares if the very first sentence to the very first amendment to the Constitution says : Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion .
What part of that unambigous sentence do Republicans fail understand ?
Since these convicted felon statutes passed by states rest on the quicksand foundation of mumbo jumbo legal reasoning , it 's about time John Kerry and Hillary Clinton put an end to this nonsense by sponsoring a bill puts an end to the Republican 's post - modern version Jim Crow laws .
Whatever policy we have about convicted felons voting , it should be uniform over all 50 states .
We can't have some states refusing the franchise to convicted felons and others allowing convicted felons to vote .
The biggest problem with banning convicted felons from voting is there is n't an accurate list of convicted felons in any state .
Felon lists are generated by private sector contractors
The Miami Herald wrote this about James Lee , president of DBT , the private contractor that was hired by the state of Florida to generate a felon 's list for the 2000 presidential election :
On April 17 2001 , James Lee testified , before the McKinney panel , that the state had given DBT the directive to add to the purge list people who matched at least 90 % of a last name .
DBT objected , knowing that this would produce a huge number of false positives ( non-felons ) .
Lee went on saying that the state then ordered DBT to shift to an even lower threshold of 80 % match , allowing also names to be reversed ( thus a person named Thomas Clarence could be taken to be the same as Clarence Thomas ) .
Besides this , middle initials were skipped , Jr. and Sr. suffixes dropped , and some nicknames and aliases were added to puff up the list .
" DBT told state officials " , testified Lee , " that the rules for creating the [ purge ] list would mean a significant number of people who were not deceased , not registered in more than one county , or not a felon , would be included on the list .
DBT made suggestions to reduce the numbers of eligible voters included on the list " .
According to Lee , to this suggestion the state told the company , " Forget about it " . "
The people who worked on this ( for DBT ) are very adamant ... they told them what would happen " , said Lee .
" The state expected the county supervisors to be the failsafe . "
Lee said his company will never again get involved in cleansing voting rolls .
" We are not confident any of the methods used today can guarantee legal voters will not be wrongfully denied the right to vote " , Lee told a group of Atlanta - area black lawmakers in March 2001 .
I 'm sorry if I see things differently from George and Jeb Bush , but if one innocent person is fraudulently denied the right to vote because of an inaccurate felon 's list , that 's one person too many .
Meanwhile back at the ranch the Bush brothers , Karl Rove and Dick Cheney are dreaming up more crackpot ideas to supress the vote , and dispatching Big Al Gonzalez the psycho-attorney to the law library find some precedent , any ol ' bizarre precedent to keep even more poor people & non-combatant domestic enemies from voting .
In the 2004 presidential election Associated Press ( 10/17/04 ) wrote this about the Florida felon 's list :
Florida Gov. Jeb
Bush ignored advice to throw out a flawed felon voter list before it went out to county election offices despite warnings from state officials , according to a published report Saturday .
In a May 4 e-mail obtained by the Sarasota Herald - Tribune , Florida Department of Law Enforcement computer expert Jeff Long told his boss that a Department of State computer expert had told him ``that yesterday they recommended to the Gov that they ' pull the plug ' on the voter database .
The e-mail said state election officials ``were n't comfortable with the felon matching program they 've got , '' but added , `` The Gov rejected their suggestion to pull the plug , so they 're ' going live ' with it this weekend . ''
A software program matched data on felons with voter registration rolls to create the list of 48,000 names .
Secretary of State Glenda Hood junked the database in July after acknowledging that 2,500 ex-felons on the list had had their voting rights restored .
Most were Democrats , and many were black .
Hispanics , who often vote Republican in Florida , were almost entirely absent from the list due to a technical error ( my emphasis )
Florida is one of the increasing number of states that does not automatically restore voting rights to convicted felons when they complete their sentences and probation .
Purging felons from voter rolls has been a hot - button issue since the 2000 presidential election , and since then many citizens discovered at the polls they were n't allowed to vote since the passage of laws denying convicted felons of the right to vote .
The Seattle Times wrote this about Washington 's felon list ( 3/17/2005 ) :
The list of alleged felon voters compiled ... mistakenly includes people tried as juveniles who never lost their right to vote .
A spokeswoman for Rossi acknowledged last night that perhaps hundreds of the 1,135 people on the list are there improperly because of juvenile cases .
A partial check by The Seattle Times showed that 165 alleged felon voters in King County had only juvenile cases .
The Times was able to check 462 names using a Washington State Patrol database .
An attorney for the Democratic Party said more than 200 juvenile cases were found among the King County names .
" They should scrub their list for other errors , " said attorney Jenny Durkan , a lawyer for the Democrats . " This is a huge error . "
Durkan said Republican attorneys should apologize to the people erroneously listed as voting illegally and amend the list " so these people 's names never have to go into an official court file . "
Every state that has denied the vote to convicted felons has attempted to enforce the law with shoddy , poorly compiled lists of felons that often target minority voters .
Do we know that law is even equally enforced ?
Is a John Smith " who votes in an affluent Republican precinct subjected to the same rigorous scrutiny as the " John Smith " whose name comes up on a felon 's list in an inner city black neighborhood ?
Under the law both John Smith " should be denied the vote , but it 's unlikely that the John Smith in the Republican precinct will be challenged as being the felonious John Smith " on the list .
State laws restricting felons from voting should be scrapped because the technology is not available to generate fair and accurate felon lists .
As long as felon lists are inaccurate , innocent people will be denied the right to vote because they have the bad luck of having the same name as a convicted felon .
It may well be that felony lists have turned away more legally eligible voters , than felons .
No study has ever been done on the impact of felony lists on denial of the vote to perfectly legal voters .
What is a convicted felon , anyway ?
Anyone caught with a marijuana cigarette 20 years ago may well be a convicted felon in the state of Florida in 2006 .
If you got into a brawl in 1977 , and were convicted of aggravated assault you can't vote in the state of Florida .
If you were convicted of rape and later exonerated on the basis of DNA evidence that felony conviction will not automatically disappear from your criminal record , so you are denied the right to vote in Florida .
In Missouri animal abuse is a class D felony .
In most states a third conviction on drunk driving is a class D or class C felony , even though 20 years ago third time offenders were at most charged with a class A misdemeanor .
So if you were drunk driver George Bush in the Seventies you are grandfathered out of the Class C felony and you 're drunk driver George Bush in the Nineties you were a felon and automatically denied the right to vote .
Sorry George , you 're not even allowed to run for office because you 're a drunken felon .
There is no language in the Constitution about denying the right to vote to convicted felons .
Not even close .
Theoretically , federal law allows persons convicted of felonies in a United States district court to apply to have their record expunged after a certain period of time with a clean record .
However , the Republicans in the U.S. Congress have refused to fund the federal agency mandated with handling the applications of convicted felons to have their record expunged .
This means that , in practice , federal felons cannot have their records expunged .
Another Republican slam - dunk on denying voting rights .
My own grandfather came to America after he was wrongfully accused of the felony of gun running for the Irish republican movement in the 1930s .
He was a stow - away on a commercial freighter boat and was assisted and protected by Irish national deckhands on the ship .
When he reached Ellis Island , expatriate Irish immigration officials expedited his illegal entry into the United States .
We are no longer the land of opportunity if we deny voting rights to those who want a new start in life .
My grandfather was lucky enough to get a second chance .
In 2006 in America , he would have been detained as a terrorist and flown off to Egypt to be tortured by millitary intelligence specialists .

Last year , two days after Christmas , we kicked China out of the house .
Not the country obviously , but bits of plastic , metal , and wood stamped with the words " Made in China . "
We kept what we already had , but stopped bringing any more in .
The banishment was no fault of China's .
It had coated our lives with a cheerful veneer of toys , gadgets , and $ 10 children 's shoes .
Sometimes I worried about jobs sent overseas or nasty reports about human rights abuses , but price trumped virtue at our house .
We could n't resist what China was selling .
But on that dark Monday last year , a creeping unease washed over me as I sat on the sofa and surveyed the gloomy wreckage of the holiday .
It was n't until then that I noticed an irrefutable fact : China was taking over the place .
It stared back at me from the empty screen of the television .
I spied it in the pile of tennis shoes by the door .
It glowed in the lights on the Christmas tree and watched me in the eyes of a doll splayed on the floor .
I slipped off the couch and did a quick inventory , sorting gifts into two stacks : China and non-China .
The count came to China , 25 , the world , 14 .
Christmas , I realized , had become a holiday made by the Chinese .
Suddenly I 'd had enough .
I wanted China out .
Through tricks and persuasion I got my husband on board , and on Jan. 1 we launched a yearlong household embargo on Chinese imports .
The idea was n't to punish China , which would never feel the pinprick of our protest .
And we did n't fool ourselves into thinking we 'd bring back a single job to unplugged company towns in Ohio and Georgia .
We pushed China out of our lives because we wanted to measure how far it had pushed in .
We wanted to know what it would take in time , money , and aggravation to kick our China habit .
We hit the first rut in the road when I discovered our son's toes pressing against the ends of his tennis shoes .
I wore myself out hunting for new ones .
After two weeks I broke down and spent $ 60 on sneakers from Italy .
I felt sick over the money ; it seemed decadent for a pair of children 's shoes .
I got used to the feeling .
Weeks later I shelled out $ 60 for Texas - made shoes for our toddler daughter .
We got hung up on lots of little things .
I drove to half a dozen grocery stores in search of candles for my husband 's birthday cake , eventually settling on a box of dusty leftovers I found in the kitchen .
The junk drawer has been stuck shut since January .
My husband found the part to fix it at Home Depot but left it on the shelf when he spotted the telltale " Made in China . "
Mini crises erupted when our blender and television broke down .
The television sputtered back to life without intervention , but it was a long , hot summer without smoothies .
We killed four mice with old - fashioned snapping traps because the catch - and - release ones we prefer are made in China .
Last summer at the beach my husband wore a pair of mismatched flip - flops my mother found in her garage .
He 'd run out of options at the drug store .
Navigating the toy aisle has been a wilting affair .
In the spring , our 4 - year - old son launched a countercampaign in support of " China things . "
He 's been a good sport , but he 's weary of Danish - made Legos , the only sure bet for birthday gifts for his friends .
One morning in October he fell apart during a trip to Target when he developed a sudden lust for an electric purple pumpkin .
" It 's too long without China , " he wailed .
He kept at me all day .
The next morning I drove him back so he could use his birthday money to buy the pumpkin for himself .
I kept my fingers off the bills as he passed them to the checker .
My husband bemoans the Christmas gifts he can't buy because they were made in China .
He plans to sew sleeping bags for the children himself .
He can build wooden boats and guitars , but I fear he will meet his match with thread and needle .
" How hard can it be ? " he scoffed .
The funny thing about China 's ascent is that we , as a nation , could shut the whole thing down in a week .
Jump - start a " Just Say No to Chinese Products Week , " and the empire will collapse amid the chaos of overloaded cargo ships in Long Beach harbor .
I doubt we could pull it off .
Americans may be famously patriotic , but look closely , and you 'll see who makes the flag magnets on their car bumpers .
These days China delivers every major holiday , Fourth of July included .
I do n't know what we will do after Dec. 31 when our family 's embargo comes to its official end .
China - free living has been a hassle .
I have discovered for myself that China does n't control every aspect of our daily lives , but if you take a close look at the underside of boxes in the toy department , I promise it will give you pause .
Our son knows where he stands on the matter .
In the bathtub one evening he told me how happy he was that " the China season " was coming soon .
" When we can buy China things again , let 's never stop , " he said .
After a year without China I can tell you this :
You can still live without it , but it 's getting trickier and costlier by the day .
And a decade from now I may not be brave enough to try it again .

Mr Blair is being urged to make a public announcement
He branded ex-junior minister Tom Watson , the most senior person to quit , " disloyal , discourteous and wrong " for signing a letter urging him to go .
The resignations came as Mr Blair faces growing pressure to name a departure date or even quit now .
Gordon Brown 's backers say assurances he will resign in May are " not enough " .
' Brownite plot '
But Mr Blair 's supporters claim the calls for him to quit are an orchestrated plot by supporters of Mr Brown , who has so far declined to comment on the furore .
In a statement , former Home Secretary David Blunkett said : " It is now in Gordon Brown 's - and the Labour Party 's - best interests for those seeking the prime minister 's immediate departure to back off .
" This is not only to avoid our opponents exploiting the impression of disintegration and division , but also to avoid the split of our party , which would have lasting consequences .
" No - one can benefit from a split in the government or the party now , or in the foreseeable future , and this is patently avoidable by a return to common sense . "
' Clear timetable '
Mr Watson and the six parliamentary private secretaries ( PPSs ) - who are unpaid ministerial aides at the bottom rung of the government ladder - were among a number of normally loyal Labour MPs from the 2001 intake who signed a letter calling on Mr Blair to quit .
Without an urgent change in the leadership of the party it becomes less likely that we will win that election
Loyal Labour MPs urge Blair to quit
In full : 2001 intake letter
The six were : Khalid Mahmood , Wayne David , Ian Lucas , Mark Tami , Chris Mole and David Wright .
In a joint statement , four of the PPS group said Mr Blair had " not ended the uncertainty over when you intend to leave office , which is damaging the government and the party " .
Mr David told BBC Radio 5
Live he was worried about next year 's elections in Scotland and Wales , adding : " We obviously will do much better if we have a clear timetable set out for transition " .
Mr Watson , who has already been replaced as a junior defence minister by junior transport minister Derek Twigg , said he no longer believed that it was in the best interests of the party or the country for Mr Blair to continue .
Impossible position
But Mr Blair hit back saying that calls for his resignation were putting Labour 's electoral prospects at risk .
GOVERNMENT HIERARCHY
Cabinet : 23 people - appointed by PM to head departments and decide government policy Minister of State : 28 people - middle - ranking ministers responsible for specific area Parliamentary Secretaries /
Under secretaries of state : 36 people - the most junior ministers , often responsible for aspect of department 's work Whips : 23 people - communicate government objectives and MPs ' concerns Law Officers : 3 people - provide high - grade legal advice Parliamentary Private Secretaries : 55 people - act as unpaid assistant to minister .
Seen as first rung on ladder
He said he had been " intending to dismiss " Mr Watson anyway " but wanted to extend to him the courtesy of speaking to him first " .
The prime minister added : " Had he come to me privately and expressed his view about the leadership , that would have been one thing .
" But to sign a round robin letter which was then leaked to the press was disloyal , discourteous and wrong .
" It would therefore have been impossible for him to remain in government . "
' Change wanted '
The Sun newspaper said earlier that Mr Blair will go on 31 May , but Number 10 has insisted it had not leaked the date .
Meanwhile , leading Brownites are calling for the prime minister to make a public declaration about when he will go , so that he can not go back on it .
If this is a coup , are Brown 's allies ready to follow through ?
BBC political editor Nick Robinson
Read Nick 's thoughts in full
One of the chancellor 's closest allies , who asked not to be named , told the BBC News website : " From Gordon 's point of view there has to be a public statement .
" Blair has to let it be known when he will go and there has to be a public declaration . "
Ex-minister Doug Henderson , also a Brown supporter , said he could not see what Mr Blair would achieve by staying on .
HAVE YOUR SAY I think Mr Blair is left with no option but to lay out a clear timetable for departure
Mark Thomas , Hastings
Send us your comments
" There should be a new leader in place by the end of March , " said Mr Henderson , in time for the local elections and mid-term polls in Scotland and Wales .
" People in the country want a change , " he added .
Conservative leader David Cameron said the government was " in meltdown " , while Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell added that Mr Blair " should either resign or state a date " .
We all knew it was a matter of " when " not " if " , but it 's surprising to see that it had to happen this way .

The Motorola sponsored Spring Racing Carnival in Melbourne is due to have a special guest â€ “ Superman star Kate Bosworth .
After filming Superman in Sydney , another visit back to Australia interested the thin actress who will be the star attraction on Derby Day on November 4 .
And it will give her a chance to put hundreds of thousands of kilometers between her and Orlando Bloom after the pair split recently .
Though she has been seen with another man in New York – pictured left .
Other names were bandied about as potential star attractions , from Liv Tyler , Carmen Electra and Eva Herzigova .
The Spring Racing Carnival attracts big names to the city of Melbourne every year , with names like Eva Longoria and Paris and Nicky Hilton visiting for the races .
Esteemed Monks ,
Last week I participated in a gathering of 300 developers in Tokyo called the Lightweight Language Ring ( LLRing ) , held in a real boxing ring .
It included a number of famous Japanese programmers , the creator of Ruby , a bot shootout , language updates , a panel on functional programming , and more .
So I 'd like to invite you to read Boxing in the LLRing .
The first half of the 4500 word article is more accessible to non-experts while the second half gets into more nitty gritty .
Coverage of the Perl language update , bunches of Haskell and Javascript , a surprise announcement that Ruby 's Matz is going to go into hiding to work on Yet Another Ruby VM ( get that guy onto Parrot ! ! ) , and a mysterious connection between the naming of Ruby and Python , a talk at YAPC :: Asia 2006 Tokyo in March , and the location of the good humored " boxing match " ( The TCP / IP bot battle was in fact chaired by Shibuya Perl Mongers ) .
See also the photos on Flickr )
And finally I attempted a followup of the YAPC presentation on Babel - 17 , which was a comparison of Perl to Ruby to psychoactive scifi computing languages ...
But I do n't want to ruin the ending , please come over and take a look , and help me correct any mistakes !
Anyway seemed like a good reason to finally install a blog of my own .
Even though the number of languages and frameworks exceeds twenty , it is certainly about Perl and many issues thought about by monks , especially how languages change the way you think about problems .
The event site is all in Japanese , unlike the site for YAPC :: Asia , but I found it an interesting look at Japanese developers , and that it includes many of the Japan - side stars of the recent YAPC may be of interest to people who came all the way to Japan for it ( Larry , Damian and Ingie among others came in March ) .
Even though it is lengthy I do n't have anywhere in particular to post it besides PerlMonks , so if anyone has a good idea about that I 'd like as many people as possible to contribute to an English language discussion of some of the things that were covered at LLRing .
Especially now that Perl is advancing and Parrot and Pugs are on the rise , I hope you agree it is timely .
Looking forward to your comments !
Takahashi's YAPC perl - ruby comparison
by Anonymous Monk on Sep 08 , 2006 at 11:26 UTC
I say similar things about Takahashi's YAPC comparison of ruby with Babel - 17 ( http://www.rubycolor.org/takahashi/yapc2006) at http://use.perl.org/~mr_bean/journal/29899
It was difficult for me to tell how serious he was discouraging use of ruby because of its effects on thinking .
Perhaps this was my lack of understanding of the joke rather than the mythical / proverbial Japanese ambiguity .
( Oh , it was a joke ? )
I write about the Takahashi method at http://use.perl.org/~mr_bean/journal/29948
What is the minimum implication of the linking of the 2 major non-perl dynamic ' scripting ' languages with wrestling foreseen by Delany , if it is not a complete coincidence ?
That the Japanese organizers of LLRing also read Delany ?
What is the minimum implication of the linking of the 2 major non-perl dynamic languages , aside from the wrestling link , foreseen by Delany , if it is not a complete coincidence ?
That the accounts we have of the naming of those 2 languages is not completely correct ?
That the explanations we have of the naming underdetermines the naming process ?
Perhaps the 2 language creators are n't completely aware of why they named the languages the way they did , and the accounts they gave us are a rationalization .
I wonder if it is possible to find any other amazing links like this .
Search for close associations of the names of the 2 languages in non-computer contexts ?
I have my own example of an amazing coincidence with perl .
I had a student here in Taiwan who looked like Audrey Tang , but whose English name was Larry .
I thought ,
This student will go places .

( Curate ) on Sep 08 , 2006 at 16:30 UTC by mattr on Sep 08 , 2006 at 16:30 UTC Hi , and thanks for a great reply !
Seems
I get very few replies but they are all from great people and quite to the point .
I think you 're right on both your posts , though I could add that also Takahashi 's presentation format was quite enjoyable to me even though it is difficult to follow rapid fire Japanese , it seemed a pleasant mix of rap , humor and wit .
( All in good humor though perhaps there should have been a * very * lengthy English translation below the few kanji , which would have been more useful and even funnier . )
That , and also I think his technique was transmitted to other YAPC attendees who for some braindead reason vied to shave the amount of time left before their presentation to actually create the presentation .
Apparently Javascript and xul are quite handy here .
Probably happening at YAPC :: EU too ?
Okay , so taking your delightful post very seriously , of course you make it very hard by disallowing the possibility that it is a complete coincidence .
Also python and ruby seem to be very strong names , i.e. for snake and garnet .
And green and red go well together , and as I found on Google a python piece of jewelry is apt to have eyes made of rubies .
And cool names are running out .
Also , dragons love to hoard gems .
But I agree we must disallow coincidence , even if it is pushed bodily along by coginitive dissonance .
I would guess at a minimum , Ruby 's creator ( who also studied linguistics ) has read Babel - 17 twenty times and every time he sees the word Python he thinks of Ruby and Python in the null - grav wrestling sphere .
Two other points from the novel are that the fighters have made massive enhancements to their bodies , grafting things on , and the other thing is that they are apparently mostly hyperspace pilots , since the only way to control these hyperships is to plug enhanced humans who can react by instinct , or sexually bonded trios who can handle more complex jobs than any one or two people can .
No really , that is how the story goes .
So there are some wierd parallels to all the " lightweight languages " .
Um , and lightweight < = > lighter than air < = > null - grav ...
GONNNGGG !!
Ahem .
The minimum relation excluding the wrestling is I guess that he forgot about the wrestling part ..?
Well another is that maybe there is a cabal of elite intellectuals on a secret mission of world domination , flying from country to country to evangelize and share code , at popular conferences like YAPC and .. sshhh !
Depends on your level of paranoia and knowledge .
Another explanation that could also be seen as minimal , and which I wanted to alude to in my article , is like the self - organizing structures we are finding at the nanoscale level these days .
Did you read Carl Sagan 's Contact ?
There is a great image that is totally cut out of the movie with Jodie Foster , in which engineers have been following alien instructions to build things and one of the inexplicable things that happens is they are instructed to pour a chemical into a swimming pool , and a mind - numingly complex , semi-alive red bronchial thing is created ( added below FYI ) .
Maybe we are all working towards something and these kinds of mysterious things will happen more and more reguarly , until , ... until ...
Poof !
As the first factories were built and the first prototypes produced , pessimism diminished about human ability to reconstruct an alien technology from a Message written in no known language .
There was the heady feeling of arriving unprepared for a school test and finding that you can figure out the answers from your general education and your common sense .
As in all competently designed examinations , taking it was a learning experience .
All the first tests were passed :
The erbium was of adequate purity ; the pictured superstructure was left after the inorganic material was etched away by hydrofluoric acid ; the rotor spun up as advertised .
The Message flattered the scientists and engineers , critics said ; they were becoming caught up in the technology and losing sight of the dangers .
For the construction of one component , a particularly intricate set of organic chemical reactions was specified and the resulting product was introduced into a swimming pool - sized mixture of formaldehyde and aqueous ammonia .
The mass grew , differentiated , specialized , and then just sat there -- exquisitely more complex than anything like it humans knew how to build .
It had an intricately branched network of fine hollow tubes , through which perhaps some fluid was to circulate .
It was colloidal , pulpy , dark red .
It did not make copies of itself , but it was sufficiently biological to scare a great many people .
They repeated the procedure and produced something apparently identical .

Wikipedia has recorded its millionth registered user for its English - language website and anticipates a milestone double - whammy this week as the millionth article is published .
Users of the online encyclopaedia have been speculating on the date of the millionth posting since November 2004 , with some predicting it simply would n't happen .
" There simply are n't one million topics in existence , " said one Wikipedian , who looks likely to be proved wrong some time today .
Answering questions from the site 's users last week , Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales said the quality of content on the site would be improved with a new article review system .
He predicted the site 's content would change eventually as core subjects are covered more comprehensively .
" We 'll see a tapering off of new article creation in the large language Wikipedias as more and more ' verifiable ' topics are covered .
At this point , most changes will be expansions and updates and quality improvements to existing articles .
" But in 10 years , it seems likely to me that many languages which are now quite small will have very large Wikipedia projects .
Our community will continue to become more diverse as more and more people worldwide come online . "
Predictions for the date of the 2 millionth article , 5 millionth article and 500th language pool are also ongoing .
And in the event that Wikipedia goes under , the earth ends or the site is finally completed " with the sum total of all current and future human knowledge " , users have set up a last topic pool with suggestions including " Three easy steps to building your own nuclear weapon " , " Quantum black hole safety " and " How to delete the internet in one simple keystroke " .
The online encyclopaedia allows anyone to edit and contribute content and has become a powerful online presence since it launched in January 2001 .
The site recently blocked access from US Congressional computers - albeit temporarily - after what it described as " inappropriate edits " by staffers , although Mr Wales denied any evidence of " corporate astro- turfing " .
The credibility of the site came into question last December by the USA Today founding editorial director , John Seigenthaler , after he discovered a " false and malicious " entry that implicated him in the assassination of President John F Kennedy .
Wikipedia responded by strengthening its registration procedures so that new stories cannot be posted by anonymous posters , and by issuing a new policy on biographies of living people .

Microsoft 's Open XML specification , also headed for consideration by ISO / IEC , is still in process within Ecma .
Upon completion , it would be submitted to the same voting process .
With adoption of ODF by ISO / IEC now assured , software that implements the standard will now become more attractive to those European and other government purchasers for whom global adoption by ISO / IEC is either desirable , or required .
Given the ongoing unhappiness in Europe with Microsoft over what the EU regards as unacceptable bundling and other practices , this may be particularly significant , especially when taken with the desire of many European and other purchasers to use open source products whenever possible .
Offerings such as OpenOffice and KOffice therefore should receive a boost in appeal and usage , as well as for - sale versions , such as Sun 's StarOffice and IBM 's Internet - based offering .
The six month voting window for ISO / IEC adoption of the OASIS OpenDocument Format ( ODF ) standard closed on May 1 , and at midnight ( Geneva time ) last night it was announced internally that ODF had been approved by the ISO members eligible and interested in casting a vote .
The vote passed with broad participation and no negative votes ( there were a few abstentions ) , and ODF is now ISO / IEC 26300 .
While there are still some procedural steps internal to ISO / IEC that are required before the official text of the standard will be finalized and issued , these steps ( described below ) are formalities rather than gating factors .
The remaining formal steps for ODF adoption , as described by Patrick Durusau in a blog entry of mine on March 23 are below ( Patrick is the Chairman of the INCITS V1 committee that managed the voting on ODF by interested U.S. parties , and is the Project Editor for the OpenDocument Format submission ) :
The votes on those ballots are due on May 1 , 2006 .
The votes and any comments will be communicated to the appropriate parties in the ISO process .
Once the votes and comments have been distributed , a ballot resolution meeting will be held to resolve any comments and to determine the text of ODF that will be issued as an International Standard .
The scheduling of the ballot resolution was discussed in SC 34 ( a subcommittee of JTC1 ) and unfortunately the early discussion of a date for that meeting was based on a clerical error in reading the required time delay between the vote and the ballot resolution meeting .
The JTC 1 directives were drafted prior to the immediate communication afforded by email and sets a minimum period of two and one - half months between the distribution of the voting results ( including comments ) and a ballot resolution meeting if necessary .
The return date for votes and comments being May 1 , when considered with the JTC 1 rule on scheduling of a ballot resolution meeting * not less than * two and one - half months after distribution of the voting results ( including comments ) means that the original SC 34 discussion was based on an incorrect reading of the relevant JTC 1 directive .
Assuming agreement on the final text , which is the goal of the ballot resolution meeting , the Convener of the ballot resolution committee ( Martin Bryan ) and I ( as Project Editor ) have thirty ( 30 ) days to prepare the final report from the ballot resolution meeting and the final text of ODF to be published as an International Standard .
Those items are then distributed by the SC 34 Secretariat .
The ballot resolution meeting is most likely going to occur in early August to conform to the two and one - half month requirement .
Note that the scheduling of the ballot resolution meeting depends upon the date of the distribution of the voting results and so there is some uncertainty at this point on the exact dates for the ballot resolution meeting .
That is a clerical issue and not one of substance .
I am expecting that press releases will be issued by several organizations and others today , and will update this blog entry later in the day as those announcements become available .
Update : 10:00 EDT : From a press release issued at this hour by the ODF Alliance , the organization formed in March ( now with over 150 members ) to support and educate potential government adopters of ODF :
Washington , DC - The OpenDocument Format Alliance ( ODF Alliance ) , a broad cross-section of associations , academic institutions and industry dedicated to solving the problem of improving access and retrieval of electronic government documents , today congratulated the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) for its sweeping approval of the OpenDocument Format as an international standard .
" Approval of the OpenDocument Format by ISO marks an important milestone in the effort to help governments solve the very real problem of finding a better way to preserve , access and control their documents now and in the future , " said Marino Marcich , Executive Director of the ODF Alliance .
" There 's no doubt that this broad vote of support will serve as a springboard for adoption and use of ODF around the world .
At the same time , it also represents a milestone for the ODF Alliance , which in just weeks has seen a groundswell of support and continues to grow everyday . "

How bent spaghetti break B. Audoly , S. Neukirch
Bent dry spaghetti do not break in half but instead in three or more pieces .
With the aim to explain this surprising phenomenon , we studied a related problem , namely the dynamics of an elastic rod that is bent quasi-statically and then suddenly set free .
Counter - intuitively , we find that the mere release of the rod induces a stress increase .
The multiple breaking of bent rods , like dry spaghetti pasta , can then be understood as a cascade of releases ( loss of cohesion upon breakings ) followed by stress increases leading to new cracks .

Tridelna dokumentarna serija v prepletu antropologije , znanosti in zgodovine raziskuje nastanek in razvoj družbenih omrežij ter njihov vpliv na naša življenja .
3 . del : Vojna v svetu omrežij Tretji del serije se posveča vprašanju , ali bo naslednja svetovna vojna v resnici hladna vojna s kitajskimi omrežji .
Velika kitajska tehnološka podjetja so v zadnjih letih ne le dohitela ameriške tekmece , ampak jih v mnogočem že prekašajo .
Toda medtem ko je na zahodu državni nadzor družbenih omrežij nekaj nezaslišanega , je na Kitajskem povsem sprejemljiv .
Tako deluje na primer sistem merjenja družbenega ugleda , ki kitajskim državljanom prišteva in od števa točke glede na njihovo vedênje , kršitelje predpisov pa javno sramoti .
Videli bomo tudi , kako so se ruski uporabniki družbenih omrežij vmešali v ameriško predsedniško kampanjo leta 2016 in kako so morali ameriški vojaki v Iraku prilagoditi taktiko omrežno organiziranim nasprotnikom .
The latest in a recent spate of cellphone videos documenting questionable arrest tactics surfaced Wednesday , this one showing a UCLA police officer using a Taser to stun a student who allegedly refused to leave the campus library .
Grainy video of the Tuesday night incident at UCLA ’s Powell Library was broadcast Wednesday on TV news and the Internet , prompting a review of the officers ’ actions and outrage among students at the Westwood campus .
For the record : For The Record
Los Angeles Times Friday November 17 , 2006 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 2 National Desk 2 inches ; 78 words Type of Material : Correction
Taser incident :
An article in Thursday ’s California section about UCLA student Mostafa Tabatabainejad being stunned with a Taser gun by campus police officers incorrectly quoted an article in the Daily Bruin , the campus newspaper .
The Times article said : “ The video shows Tabatabainejad yelling , ‘ Here ’s your Patriot Act , here ’s your use of power . ’ ” What he actually said , according to the Daily Bruin , was , “ Here ’s your Patriot Act , here ’s your ... abuse of power . ”
The ellipsis indicates a profanity .
The footage showed the student , Mostafa Tabatabainejad , falling to the ground and crying out in pain as officers stunned him .
According to a campus police report , the incident began when community service officers , who serve as guards at the library , began their nightly routine of checking to make sure everyone using the library after 11 p.m. is a student or otherwise authorized to be there .

Campus officials said the long - standing policy was adopted to ensure students ’ safety .
When Tabatabainejad , 23 , refused to provide his ID to the community service officer , the officer told him he would have to show it or leave the library , the report said .
After repeated requests , the officer left and returned with campus police , who asked Tabatabainejad to leave “ multiple times , ” according to a statement by the UCLA Police Department .
“ He continued to refuse , ” the statement said .
“ As the officers attempted to escort him out , he went limp and continued to refuse to cooperate with officers or leave the building . ”

Witnesses disputed that account , saying that when campus police arrived , Tabatabainejad had begun to walk toward the door with his backpack .
When an officer approached him and grabbed his arm , the witnesses said , Tabatabainejad told the officer to let go , yelling “ Get off me ” several times .
“ Tabatabainejad encouraged library patrons to join his resistance , ” police said .
“ The officers deemed it necessary to use the Taser . ”
Officers stunned Tabatabainejad , causing him to fall to the floor .
The video shows Tabatabainejad yelling , “ Here ’s your Patriot Act , here ’s your use of power , ” the Daily Bruin reported , adding he used a profanity .

“ It was beyond grotesque , ” said UCLA graduate David Remesnitsky of Los Angeles , who witnessed the incident .
“ By the end they took him over the stairs , lifted him up and Tasered him on his rear end .
It seemed like it was inappropriately placed .
The Tasering was so unnecessary and they just kept doing it . ”
Campus police confirmed that Tabatabainejad was stunned “ multiple ” times .
By then , Remesnitsky said , a crowd of 50 or 60 had gathered and were shouting at the officers to stop and demanding their names and badge numbers .
Remesnitsky said officers told him to leave or he would be Tasered .

Tabatabainejad declined to comment .
He was arrested Tuesday night and cited by campus police for resisting and obstructing a police officer and was released .
The incident was the third videotape of an arrest to surface in the last week in Los Angeles .
One video showed a Los Angeles Police Department officer dousing a handcuffed suspect in the face with pepper spray as the suspect sat in a patrol car .
That video came to light Monday , just days after the LAPD and the FBI launched investigations into another videotape showing a police officer hitting a suspect in the face several times after a foot chase in Hollywood .

UCLA Assistant Police Chief Jeff Young said Wednesday that he had viewed the video of the campus incident on the Internet and would view any other videos that were shot .
“ We will gather as many samples as we can find , from different sources , ” Young said .
“ We ’ll use it for our own administrative investigation . ”
UCLA Acting Chancellor Norman Abrams said in a statement that university police are investigating the incident and the officers ’ actions .
“ The investigation and review will be thorough , vigorous and fair , ” he said , adding that compliance with the ID policy is “ critical for the safety and well - being of everyone . ”

Young said Tasers , which discharge an electric current to incapacitate a suspect , are seldom used by the campus police department .
On campus Wednesday , many students said they were surprised by news of the incident .
“ UCLA is a very peaceful campus , ” said Chen Mei , a third - year political science student from Laguna Hills .
“ I study in Powell Library at night all the time .
I ’ve seen people without ID cards who are removed .
But none of the time has it been this dramatic . ”
Karen Jou , a second - year student from Orange , said the campus police “ usually are really good . ”
Advertisement
“ I would n’t have thought that would have happened here , ” she said .
“ It ’s really odd . ”
Julia Newbold , a third - year English literature major from Walnut Creek , said her impression from her limited contact with campus police was good .
“ They seem like a peacekeeping force , ” she said .
“ I ’m really surprised to hear they had to resort to something like that .
It sounds a little too forceful to me to Taser someone . ”

THE instant Derek Paravicini heard the sound of the music , he broke free from his parents ' grasp and headed towards it .
The little girl on the piano stool took a tumble as the then four - year - old boy , blind , autistic and severely learning impaired , pushed her out of the way and began playing in her place .
" It was utterly extraordinary , " says Adam Ockleford .
" He was hitting the notes with his hands , his feet , his nose , even his elbows .
It was clear he had never had a lesson , yet he produced this wonderful version of Do n't Cry For Me Argentina . "
Mr Ockleford , a music psychologist and then head of music at Linden Lodge School for the blind and intellectually impaired , realised at once that the child frantically bashing keys was a prodigy .
Today , at 27 , Paravicini is acknowledged as one of only 23 autistic savants in the world .
He is one of those rare people with severe learning difficulties , who is a genius in one particular area .

Hop.js : a multitier JavaScript
Hop.js ( aka Hop ) is :
A multitier JavaScript : a single code runs on the client and the server .
A compliant JavaScript implementation : EcmaScript 5.1 compliant ; EcmaScript 6 features ( modules , async / await , proxy objects , ... ) ; Nodejs compatibility .
An extended JavaScript : builtin HTML : native HTML syntax support and multitier dom .
server - side web workers .
native websockets .
A builtin multi- threaded web server .
Note : Hop also supports the Scheme programming language .
With Hop.js , JavaScript and Scheme are fully interoperable and applications can mix both languages .
This page mostly describes the JavaScript layer .
The Scheme layer is described in a dedicated programming manual .
Hop programs execute in the context of a builtin web server .
They define services , which are super JavaScript functions that get automatically invoked when HTTP requests are received .
Functions and services are almost syntactically similar but the latter are defined using the service keyword :
service hello ( ) { return " hello world " ; }
To run this program put this code in the file hello and execute :
$ hop -p 8080 hello.js
You can now browse http://localhost:8080/hop/hello .
Hop extends JavaScript with the geniune HTML .
if we want to modify our service to make it return an HTML document , we can use :
service hello ( ) { return < html > < div > hello world </div > </html > ; }
Hop is multitier .
That is client - side codes are also implemented in Hop .
The ~{ mark switches from server - side context to client - side context :
service hello ( ) { return < html > < div onclick = ~ { alert ( " world " ) } > hello </div > </html > ; }
Hop client - side code and server - side can also be mixed using the ${ mark :
service hello ( { name : who } ) { return < html > < div onclick = ~ { alert ( " Hi " + $ { who } + " ! " ) } > hello </div > </html > ; }
By default Hop.js only accepts to serve authenticated requests .
Before executing any programs users must be declared .
These declarations go into the $ HOME /.
config/hop/hoprc.js file .
The following declare a user named hopjs whose password is inria and that is allowed to execute any Hop.js service , the declaration services : " * " , and download any file readable from the server process , the declaration directories : " * " :
$ mkdir -p $ HOME /. config / hop && cat >
$ HOME/.config/hop/hoprc.js << EOF hop = require ( " hop " ) ; var user = require ( hop.user ) ; var config = require ( hop.config ) ; user.add ( { name : " hopjs " , password : user.encryptPassword( " hopjs " , " inria " ) , services : " * " , directories : " * " } ) ; user.add ( { name : " anonymous " , password : user.encryptPassword( " hopjs " , " 23^73 ++_* " ) , services : " " , directories : " " } ) ; EOF
You are now ready to execute Hop.js programs !
Many more additional examples can be found in the source development tree .
The foundation has started briefing officials at City Hall , in the office of Gov. George E. Pataki and at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , which owns the land .
A person involved in meetings about the memorial provided The New York Times with a copy of a confidential foundation memorandum , dated May 2 , that summarizes the Bovis findings .
Even before the official release of the new estimate , Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that he had spoken to both Governor Pataki and Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey about the escalating costs .
" Both governors and I think that $ 500 million is the amount of money that they 're going to have to learn to figure out how to deal with , " the mayor said .
" We want to build the memorial , but we have to realize that there are conflicting demands in this city . "
John P. Cahill , Mr. Pataki's chief of staff , who is overseeing rebuilding at the trade center , issued a statement yesterday saying , " We remain committed to the creation of a prominent , powerful and moving memorial that our nation can be proud of .
Generations to come will come to see this tribute .
However , we must ensure that it is financially achievable , while remaining consistent " with the original vision .
The report estimates the cost of just the memorial and its related museum at $ 672 million , up 36 percent from $ 494 million only four months ago .
In addition , the latest projections include $ 71.5 million for an underground cooling plant , up from $ 41.5 million four months ago .
Bovis also identified $ 300 million in site preparations and infrastructure — nearly triple the previous $ 110 million estimate by the foundation , the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the Port Authority — that would be necessary before construction could begin .
It contends that the Port Authority must deliver a " buildable site " and should bear those costs .
The authority will almost certainly contest that assertion .
Last month it agreed to provide $ 100 million , based on the prior estimate , as part of a major realignment of the plans to build four major office towers on the site .
It also took on financial responsibility for the troubled $ 2 billion Freedom Tower .
Yesterday , some state and Port Authority officials expressed misgivings about the validity of the jump in infrastructure costs , but said that they did not want to say so publicly until they had been briefed .
J.F. had a pretty good idea of what he was getting himself in to .
And considering his other options -- remain unemployed , work at his father 's glass company , or spend another two years at the university getting another degree -- this was actually his dream opportunity .
The year was 2002 and the technology boom had officially come to an end .
As a graduate fresh out of college , JF did n't even have a fighting chance .
Practically everyone in I.T. was out of work and was willing to take just about any job to pay the bills : senior - level developers were lining up in droves for junior - level positions ; juniors were going after all the entry - level jobs ; and the entry - level folks like J.F. were struggling to find any type of job that had any resemblance to technology .
That said , imagine J.F.'s excitement when he landed an interview for a tech support position at a software development firm .
Now try to imagine his reaction when , halfway through the interview , The Boss said :
" So you know how to program and stuff , eh ?
You know , now that I think about it , I could really use another programmer .
Can you start tomorrow ?
I think J.F. 's reaction was somewhere between holy - crap - an - actual - programming - job - in - the - post - tech - boom and wait - a - minute - he - did n't - even - ask - a - single - programming - question .
But no matter , J.F. could n't pass up the opportunity and accepted the offer .
He was officially a programmer .
Within his first hour of employment , J.F. realized that this business was n't quite like the businesses he learned about in school .
Or like the businesses portrayed on television .
Or , really , like any other business out there .
Despite being a commercial office building , The Boss took up residency in a corner of the third floor .
He had a shower , bed , dresser , and all of the other living amenities one would need to live in an office building .
More strangely , he would " work from home " some days , presumably to save the dreaded commute to his second - floor office .
Some days , The Boss would call himself the Managing Director .
Other days , he was the Vice President of Sales .
Every now and then , he'd be The Owner .
But The Boss wanted a new role -- Lead Developer -- and hired J.F. to help transition him into this role .
Being as new as he was , J.F. had absolutely no idea that this was The Boss 's intention .
For the first few weeks ,
The Boss would chat with J.F. and ask very basic development questions for " curiosity 's sake " :
How do you connect to source control ?
How do you add a field to a form ?
How do you connect to the database ?
How do you create a build of the software ?
It all seemed very innocent until J.F. arrived at work one day to find customers literally screaming at the help desk staff about bugs in the new version of their software and developers scrambling to figure out what they were talking about .
The customers seemed to have a version of the software that did n't exist and was installed earlier that morning by an unknown developer .
And that was when J.F. realized what he had created : the new Lead Developer .
The developers spent the entire day fixing the mess with a series of emergency fixes and an eventual rollback to the production version .
All the while , no one had any idea where The Boss was , other than " out of town on Business . "
They found out the next morning .
He was five hundred miles away , on a customer site , and had just sold them a new module that he had developed on the spot .
It was the developers ' job to fix it and make it work properly .
The cycle continued almost every month for the next three years :
The Boss would head out to a client site , sell a module that did n't exist , develop it in the hotel room at night , install it the next day , and let the customer work with the developers to get it working .
And actually , it 's probably still continuing to this very day , but J.F. was finally able to make a break after three long years .
He reports that he's now working with a very professional team of analysts , programmers , and management ; none of whom seem to be living in the floor above .
Der US - Amerikaner Daniel Wallace ist vor einem Bezirksgericht im US - Bundesstaat Indiana mit seiner Klage gegen die Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) – Autor der GNU General Public License ( GPL ) – gescheitert .
Er hatte moniert , die durch die GPL mögliche kostenlose Verfügbarkeit von Softwarekopien sei gleichbedeutend mit Preisabsprachen , die in Paragraph 1 des Sherman Antitrust
Act untersagt würden .
Wallace klagte im Juni 2005 auf Unterlassung ( PDF - Datei ) , da die GPL die Möglichkeiten für andere Entwickler mindere , mit eigenen Betriebssystemen auf dem Softwaremarkt konkurrieren zu können .
Diese Klage wurde bereits im November vorigen Jahres abgewiesen , woraufhin Wallace sie ergänzte .
Diese Ergänzung wurde nun von Richter John Daniel Tinder ebenfalls abgewiesen ( PDF - Datei ) .
Tinder konnte in den Vorbringungen des Klägers keinen generellen Verstoß gegen den Sherman Act erkennen .
Vielmehr schreibt er in seiner Begründung , die GPL begünstige den freien Wettbewerb und die Distribution von Computer - Betriebssystemen , was sich auf die Verbraucher durch niedrigere Preise , besseren Zugang und mehr Innovation auswirke .
Der Richter konnte zwar Wallace ' Argument nachvollziehen , er als Individuum habe Probleme , auf dem Softwaremarkt
Fuß zu fassen , doch habe er nicht nachweisen können , dass sich die GPL schädlich auf den Markt als solches auswirke .
Es gebe ein " potenzielles Problem " , eine Kartellrechtsverletzung festzustellen , wenn die Interessen des Klägers von denen der Konsumenten divergieren , heißt es in der Begründung der Entscheidung weiter .
Der Sherman
Act sei aber installiert worden , um den Verbrauchern die Vorteile der Preis - Konkurrenz zu sichern .
Da Wallace Preisabsprachen zwischen der FSF und IBM , Novell und Red Hat unterstellt , hat er auch gegen die drei Unternehmen Klagen laufen .
