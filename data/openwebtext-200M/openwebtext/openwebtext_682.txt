However , EDMOs are complex and lengthy , and so far only a few hundred have started .
About 20 went as far as the " interim order " stage before owners stepped in and reclaimed properties , and only three have resulted in a final order .
" The EDMO legislation has not resulted in thousands of empty properties being seized , as was first anticipated , " Mr Ireland says .
" But where it has been enforced it has acted as a lever to encourage landlords to take responsibility for the empty properties they own . "

The International Monetary Fund may soon lack the money to bail out an ever growing list of countries crumbling across Eastern Europe , Latin America , Africa , and parts of Asia , raising concerns that it will have to tap taxpayers in Western countries for a capital infusion or resort to the nuclear option of printing its own money .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The Fund is already close to committing a quarter of its $ 200 bn ( £ 130 bn ) reserve chest , with a loans to Iceland ( $ 2bn ) , Ukraine ( $ 16.5 bn ) , and talks underway with Pakistan ( $ 14.5bn ) , Hungary ( $ 10bn ) , as well as Belarus and Serbia .
Neil Schering , emerging market strategist at Capital Economics , said the IMF ’s work in the great arc of countries from the Baltic states to Turkey is only just beginning .
“ When you tot up the countries across the region with external funding needs , you get to $ 500bn or $ 600 bn very quickly , and that blows the IMF out of the water .
The Fund may soon have to start calling on the West for additional funds , ” he said .
Brad Setser , an expert on capital flows at the Council for Foreign Relations , said Russia , Mexico , Brazil and India have together spent $ 75bn of their reserves defending their currencies this month , and South Korea is grappling with a serious banking crisis .

The New School In Exile
The original idea of the University in Exile , and the New School in general , was to be a safe - haven for academic freedom and scholarship free of oppressive political regimes , and to be a center for critical engagement with important issues of our times .
It was known for its deep thinkers , its innovative academics , and its commitment to social and political justice as a bedrock of all other scholarship .
This is a call for student action !

11-60903 SYSTEM VERSION PRODUCT VERSION COMPONENT SOFTWARE : VAX / VMS V3.2 VAX / VMS V3.2 Run-Time Library PROBLEM : The LIB$DAY Run-Time Library service " incorrectly " assumes the year 2000 is a leap year .
RESPONSE : Thank you for your forward - looking SPR .
Various system services , such as SYS$ASCTIM assume that the year 2000 will be a leap year .
Although one can never be sure of what will happen at some future time , there is strong historical precedent for presuming that the present Gregorian calendar will still be in affect by the year 2000 .
Since we also hope that VMS will still be around by then , we have chosen to adhere to these precedents .
The purpose of a calendar is to reckon time in advance , to show how many days have to elapse until a certain event takes place in the future , such as the harvest or the release of VMS V4 .
The earliest calendars , naturally , were crude and tended to be based upon the seasons or the lunar cycle .
The calendar of the Assyrians , for example , was based upon the phases of the moon .
They knew that a lunation ( the time from one full moon to the next ) was 29 1 / 2 days long , so their lunar year had a duration of 364 days .
This fell short of the solar year by about 11 days .
( The exact time for the solar year is approximately 365 days , 5 hours , 48 minutes , and 46 seconds . )
After 3 years , such a lunar calendar would be off by a whole month , so the Assyrians added an extra month from time to time to keep their calendar in synchronization with the seasons .
The best approximation that was possible in antiquity was a 19 - year period , with 7 of these 19 years having 13 months ( leap months ) .
This scheme was adopted as the basis for the religious calendar used by the Jews .
( The Arabs also used this calendar until Mohammed forbade shifting from 12 months to 13 months . )
When Rome emerged as a world power , the difficulties of making a calendar were well known , but the Romans complicated their lives because of their superstition that even numbers were unlucky .
Hence their months were 29 or 31 days long , with the exception of February , which had 28 days .
Every second year , the Roman calendar included an extra month called Mercedonius of 22 or 23 days to keep up with the solar year .
Even this algorithm was very poor , so that in 45 BC , Caesar , advised by the astronomer Sosigenes , ordered a sweeping reform .
By imperial decree , one year was made 445 days long to bring the calendar back in step with the seasons .
The new calendar , similar to the one we now use was called the Julian calendar ( named after Julius Caesar ) .
It 's months were 30 or 31 days in length and every fourth year was made a leap year ( having 366 days ) .
Caesar also decreed that the year would start with the first of January , not the vernal equinox in late March .
Caesar 's year was 11 1/2 minutes short of the calculations recommended by Sosigenes and eventually the date of the vernal equinox began to drift .
Roger Bacon became alarmed and sent a note to Pope Clement IV , who apparently was not impressed .
Pope Sixtus IV later became convinced that another reform was needed and called the German astronomer , Regiomontanus , to Rome to advise him .
Unfortunately , Regiomontanus died of the plague shortly thereafter and the plans died as well .
In 1545 , the Council of Trent authorized Pope Gregory XIII to reform the calendar once more .
Most of the mathematical work was done by Father Christopher Clavius , S.J.
The immediate correction that was adopted was that Thursday , October 4 , 1582 was to be the last day of the Julian calendar .
The next day was Friday , with the date of October 15 .
For long range accuracy , a formula suggested by the Vatican librarian Aloysius Giglio was adopted .
It said that every fourth year is a leap year except for century years that are not divisible by 400 .
Thus 1700 , 1800 and 1900 would not be leap years , but 2000 would be a leap year since 2000 is divisible by 400 .
This rule eliminates 3 leap years every 4 centuries , making the calendar sufficiently correct for most ordinary purposes .
This calendar is known as the Gregorian calendar and is the one that we now use today .
( It is interesting to note that in 1582 , all the Protestant princes ignored the papal decree and so many countries continued to use the Julian calendar until either 1698 or 1752 .
In Russia , it needed the revolution to introduce the Gregorian calendar in 1918 . )
This explains why VMS chooses to treat the year 2000 as a leap year .
Despite the great accuracy of the Gregorian calendar , it still falls behind very slightly every few years .
If you are very concerned about this problem , we suggest that you tune in short wave radio station WWV , which broadcasts official time signals for use in the United States .
About once every 3 years , they declare a leap second at which time you should be careful to adjust your system clock .
If you have trouble picking up their signals , we suggest you purchase an atomic clock ( not manufactured by Digital and not a VAX option at this time ) .

First Review of Will Ferrell 's Broadway Bush Spoof
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Gunmen broke into the house of a women 's rights activist in the volatile northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk on Thursday and beheaded her , police said .
Iraqi Interior Ministry troops conduct inspections at a checkpoint in the southern Iraqi city of Basra in May .
The victim was identified as Nahla Hussain , the leader of the women 's league of the Kurdish Communist Party .
She was alone in the house at the time of her death .
It is not known what the circumstances were that led to the attack .
Violence against women has been an ongoing problem in Iraq .
The killing comes ahead of next month 's provincial elections , a post - Saddam era watershed event that 's generating an uptick in civil unrest and political infighting .
Twenty - four officers from the interior and defense ministries were arrested this week accused of facilitating the activities of former Baathist regime members , the Iraqi prime minister 's media spokesman said Thursday .
The arrests appear to have been politically motivated , a senior U.S. military official told CNN Thursday .
The official said Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki is believed to be behind the arrests .
Iraqi Interior Ministry officials said the detained officers have links to the al - Awda party , an underground successor to Saddam Hussein 's Baath party , .
The Baathist movement ruled Iraq for 35 years but was banned after Hussein was overthrown in the 2003 U.S. - led invasion of Iraq .
The arrests , which were made inside and outside ministerial offices , were carried out by an elite force that reports directly to al - Maliki , according to an Interior Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity .
Al - Maliki 's media spokesman , Yasseen Majeed , denied that report and said the arrests were made by Iraqi security forces acting on judicial arrest warrants .
Majeed , al - Maliki 's military office , and Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta , spokesman for the Baghdad Operations Command told Iraqi State TV that reports of a planned coup are incorrect .
Majeed said the arrests were precautionary measures .
He said investigations are continuing into the suspects , who are accused of facilitating the activities of " terrorists " and " outlaws . "
Initial reports listed arrest tolls that ranged from 20s to the 30s and said the arrested were all from the Interior Ministry , which oversees policing , border enforcement and internal security .
The ministry has been criticized by Iraqi and U.S. officials for inefficiency , corruption and infiltration by Shiite militia groups during the Sunni-Shiite violence in 2006 and 2007 .
According to the Interior Ministry 's spokesman , Maj. Gen. Abdul Karim Khalaf , the highest - ranking person taken into custody was a brigadier general , and the others were low - ranking officers .
He said 23 officers were detained and judicial authorities were questioning them .
The Interior Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity said at least 32 ministry employees were arrested between Monday and Wednesday .
That official had no information on the reasons behind the arrests .
He said at least two generals were among the arrested , and identified one as Gen. Ahmed Taha Abu Ragheef , head of the ministry 's Internal Affairs Department .
Khalaf said Ragheef was not among those arrested , and Ragheef himself appeared on state TV to issue a denial .
He said he took part in the investigation that led to the action .
It is not yet clear how many Sunnis and Shiites were arrested in the case , but Saddamists tend to be Sunnis .
Al - Maliki is a Shiite , and the government is dominated by a Shiite bloc , called the United Iraqi Alliance , and a Kurdish bloc .
One knowledgeable Iraqi politician told CNN he believes this and other discord at present in Iraq , such as attacks , arrests and political infighting , stems from internal conflicts between political parties ahead of the January 31 provincial elections .
The voting -- to be held in 14 of Iraq 's 18 provinces -- has been much anticipated by U.S. and Iraqi officials , who hope the election of local government officials can empower grass - roots Iraqis and give alienated Sunni Arabs more political clout .
Sunnis , who had more power under Saddam than they do now , feel they have been marginalized in Iraq 's new political system , where the majority Shiite population and the Kurds have emerged as powers .
Elections wo n't be held in Tameem province , where political disputes in the city of Kirkuk have yet to be resolved , and in the three Kurdish autonomous region provinces .
As for the Interior Ministry , a September 2007 report assessing the status of Iraq 's security forces slammed it and the National Police , which it operates .
The report by the Independent Commission on Security Forces in Iraq , called Interior " a ministry in name only " and said it was " widely regarded as being dysfunctional and sectarian , and suffers from ineffective leadership . "
It said the National Police force has been " operationally ineffective " and " sectarianism in its units undermines its ability to provide security ; the force is not viable in its current form .
The National Police should be disbanded and reorganized . "
The Defense Ministry oversees the military .
The 2007 report had promising words for the Iraqi army , special forces , navy and air force , describing them as " increasingly effective " and " capable of assuming greater responsibility for the internal security of Iraq . "
CNN 's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report .

The Ukrainian currency has slumped in recent weeks The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) is to offer a $ 16.5 bn ( £ 10.4 bn ) loan to Ukraine and has agreed an as yet undisclosed package with Hungary .
Ukraine is to receive the loan to help it " maintain confidence and economic and financial stability " , the IMF said .
The country has seen its stocks , banks and currency badly shaken by the global credit crunch .
The " substantial financing package " for Hungary is due to be finalised in the next few days , the IMF said .
It is conditional upon Hungary adopting " strong policies " and will be drawn from the IMF , the EU , and some individual European governments " together with regional and other multilateral institutions " , IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss - Kahn said in a statement .
" The policies Hungary envisages justify an exceptional level of access to fund resources , " he added .
Ukraine and Hungary are trapped in the vice of the last phase of deleveraging , or the reduction in credit being provided by banks and other investors , and the decline in the real economy
Robert Peston
BBC Business Editor
Read Robert 's blog Hungary 's daunting debt mountain
The BBC's Sarah Morris in Washington says this suggests the loan is likely to be one of the biggest the IMF has ever made .
Hungary 's currency , the forint , has seen a sharp fall , stocks have tumbled and the country has cut its growth forecast for 2009 .
Currency plunge Internal political turmoil has delayed economic development in Ukraine and the IMF loan depends on the ex-Soviet state being able to balance its budget and make reforms to its banking sector .
Last week , the IMF said it was to give Iceland a £ 2.1 bn loan as its banking system came close to collapse .
Pakistan and Belarus are also in talks about accessing IMF funding .
" The authorities ' programme is intended to support Ukraine 's return to economic and financial stability , by addressing financial sector liquidity and solvency problems , by smoothing the adjustment to large external shocks and by reducing inflation , " said Mr Strauss - Kahn .
" At the same time , it will guard against a deep output decline by insulating household and corporations to the extent possible . "
Easy credit and a property boom have seen Ukraine 's capital Kiev expand rapidly but the global downturn has seen investors and those willing to offer loans withdraw .
Ukraine also relies heavily on steel , but prices have collapsed and its currency , the hryvnia , has fallen sharply in the past two weeks .

COMMENTARY :
A Scottish judge recently bent the law to benefit a polygamous household .
The case involved a Muslim male who drove 64 miles per hour in a 30 mph zone - usually grounds for an automatic loss of one ’s driving license .
The defendant ’s lawyer explained his client ’s need to speed : “ He has one wife in Motherwell and another in Glasgow and sleeps with one one night and stays with the other the next on an alternate basis .
Without his driving license he would be unable to do this on a regular basis . ”
Sympathetic to the polygamist ’s plight , the judge permitted him to retain his license .
Monogamy , this ruling suggests , long a foundation of Western civilization , is silently eroding under the challenge of Islamic law .
Should current trends continue , polygamy could soon be commonplace .
Since the 1950s , Muslim populations have grown in Western Europe and North America via immigration and conversion ; with their presence has grown the Islamic form of polygyny ( one man married to more than one woman ) .
Estimates find 2,000 or more British polygamous men , 14,000 - 20,000 harems in Italy , 30,000 harems in France , and 50,000 - 100,000 polygamists in the United States .
Some imams openly acknowledge conducting polygamous marriage ceremonies : Khalil Chami reports he is asked almost weekly to conduct such ceremonies in Sydney .
Aly Hindy reports having “ blessed ” more than 30 such nuptials in Toronto .
Social acceptance is also growing .
Academics justify it , while politicians blithely meet with polygamists or declare Westerners should “ find a way to live with it ” and journalists describe polygamy with empathy , sympathy and compassion .
Islamists argue polygamy ’s virtues and call for its official recognition .
Polygamy has made key legal advances in 2008 .
( For fuller details , see my blog , “ Harems Accepted in the West . ” )
At least six Western jurisdictions now permit harems on the condition that these were contracted in jurisdictions where polygamy is legal , including India and Muslim - majority countries from Indonesia to Saudi Arabia to Morocco .
— United Kingdom : Bigamy is punishable by up to seven years in jail but the law recognizes harems already formed in polygamy - tolerant countries .
The Department of Work and Pensions pays couples up to 92.80 pounds ( $ 140 ) a week in social benefits , and each multiculturally named “ additional spouse ” receives 33.65 pounds .
The Treasury states .
“ Where a man and a woman are married under a law which permits polygamy , and either of them has an additional spouse , the Tax Credits ( Polygamous Marriages ) Regulations 2003 allow them to claim tax credits as a polygamous unit . ”
Additionally , harems may be eligible for additional housing benefits to reflect their need for larger properties .
— The Netherlands : Dutch Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin has announced that polygamous Muslim marriages should not be dealt with through the legal system but via dialogue .
— Belgium : The Constitutional Court took steps to ease the reunification of harems formed outside the country .
— Italy : A court in Bologna allowed a Muslim male immigrant to bring the mothers of his two children into the country on the grounds that the polygamous marriages had been legally contracted .
— Australia : The Australian newspaper reports “ it is illegal to enter into a polygamous marriage .
But the federal government , like Britain , recognizes relationships that have been legally recognized overseas , including polygamous marriages .
This allows second wives and children to claim welfare and benefits . ”
— Ontario , Canada : Canadian law calls for polygamy to be punished by a prison term but the Ontario Family Law Act accepts “ a marriage that is actually or potentially polygamous , if it was celebrated in a jurisdiction whose system of law recognizes it as valid . ”
Thus , for the cost of two airplane tickets , Muslims potentially can evade Western laws .
( One wonders when Mormons will also wake to this gambit . )
Rare countries ( such as Ireland ) still reject harems ; generally , as David Rusin of Islamist Watch notes , “ governments tend to look the other way as the conjugal mores of seventh - century Arabia … take root in our backyards . ”
At a time when Western marriage norms are already under challenge , Muslims are testing legal loopholes and even seeking taxpayer support for multiple brides .
This development has vast significance : Just as the concept of one man , one woman marriage has shaped the West ’s economic , cultural and political development , the advance of Islamic law ( Shariah ) will profoundly change life as we know it .

Bob Barr is like Rodney Dangerfield – can't get no respect .
If you recall , I wrote about Mr Barr and his troubles in Texas , where he was the only candidate to meet the filing deadline to be included on the ballot for president .
A quick recap .
According to Chapter 192 of the Texas Election Code , all nominees for President of the United States of America are required to turn in the following at least 70 days before the general election :
( A ) the names of the party 's nominees for president and vice - president ; and
( B ) the names and residence addresses of presidential elector candidates nominated by the party , in a number equal to the number of presidential electors that federal law allocates to this state ;
The magic date was August 25 , 2008 , but Obama did n't provide his until August 28th , McCain on September 4th .
But they were still certified by the Secretary of State .
So , Bob Barr filed a writ of mandamus with the Supreme Court of Texas , trying to force the SoS to follow the law and remove the Democratic and Republican candidates from the ballot .
The Supreme Court simply denied the writ , with no explanation – but no explanation was needed .
This is a two - party duopoly , and while third parties have to jump through hoops to get on a ballot , the elites are there somehow by birthright .
So , fast forward to today , when reason magazine 's Radley Balko reports that Bob Barr lost his lawsuit to be included on the Louisiana ballot , after having missed the deadline .
There was a slight difference , though .
While McCain and Obama missed the deadline because of elitist indifference , Bob Barr missed the deadline in Louisiana because of a hurricaine .
You see , the filing deadline was September 2nd , but the state offices in Louisiana were closed that week due to Hurricaine Gustav .
Now , can anyone still tell me with a straight face that there is n't a double standard in this country when it comes to ballot access for third party candidates ?

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
These are uneasy times for America ’s Muslims , caught in a backwash from a presidential election campaign where the false notion that Barack Obama is Muslim has been seized on by some who link Islam with terrorism .

The Democratic White House candidate , who would be the first black U.S. president and whose middle name is Hussein , is a Christian .
Son of a Kenyan father and white American mother , he spent part of his childhood in largely Muslim Indonesia .
The idea Obama is Muslim has circulated on the Internet for months , presented by some as a fact to reinforce the position that Obama is not a suitable candidate for the White House .
Not since the election of John Kennedy as the first Catholic U.S. president in 1960 has the faith of a White House hopeful generated so much distortion , said about 100 “ concerned scholars ” and others who have signed an October 7 proclamation aimed at countering Islamophobia they say is on the rise .
In recent weeks :
-- More than 20 million video disc copies of a film called “ Obsession : Radical Islam ’s War Against the West ” were included as advertising supplements in newspapers across the country , many in battleground states where Obama is in a close fight with Republican candidate John McCain .
The film , distributed by a private group unaffiliated with the McCain campaign , features suicide bombers , children being trained with guns , and a Christian church said to have been defiled by Muslims .
-- A city council candidate in Irvine , California , who is a Muslim convert , said he got a telephone call saying “ I want to cut your head off just like all the other Muslims deserve , ” the Los Angeles Times reported .
-- A mosque in a suburb of Chicago , Obama ’s home city , was vandalized four times in less than two months , with anti-Islamic messages left on its outer walls , and windows and doors broken .
--
An account of an Ohio rally for McCain running mate Sarah Palin , filed by Al Jazeera and posted on YouTube , shows a woman saying “ he is not Christian , and this is a Christian nation , ” and a second woman saying she opposes Obama because of “ the whole Muslim thing .
A lot of people have forgotten about 9/11 ( the September 11 , 2001 , attacks ) .
It ’s a little unnerving . ”
“ It is frightening to see at this point the label ‘ Arab ’ or ‘ Muslim ’ being used de facto as an insult , ” said Ahmed Rehab , executive director of the Chicago office of the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( C.A.I.R ) .
There is a feeling , he said , that hate crimes increase as Islamophobia rises in public discourse , including that going on peripherally in this election campaign .
Former Secretary of State Colin Powell , a Republican crossing party lines to endorse Obama on Sunday , made a demand for tolerance when he referred to Obama - is - a - Muslim rumors .
“ Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country ? ” he asked on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”
“ The answer ’s no , that ’s not America .
Is there something wrong with some seven - year - old Muslim - American kid believing that he or she could be president ?
Yet I have heard senior members of my own party drop the suggestion ‘ he ’s a Muslim and he might be associated with terrorists . ’
This is not the way we should be doing it in America , ” Powell said , while making clear such sentiment was not coming from McCain himself .
Muslims make up less than 1 percent of the U.S. population of 305 million , according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life , though some believe that number is low .
About a third of the world ’s population is Christian , another 21 percent Muslim .
Daniel Varisco , anthropology chair at Hofstra University , said he wrote the “ statement of concerned scholars ” after seeing Islamophobia on the rise .
“ The attempts to label Senator Obama a terrorist or rhyme his name with Osama ( bin Laden ) or accent his middle name ( Hussein ) , as well as false claims about his being sworn into ( U.S. Senate ) office on a Koran , demonstrate how near to the surface anti-Islamic sentiment is in the United States , ” he said .
Circulating such falsehoods “ avoids playing the race card directly but at the expense of Muslims , ” he said .
The Clarion Fund , which distributed the film “ Obsession , ” through a huge newspaper advertising buy , says it is an independent education group focused “ on the most urgent threat of radical Islam ” and that placing the film in the hands of readers in battleground election states was an attempt to grab attention .
Spokesman Gregory Ross said , “ we have no political or religious affiliations to any group whatsoever . ”
The Islamic Circle of North America has meanwhile opened an offensive of sorts -- a campaign promoting Islam and seeking converts .
It said it placed advertising signs inside 1,000 cars in New York ’s subway network .
In Chicago the group had a number of city buses adorned top to bottom with pro-Islam advertising , headlined “ Islam : The Way of Life of Noah , Abraham , Moses , Jesus and Muhammad . ”
Rehab of the Chicago C.A.I.R. office said that kind of approach may work to a limited degree , “ but really the crux of the issue is not learning about the details of a religion but rather interacting with and understanding that the average Muslim is no different than yourself . ”
Drive north of Kabul for an hour , turn left into a grey desert and head east for fifteen minutes , the sand shawling up the side of the windows until an armed man in the uniform of the Iranian police stops you before a forbidding compound of watchtowers , mud walls and razor wire .
For a brief moment , that willing suspension of disbelief - I can see the inmates sitting on the sand beyond the iron gate – I forget that this is an Afghan movie set , and that Daoud Wahab , the producer of ' The White Rock ' is sitting in front of me .
" Looks real , huh ? " he asks over his shoulder .
It does .
For incredibly , as Afghanistan sinks back into the anarchy which became its natural state these past 29 years , Afghan film - makers are producing movies of international quality , turning out pictures which prove – even amid war – that a country 's tragedy can be imaginatively recreated for its people .
Safaid Sang – Dari ( Persian ) for White Rock – was an Afghan refugee detention camp inside Iran whose Iranian guards helped to massacre more than 630 of their prisoners in 1998 after inmates protested at their treatment .
The atrocity – largely unknown in the West – ended after two Iranian helicopters strafed the Afghans with machine guns .
Quite a story .
Quite a movie .
" I 'm really hoping for something big for this , " Wahab says as he eases himself into the producer 's folding canvas chair inside the prison gate .
" We built all the mud walls , bought the razor wire , constructed the concrete lavatories – we even made fake shit to put all over the floor – and I found a real Iranian flag in the ' souk ' in Kabul . "
It snaps above us now in the desert wind , the silken split - onion symbol of the Islamic Republic between red and green , the banner fringed with gold .
The guards even speak with the right accent because some are half - Iranian .
At least one of the actors was himself a prisoner in the real camp .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Afghan actors squat beside an inner fence of wire , pleading with family visitors for help while the ' guards ' , immaculately dressed in near - perfect Iranian uniforms – Wahab and director Zubair Farghand searched the internet for photographs which showed cap badges and insignia of rank – shout abuse at their charges .
One young man with an American rifle – the real Iranian police do indeed have US weapons – walks up to a ' prisoner ' and kicks him brutally in the back , pulling out a cosh and bashing him on the legs .
" I think he enjoys beating these people – he 's grown into the part , " Wahab says sharply .
He paid £ 30 for each of the 64 refugee tents to be sewn and patched together in the bazaar .
They are a distressing backdrop to the White Rock camp where the dust and wind bleach out the colour of the landscape , even the great mountains that shoulder their way across the landscape , the foothills of the Panshir Valley .
The movie , of course , is called ' The White Rock ' .
But unkind thoughts move through my mind .
When the Third Reich was collapsing , did n't Goebbels produce an epic movie about Frederick the Great to boost the morale of German troops ?
And – while I made sure that Daoud Wahab did n't take offence at the Hitler parallel – was n't there a certain irony that his film was being shot scarcely three miles from the vast American base where Afghans prisoners are held in their hundreds , even as we sit in this desert today , and where US personnel have sadistically tortured – perhaps still do torture – their inmates .
Why not make a film about this far more contemporary violence ?
" If we get a chance in the future , I 'm sure we will , " Wahab says – I am not entirely convinced by this – " and there will come a time .
But we do n't need problems from the Americans now .
Yes , there is a prison in Baghram , and there is mistreatment there , but now we are completing this earlier piece of history .
We 've told the Americans we are making this film here , just in case they wonder why there 's another ' prison ' in the area . "
On cue , a US chopper comes thundering over the desert and a C - 130 transport sails high above us in the yellow , sand - coloured sun .
" A part of Iranian society had a madness towards the Afghans , " Wahab says .
" There were social , economic problems at the time .
There was a lot of prejudice against Afghans because the refugees provided cheap labour in Iran and contractors therefore preferred Afghan labour rather than Iranians .
When the refugees started complaining about their bad treatment , something snapped .
But can you blame the Afghans for protesting ?
Iran had taken tens of thousands of refugees fleeing first the Russians .
then the ' mujahedin ' and then the Taliban -- but these prisoners even had to rent boots to walk in the faeces encrusted on the floor of the camp latrines .
When they found prisoners gambling at night , each of the Afghans was given a hundred lashes by the Iranian police . "
A camera moves through the prisoners on a ' dolly ' – a small railway track – while another is hoisted above them by crane .
This is real movie - making , even if the entire budget is only Pounds Sterling 34,000 .
Homayoun Paiz sits down beside me , ' blood ' seeping through a wad of bandages wrapped round his filthy , bearded face .
?
I am the hero , " he announces .
And , I ask – I want my suspicions confirmed – does he die at the end of the film .
" Of course , " Paiz says .
" In the helicopter attack . "
We have met before , in the days after the overthrow of the Taliban , when Afghanistan 's surviving film community found that the gunmen of the most obscurantist militia in the world had bulldozed a pit in Kabul and used it to burn every foot of film they could find .
Paiz 's his friends hid original Afghan movies and archive documentary footage , letting the Taliban cremate old Russian and Indian films of which there were copies in Moscow and Mumbai .
One of the ' old guard ' directors , Siddiq Barmaq , is now himself a leading film - maker and has confronted the US occupation of his country today .
His new film , ' Opium Fields ' , tells the story of two American soldiers who try to escape the country in an old Russian tank – only to find an Afghan family living inside the wreck .
The movie has just won the Critics Award at the Rome International Film Festival .
In all , 630 Afghan prisoners – women as well as men -- are believed to have died in the original camp massacre , which lasted for six hours .
Some of the prisoners managed to escape and hid in the mountains .
Daoud Azimi was one of them and plays an Iranian police guard in the film .
What does it feel like to wear the uniform of his oppressors ?
" I feel good , " he says , " because I can actually show the world what they did . "
We drive back to the broken highway to the east .
An American convoy races past us at speed , four - by - fours with blacked - out windows guarded by Humvees , US troops hunched over machine - guns on the roof .
Daoud Wahab has plenty of material for his next film .
No doubt Homayoun Paiz will play the hero .
And die at the end .

Conclusion Introduction Back To Top ]
Before the Ajax appears , JavaScript is rarely utilized in the traditional Web applications , and under most circumstances developers have to face up to procedure - oriented programming .
So , real advanced JavaScript developers are also rare .
But nowadays , with the share of the rich client Web applications becoming larger and larger , the role of JavaScript is becoming more and more outstanding and important .
How to the reuse the existing JavaScript code and deal with the changing of requirements becomes the urgent problem that every JavaScript developer has to take into account .
The popular design patterns put forward by GoF ( Erich Gamma , Richard Helm , Ralph Johnson , and John M. Vlissides ) are welcomed by developers all over the world .
As for the JavaScript field , these design patterns applies in the similar way .
In this article I will show you how to apply the six popular design patterns from GoF to the JavaScript programming area by related samples .
Now , let us delve into these interesting patterns one - by - one .
Working with the Singleton Pattern Back To Top ]
First of all , let us look at how the simplest yet commonly - used pattern , the Singleton pattern , is achieved in JavaScript .
( 1 ) Concept
As a very fundamental and important pattern , the Singleton pattern is used to guarantee that there is one and only one instance for a given class , and provide an overall point to visit it .
Under a lot of practical circumstances , you usually need to insure there is one and only one instance related to a specified class .
For this , traditional languages often resort to embedding a static variable in the class definition , setting up this variable in the first instance and making corresponding verifications whenever using the constructor of the instance .
That is to say , no matter how many instantiations you have established , the static variable only relates to one instance .
To prevent from instantiating a class more than one time , you need to declare the constructor function as private type , so that you can only establish the instance in the static method .
In the JavaScript language , although we still can specify a static method to construct an object , because we cannot make use of the " private " characteristic of the constructor function to forbid creating more than one instances , it is not as simple as that imagined to completely carry out the Singleton pattern .
( 2 ) Example Assume that we want to create an object which serves as a tool helper , including no business logic and any data required to be changed .
Obviously , when you use such an object you do not need to instantiate the class each time -- one and only instance is enough for global invocation .
According to the analysis above , we can use JavaScript code ( Listing 1 ) to carry out the Singleton pattern .
This can insure there is one and only one instance relating to a given class , and provide an overall site to access it .
Listing 1 : Establish the Singleton pattern in the JavaScript function Singleton ( ) { this .
property 1=” hello ” ; this.methodl=function(x , y ) { return x+y ; } //define a static property Singleton._instance_=null； Singleton.getInstance=function ( ) { if ( this._instance_==null ) { // if there is no instance for class Singleton , then create one this._instance_=new Singleton ( ) ; } //return the instance of class Singleton return this .
_instance_ ; } ;
The getInstance method first judges whether the static property Singleton .
_instance_ is null .
If so , then it sets up an instance of the Singleton object and stores it in property Singleton .
_instance_ .
Finally , the Singleton .
_instance_ property is returned .
As for the usage of the Singleton class , it is easy : Listing 2 // return only one instance var instA = Singleton.getInstance ( ) ;
Regrettably , the above code cannot prevent a user from instantiating the Singleton class directly .
For example , it is still OK to set up an instance of the Singleton class through the following sentence .
Listing 3 var instA =new Singleton ( ) ;
And later on , it is also valid to make the following invocations .
Listing 4 alert ( typeof ( instA ) ) ; alert ( instA.property1 ) ;
Therefore , we need a further modification with the definition of the Singleton structure so that you can only instantiate the Singleton class in the Singleton .
getInstance method .
Please look at the following solution .
Listing 5 function Singleton ( ) { if ( Singleton.caller!=Singleton.getInstance ) { throw new Error ( ” Can not new Singleton instance ! ” ) ; } …… ( omitted ) } Now , whenever the user tries to establish several instances , an exception is thrown out .
However , it still feels some awkward , does n't it ?
But anyway , we have already used the above - mentioned solution to achieve our initial purpose -- creating one and only instance of a given class .
Next , we start to discuss the third method ( also a second to none method ) .
This kind of method skillfully makes use of JavaScript 's support toward " anonymous " function to indirectly achieve the target of forbidding the access to the constructor function of class Singleton , which preferably imitates the characteristic of private constructor function and perfectly solves the problem that JavaScript carries out the Singleton pattern .
Listing 6 below shows this kind of best solution .
Listing 6 : with the help of " anonymous " function to implement the Singleton pattern in JavaScript < script type = " text / javascript " > ( function ( ) {
//SingletonFactory Interface SingletonFactory = { getInstance : getInstance } // private classes function SingletonObject ( ) { SingletonObject.prototype.methodA = function ( ) { alert ( ' methodA ' ) ; } SingletonObject.prototype.methodB = function ( ) { alert ( ' methodB ' ) ; } SingletonObject.instance = this ; } //SingletonFactory implementions function getInstance ( ) { if ( SingletonObject.instance == null ) return new SingletonObject ( ) ; else return SingletonObject.instance ; } } ) ( ) ; var instA = null ; try { alert ( " Try to create an instance using new SingletonObject ( ) ! " ) ; instA = new SingletonObject ( ) ; } catch(e ) { alert ( " You cannot access the constructor of SingletonObject externally ! " ) ; } //create the target instance with the help of the // static method from the Factory instA = SingletonFactory.getInstance ( ) ; var instB = SingletonFactory.getInstance ( ) ; instA.methodA ( ) ; instB.methodA ( ) ; alert ( instA == instB ) ; //OK </ script >
Ha , the third solution finally finds out a way to it by digging into the ability of " poor " JavaScript , but finally obtains decent effect .
Working with the Factory Method Pattern Back To Top ]
First of all , let us look at the definition of the Factory Method pattern .
( 1 ) Concept According to the GoF 's definition , the purpose of the Factory Method pattern is to define an interface to create objects , while it is the sub classes ' responsibility to decide which class to instantiate .
More accurately , the Factory Method pattern transfers the responsibility of creating instantiations to the factory class , and makes use of the abstract principle to delay the instantiation behavior to concrete factories .
( 2 ) Example Under some conditions , we really cannot make sure the object to establish corresponds to which class ' instantiation .
Such a typical example is to establish the XMLHttpRequest ( XHR ) object in the Ajax applications , because everyone knows the implementation of the XHR object is different in different browsers .
With the help of the Factory Method pattern , we can easily establish the generally - used XHR object in JavaScript .
The corresponding code of such an implementation is as follows .
Listing 7 function XMLHttpFactory ( ) {} XMLHttpFactorv.CreateXMLHttp=function ( ) { if ( typeof XMLHttpRequest !=” undefined ” ) { // for browsers ( such as Firefox ) that support the XMLHttpRequest object return new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; } else if ( typeof window .
ActiveXObject !=” undefined ” ) { // for browsers ( such as IE ) that support // the ActiveX object return new ActiveXObject ( “ MSXML2.XMLHttp ” ) ; } } Then , using the following code you can easily judge the type of the target browser and then establish the proper XHR object . var xmlhttp=XMLHttpFactory.createXMLHttp( ) ；
Henceforth , you can carry out the server - side invocation in your Ajax styled applications according to the XHR object established above .
Working with the Decorator Pattern Back To Top ]
First of all , let us , as usual , look at the definition of the Decorator pattern .
( 1 ) Concept
The Decorator pattern is one of the seven Structural patterns which are concerned with how classes and objects are composed of larger structures ( the other six Structural patterns are Proxy , Bridge , Composite , Flyweight , Adapter , Façade , respectively ) .
The Decorator pattern makes full use of the advantages of inheritance and aggregation , whose main purpose is to attach new state and behavior to a ready - made object dynamically while not modifying the original behaviors .
This can be compared to an adornment worker who is ready to decorate a wall of a new residence with colorful pigment .
( 2 ) Example Interesting thing is that we can apply the Decorator pattern to the Aspect Oriented Programming ( AOP ) in the JavaScript scenario .
Author 's Note : Aspect - oriented programming , AOP in short , is a new means of method to improve the existing pattern and discover new ones .
According to Wikipedia , aspect - oriented programming ( AOP ) is a programming paradigm that increases modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns .
Separation of concerns entails breaking down a program into distinct parts ( so - called concerns , cohesive areas of functionality ) .
All programming paradigms support some level of grouping and encapsulation of concerns into separate , independent entities by providing new abstractions ( e.g. procedures , modules , classes , methods ) that can be used to represent these concerns .
But some concerns defy these forms of encapsulation and are called crosscutting concerns because they " cut across " multiple abstractions in a program .
Next , let us look at the code shown in Listing 8 below .
Listing 8 : Use the Decorator pattern to achieve AOP in JavaScript function Decorator ( object ) { object.setup=function( method ) { // if never execute the Setup method , then make initialization if ( !(‘ _’+ method in object ) ) {
//reserve the existing methods object [‘_’+ method]=object[method ] ; //initialize the lists for before and after advice respectively object [ ‘ beforeAdvice_ ’+ method ] = [ ] ; object [ ‘ afterAdvice_’+method ] =[ ] ; // override the < span class = Bold > method </ span > method object [ method ] =function ( ) {
//establish the before advice list var before=this [ ‘ beforeAdvice_ ’+ method ] ; // establish the after advice list var after=this [ ‘ afterAdvice_ ’+ method ] ; //used to hold the returned value var ret ; // invoke the functions in the before advice for ( var i=0 ; i< before.
length ; i++) { before [ i].call ( this , arguments ) ; } // invoke the initial functions ret=this [ ‘_’ + method ] ( arguments ) ; // invoke the functions in the after advice for ( var i= ; i< after . 1ength ; i++) { after [ i].call ( this , arguments ) ; } //return the value of the initial method return ret ; } } } ; //attach the before advice object.addBeforeAdvice=function ( method , f ) { object.setup( method ) ; // the last before advice attached will be invoked first object [ ‘ beforeAdvice_ ’ + method].unshift(f ) ; } ; // attach the after advice object .addAfterAdvice=function ( method , f ) { object .
Setup ( method ) ; // the last after advice attached will be invoked first object [ ‘ afterAdvice_ ’ + method ] .
push(f ) ; } ; } The basic idea behind the Decorator function above is to substitute the original function for a now one and in the one add invocations to the before and after functions .
Below is a concrete example to explain the usage of the Decorator function .
For convenience , we should first define a class named testClass .
Listing 9 var testClass = function ( ) { testClass.prototype.pl=”hello ” ; testClass.prototype.ml =function ( ) { alert ( this .
p1 ) ; } } ;
If you wish to place before or after notifications upon all the instantiations of class testClass , then you need to do some processing with the testClass .
prototype attribute .
Listing 10 Decorator( testClass.prototype ) ; testClass.prototype.addBeforeAdvice(“ m1 ” , function ( ) { alert ( “ beforeAdvice ” ) ; } ) ; testClass.prototype.addAfterAdvice(“ m1 ” , function ( ) { alert ( ” afterAdvice ” ) ; } ) ;
At this time , if you create an instantiation of class testClass and invoke its ml method , then the application will output strings " beforeAdvice , " " hello , " and " afterAdvice " in order .
Listing 11 var t＝new testClass ( ) ； //output ' beforeAdvice ' , 'hello ' , 'afterAdvice ' t.ml ( ) ;
If you only want to place before or after notifications upon a specified instantiation of class testClass , then you can directly do with this instantiation , as shown below .
var t=new testClass ( ) ; Decorator(t ) ; t.addBeforeAdvice( “ ml ” , function ] ( ) { alert ( “ beforeAdvice ” ) ; } ) ; t.addAfterAdvice ( “ ml ” , function ( ) { alert ( “ afterAdvice ” ) ; } ) ;
That is it .
Working with the Observer Pattern Back To Top ]
As above , let us first look at the definition of the Observer pattern .
( 1 ) Concept
The Observer pattern defines a relationship between objects so that when one changes its state , all the others are notified accordingly .
Generally , you are suggested to consider leveraging the Observer pattern under the following conditions .
·
When an abstract model contains two parts , one depending on the other , you need to seal these twos independently in order to change and reuse them respectively and independently .
·
When you want to change an object then in the meantime you have to change other objects , but do not know how many objects need the related change .
·
When an object has to notify other objects , but it cannot suppose who the other objects are .
In other words , you do not hope that these objects are closely coupled .
( 2 ) Example Underneath , we are going to apply the Observer pattern to a simple yet typical JavaScript event handling mechanism .
First , we need to do some preparation , namely expanding the Array object with two methods ( i.e. index Of and removeAt below ) , as shown in Listing 12 .
Listing 12 - Expand the Array object // expand the properties of the destination object // , copy all the properties of the source object // , to the destination Object.extend=function ( destination , source ) { for ( property in source ) { destination [ property ] =source [ property ] ; } return destination ; } // expand the built - in Array object Object.extend ( Array.
prototype , { //retrieve the object in the array indexOf : function ( object ) { for ( var i=0,1ength=this.length ; i< length ; i++) if ( this [ i ] ==object ) return i ; return - 1 ; } , //remove the specified element in the array removeAt : function ( index ) { if ( index < 0 || index > =this.length ) return null ; switch ( index ) { case 0 : return this .
shift ( ) ； break ; case this .
length - 1 : return this .pop ( ) ; break ; default : var head=this.s1ice( 0 , index ) ; var tail=this.s1ice( index+1 ) ; var ele=this [ index ] ; this=head.concat( tail ) ; return ele ; break ; } } } ) ; Next , define two classes , i.e. Observer and Subject .
The code related to the Observer class is shown below : // the Observer class function Observer ( ) {} object.extend ( Observer.prototype , { //note that the later instantiation Observer will override this Update method Update : function ( ) { return ; } } ) ;
The code related to the Subject class is as follows .
Listing 13 // the Subject class function Subject ( ) {} Object.extend( Subject.prototype , { //an array of the Observer objects observers : [ ] , // notify per Observer object to execute the Update method notify : function ( context ) { for ( var i=0 ; i< this.observers.length ; i++) this.observers[i ] . Update ( context ) ; } , //add a new Observer addObserver: function ( observer ) { if(!observer .
Update ) throw new Error ( “ addObserver error ! ” ) ; this.observers.push( observer ) ; } , //delete the existing Observer removeObserver: function ( Observer ) { if(!observer .
Update ) throw new Error ( “ removeObserver error ! ” ) ; this.observers.removeAt(this.observers.indexOf(observer ) ) ; } , } ) ; OK , for now we have defined all the objects relating to the Observer pattern .
The following lists the steps to carry out the Observer pattern : · Establish an instantiation of the Subject class .
· Establish several instantiations of the Observer object , overriding their Update methods respectively .
· Subscribe all the Observer objects to the Subject object .
· Send out a notice through the Subject object , when the Observers objects are subscribed to the Subject object will execute their Update methods respectively .
·
If you need to cancel a certain Observer object 's subscription for the Subject object , you can invoke the removeObserver method .
Finally , we are to set up an example to show you the application of the Observer pattern , as well as the objects defined above .
First , Establish a Subject object and define a publishEvent method for it .
Listing 14 // Create a new Subject object var concreteSubject=new Subject ( ) ; // define a new publishEvent method with which to notify all the Observer of the related data concreteSubject.publishEvent=function ( data ) { document . write ( “ published : ” +data ) ; this .notify ( data ) ; } Then , establish two Observer objects ; overlay their Update methods respectively .
Listing 15 // create a new Subject object var concreteSubject=new Subject ( ) ; // define a new publishEvent method with which to notify all the Observer of the related data concreteSubject.publishEvent=function ( data ) ( document . write ( “ published : ” +data ) ; this.notify ( data ) ; } // Create a new Observer object and override its Update method var concreteObserverl=new Observer ( ) ; concreteObserverl.Update=function(data) { document.write(“ concreteObserverl received : ” +data ) ; } //subscribe concreteObserverl to concreteSubject concreteSubject.addObserver(concreteObserverl ) ; // create the second Observer object and override its Update method var concreteObserver2=new Observer ( ) ; concreteObserver2.Update=function(data) { document.write(“concreteObserver2 received : ” +data ) ; } //subscribe concreteObserver2 to concreteSubject concreteSubject.addObserver(concreteObserver2 ) ;
Now , let us carry out the publishEvent method of the concreteSubject object , sending out a notice .
Listing 16 concreteSubject.publishEvent(“ msg ” ) ;
At this time , the application will output the following .
Listing 17 published : msg concreteObserverl received : msg concreteObserver2 receired : msg
Such results proved that concreteObserverl and concreteObserver both received a notice from the concreteSubject object .
Next , you can use the removeObserver method to cancel a subscription for the concreteSubject object .
Listing 18 concreteSubject.removeObserver(concreteObserver2 ) ;
Again send out a notice : Listing 19 concreteSubject.publishEvent(“ msg ” ) ;
This time , only concreteObserver receives the notice and the application will output the following .
Listing 20 published : msg concreteObserver1 receired : msg Using the Observer pattern can implement the typical event mechanism in the JavaScript environment .
Those who are acquainted with the Ajax development may know of the two famous client - side Ajax frameworks -- Prototype and Dojo .
In fact , the two frameworks both adopt the similar means herein to introduce their respective event mechanisms .
Readers who have interests with this can study further .
Working with the Façade Pattern Back To Top ]
First of all , let us still look at the definition of the Façade pattern .
( 1 ) Concept The Façade pattern can define the homologous interfaces for a set of sub systems .
The true secrets behind the Façade pattern lies in that it can define a high - level interface with which to make all the sub systems more easily to use .
A typical illustration of the Façade pattern in developing Web applications is to implement a uniform API with which to remove the differences of various browsers in realizing the concrete characteristics .
Let us next still see a related example .
( 2 ) Example
In constructing the Ajax based Web applications , when we use the XHR object to request the server - side data , we usually utilize the following steps to code : · Create the XHR object .
· Register the related callback function .
·
Set the request mode ( POST or GET ) , URL , and pattern ( synchronously or asynchronously ) with the open method .
· Send out the request with the send method .
· Supervise the states of the request , and if the special request is met , then perform the specified function .
As you 've guessed here , using the XHR object is rather complicated , in each of the above steps you have to consider the browser - compatible related problems .
Below , we will show you the basic application of the Façade pattern through a simple example .
The target of the example is to output a line to welcome information hinting the browser type the current user is using .
For the sake of simplicity , we are only to distinguish the IE from other types of browsers in the example .
The key and related code is shown as follows : Listing 21 // IE function IEBrowser ( ) { this.hello=function ( ) { alert ( ” IE browser ” ) ; } } //Non-IE browser function NonIEBrowser ( ) ( this .hello =function ( ) { alert ( " Non - IE browser " ) ; } } // The Façade object var Facade={} ; Facade.hello=function ( ) { var browser ; // IE if ( window.ActiveXObject ) browser=new IEBrowser ( ) ; //Non-IE browser else browser=new NonIEBrowser ( ) ; Browser.hello( ) ; } ;
The " Facade.hello " method above establishes different browser objects according to the browser type and invokes the corresponding hello methods .
So , for the developers , they do not need to consider the browser type , but only focus on invoking the hello method of the Facade object .
Moreover , the IE browser and Non-IE browser are two types of independent classes , both of whose internal realizations may change in the future , but this will not influence the exterior object Facade to invoke them , namely the " Facade.hello " method related code does not need to be changed .
Working with the Command Pattern Back To Top ]
As usual , let us look at the definition of the Command Pattern .
( 1 ) Concept
The Command pattern encapsulates requests , invocations , or operations into an object .
In detail , the Command pattern allows the system to parameterize the clients using different claims , queuing up the requests , recording request records , etc .
The Command pattern can separate the responsibilities of issuing commands from those of executing commands , delegating them to the different objects .
( 2 ) Example
In this section , I will explain the application of Command pattern by dissecting the design idea of constructing a JavaScript based calculator application .
What first comes to my mind is to define the following Calculator object which includes four methods relating to the four arithmetic operations respectively .
Listing 22 var Calculator={ // addition add : function ( x , y ) { return x+y ; } , // subtraction substract : function( x , y ) { return x-y ; } , // multiplication multiply : function( x , y ) { return x*y ; } , // division divide : function ( x , y ) { return x/y ; } , } ; To be honest , based on the above Calculator object , we can carry out the four basic arithmetic operations by directly invoking the methods , such as " Calculator.add , " and " Calculator.substract , " etc .
In some circumstances , however , we do not expect to invoke the inner methods inside the Calculator object directly .
The reason for this is apparent : this will increase the dependencies among objects .
In another word , if the internal logics of the Calculator object change , then all the code scripts that carry out the calculations associated with the Calculator have to be modified in the meantime .
This , as you may imagine , will violate the principle advocated by OOP -- to loosely couple the objects as much as possible .
According to the design pattern related theories put forward by GoF , we can leverage the Command pattern to improve the above design .
Here , the basic idea of the Command pattern is : take any type of calculations as a request to the Calculator object , the contents of a request including the type of operation and the related operands .
Hence , using the code below you can get the result of the formula of " 1+2 . " Listing 23 Calculator.calc ( { type : " add " , // addition op1:1 , // the first operand is 1 op2:2 // the second operand is 2 } ) ;
According to the format above , we can conclude the definition for the " Calculator.calc " method as follows : Listing 24 Calculator.calc=function( command ) { return Calculator[command.type ](command.opl,command.op2 ) ; } ; Consequently , we can use the following four " Calculator.calc " methods to carry out each kind of above - mentioned operations .
Listing 25 Calculator.calc( {type : " add " , opl:1, op2:1} ) ; Calculator.calc({type : " Substract " , opl:6 , op2:2} ) ; Calculator.calc( {type : " multiply " , opl:5 , op2:2 ) ) ; Calculator.calc( {type : " divide " , opl:8 , op2:4 ) ) ; Conclusion Back To Top ]
The thought of Design Pattern based development has been put forward for quite a few years , but just caused the attention of the forefront developers in recent years , which can be proved with the numerous data from the Internet .
The various design patterns are based upon the object - oriented programming , so they are not easy to grasp .
As you may imagine , only through continuous software development practice can we finally apply various design patterns flexibly .
Design patterns are not any language specific , so equally apply in the JavaScript area , only with very few materials focusing on this aspect .
This article based upon common JavaScript examples on the client side and discussed six kinds of typical design patterns , i.e. Singleton , Factory Method , Decorator , Observer , Facade , and Command .

DOSE :
oral Mushrooms ( dried )
BODY WEIGHT : 150 lb
I 'm not sure why Im gonna type this , maybe its because I feel like I would n't be able to tell anyone .
Around 9:00 am me and my mom pick up my girlfriend and bring her over to my house in the woods .
I had done mushrooms several times before and this was her first time .
I had not done mushrooms for almost a year so it had been a while .
We started eating the mushrooms around 9:30 I started with an empty stomach .
Before I even finished the bag I was already beginning to feel uplifted .
The living room before me began to look like a long hallway .
About 5 minutes after I ate them my mom took everyone out of town ( there was about 3 people there including my brother and my mom was going to work . ) so it was me and my girlfriend home alone .
I thought perfect were gonna have sex soon .
She gets up and goes into my bedroom and I went to the bathroom to piss .
Then I went into my bedroom .
The lights were off so it was kind of dark .
I began to see patterns like dotted lines everywhere , everything was rounded ( there were no corners to anything ) .
I look at my girlfriend and shes lying on my bed with no pants on .
I said why arent you wearing pants ' she replied ' cuz im in a bed I dont feel like wearing pants .
I got into bed with her .
And took off my pants and we just lied there for a while .
Every minute the trip was getting more intense .
I could feel my brain pulsating .
I took the shirt off my girlfriend .
I looked at her chest and she seemed fake .
The skin looking and feeling like rubber .
I taped my fingers on her .
My fingers felt like stubby erasers .
I looked at my girlfriend and closed my eyes .
I could still see her perfectly with my eyes closed .
But when they were closed there were more hallucinations , more patterns and I had begun to see faces everywhere .
I told her that she was the most beautiful girl in the world .
And she would just smile .
I put my head under a blanket and saw her chest .
It was amazing there was a bright beam of white light coming from her .
It was really concentrated to a dot .
I looked at her and told her about it .
When I looked at her face the skin began to change colors from purple to orange to yellow .
That was the good part of my trip .
It had only been 15 minutes .
all of the sudden I started to cry .
I never cry .
I look at her and told her and she became worried .
I tried to kiss her and then I got dog hair on my tongue .
I tried to pick it off but it only became worse .
It infested my whole mouth and I couldnt get it out .
My stomach became upset .
I went into the kitchen and puked all over the floor .
My fingers were going numb .
I tried to drink some water still crying , my mouth went numb , I couldnt even tell I was drinking the water .
I became dizzy , my head pulsating hard I heard music playing in the background but there was no music I ran into the bathroom naked .
She ran with me we hugged in the bathroom for a while and I told her I loved her .
Still with the feeling of dog hair in my mouth I started to gag .
I literally stuck my head into the toilet and almost stuck my hand down my throat .
I was breathing really hard and almost felt like I was gonna pass out .
I shouted at my gird friend '
This is horrible !!!
We need help ! call someone .
I ran into the living room it was a miracle I found the phone .
I managed to dial my moms number .
When I looked at the screen there was almost 13 numbers that I had dialed even though I had only dialed 7 .
The phone was wiggling in my hand .
the buttons werent numbers .
they were odd syllables and faces .
The whole house had faces ... my mom answered the phone .
I was still crying ' hello ' ' mom help ...'' what happend ? ''
I puked .. I think im gonna pass out ... come home '' I coming right now 'I was still naked and crying .
Starting to tremble .
My body was going cold and I was sweating .
I wrapped myself in blankets but I was still cold .
The world around me was shaking .
Everywhere I looked there was faces .
I had begun to talk to my sweater ... I lied on my bed and just kept telling my girlfriend that I loved her . ' I dont want to die ...' my mom finally came home .
She wanted me to clean up .
Clean up !
I couldnt even fucking stand .
I told her to take us to the hospital .
She refused to .
She put on some music to try to calm us down .
The music was horrible and just raising tension .
I was still cold and shaking vigorously .
I was struggling to breath .
Along with my fingers and my mouth .
my arms and feet went numb .
I sat down on the couch the .
roof was laughing at me .
I prayed .
I started to have convulsions .
I had walked around in my own throw up so my feet were wet .
My face was covered in my own mucus .
Snot drool and tears .
I started to breath really slow .
Every breath took all my energy .
I closed my eyes .
I just wanted to wake up out of this .
My head thumping so hard it felt like someone was repeatedly shooting me with a shotgun .
I ran to a desk and found a marker and some newspaper .
I was sure I was gonna die .
This is what I wrote .' tell my girlfriend .. if I live that I love her ' 'tell my brother I love him to .
I love you mom 'I am a horrible person .
I was screaming at my mom . ' take us out of here take us to the hospital !!'
She said she was gonna get rid of us and drop us off at my dads .
Every 5 minutes seemed like an hour .
My girlfriend just kept trying to get a hold of her parents who were answering their phones .
she left a couple of messages ... My mom drove us to my dads house .
When I got there my bother was there watching tv .
I told him we need help .
He said to leave and go to the park because my dad was gonna be home soon .
Me and my girlfriend ran into my room .
I was convinced this was the last time I was gonnna see her .
I drew a smiley face on her stomach and gave her a hicky right next to it .
She was crying .
I pulled out a note book and wrote I love you on it .
I tore off the paper and handed it to her .
I told her to take it home with her .
Then I pulled out the guitar and started to play it .
I was just appreciating everything in life .
I looked at her .
and we realized how much we loved each other .
And decided that were getting married and gonna spend the rest of our lives together .
My brother came and told us to get out so we walked down the street to the park .
My mom called us there and said she was gonna take us to the beach .
So we were gonna wait there .
It was raining .
We didnt know what to do .
We were just standing in the parking lot staring at each other .
we looked toward the street and a person driving slowed down and stopped in the middle of the street and stared at us for a couple of minutes .
We decided being at the park wasnt a good idea so we were gonnna head back to my house .
We started to walk and then my girlfriend stopped and we turned around .
We walked in circles for a while not knowing what we were doing .
We finally made our way back to my house .
We sat for a while and my mom showed up .
She drove us to a restaurant and ordered dinner for her self .
We couldnt eat .
me and my girlfriend just got drinks and couldnt even drink them .
I was begging my mom to just let us sit in the car but she wouldnt let us .
so I said fine .
were gonna sit in front of the restaurant walk out and sit on the bench .
My girlfriend came out a little bit later .
We sat there and she cried .
her mom finally called her back and was gonna take her home .
My mom finally finished her dinner and we went to the car .
She took pictures of us and made a scene in front of the restaurant .
People were standing on the other side of the parking lot staring at us .
my girlfriend mom showed up and took her away .
Then my mom took me back to my house and I took a shower to help sober up .
I heard some weird noises in the shower and the floor of it had a face and it was laughing at me .
then there was no more hot water left and I just layed on the couch till I sobered upapparently we both overdosed .
We came very close to dieing .
I lost a lot of weight that day .
But it was an experience that bonded the both of us .
I decided to become a vegetarian .
I realized how much I loved being alive and felt that eating meat was like taking the lives of someone else .
I feel like I now know that there is an after life .
In his great Civil War history , " Decision in the West , " Albert Castel describes the last Confederate hope of victory .
If in 1864 the Confederate armies continue to exact a steep cost from the North , " the majority of Northerners will decide that going on with the war is not worth the financial and human cost and so will replace Lincoln and the Republicans with a Democratic president and Congress committed to stopping hostilities and instituting peace negotiations . "
He cites the resolution of the Confederate Congress that : " Brave and learned men in the North have spoken out against the usurpations and cruelties daily practiced ....
People magazine may have named Hugh Jackman as 2008 ’s “ Sexiest Man Alive , ” said Salon , but we disagree :
This year 's “ Sexiest Man Living ” goes to Robert Downey Jr .
He ’s made one of the greatest comebacks in Hollywood history , “ wears his age and experience like a badge of honor , and looks comfortable in his own gorgeous skin . ”
“ Booooooo - ring , ” said Josh Gillin in the St. Petersburg Times online .
“ We do n't read celebrity fluff ” for that kind of assessment .
“ Tell the ladies what they want to hear , Salon ” : That Robert Downey Jr. “ uses his six - pack abs to grate cheese for the omelet he cooks his wife Susan Levin every day for breakfast in bed before driving a Porsche to the orphanage to read the funnies to sick kids . ”
Salon is “ more cerebral ” than People , said Celebitchy .
They offer “ hotties for thinking women , ” so it makes sense that they chose the “ former trainwreck bad boy who managed to reboot his career and is now an unapologetic star . ”
In Salon ’s book , “ an educated do - gooder trumps a chiseled ” jerk any day .
But the “ hormone arbiters ” at People magazine “ only have eyes for Hugh , ” said Robert Kahn in Newsday online , and it makes sense : “ With his 6 - foot - 2 frame , seeming - disinterest in shaving on a daily basis and pecs - of - granite , Jackman is an obvious choice for the top accolade . ”
And his wife Deborra - Lee Furness says he ’s “ a romantic who sings ballads at home and makes pancakes for the couple 's children ” — sounds pretty sexy to us .

The information necessary to create a male is encoded in our DNA , but it takes all the institution of a culture to produce a man .
The male body is the biologically given " hardware , " the myth of manhood is the " software " inserted by society through a series of formal and informal rites of passage .
- - - Sandor McNab
The Women 's Movement , the Peace Movement , and the Industrial Revolution , all have made sweeping cultural changes that have gravely affected the lives of men , generally redefining " male " identity .
Some men have welcomed these changes and made the adjustment .
Others have actively resisted the forces intent upon redefining them .
In the wake of this cultural evolution , many men find themselves lost and confused , angry and alienated .
Most of the changes have come about so rapidly that orderly social adjustment has been impossible .
Cultures forced to abandon a tradition must replace it with a new tradition of equal value , or find expression of such loss in violent substitutes .
It is not surprising then , at a time when many men experience a loss of power , identity , self - worth and purpose , that we are witnessing an upsurge of crime , addiction , divorce , and chronic illness .
Proactive solutions are few , in part , because men are under organized , confused about what is happening , uninformed about their rights and their situation , or just resistant to change .
Even major men's organizations established to effect change , such as , Promise Keepers , The national Organization for Men Against Sexism , and New Warriors , receive little ongoing attention from the media , and have been ineffective at rallying many constituencies of the wider society .
The Men's Studies Program is designed to investigate , in a gender - specific manner , the many forces and issues affecting men in today 's society .
The mission of the program is to prepare and empower graduates to make far - reaching contributions in a variety of professional settings .
The program will explore the spiritual , cultural , social , familial , tonic , political , economic , historical , philosophical , medical and psychological aspects of " being male " in modern society .
This program will undertake to fill the knowledge gap in these areas by engaging students through course work , research , fieldwork , and self - examination .
We will strive to empower our students with the knowledge and capabilities needed to effectively manage the resulting changes in men's roles and responsibilities .
This program will help develop leaders and mentors who can work effectively and responsibly within the diversity of the men's movement , affecting social policy , and building a broader base of knowledge for the study and research of both genders .
The program is designed to serve the professional needs of social and political advocates , public and private policy makers , educators , therapists , personnel directors , ministers , human right 's advocates and EAP counselors .
This program focuses on the spiritual , cultural , social , familial , ethnic , political , economic , historical , philosophical , medical and psychological aspects of " being male " in our modern society .
Our aim is to develop leaders and mentors who can work effectively and responsibly within the diversity of the men's movement , affecting social policy , and building a broader base of knowledge for the study and research of both genders .

The difference between what drug companies tell the government and doctors suggests that they 're cooking the books , which could mislead doctors making prescriptions .
Of 33 new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2001 and 2002 , one - fifth of supporting clinical trials were not published in medical journals , according to a new study .
And those results that were published were often more positive than what companies presented to the FDA in their applications .
As a result , potentially unreliable data is being used to promote drugs on which billions of dollars and thousands of lives may ride .
" Some studies are n't published at all .
Then , when they are , there are little changes that make the papers look more favorable towards the product , " said review co-author Lisa Bero , a University of California , San Francisco health policy expert .
If new — and typically more expensive — drugs are only slightly better than existing drugs , but otherwise are comparable , this is largely an ethical and financial problem .
But if the drugs later prove harmful , the damage can be profound .
In 2004 , Merck 's blockbuster anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx was pulled from the market after killing an FDA - estimated 27,000 people .
The drug doubled heart attack risk — a side effect that critics say was glossed over in the company 's studies , which in retrospect were partly marketing propaganda .
Another Merck blockbuster , the cholesterol - lowering drug Vytorin , has proven ineffective .
GlaxoSmithKline 's best - selling diabetes drug Avandia was allowed to remain on the market , but only with a label stating its apparent cardiovascular risks .
None of those drugs were among the applications reviewed in by Bero , and her team reviewed only efficacy rather than safety data .
But the underlying problem was similar : Doctors and researchers who trusted in prestigious , peer - reviewed journals were given a false impression of the medicines .
" It 's more of the same , " said Arthur Levin , director of the nonprofit Center for Medical Consumers .
" It confirms that this is not an open , transparent process .
There is still the opportunity for sponsors of new products to try and tip the scales in their favor . "
Among the differences between results submitted to medical journals and to the FDA were trials that did n't favor a company 's product , Bero found .
Only half of 43 such outcomes were reported in the literature .
More subtly , but just as importantly , key pieces of trial data vanished .
" The main thing that jumped out at me was the addition and deletion of primary outcomes .
Those are the most important outcomes of a trial .
To find that one disappeared from a paper , or just appeared in a paper , is pretty amazing to me , " said Bero .
FDA spokeswoman Rita Chappelle stressed that the agency bases its decisions on application data , not medical literature .
Once a drug is approved , she said , the agency 's scientific review is made available to the public .
" This allows anyone to see what studies were done and what the results were , " she said .
But in a commentary accompanying Bero 's review , published yesterday in Public Library of Science Medicine , Mayo Clinic researcher
An - Wen Chan wrote that the content and availability of FDA releases " is variable , and sections are often redacted . "
Such information , agreed both Chappelle and Levin , is also harder for doctors to read than traditional journal articles .
However , even if the FDA makes application data available , and no changes are made to journal publications , the troublesome fact remains that commercially funded studies systematically favor their sponsors .
Bero calls for the FDA to be overhauled to run clinical studies itself , as is done by comparable agencies in Italy and Spain .
" The Italian FDA collects money from every drug company that sells drugs in Italy , pools that , and funds drug trials .
They fund the sort of head - to - head drug comparisons that companies do n't like to fund .
And they have independent people peer - reviewing the trials .
It 's a great model , " she said .
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association of America , the drug industry 's trade group , defended the current system in a prepared statement .
“ The critical information that health care providers need to make appropriate prescribing decisions are found in the Food and Drug
Administration - approved drug label , which synthesizes key details , including important drug safety information that may not be included in a published paper , " said senior vice president Ken Johnson .

A father of two who was paralysed after being viciously beaten in an unprovoked attack in a Co Down restaurant , has said he forgives the man who has left him in a wheelchair for life .
Joseph Nelson was hospitalised for six months and is still recuperating in a care home after the violent attack in December last year .
His attacker Alexander Moore , 37 , from Kilmood Church Road , Killinchy , pleaded guilty at Downpatrick Crown Court earlier this week to causing grievous bodily harm with intent in an incident in a Chinese restaurant in Killyleagh .
CCTV footage from inside the restaurant shows Moore punching Mr Nelson , 54 , knocking him to the ground and then standing on his neck .
Mr Moore is now a tetraplegic with steel rods in his neck holding his spinal column in place .
The Killyleagh man , however , said he does not hold any malice towards his attacker .
“ My life has been ruined so why should somebody else 's life be ruined ?
What has happened to me is awful but why should I spend my time feeling bitter ?
It would eat away at me .
I just have to get on with it , ” Mr Nelson told the Belfast Telegraph .
Mr Nelson was attacked when he called into the Chinese restaurant after a night out in Killyleagh last December .
While he was there he spotted Moore , whose father had just died , and went over to pass on his condolences .
The next thing Mr Nelson can remember is waking up in hospital .
“ I could n’t move and for some reason I could n’t breathe .
There were doctors everywhere and I did n’t know what was going on .
The police came and showed me CCTV footage of what happened but I could n’t believe I was looking at myself .
It is as if my mind has blanked it all out .
As far as I know it ( the attack ) was completely unprovoked .
I have no idea why he did it , ” he said .
Mr Nelson was in court this week to see Moore admit to violently attacking him .
He is due to be sentenced next month .
“ I am glad he pleaded guilty so I did n’t have to sit through a trial .
I do n’t want him to spend the rest of his life in jail for what he did to me .
I have a life sentence , but why should somebody else ’s life be ruined ?
Whatever sentence he gets I will still be like this .
I do n’t want him to spend the rest of his life in jail for what he did
“ My legs do n’t work , my hands do n’t work .
I ca n’t walk and I used to love going out for walks .
I was always very active .
But there is nothing else for it but to try and remain positive and get my life back together .
“ I am hoping to move back home to Killyleagh in the New Year .
My home is just being adapted at the minute for me .
All my family and friends are in Killyleagh and it will be nice to get some independence back , ” he said .
After the attack a number of people in Killyleagh organised events to buy an electronic chair for Mr Nelson .
“ I have had a lot of support and that helps keep me going .
I just get on with things the best I can , ” Mr Nelson added .
The attack on Mr Nelson is just one of a number of vicious assaults across the province that have sparked serious public concern over violent crime .
It emerged earlier this year that on average more than 600 violent crimes — including assaults , sex offences and robberies — are recorded by police every week .
The PSNI has insisted that violent offences across Northern Ireland are decreasing with recent police statistics showing that violent offences dropped by over 10 % in 11 months
Recently , Chief Constable Sir Hugh
Orde said that while he fully understands that these figures will be “ of cold comfort to victims of crime and their families ” , they do show “ the commitment of my officers and staff to making all communities safer ” .

The first safe haven for GLBT middle schoolers is set to open in Milwaukee .
A Dec. 17 article posted at the Web site of U.S. News and World Report said that the new school was approved by the Milwaukee Board of Education , and follows the establishment , four years ago , of the Alliance School , a Milwaukee high school that , like New York City ’s Harvey Milk School , is intended as a safe educational environment for GLBT students .
Like the Harvey Milk and Alliance high schools , the new middle school will also be open to straight students .
The article said that approval for the new , GLBT - safe middle school was unanimous , albeit via procedure rather than by vote : the issue was not advanced to a vote or tabled for further study , and so passed .
The school is expected to open next year ; applicants are able to sign up right away .
The move follows the failure , last fall , of a similar proposal for GLBT high school students in Chicago .
That plan , the article said , did not even make it to the school board , due to community opposition to a gay - safe school .

I got an interesting email this morning about the Chicago Blackhawks .
( Wait guys , that 's not a joke ! )
Advertisement
Last month , the Hawks had six straight road games sandwiched around the Thanksgiving holiday .
They went from Phoenix to Dallas to Toronto ( nice travel agent ) , then had three days off before heading out for a California swing .
That three - day break was their only chance to get home before the holiday , and the team had arranged for a commerical flight to take the players back to Chicago right after their game against the Leafs on Saturday night .
General Manager Dale Tallon was staying behind , to attend his father 's funeral in rural Ontario .
Take it away , crazy anonymous emailer .
This plane departs on schedule , but without a single member of the hockey team .
Back in the locker room a vote is taken after the game was complete , and a unanimous decision is made by this young team to skip this flight and stay one more day .
They make arrangements to check back in the hotel and on a frozen Sunday morning charter two buses that have no heat and begin a journey two hours straight north into a sparsely inhabited Canada , but where hockey is its passion .
They arrive at their destination to the surprise of the teams general manager who is there attending his fathers wake .
After a few emotional hours , this team boards the buses and heads back for a two - hour trip back to Toronto .
On the way they ask the drivers to stop in a tiny Canadian town because they are hungry .
To the shock of the patrons and workers at this small hockey town McDonald 's , a professional team walks out of two rickety buses and into the restaurant , which just happens to have pictures of two members of this team on its wall .
The patrons know every single one of these players by sight being Fanatic fans of hockey in these parts .
One can only imagine their amazement of the locals seeing and the entire professional hockey team sit down and have a meal in their tiny little town in the middle of a hockey season .
After a while they board the buses and catch their same flight 24 hours later , giving one day to their general manager .
Have I made this up , is this an excerpt from some fictional book ?
No .
This a true story of the Blackhawks last Saturday night and they decided to attend Dale Tallon 's fathers funeral .
It 's amazing that such a good story can be found nowhere on the internet , and not even mentioned in the Chicago papers .
Had one of the Blackhawks got into a fight and punched some drunken loser in a Toronto bar it would be plastered all over papers and the television .
This being said , its hard to imagine any professional football , basketball or baseball team doing this , but the members of the Blackhawks claim any " hockey " team would have done this .
This is one reason I continue to be a big hockey fan , and another reason I am excited about this Chicago team .
I thought I would share as this story appears to have gone unnoticed .

Still skeptical , I sent an email to Sarah Spain of Mouthpiece Sports , who has forgotten more about Chicago hockey than I care to remember .
Got a response from one of my contacts in the org .
This is a funny addition - it 's true that they took a bus up to his dad 's funeral — and afterwards they all went to McDonald 's where there were [ Patrick ] Kane and [ Jonathan ]
Toews trading cards in the happy meals .
I do n't think the unheated part was true , but yeah - these guys are all nice , which makes the job very easy .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Yeah , the unheated bus did seem like a bit much , did n't it ?
Was that embellishment really necessary ?
But it is a sweet story nonetheless , and it is shocking that more media outlets have n't picked up on it .
Do you know how much fuzzy , heart - tugging mileage SportsCenter could get out of this ?
Do n't even get me started on Costas .
Red State endorses Stevens ' opponent
Lamenting the possibility that a loss in Alaska by Sen .
Ted Stevens could pave the way to a 60 - seat Democratic majority in the Senate , the conservative blog RedState nevertheless endorsed his opponent Monday afternoon .
For good measure , the blog , never a fan of Stevens , threw Rep. Don Young ( R - Alaska ) on the reject pile , saying that both appropriators " have been a pox on the Republican house for too long - too addicted to the pork barrel , too fast and loose with ethics . "
Their post ...
We stand at a perilous moment in American politics , with the real possibility that the Democrats could get to 60 votes in the Senate .
This is no time for litmus tests of party loyalty , for abandoning our own .
But we must make one exception : good conscience compels us to advise Alaskans to vote for Mark Begich , the Democrat mayor of Anchorage , for the U.S. Senate .
And we also endorse Ethan Berkowitz for the at - large House seat in Alaska .
We have no illusions that Begich will be a good Senator ( although perhaps he can bring to DC some bipartisan oomph to the need to exploit Alaska 's energy resources for the good of the nation ) , or Berkowitz a good Congressman .
But Ted Stevens and Don Young have been a pox on the Republican house for too long - too addicted to the pork barrel , too fast and loose with ethics .
Stevens ' conviction in federal court today is the exclamation point on an era in Republican politics in general and Alaska politics in particular that needs to end ( and which Gov. Sarah Palin has been battling to clean up ) .
Republicans need to clean our own house .
Washington cannot too soon see the end of Stevens and Young .
UPDATE : RedState has retracted the outright endorsementafter apparent protest , but still opposes Stevens .
The blog editors write : " We have changed the title and amended the post to retract the formal endorsement out of respect for RedState Contributors who did not feel they could be associated in good conscience with an endorsement of two pro-abortion Democrats ( though we note that Ted Stevens is also not pro-life ) .
However , our point remains : the GOP , the conservative cause and even specifically the pro-life cause will be better off if Stevens and Young are defeated and the tarnish they carry with them are excised from the GOP . "

FBI agents improperly received millions of dollars in overtime payments for hours spent exercising , watching movies and going to cocktail parties while serving in Iraq , a Justice Department audit concluded .
A report from Justice Department Inspector General Glenn A. Fine said the FBI allowed , even encouraged , agents to list all waking hours on their time sheets , a move that violated federal pay statutes , regulations and FBI policies .
The 1,150 agents who worked in Iraq from 2003 to 2007 uniformly listed 16 - hour workdays for each day of their three - month tours .
The inspector general also said the FBI shifted the workweek of the agents from Monday through Friday to Sunday through Thursday , meaning they improperly received additional “ Sunday pay . ”
“ We accept that headquarters management , in an effort to quickly develop a simple system to compensate FBI employees who volunteered to leave their domestic assignments and serve in war zones , allowed a flawed system to develop and remain in place too long , ” FBI Assistant Director John Miller said .
“ The overtime policy described in the report was discontinued and the FBI accepts all of the IG ’s recommendations , many of which have already been implemented . ”
The inspector general could not determine exactly how much money the sham overtime hours cost the federal government , but the report lists $ 6.4 million as a conservative estimate .
Agents also improperly received about $ 1.4 million for “ Sunday pay . ”
In all , the bureau paid agents a total of $ 44 million in overtime , the majority of it legitimate .
According to the report , a typical agent received $ 31,531 for overtime work during a three - month tour .
The report estimates that only about $ 4,577 of that amount was illegitimate .
Combined with the $ 1,017 a typical agent improperly received for “ Sunday pay , ” agents were paid about $ 5,594 more than they should have been .
But there is little chance any of that money will be paid back .
“ We do not believe that there is sufficiently specific evidence regarding the time that individual agents actually worked to permit the FBI to calculate excess payments to individual employees , ” the IG ’s report said .
A less - thorough review found similar problems with FBI agents deployed to Afghanistan .
The report also said the smaller number of employees of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , the Drug Enforcement Administration and the United States Marshals Service who were sent to Iraq and Afghanistan also received excessive payments .
A tour in Iraq or Afghanistan is lucrative for an FBI agent .
Agents who volunteer to travel to a war zone can triple their income during a tour , according to the report .
FBI agents in Iraq conducted interrogations , worked on task forces whose investigations included that of the regime of Saddam Hussein , and helped train their Iraqi counterparts .
And the assignments come with great risks .
“ FBI employees lived with sniper attacks , mortar fire and roadside bombs as part of their daily work environment , ” Mr. Miller said .
According to the inspector general , some agents and supervisors defended putting in for 16 - hour days .
They said they were always “ on call ” and 16 hours a day was a reasonable average of the amount of time they worked .
Generous overtime pay was necessary to encourage people to volunteer for war zone assignments , they said .
As one agent is quoted in the report : “ When you ’re in that environment , anything you do to survive is work for the FBI . ”
The report concluded that using that rationale , agents billed for time spent at cocktail parties hosted each Saturday evening by the FBI , watching DVDs at the Baghdad Operations Center and washing laundry .
The FBI has made changes that include requiring supervisors in Iraq to approve the working hours reported by agents .
Previously , a supervisor in the U.S. gave approval .
“ We recognize that the FBI ’s failure to comply with applicable laws and its own policies in the early stages of the Iraq war was understandable to some extent due to the crisis atmosphere in a war zone , ” the inspector general ’s report said .
“ However , the FBI has had five years since the Iraq war began to establish lawful overtime procedures , and it failed to do so prior to the initiation of this investigation . ”

After besting BlackBerry and the Razr , the iPhone has seized its largest parcel of the global smartphone market yet : 16.6 percent .
It does n't sound like a lot , but it 's actually a pretty big deal .

You actually have to look at Nokia 's numbers , though , to understand why .
The global smartphone leader by a huge margin , its marketshare shrank from 63.3 percent to just 43.6 percent .
So , not only did it lose 20 percent of its grip , its marketshare fell below 50 percent for the first time in several years , according to Needham 's chart .
And , more to the point , its drop is roughly proportional with the iPhone 's rise in the last quarter .
In fact , the iPhone is the only reason smartphone growth did not slow overall .
FWIW , RIM and Windows Mobile 's marketshare stayed roughly constant , dipping slightly .
Even though it's not like the iPhone is stealing Nokia 's users directly — many of the iPhone 's are first - time " smartphone " owners in the US — it does make it painfully clear how unwise it is for Nokia to essentially forego certain segments of the market .
Hey , guess who their flagship N97 precisely does n't target ?

Unlikely Paths to Stimulus May Interest Investors
As hopes for an additional stimulus package wane in the run-up to the U.S. elections , some of the less likely paths to a deal may provide a way out of the current correction .

Deforestation was not the direct cause of the Great Irish famine of mid 19th century , but it was the start of a chain of events that led to it .
In this article , I show the condition of " overshoot " that Ireland was in at the time of the famine has much in common with the " overshoot " condition our world is in today .
What shall we do for timber ?
The last of the wood is down ,
…..
There ’s no holly nor hazel nor ash here
But pastures of rock and stone
The crown of the forest is withered
And the last of its game is gone .

1. Introduction
Today , we are more concerned about being overweight than about not having enough to eat , at least in the industrialized world .
Famines appear to us as events that occurred in remote ages , nothing that could happen to us in our enlightened era of progress and abundance .
Yet , the last major famine recorded in Western Europe , the Irish famine that started in 1845 , is not so remote after all .
It took place at a time when people already had railways , steamships , press , telegraph and more .
Those were also the times of the great gold rush in California , of the discovery of oil in Pennsylvania , of the unification wars in Italy .
It was a period of optimism and of economic growth ; and yet more than a million people died in a few years in a European country because of lack of food .
That is not something that we can ignore so easily .
Trying to understand the Irish famine means , usually , to seek its causes .
We could just say that it was caused by the " potato blight " ( Phytophthora infestans ) that killed the potato crops and , in a narrow sense , we would be right .
But that is not enough , obviously .
We are looking for deeper reasons : what had led to conditions so critical in the Irish agricultural system that the potato blight could have such devastating effects ?
Many interpretations have been proposed .
One is that the famine was due to overpopulation , as Malthus would have interpreted it .
But several studies maintain that the Irish land could have sustained many more than 8 million people -- the island 's population at the time of the famine .
An Irish tradition says that the English were the culprit in the famine .
If they had n’t really caused the famine , it is said , they had at least exploited it to get rid of a good number of their unruly Irish subjects .
For ( perhaps ) this reason , you sometimes see the term of “ Irish holocaust ” applied to the famine .
There are other interpretations , such as those given by Joel Mokyr in his comprehensive work of 1983 , " Why Ireland starved " .
We read of low productivity of labor , insufficient accumulation of capital , and other contributing factors .
Is a single one of these explanations the " correct " one , or are they all correct in a certain measure ?
Perhaps there is some confusion as to what we mean , exactly , as the " cause " of the famine .
Ireland had , at that time , an immense and intricate web of relationships and connections that linked the social system , the political system , the economic system and the ecosystem .
We call this kind of system " complex " ; a characteristic of complex systems is that they can't be described in simple terms of " cause " and " effect " .
Rather , we speak of " forcings " to describe how an external influence ( e.g. the potato blight ) pushes the system in a certain direction .
We speak of " feedback " in describing how the system reacts -- amplifying or damping the influence .
There were other failures of the potato crops before the Great Famine , but none had such devastating effects as the one of 1845 .
Evidently , at that time , the Irish social and economic systems were more sensitive to perturbations than they had been before .
So , if we want to understand the Irish famine , it is useless to look for a single cause to blame .
Overpopulation was surely a factor , but it needs to be understood together with other parameters .
Complex system need to be understood by looking at the specific patterns that they follow .
One of these patterns , a typical one of economic systems , is resource overexploitation .
It is a phenomenon that leads to the condition that we call " overshoot " .
A society in overshoot exploits resources beyond their capabilities to reform .
Sooner or later , what has been borrowed must be repaid , and that implies a return to sustainability that may be traumatic : we call it collapse .
The point that I 'll discuss in the rest of this article is the hypothesis that Ireland in the 19th century was a case of overshoot followed by collapse .
It appears that the whole cycle started with the cutting down of the island 's forests , in the 18th century .
Deforestation generated a series of positive feedbacks that eventually led to the great famine .
One of these positive feedbacks was the creation of arable land and the consequent increase in agricultural production .
That , in turn , generated an economic boom that led to a population explosion .
But population could n't keep growing forever .
Agriculture had reached its productive limits and was using a resource that could n't be renewed : topsoil -- easily eroded in a rainy northern country such as Ireland .
Eventually , the return to sustainable population levels was triggered by a potato disease that generated the great famine , but some form of collapse was unavoidable one way or another .
2. Origins of the famine
The Romans of imperial times knew about the remote island of Northern Europe that they called Hibernia .
It was a sparsely populated land covered with thick forests .
It was too poor and too far away to be worth conquering , and so the Roman legionnaires never set foot there .
Ireland was nearly unaffected by the collapse of the Roman Empire and played an important cultural role in early medieval Europe .
But , as Europe recovered it became clear that Ireland was too small and too weak to compete with the new European powers of the time ; of these , England was the closest and the most dangerous .
There were several waves of invasion from England ; the final one was led by Oliver Cromwell and ended in 1653 with the complete conquest of Ireland and the collapse of the Gaelic Irish society .
The ancient Irish nobility was exterminated or sent to exile .
The surviving Irish lost all their lands , had little or no civil rights , could not carry weapons , and could n’t vote or have representatives .
Even the practice of the Catholic religion was forbidden .
All the economic activities of Ireland fell into the hands of the English rulers , and the role of the Irish was only that of peasants or workers .
Ireland was the first British colony ; even though never formally declared one .
In the meantime , the modern era had started .
New worlds had been discovered beyond the seas , and Spain , France and England were engaged in a worldwide struggle for power .
All three faced the same problem : how to feed their population and at the same time equip their armies and their military fleets .
Britannia , it is said , ruled the waves by means of wooden ships and iron men .
But iron men were not enough : armies needed iron weapons and warships .
Every kingdom needed forests ; a strategic asset that provided charcoal , needed for smelting iron , and timber , needed for building warships .
“ No wood , no kingdome ” had said Arthur Standish in his “ The Commons Complaint ” of 1611 .
But kingdoms also needed food for their troops and their population .
For that , it was necessary to clear as much land for agriculture as possible .
It was a difficult strategic game : how to keep a country 's forests and at the same time feed the population ?
Eventually , England found a way of winning the game by using its abundant coal reserves .
With the process of “ coking ” developed in 18th century , plenty of iron was available for weapons .
With England 's powerfully armed fleet , England could get timber from anywhere in the world and , at the same time , prevent its competitors from getting it .
More timber meant more warships and more warships meant more world domination and , therefore , even more timber .
Weapons and warships also meant that powerful armies could be ferried overseas .
Everywhere in the world , foreign kingdoms were brought down and transformed into colonial plantations that produced food for their remote rulers .
More food meant larger armies and that , in turn , meant more plantations and even more food .
It was this mechanism that created the British Empire , the first planetary empire of history .
But there was a problem with the food coming from far away colonies .
In a time of slow sailing ships and without refrigeration , few kinds of food could survive a long trip without spoiling .
One was sugar : the main product of remote plantations .
That was the origin of the " tea at five " habit in England .
But sugar was n't enough to feed the growing British Empire and Ireland was the right place for getting the kinds of food , meat and butter for instance , that could n't be shipped to England from remote colonies .
Making room for food production spelled the end of the Irish forests .
At the time of the British Empire , we do n’t have to think that Ireland was still covered with the lush forests of the time of the mythical hero Cuchulainn .
But the data reported by Michael Williams in his “ Deforesting the Earth ” show that Ireland in the 17th century still maintained about 12 % of the land covered with trees , significantly more than most European countries of that time .
Ireland did n't need trees for a navy or an army , so there were no incentives or laws that could protect the Irish trees .
That gave rise to a deforestation boom .
From the trunks , timber was produced and sold on the international market .
From the shrubs , charcoal was made and used for producing iron .
The Irish iron industry could n’t compete with the English one , but Ireland had enough iron ore to keep the forges running and produce iron for local uses and for export .
Then , the land cleared of trees left a rich fertile soil that could be used for agriculture .
Exporting food could pay for even more deforestation and the process fed on itself .
Jonah Barrington , Anglo - Irish landlord , said in late 18th century that , “ Trees are stumps provided by nature for the repayment of debt . ”
But , of course , trees were being cut much faster than they could regrow , and this was taking a heavy toll on the Irish forests .
Arthur Young , an English writer , reported in 1776 in his “ Tour of Ireland ” that the greatest part of the kingdom exhibits a naked , bleak , dreary view for want of wood .
That does n’t mean that the whole island was cleared of trees at that time , but it does tell us that the effects of deforestation had started to become important .
We do n't have detailed data on the extent of deforestation ; apparently nobody would keep such a record at that time .
But we can learn from Eileen McCracken ( “ The Irish woods since Tudor times ” ) that , for instance , the Irish exports of timber went from more than 170,000 cubic feet in mid 17th century to nearly zero in 1770 ( p. 113 ) .
Timber imports , conversely , grew nearly 20 - fold from 1711 to 1790 .
Evidently , in the 18th century Ireland was gradually becoming unable to produce enough timber for its internal market .
We also learn from McCracken 's book that the Irish iron production died out in late 18th century , most likely because there was no more wood for making the charcoal necessary to smelt iron ore .
The only quantitative data we have on the actual deforestation trends are from the extent of wood acreage on sale advertised in newspapers , again as reported by Eileen McCracken .
The data can be plotted as shown in the figure at the beginning of this article .
We may reasonably assume that the acreage on sale is proportional to the deforestation rate and , therefore , we see that Ireland had a “ deforestation peak ” in mid 18th century .
The curve is in agreement with the estimates of various authors on the extent of deforestation in Ireland .
At the beginning of the 19th century , no more ( and probably much less ) than 1 % of the Irish land was still covered with trees .
The deforestation curve in Ireland very much like the oil production curve in the United States that was studied by Marion King Hubbert .
Wood is a renewable resource , in principle , but if the forest is cut down too fast it does n’t have the time to reproduce .
This behavior seems to be general of slowly renewable biological resources and I found it also for the case of whale oil .
Deforestation in Ireland was not only nearly total , but it also paid no attention to things that today we take for granted ; for instance leaving at least a few natural reserves .
Native species were exterminated without regret , and even squirrels and deer went extinct -- to be reintroduced only much later , in 20th century .
The last wolf of Ireland is reported to have been shot in 1770 .
The same destiny was reserved for the “ woodkernes ” , dispossessed Irish who had taken to the woods .
We may be tempted to see these forest dwellers as romantic freedom fighters , an Irish version of Robin Hood and his merry men .
But woodkernes , rather than sung as sylvan heroes , were lumped together with the wolves .
They were hunted down and exterminated in an activity that seems to have provided much merriment to the landlords , as well as prizes provided by the government .
Woodkernes were reported as still existing in the 18th century .
But , just as it is difficult for us to imagine Robin Hood without the forest of Sherwood , the Irish woodkernes could n’t exist without the Irish forests , and no mention is made of them any more in the 19th century .
The transformation of Ireland into a food producer for England 's sake was highly successful .
Historians have calculated that during the first half of the 19th century , Ireland provided more than 10 % of all food available in England , including high quality food such as meat and butter .
The Irish , instead , had to content themselves with potatoes -- easy to cultivate and providing an abundant harvest .
But relying on a monoculture is risky , and intermittent famines were a normal feature in Ireland .
It was one of these periodic famines that had led Jonathan Swift to write his “ A modest proposal ” , published in 1729 , where he satirically proposed to solve the problem of hunger in Ireland by having the Irish eat their children .
Sir Jonah Barrington , cited before , tells us about the Irish peasants , “ The only three kinds of death they consider as natural are -- dying quietly in their own cabins , being hanged about the assize - time , or starving when the potato crop is deficient . ”
Despite the recurrent hard times , an Irish family could get enough food to survive the year round from a relatively small patch of land by cultivating potatoes .
The time that they were not working on their potatoes , they would work for their landlord in order to pay the rent .
For the landlords , it was the perfect arrangement : they had manpower for free .
For the Irish , it was far less than perfect but , at least , they had something to eat .
And , as it is usual in a growing economy , population was growing , too .
We do n’t know whether the rapid growth of the Irish population was actively encouraged by the landlords in order to have more manpower for their plantations .
It may also be that the Irish had reasoned as all peasants in the world do : more arms in the family , more wealth .
Perhaps , they also dreamed that their growing numbers would allow them , one day , to get rid of their hated English masters .
Whatever the case , the island experienced a real explosion in population .
There had been fewer than two million people in Ireland at the time of the English conquest .
By 1840 , the historical population maximum had been reached -- more than 8 million .
3 . The deadly trap
Cutting forests to make room for agriculture is an ancient practice , often referred to as " slash and burn agriculture " .
The idea is that a cleared forest leaves a soil rich in nutrients , also resulting from the ashes of burned trees .
Slash and burn agriculture is not necessarily bad for the land if it is practiced with moderation -- that is if trees are allowed to regrow while crops are moved
elsewhere .
If that is not done , the result is irreversible desertification .
In Ireland , we do n't know whether trees were commonly burned on the spot but , in any case , there was no attempt to rotate the cultures and re-grow forest patches .
Ireland is a rainy country , so desertification is less evident there than in arid areas .
Nevertheless , the Irish soil is fragile since the low sunlight makes plant growth slower than in more southern areas .
Without trees , and with the effect of the rain , Ireland 's fertile soil is easily eroded and washed into the sea .
It takes a lot of time for soil to reform -- centuries -- and we can be sure that erosion was a problem in the deforested Ireland of the 19th century .
Soil erosion does n't seem to have been studied in great depth in relation to the great famine , but a paper by Patrick Macgregor ( 1989 ) shows that the famine was more severe in those areas where erosion , too , was more severe .
Evidently , these areas were in a condition of a more advanced overshoot than others .
Today , you can see how serious the erosion problem still is if you travel in southern and south - western Ireland .
You can also use Google Earth or other satellite images to see erosion in those areas .
In the picture below , you can see the characteristic appearance of south - western Ireland , with large patches of eroded land and the walls that the Irish have built over the years .
The walls may have served as property marks but , clearly , had also the purpose of trying to free the fields from the stones that erosion had brought to the surface .
( Picture taken by the author in 2007 ) .
For the first half of 19th century , potatoes could still feed the growing Irish population .
It is even reported that when the harvest was good , there was a surplus of potatoes , and some had to be thrown away .
But the Irish were exploiting resources that could n’t be renewed , and population could not keep growing forever .
Something had to bring it back to levels that the land could support .
The return to sustainability started in 1845 when a series of waves of infection destroyed the potato crops of Ireland , one year after the other .
The results were devastating .
About one million people died in a few years as the direct result of the famine .
Another half million died of diseases related to the lack of food .
Many tried to escape to the United States .
In many cases , they left Ireland on ships totally inadequate in terms of hygienic conditions and lacking sufficient food and water .
These vessels were termed “ coffin ships ” and caused the death of an untold number of Irish emigrants .
We know that Ireland continued to produce food for England even during the worst years of the famine .
That has generated the legend of the " Irish holocaust " that blames the English for the famine .
But , surely , the British government had no interest in depopulating a colony that was producing plenty of food for England .
Rather , the English simply were indifferent to what looked to them just like one more of the recurrent Irish famines .
And the British were n't exactly sympathetic to the Irish population .
In the documents of the time , the Irish are often described as an inferior race and culture ; lazy and good for nothing people who created by themselves the disaster that befell on them .
Jonah Barrington describes the Irish peasant of his times ( late 18th century ) as something of a mixture of the troll and the hobbit ; sometimes dangerous , sometimes funny , never fully human .
Benjamin Disraeli , prime minister at the time of Queen Victoria , is reported to have said , “ The Irish hate our order , our civilization , our enterprising industry , our pure religion ” ( we read this sentence at page 6 of Cahill ( 1985 ) ) .
Why should the English have cared about a colony peopled with primitive peasants who spoke an incomprehensible language , practiced a different and hated religion , and did n’t seem to be at all grateful for the civilization that England had brought to them ?
Not that the British government did n't try to do something to mitigate the effects of the famine , but what was done was always too little and too late .
Ten years after the start of the famine , Ireland had lost one - fourth of its population .
Three decades afterwards , the Irish population had been reduced to about four million -- half of its historical maximum .
At that point , population stabilized ; in part as the result of emigration but also because of a specific choice of the Irish to limit population growth , obtained mainly retarding the age of marriage .
Still today , the Irish population has not returned to the level of before the great famine .
Still today , the Irish forests have not re-grown in full .
The northern regions of the country seem to have bee scarcely affected , but southern and south - western Ireland still show the scars of the events of mid-19th century .
( illustration from Wikipedia ) .
It is not just the Irish land that keeps the scars of those times ; it is also the memory of the famine that still lingers and still hurts .
We can barely imagine the humiliation and the rage of people who saw their children dying of hunger while they knew that food produced in Ireland was being shipped to England .
But we have very little material from those times that can tell us how the famine was perceived by the Irish .
Most of them could speak only Gaelic and there was n't a Gaelic press that could record their thoughts .
We only have reports by English travelers that tell us of a devastated landscape where desperate figures moved aimlessly along the roadside .
From one of them , we have the story and the image of Bridget O’Donnell , almost a walking skeleton with her famished children .
Still today , that image summarizes the tragedy of the Great Hunger , An Gorta Mor .

4. Implications for today
If you have read thus far , you have surely noticed the many similarities of the Island of Ireland at the time of the British Empire to the larger island that is the whole world at the time of the greater empire that we call " Globalization " .
Deforestation was a feature of both .
The last chapter of Michael Williams ' book “ Deforesting the Earth ” is entitled “ The Great Onslaught ” .
He reports that more trees have been cut and more land cleared in the 20th century in the world than in any other period in history .
Deforestation has affected mainly the tropical regions , whereas the temperate regions have been partly spared only because the abundance of fossil fuels has reduced the need for wood ( so far ) .
Economic factors are leading to the onslaught of trees , but there also seems to exist a certain degree of aesthetic satisfaction in removing those ugly trees to make room for agriculture .
I already mentioned Jonah Barrington 's sentence “ Trees are stumps provided by nature for the repayment of debt . ”
It seems to be a common kind of feeling .
Many people see forest clearing not just as an economic activity , but as an embodiment of the human right of dominating nature .
The forest is the place of wilderness and barbarism ; the place where woodkernes live .
Clearing it means to bring civilization and refinement .
This feeling has a certain logic .
We are predators of trees .
We cut trees for fuel and for making shelter , just as we kill animals for food .
Arthur Standish had said in 1611 " no wood , no kingdome " :
We can still say it : no wood , no civilization .
So , there is nothing wrong in cutting a tree , not even in cutting many trees .
But we do n't seem to be able to understand when it is time to stop .
Over and over , we have exterminated the creatures that provided us with food , pushing them to extinction .
We have destroyed the resources that provided us with wealth : the case of trees is , perhaps , less spectacular than that of woolly mammoths , but tree species do become extinct , too .
More than single species of trees , what we seem to be able to do , and to do all the time , is to destroy whole forests , to clean the land bare until it becomes “ naked , bleak and dreary ” , as Andrew Young had described Ireland in 18th century .
And that , as we saw , destroys our main source of survival : topsoil .
The destruction of the topsoil is the ultimate rape of the land .
It started when our ancestors discovered that slashing and burning was a good way to transform forests into fertile land .
We are still doing it today , although mechanization has given us ways of destroying forests much faster than any previous time .
We do that because of the ruthless mechanisms that push people for short term benefits , forgetting about long term survival .
But the Irish disaster places us in front of our relationship with the land , which is the source of our existence .
We ca n’t miss the analogy of the Irish potato , wonder of the agricultural technology of that time , with our “ green revolution ” and our “ genetically modified crops ” .
Wonders of agricultural technology , too , but how fragile ?
The green revolution and genetic crops are all based on the availability of cheap fertilizers and pesticides .
And both need topsoil that , with deforestation , is disappearing worldwide at rates perhaps faster than the Irish topsoil of two hundred years ago .
Something more that strikes us about the great Irish famine is the rapidity of the passage from abundance to scarcity .
It is reported that in the years before the famine , there were so many potatoes in Ireland that people had to throw them away .
Then , in a few years , people were dropping dead of starvation along the streets .
Yet , the famine was not , and could not , be unexpected .
There had been many other famines in Ireland before the great one of mid 19th century .
Could n't people see that with the growing population , they were becoming more and more vulnerable to another harsher , famine ?
But the lack of memory of the past , even the recent past , is not just a characteristic of mid 19th century Ireland .
We tend to see our prosperity as the way things are and will always be .
But , how long is it going to last ?
We may not be losing just our topsoil .
Stuart McLean in his book “ The event and its terrors ” tells us that in some measure , Ireland lost her soul because of the famine .
Together with her trees , Ireland lost her language , Gaelic , and her traditions .
Today , languages and tradition are disappearing all over the world .
It is all part of the exploitation of the world 's riches , forests and many other resources .
As in the past , we do n't seem to know when it is time to stop .
In the “ Morte d’Arthur ” published in 16th century , Thomas Mallory tells us the ancient Celtic legend of a king whose sickness changes the fertile land of his reign into a barren land .
At the time of the great famine , the ancient Irish kings had abandoned Ireland and the land had become just an economic resource .
Trees had become “ excrescences useful for paying debt ” .
For us , the fertile land of our planet has also become just an economic resource useful only for paying debt .
In the end , we are all Irish .
5. Final notes and acknowledgments
This post grew out of a trip that I made to Southern Ireland in 2007 .
I had visited Ireland many times before , but , up until then , I had never been in that area .
What I saw was a devastated landscape : almost no trees anywhere and nude rock at the surface as the result of topsoil erosion .
That led me to study the subject of Ireland 's ecosystem more in depth .
I hope it is clear from what I wrote that I do n't mean to disparage or contradict the excellent work that people much more expert than I have done on the subject of the great famine .
Not being Irish myself , I hope that I can be forgiven for having ventured into this subject , apparently remote from my personal experience .
But I have always felt that the great tragedy that was " an gorta mor " is not something that should be seen as relevant for Ireland only .
It is a mirror in which we can see an image of our world of today and of ourselves as well .
I wish to thank Bobbins and Colin Campbell for having taken me to Southern Ireland after the " ASPO - 6 " conference in Cork .
I wish also to thank Lindianne Sarno who brought ancient Ireland alive for me with her novel “ Greensleeves , An Historical Novel of the First Irish Diaspora . ”

Of the many academic texts about the famine , the most detailed one and perhaps the most complete is the one by Joel Mokyr , “ Why Ireland Starved ” , George Allen & Unwin publishers , London , 1983 .
Mokyr ’s conclusion is that the Irish famine was not due to overpopulation but to factors such as insufficient accumulation of capital and low labor productivity .
Surely these factors contributed to causing the famine , but Mokyr seems to miss the dynamic nature of overshoot , and he does n’t explicitly consider the conditions of the Irish soil in his study .

Barack Obama , soon to become the 44th President of the U.S.A. , is many things : a statesman , a lawyer , an author , and an orator .
It is also our opinion at GeekDad that , even without knowing him personally , we have enough evidence to demonstrate that he is a big geek .
Even if you did n't want him to win the election , you have to admit that it would be awesome for him to be not only the first African - American President , but also the first geek President .
Here , then , is our evidence :
1. Obama has pledged to create a cabinet - level Chief Technology Officer for the country .
The U.S. CTO would be responsible for making broadband technology readily available to every U.S. citizen , and for fighting the telcos for net neutrality .
While this is admirable for many reasons , it seems to us that nobody would make this a central point of his presidential campaign unless he were , on some level , a geek .
2 . He is a big fan of Star Trek .
He said himself : " I grew up on Star Trek .
I believe in the final frontier . "
And , when Leonard Nimoy was the guest on NPR's " Wait Wait ... Do n't Tell Me ! " in September , he said that he had run into " one of the presidential candidates " and that that candidate had , upon seeing Nimoy , given him the Vulcan salute .
He refused to name the candidate , but said he " was not John McCain . "
( Ed. Note : not to mention , he is the best example of the strength of IDIC we 've seen in a long time )
3 . He can talk techspeak when the occasion demands it .
Almost a year ago , Obama visited Google and had a Q&A session with employees .
CEO Eric Schmidt asked him what the most efficient way would be to sort a million 32 - bit integers .
Obama smoothly responded " I think the bubble sort would be the wrong way to go . "
Now , yes , he was probably prepped for the question by his staff ( since McCain had been asked a similar question at his Google Q&A weeks earlier ) , but that 's OK — plenty of geeks BS their way through technical interview questions , right ?
4. Obama has repeatedly spoken about using the Internet to make the White House more open and accessible to the public once he 's President .
This would include letting people enter comments on bills before he signs them , putting videos of some meetings online , and in general making the executive branch transparent .
He 's already shown in his campaign that he and his staff know how to use the Internet to extremely good purpose , including extensive use of SMS , Twitter , and even building an iPhone app .
This would be another of the duties of the CTO mentioned in # 1 , but is significant enough we felt it was worthy of being considered a separate piece of evidence .
5 . The photograph you see to the right , which can even be found on Obama 's official Senate website .
I do n't think any explanation is necessary as to why this qualifies as evidence .
So , what do you think ?
Any further evidence ?
Any evidence against ?
It must be pointed out , since this is GeekDad , that if indeed Barack Obama is a geek , he is a geek dad like us , since by now just about everyone knows about his two daughters .
The coolness of having a geek dad President - Elect can scarcely be overstated .

CAIRO ( Reuters ) -
An Egyptian man said on Wednesday he was offering his 20 - year - old daughter in marriage to Iraqi journalist Muntazer al - Zaidi , who threw his shoes at U.S. President George W. Bush in Baghdad on Sunday ,
The daughter , Amal Saad Gumaa , said she agreed with the idea .
“ This is something that would honour me .
I would like to live in Iraq , especially if I were attached to this hero , ” she told Reuters by telephone .
Her father , Saad Gumaa , said he had called Dergham , Zaidi ’s brother , to tell him of the offer .
“ I find nothing more valuable than my daughter to offer to him , and I am prepared to provide her with everything needed for marriage , ” he added .
Zaidi ’s gesture has struck a chord across the Arab world , where President Bush is widely despised for invading Iraq in 2003 and for his support for Israel .
Amal is a student in the media faculty at Minya University in central Egypt .
Zaidi ’s response to the proposal was not immediately clear .
Holy robot glory — A Chinese Odyssey director Jeffrey Lau is making a Chinese Transformers movie .
No matter how many things Michael Bay blows up in Transformers : Revenge Of The Fallen , it still wo n't have Stephen Chow in it .
Which means it 's China 1 , America 0 .
Apparently its been in the works for 10 years and it 's titled simply , Robot .
Lau has partnered with Le TV.com and has created a film company , and Robot will be their first production .
The giant - robot film will
present a refreshing look at Chinese robots for people who are used to stereotypical Hollywood figures like Spiderman and Superman .
He said the Chinese robot , in comparison , would feel closer and more human to audiences .

The film will begin shooting on November 19th in China .

A bizarre bar room conversation related to us by a reader suggests that ex-military personnel may be being used to provocateur 9/11 truthers and liberty activists into making violent statements as a potential pretext for entrapment .
A reader who wishes to remain anonymous informs us about a strange individual who entered his local bar and suddenly started spouting off in a loud voice about Jews , 9/11 and even allegedly made death threats against Barack Obama .
The full story of the encounter is included below .
Last night at about 6 pm , I decided to go have a scotch and pizza at a nearby pub .
I ’ve been there several times and like most of the times in my life of visiting bars , I have never sat next to someone that wanted to ( in this case ) encourage open statements against the Jews , against Obama , against the government , but not necessarily at George Bush , Jeb Bush , or even Marvin Bush .
Out - of - the - blue , a fairly educated looking individual sits down next to me and began bashing Jews , faster than I could say “ What ? ”
He ordered a pizza and a coke , and began bashing FoxNews as the “ Jew Tube ” and kept trying to get my input .
My antennas went - up immediately and I made the mistake of engaging in a conversation with him , and mentioned that FoxNews was typical of mainstream media now .
He continued to bash Jews at every single level and tells me he knows who exactly was behind 9/11 .
“ I know I sound like a Jew basher , but it ’s the truth , ” he says …and that “ Alex Jones is right and he bashes Jews too ! ”
( He did n’t ask me if I had seen “ Loose Change ” ) but he assumed that I did .
I told him that Alex does not bash Jews , and I asked , “ What station do you listen to Alex on ? ”
He paused and said , “ I only saw Loose Change ! ”
And added … ” I do n’t listen to him on any station . ”
He went - on about 9/11 being an inside job , and of course , “ the Jews did it , ” he said .
I told him several times that I have nothing against the people of Israel , but I am sure that Mossad and the Pakistani ISI were involved , I continued … ” That ’s a theory and all my expertise is on the act itself , since I am a retired airline captain of large jets , therefore , leave it to a new investigation to determine who actually did it ! ”
He goes - on … ” The Jews were behind 9/11 , they ’re behind everything ! ” I just shuddered , as most everyone around us could hear him .
He went - on about everyone , including Obama being a Jewish descendent and “ somebody should K*** him ” etc .
He continued to stay on that a few minutes and trying to get me to agree .
I did n’t …
I told him that he ca n’t just walk into a bar , up to someone he does n’t know , and begin bashing Jews !
“ That can get you in an immediate bar fight ! ”
He said … ” I have a right to express my 1st amendment rights and if nobody likes it … tough ! ”
I was eating my pizza as fast as I could , because I was beginning to get sick .
I felt strongly that he was a federal agent , attempting to ( either ) initiate me into a supremacist group , or openly state something against Obama ( to determine a threat level of me ) , or use a taped conversation later as evidence to lock me up .
BTW …he knew nothing about REX 84 .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
He was in full agreement that 9/11 was an inside job , and told me his name …. but if you look at his article on “ Defense Link ” below , it paints a different picture .
He ’s retired from the Navy and seems to have become very disgruntled about 9/11 , or he ’s an agent .
Something tripped this guy , and it would be remarkable if “ Loose Change ” did it , but certain things do n’t add up here .
I was definitely being prompted to agree and talk on his terms .
The moral of this story is to NOT engage in open conversation about sensitive issues at a bar .
Hand them a DVD ( outside ) and ask them to tell you later as to what they think about it .
If you are the initiator of a sensitive conversation , you have a better chance of not encountering a federal agent that wants to drag you into their world .
And by all means … do n’t open conversations by bashing Jews , Christians , and telling people what you would like see happen to Obama .
ONLY federal agents can get away with that dialogue when prompting a subject to fall into their trap .
Our new world will get real testy soon and people need to be aware of who they are talking to , because the search for dissidents , patriots , 9/11 truthers , bloggers , and radio / journalists is on the move .
I ate my last piece of pizza and told him I had to go feed my dog .
I get - up , did n’t wait for the bartender to take my money … I walked over to the end of the bar and paid her .
He gets up and walks over to where I am standing and pays his bill too !
He leaves out the front door … I walk into the bathroom , and a guy , that was sitting near us , ( now in the bathroom ) had been listening to the conversation , asked me “ What in the hell was that all about ?
That guy was F****** strange ! ”
If that were the entirety of the story then one would be inclined to dismiss the individual as just a disturbed nutcase .
However , despite this individual making vague but hostile statements against Jews , the government , the media and the official 9/11 story , he is prominently featured on the U.S. Department of Defense website as a recently retired Navy officer who expressed vehement support for the war on terror .
His real name and photo are carried on the defenselink .mil website , according to the reader who related the story , and were provided to us .
The reader knows it is the same guy because he mentioned a very specific thing about himself during the conversation that is also detailed on the Defense Department website page .
The contradiction between this and the individual ’s statements and behavior in the bar suggest that he was putting on an act in an attempt to attract anyone of a radical bent that might be a target for an undercover entrapment operation .
His blanket statements yet distinct lack of detailed knowledge about 9/11 , along with his claim that “ Alex Jones bashes Jews , ” and the alleged death threat made against Obama are very suspicious indicators that this individual is on the payroll as a Federal informant involved in some kind of entrapment dragnet .
Far from being a paranoid fantasy , this is a method commonly employed by intelligence agencies to entrap alleged terrorists who are later presented to the media as dangerous Al - Qaeda affiliated operatives , as we saw in the case of the “ Chicago Seven , ” who were in actual fact a near - retarded street gang who took cash from an FBI provocateur in return for making violent remarks and drawing up crude plans to attack the Sears Tower .
The 9/11 truth movement is completely peaceful and no 9/11 truther has ever been criminally charged from activities relating to a protest or demonstration .
Despite this fact , smear attempts to link the truth movement with crude terror attacks , such as the fire - bombing of the US military recruiting center in New York ’s Times Square , have repeatedly been attempted .
We advise readers to express extreme caution when approached by strangers who begin talking in this manner and also to report any death threats made against public figures to the relevant authorities .

Two of the most common diseases in the United States -- cancer and diabetes -- are not often linked together in the public mind .
But they may have a stronger link than most people think .
Cancer patients who already have diabetes have a greater chance of dying of the disease than cancer patients who do not have the blood - sugar disorder , according to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
Breast , colorectal and endometrial cancer patients with diabetes have a significantly higher risk of dying .
If researchers can tease out the reason why , they might have an opportunity to reduce cancer deaths by focusing on diabetes - related health problems , says lead author Frederick Brancati , M.D. , a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , in Baltimore , Maryland .
About 24 million people in the United States have diabetes , and about eight to 18 percent of newly diagnosed cancer patients also have the disease .
Health.com : Top 10 diabetes stories of 2008
" It 's something that is hiding in plain sight , " says Brancati .
" Diabetes is very common , cancer is very common , but no one had really thought to organize the literature and see it . "
In the new study , Brancati and colleagues analyzed all the available research and selected 23 well - designed studies that looked at cancer patients who had diabetes at the time of diagnosis .
This type of study , known as a meta - analysis , can highlight problems that no single study typically can .
The researchers found that people with diabetes had about a 1.4 times greater risk of dying of cancer than patients without blood - sugar problems .
Mortality seemed to be higher for many types of cancer , but it was only statistically significant for three types : breast , endometrial , and colorectal .

What 's your breast cancer IQ ?
" It 's a big deal if we can take a cancer and knock its mortality rate down by 5 percent or 10 percent , " says Dr. Brancati .
" Here 's a potential 40 percent .
We do n't know from this kind of study how much we can really chip away at it , but it does say there 's a target out there . "
Some research suggests that people with diabetes are at greater risk of developing cancer in the first place , possibly due to their weight .
Many people with type 2 diabetes are also obese , and obesity is linked to a greater risk of some types of cancer .
The researchers say there are many reasons why people with diabetes might have a higher cancer - mortality risk .
• Something about diabetes , possibly high blood sugar , may cause tumors to grow faster .
• People with diabetes are at greater risk of other health problems , such as heart and kidney disease .
This may weaken their ability to withstand chemotherapy or other aggressive treatments , so doctors may treat them less aggressively .
• Diabetics are more susceptible to infections , which may increase mortality after surgery or other treatments .
• People with diabetes may be diagnosed with cancer at a later stage of disease because doctors are focusing on their other health problems .

A mammogram may have saved my life
• A cancer diagnosis may cause patients and doctors to neglect diabetes treatment .
• There may be no relation between cancer and diabetes .
People with diabetes are at greater risk of health problems , and may just have a higher mortality risk in general .
One other possible factor is depression , says Richard Hellman , M.D. , a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Missouri -- Kansas City School of Medicine .
About 10 to 40 percent of people with diabetes also experience depression , and they can have more severe episodes than those who do n't have diabetes .
" What happens is that people [ who are depressed ] delay diagnosis , they delay treatment for needed problems , and their outcomes for almost anything are poorer , " he says .
" If you have a subset of patients with cancer who have diabetes , and that group has a subset that is depressed , the ones who are depressed will tend to have particularly poor outcomes . "

Undoubtedly , more research will focus on the link to see if managing diabetes better , or differently , can reduce the cancer - mortality rate .
In the meantime , Hellman says that the findings may encourage oncologists to pay closer attention to their patients ' diabetes care , and communicate more with physicians who are managing the diabetes .
Health.com : I beat cancer and finished a half - marathon
" If you have cancer and you have diabetes , you have to be more vigilant , " he says .
" Make sure that your care is well coordinated so that your diabetes care remains excellent , any of your cardiovascular evaluations are up - to - date , and the doctors are talking to each other . "

Something over a week ago , I questioned here whom Illinois Governor Blagojevich upset so much in the criminal enterprise called government that a concerted effort began to oust him .
Readers offered a variety of scenarios , which only led to more questions .
A great majority believes the governor was ousted for asking Illinois government agencies to suspend doing business with the Bank of America .
I can sometimes better understand things if I reduce them to their lowest denominator .
If I were to become unhappy with the service at my local bank , went in and informed the manager I would no longer being doing business with them , and the next day was arrested by the local sheriff for doing that which is customary and previously accepted in the performance of my job , one thing would become immediately apparent .
I would know that the bank owns the local sheriff and is the real power in my area .
It is not hard to transfer the lesson learned here to national scale .
I must admit when Illinois Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. rushed to inform the world he had made no deals with Blagojevich , my first thought was to Shakespeare ’s Hamlet , Act 3 Scene 2 : " ( He ) doth protest too much methinks . "
Now , we are hearing of Rahm Emanuel , former Clintonite , current Congressman from Illinois , and newly ordained Chief of Staff for president - elect Obama , being recorded on many of the conversations with Blagojevich .
Although there has been nothing leaked as yet about the content of those conversations , reports indicate Emanuel sought the vacant senate seat appointment for Valerie Jarrett within a certain timeframe .
What , if anything , did Emanuel offer Blagojevich for this appointment ?
Does the fallout between Blagojevich and his father - in - law , Chicago city Alderman and Illinois Democratic Party heavyweight , Richard Mell , play into this fiasco ?
This follow - up would be incomplete without addressing the connection between Blagojevich and Obama ’s appointee to be Attorney General , Eric Holder .
Blagojevich had previously sought to employ Holder as a " special investigator to the Illinois Gaming Board . "
Holder forgot to list this meeting and TV appearance on his confirmation documents to the US Senate , but quickly said he would amend his paperwork once the oversight was discovered .
Where will this whole mess shakeout considering the former association of both Obama and Blagojevich with now convicted felon Tony Rezko ?
Rezko was listed as a fundraiser for both politicians and held an option to lease a hotel site at one of the sites to be selected for the proposed casino , a site that would have been in Holder ’s purview to select if he had assumed the job of Blagojevich ’s " special investigator " for the Illinois Gaming Board .
Then , one must question what role former U.S. Department of Justice Special Council and US Attorney for Chicago , Robert Fitzpatrick plays in this drama .
It would appear Fitzpatrick rushed to judgment in arresting Blagojevich , making the arrest before he made his case .
Standard operating procedure is to compile evidence , present the evidence to a judge , obtain an arrest warrant and then arrest the suspect .
We get this from the man who took eons investigating the Valerie Plame case ?
I know the answer everyone will give to this question is : Fitzpatrick had to move quickly before a successor to Obama was appointed .
Why , exactly was this important ?
Do people who rob a bank and get caught , get to keep the money ?
The Supreme Court would have been glad to appoint someone to the vacant senate seat if improprieties in the appointment were discovered ; after all the precedent has been set .
Take a look at the expertise of Mr. Fitzpatrick : he took mountains of evidence that Inspector Clouseau and Barney Fife could have used to indict practically the entire Bush administration and several members of the media with and was only able to indict and convict Scooter Libby , who had his prison sentence commuted by one of the suspects in the case , ( George W. Bush ) who just happens to be the man who appointed Fitzgerald to his job as U.S. Attorney .
Where is my tin-foil hat ?
Interesting , is it not , to watch these so - called " legal bulldogs " who overzealously pursue the destruction of the very foundations of liberty , morph into fuzzy little lapdogs when it comes to investigating the crimes committed by members of the criminal cabal that gave them birth ?
I ’m sure , in the interest of fair play ; we will soon be provided copies of the wiretapped conversations of New York Governor Paterson and all the representatives of the Kennedy political machine as they seek to convince the governor he needs to appoint Caroline Kennedy to Hillary ’s vacated senate seat .
We can rest assured those negotiations will have no quid pro quo agreements that would benefit the governor in any fashion ; right ?
Hang on folks ; there are many more hands to be played before this card game is over !

The Amish population is best known for avoiding modern technology A gene mutation which protects the heart against a high - fat diet has been found in the Amish population .
Researchers found 5 % of the US Amish population in Lancaster , Pennsylvania have a mutation in a protein which breaks down fatty particles .
Those with the mutation had higher levels of " good " HDL - cholesterol and lower levels of " bad " LDL - cholesterol , the journal Science reported .
It is hoped the finding will lead to new therapies to reduce cholesterol .
The researchers used blood samples from 800 volunteers in the Old Order Amish community to look for DNA markers that might be associated with levels of fat particles called triglycerides in the blood stream .
The discovery of this mutation may eventually help us to develop new therapies to lower triglycerides and prevent cardiovascular disease
Dr Toni Pollin
High blood levels of triglycerides , one of the most common types of fat in food , have been linked to heart disease .
They found a mutation in the APOC3 gene , which encodes a protein - apoC - III - that inhibits the breakdown of triglycerides .
As part of the study , participants drank a high - fat milkshake and were monitored for the next six hours .
Individuals with the mutation produced half the normal amount of apoC - III and had the lowest blood triglyceride levels - seemingly because they could break down more fat .
They also had relatively low levels of artery - hardening - a sign of cardiovascular disease .
Protection Study leader Dr Toni Pollin , assistant professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine , said : " Our findings suggest that having a lifelong deficiency of apoC - III helps to protect people from developing cardiovascular disease .
" The discovery of this mutation may eventually help us to develop new therapies to lower triglycerides and prevent cardiovascular disease , " she added .
The researchers believe the mutation was first introduced into the Amish community in Lancaster County by a person who was born in the mid-1700s .
It appears to be rare or absent in the general population .
Cathy Ross , cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation said the benefits of high HDL cholesterol and low LDL cholesterol are already being achieved by drugs such as statins .
" If new drugs can be developed that mimic the effect of this mutation , it may afford more ways in which individuals could be protected from developing cardiovascular disease .
" There are also lots of other simple ways people can reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease such as eating a diet low in saturated fat , having five portions of fruit and vegetables a day and taking regular physical activity . "

At the Alaska State Fair , and other craft shows around town , I ’ve seen a little device that makes me smile and think , “ Only in Alaska . ”
It ’s the carved wooden likeness of a moose .
The hollow moose body can be filled with jelly beans .
The tail , which is moveable , is used as a lever , which , when operated , dispenses a jelly bean “ moose nugget ” in the palm of your hand .
It ’s beginning to remind me of the Palin campaign .
Their strategy has become obvious .
Crank out a steady stream of half - truths , talking points , wedge issues , folksy filler words , justifications and shiny , sweet flat - out lies .
Do this fast enough , and by the time anyone takes the time to review , research , analyze , debunk , refute , and thoughtfully respond , you ’re already five piles of moose nuggets ahead of them .
Picture a five year old who gets a hold of the moose nugget generator , pumping that tail up and down as fast as his little hand can go , watching that big sticky pile accumulate in his hand .
Yum .
It ’s hard to know where to start , but let ’s start with the interview she did with the Chicago Tribune today .
And which nugget ?
Let ’s try that nice shiny green one .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin insisted in an interview with the Tribune on Thursday that she did not accept $ 150,000 worth of designer clothes from the Republican Party and “ that is not who we are . ”
“ That whole thing is just , bad ! ” she said .
“ Oh , if people only knew how frugal we are . ”
Oh , dear .
It sounds like she ’s been very misunderstood indeed .
People are so petty !
But , wait a minute …. has n’t she …been .. wearing those clothes ?
And …. that ’s the dollar amount that the RNC reported in their own disclosure forms .
If you pay nothing , and get $ 150,000 in clothing , hair styling and makeup , that sounds pretty frugal to me .
I just do n’t get it .
She ’s not making any sense … WAIT !
Another jelly bean !
Look , it ’s pink !
“ I think Hillary Clinton was held to a different standard in her primary race , ” Palin said .
“ Do you remember the conversations that took place about her , say superficial things that they do n’t talk about with men , her wardrobe and her hairstyles , all of that ?
That ’s a bit of that double standard . ”
Hillary Clinton ?
Double standard ?
Wait a minute .
There may be something to that , but I do n’t think Hillary Clinton spent $ 150,000 of the DNC ’s money to buy a new wardrobe .
Her Senate wardrobe was just fine , just like…um ….a
Governor ’s wardrobe should be , right ?
And what about John Edwards and that $ 400 hair cut ?
The Republicans had a field day over that one !
Oh ….look !
A yellow one !
“ I ’m not going to complain about it , I ’m not going to whine about it , I ’m going to plow through that , because we are embarking on something greater than that , than allowing that double standard to adversely affect us , ” she said .
We know American ’s do NOT like complainers and whiners , that ’s for sure .
That ’s pretty much the kiss of death for a politician .
So it ’s good she ’s not complaining , except for saying it ’s unfair , and sexist , and there ’s a double standard , and people do n’t understand the real her , and it ’s painful because …. heeeeeyy .
Come to think of it , that actually kind of sounds like complaining and whining to me !
That ’s pretty hypocritic ….. Oooo !
Another one !
It ’s red !
But polls suggest that McCain is in trouble , partly because of Palin , who has been criticized as lacking the experience to become president .
This week ’s NBC / Wall Street Journal poll suggested more people now think that Palin is hurting McCain ’s chances of becoming president than President George W. Bush , whose national approval ratings are in the 20s .
Palin disputed such conclusions .
“ I think that those reporters asking those questions should come to some of our rallies and ask some of those in the crowd why it is they are enthused , ” she said , adding that the crowds see her as representing “ hardworking , everyday American families . ”
But the Wall Street Journal / NBC poll is n’t actually made up of questions asked by reporters .
It ’s questions asked by pollsters , and it ’s done in a pretty scientific sort of way .
I do n’t think it would really be appropriate to send pollsters to your rallies to ask them why they are there .
You see , that would n’t really be impartial , or be a representative sample of the way the country is thinking , which is why we actually have polls .
And the voters are made up of people from all over , not just “ enthused ” McCain - Palin rally - goers …
Surely , you ca n’t possibly think that people will take this seriou… .
OK , I need to stop now …my stomach hurts .
I think I ’ve overdone it on the moose nugget jelly beans .
Anyone on the other ticket got some Alka - Seltzer ?

The advert compared the iPhone 's 3G and 2G models An Apple iPhone advert has been banned by the advertising standards watchdog for exaggerating the phone 's speed .
The advert boasted the new 3G model was " really fast " and showed it loading internet pages in under a second .
The Advertising Standards Authority ( ASA ) upheld complaints by 17 people who said the TV advert had misled them as to its speed .
Apple UK said it was comparing the 3G model with its 2G predecessor and its claims were " relative not absolute " .
The advert repeatedly stated that the phone was " really fast " and showed news pages and the Google maps service taking just fractions of a second to appear .
Text on the screen said : " Network performance will vary by location . "
After upholding the viewers ' complaints , the ASA said the advert must not appear again in the same form .
It said the advert was likely to lead viewers to believe that the device actually operated at or near to the speeds shown in the advert .
The watchdog concluded : " Because we understood that it did not , we concluded that the ad was likely to mislead . "
Apple said its claims were " relative rather than absolute in nature " - implying the 3G iPhone was " really fast " in comparison to the previous generation - and therefore the advert was not misleading .
The company also said the average consumer would realise the phone 's performance would vary - a point they said was made clear by the text stating " network performance will vary by location " .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Senate on Wednesday night passed a sweeping and controversial financial bailout similar in key ways to one rejected by the House just two days earlier .
The measure was passed by a vote of 74 to 25 after more than three hours of floor debate in the Senate .
Presidential candidates Sens. Barack Obama , D - Illinois , and John McCain , R - Arizona , voted in favor .
Like the bill the House rejected , the core of the Senate bill is the Bush administration 's plan to buy up to $ 700 billion of troubled assets from financial institutions .
Those assets , mostly mortgage - related , have caused a crisis of confidence in the credit markets .
A major aim of the plan is to free up banks to start lending again once their balance sheets are cleared of toxic holdings .
But the Senate legislation also includes a number of new provisions aimed at Main Street .
The changes are intended to attract more votes in the House , in particular from House Republicans , two - thirds of whom voted against the bailout plan .
The House is expected to take up the Senate measure for a vote on Friday , according to aides to Democratic leaders .
The legislation , if passed by the House , would usher in one of the most far - reaching interventions in the economy since the Great Depression .
Advocates say the plan is crucial to government efforts to attack a credit crisis that threatens the economy and would free up banks to lend more .
Opponents say it rewards bad decisions by Wall Street , puts taxpayers at risk and fails to address the real economic problems facing Americans .
" If we do not act responsibly today , we risk a crisis in which senior citizens across America will lose their retirement savings , small businesses wo n't make payroll ... and families wo n't be able to obtain mortgages for their homes or cars , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , moments before the vote .
In a press briefing after the vote , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell .
R-Ky. , said , " This is a measure for Main Street , not Wall Street .
[ It will help ] to unfreeze our credit markets and get the American economy working again . "
Because of Senate add - ons , the bill 's initial price tag will be higher than the $ 700 billion that the Treasury would use to buy troubled assets .
But over time , supporters say , taxpayers are likely to make back much if not all of the money the Treasury uses because it will be investing in assets with underlying value .
How the Senate bill differs
The package adds provisions to the House version - including temporarily raising the FDIC insurance cap to $ 250,000 from $ 100,000 .
It says the FDIC may not charge member banks more to cover the increase in coverage .
But that does n't prevent the agency from raising premiums to cover existing concerns with the insurance fund , according to Jaret Seiberg , a financial services analyst at the Stanford Group , a policy research firm .
Instead , the bill allows the FDIC to borrow from the Treasury to cover any losses that might occur as a result of the higher insurance limit .
The bill also adds in three key elements designed to attract House Republican votes - particularly popular tax measures that have garnered bipartisan support .
It would extend a number of renewable energy tax breaks for individuals and businesses , including a deduction for the purchase of solar panels .
The Senate bill would also continue a host of other expiring tax breaks .
Among them : the research and development credit for businesses and the credit that allows individuals to deduct state and local sales taxes on their federal returns .
In addition , the bill includes relief for another year from the Alternative Minimum Tax , without which millions of Americans would have to pay the so - called " income tax for the wealthy . "
The debate over extending AMT relief is an annual political ritual .
It enjoys bipartisan support but deficit hawks on both sides of the aisle contend the cost of providing that relief should be paid for .
Others argue it should n't be paid for because the AMT was never intended to hit the people the relief provisions would protect .
Nevertheless , lawmakers pass the measure every year or two .
How Senate bill mimics House version
For all the sweeteners added to the Senate bill , however , it is similar to the House bill in many key ways .
The core is the Treasury 's proposal to let financial institutions sell to the government their troubled assets , mostly mortgage - related .
And as in the House bill , the Senate would only allow the Treasury access to the $ 700 billion in stages , with $ 250 billion being made available immediately .
The Senate bill is also similar in that it includes a number of provisions that supporters say would protect taxpayers .
One would direct the president to propose a bill requiring the financial industry to reimburse taxpayers for any net losses from the program after five years .
And the Treasury would be allowed to take ownership stakes in participating companies .
Like the House version , the Senate bill includes a stipulation that the Treasury set up an insurance program - to be funded with risk - based premiums paid by the industry - to guarantee companies ' troubled assets , including mortgage - backed securities , purchased before March 14 , 2008 .
And it would place curbs on executive pay for companies selling assets or buying insurance from Uncle Sam .
One provision :
Any bonus or incentive paid to a senior executive officer for targets met would have to be repaid if it 's later proven that earnings or profit statements were inaccurate .
Lastly , the Senate version would set up two oversight committees .
A Financial Stability Board would include the Federal Reserve chairman , the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman , the Federal Home Finance Agency director , the Housing and Urban Development secretary and the Treasury secretary .
A congressional oversight panel , to which the Financial Stability Board would report , would have five members appointed by House and Senate leadership from both parties .
Differing views
Despite the Senate bill 's sweeteners , the bill did not garner unanimous support because those who oppose the Treasury plan felt passionately it was the wrong approach .
Sen. Maria Cantwell , D - Wash . , a champion of the energy tax breaks in the bill , said on Wednesday afternoon she nevertheless would vote against the bill because she opposes " giving the keys to the Treasury over to the private sector . "
Opponents of the bill have said they resented being given a " my way or the highway " choice to address what they acknowledge is a very serious economic threat .
During the Senate debate on Wednesday , Sen. David Vitter , R - La. , characterized the administration 's request to lawmakers 12 days ago as " crying ' Fire ! ' in a crowded theater , then claiming the only [ way out ] is to tear down the walls when there are many exit doors . "
Sen . Richard Shelby , R - Ala. , said the Senate will have " failed the American people " by acting hastily .
" I agree we need to do something .
... [ But ] we have n't spent any time figuring out whether we 've picked the best choice . "
Supporters of the bill say they hate the position they are in and are angry , too , but say it 's better to do something now than to let the credit crunch persist .
" There 's no doubt that there may be other plans out there that , had we had two or three or six months to develop ... might serve our purposes better , " said Obama during the floor debate .
" But we do n't have that kind of time .
And we can't afford to take a risk that the economy of the United States of America and , as a consequence , the worldwide economy could be plunged into a very , very deep hole . "
Potential costs
The tax provisions of the Senate bill - the bulk of which come from the addition of tax breaks from other legislation - may reduce federal tax revenue by $ 110 billion over 10 years , according to estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation .
More than half of that is due to the 1 - year extension of AMT relief .
The Congressional Budget Office said it cannot estimate the net budget effects of the troubled asset program because of the many unknowns about that piece of the bill .
However , the agency noted in a letter to lawmakers on Wednesday , it expects the program " would entail some net budget cost " but that it would be " substantially smaller than $ 700 billion . "
Overall , the CBO said , " the bill as a whole would increase the budget deficit over the next decade . "
All eyes on House
Now the fate of the bailout rests with the House .
" The reality has hit some members , " said House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank , D - Mass . , late Wednesday on CNN .
" The main change is reality - it 's not possible now to scoff at the predictions of doom if we do n't do anything . "
The lead House Republican , Rep. John Boehner , R - Ohio , was consulted on the Senate 's plans and gave his " green light , " spokesman Kevin Smith said .
" We believe we 'll have a better chance to pass this bill than the one that failed [ Monday ] , " he added .
The plan could attract House Republicans while simultaneously alienating bailout supporters among the Democrats because the tax cuts in the revenue bill are n't offset by spending cuts or increased revenues .
President Bush , following the Senate vote , said the bill was central to the " financial security " of the nation .
" The American people expect - and our economy demands - that the House pass this good bill this week and send it to my desk . "
People were wrong !

President - elect Barack Obama ’s transition team is flirting with creating a White House “ Climate Czar , ” but climate change crusader Al Gore says he does n’t want the job .
The Obama team declined to comment on such a post , even as environmentalists and power industry executives say it ’s being widely discussed inside the transition offices as a way to spur a clean energy industry , which Mr. Obama has promised will ween the U.S. from foreign oil and create millions of “ green jobs . ”
Obama transition chief John Podesta promoted a similar idea earlier in his role as president of the Center for American Progress , a liberal Washington think tank .
Mr. Podesta authored a white paper calling for an Energy Security Council within the White House to oversee climate change and clean energy initiatives .
The czar and the council would coordinate agencies , including the Energy and Interior departments and the Environmental Protection Agency .

• Obama picks team for economic summit
The obvious choice to lead the council is Mr. Gore , whose campaign to address climate change earned him the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize .
But the former vice president is taking a pass .
“ Former Vice President Gore does not intend to seek or accept any formal position in government , ” Gore spokeswoman Kalee Kreider said .
“ He feels very strong right now that the best thing for him to do is to build support for the bold changes that we have to make to solve the climate crisis . ”
Mr. Obama foreshadowed the new post on the campaign trail in April when he told a voter that Mr. Gore would be offered a special Cabinet post overseeing climate change .
“ Al Gore will be at the table and play a central part in us figuring out how we solve this problem , ” Mr. Obama said .
With Mr. Gore out of the running for an administration job , leading candidates for the post likely include former EPA chief Carol M. Browner , Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano and Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius .
Other names mentioned for czar or membership in the energy council include World Resources Institute President Jonathan Lash , former Pennsylvania Environment Secretary Kathleen McGinty and California Air Resources Board chief Mary D. Nichols .
The Obama transition team declined to comment on administration jobs or who would fill them , stressing instead the next president ’s commitment to fulfilling campaign promises for clean energy .
“ Obama has outlined an aggressive energy and climate agenda and will put the resources in place in his administration to achieve those goals , ” Obama spokeswoman Jen Psaki said .
Environmental advocacy groups are clamoring for the new White House post to raise the profile of energy and environmental policy .
“ There ’s clearly a pent - up demand for things that got blocked during the Bush years , ” Sierra Club spokesman Josh Dorner said .
Mr. Obama , taking a page from Mr. Gore ’s script , has argued that an energy policy strikes the confluence of economic , national security and environmental challenges facing the country .
“ Finding the new driver of our economy is going to be critical .
There´s no better driver that pervades all aspects of our economy than a new energy economy , ” Mr. Obama told Time magazine shortly before the election .
“ That ´s going to be my No. 1 priority when I get into office . ”

No doubt keeping the money flowing during a financial crisis is tough for many sectors of the economy , and Web 2.0 startups are n't excluded .
After all , some companies , such as social networking site TheLinkUp.com and video - on - demand provider Akimbo , did n't make it .
But the situation does n't have to be as dire as reports often make it out , with experts saying there are a number of ways to keep your Web 2.0 company running -- and even position it for success -- despite the downturn .
#1 : Concentrate on real value
When companies and consumers stop buying , it 's more important than ever to have a product that meets a need .
" A core principle for survival , which in practice is far less common than it would seem , is being able to articulate clear customer value , " Sean O'Driscoll , founder of CGT Consulting , and former general manager for community support at Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) , told InternetNews.com .
" Too many Web 2.0 tech and / or solution providers lack a verifiable or differentiated value proposition . "
O'Driscoll said many companies aim to do too many things and lose their focus .
" The temptation is to be a tool and therefore have broad usage scenarios , " he said .
" They want clear value attached to a clear business goal , and preferably with proven success stories . "
Anil Dash , chief evangelist for blogging software company Six Apart , said that when offering value , the product should be something worth paying a premium .
" Make sure you have something valuable enough so that people will get out that credit card and write you a check , " he told InternetNews.com .
At Six Apart , corporate clients such as Jupitermedia , this site 's parent company , rely on products such as Movable Type for its blogging platform .
Seth Sternberg , CEO of instant - messaging service Meebo , also viewed the downturn as an opportunity to offer value .
" If your product is one that people need -- make people money , save people money , give them a key piece of functionality -- they need you even more now , " Sternberg told InternetNews.com .
" Focus narrowly on your core capabilities , " Sternberg advised .
" Meebo 's core is Web live communication , so we keep ourselves narrowly focused on that , " he said .
" It enables us to get better utilization out of our available resources . "
For social networking giant Facebook , success in growing its user base has been due to the company 's focus on allowing users to share and connect , which led to rapid success .
" Focus on something that people will love , " Josh Elman , platform manager at Facebook , told InternetNews.com .
These days , Facebook is aiming to monetize its massive user base , a process that has n't always gone entirely smoothly .
Still , that does n't mean that the company does n't have sound advice on what advertisers are seeking .
" Make sure you 're providing a verticalized advertising experience that they 'll want to pay to reach , " Facebook 's Elman said .
# 2 : Aim for 18 months
Tim O'Shaughnessy 's company , LivingSocial , launched in February as a tool on Facebook that enables users to review everything from movies and books to restaurants and beer .
In July , the company secured $ 5 million in venture capital funding from Grotech Ventures and former AOL chairman Steve Case .
[ cob:Special_Report ]
As a CEO at the helm of a Web 2.0 startup , O'Shaughnessy said he believes a key factor in outlasting the downturn is reducing cash burn as much as possible to get through the downturn -- whether that means reducing headcount or pushing a sales cycle earlier in the company 's life .
" If you can live to fight to 18 months from now , you 're going to come up and half of your competition will have died and gone out of business , " he said .
According to Guy Kawasaki , venture capitalist at Garage Technology Ventures and co-founder of online media aggregator Alltop , running lean may mean reducing headcount in the business - development department .
" Fire the MBAs and business - development people , " he told InternetNews.com .
" In these times , there 's no time or money for ' strategic ' stuff .
Every employee is either making it , selling it , collecting it or supporting it , " Kawasaki explained .

A nit -picker this week .
And given the fact that we 're all remembering human rights , the Palestinians come to mind since they have precious few of them , and the Israelis because they have the luxury of a lot of them .
And Lord Blair , since he 'll be communing with God next week , might also reflect that he still – to his shame – has n't visited Gaza .
But the nit- picking has got to be our old friend United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 .
This , you 'll recall , was supposed to be the resolution that would guide all future peace efforts in the Middle East ; Oslo was supposed to have been founded on it and all sorts of other processes and summits and road maps .
It was passed in November 1967 , after Israel had occupied Gaza , the West Bank , East Jerusalem , the Sinai and Golan , and it emphasises " the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war " and calls for " withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Readers who know the problem here will be joined by those who will immediately pick it up .
The Israelis say that they are not required to withdraw from all the territories – because the word " all " is missing and since the definite article " the " is missing before the word " territories " , its up to Israel to decide which bits of the occupied territories it gives up and which bits it keeps .
Hence Israel can say it gave up Sinai in accordance with 242 but is going to keep East Jerusalem and much of the West Bank for its settlers .
Golan depends on negotiations with Syria .
And Gaza ?
Well , 242 does n't say anything about imprisoning one and a half million civilians because they voted for the wrong people .
No one in 1967 dreamed that the Israeli - Arab conflict would still be in ferocious progress 41 years later .
And as an Independent reader pointed out a couple of years ago , the Security Council clearly never intended the absence of a definite article to give Israel an excuse to stay in the West Bank .
Alas , our reader was wrong .
I 've been going back through my files on 242 and discovered a most elucidating paper by John McHugo , who was a visiting fellow at the Scottish Centre for International Law at Edinburgh University .
He points out that pro-Israeli lawyers have been saying for some years that " Resolution 242 unanimously called for withdrawal from ' territories ' rather than withdrawal from ' all the territories ' .
Its choice of words was deliberate ... they signify that withdrawal if required from some but not all the territories " .
McHugo is , so far as I know , the only man to re-examine the actual UN debates on 242 and they make very unhappy reading .
The French and Spanish versions of the text actually use the definite article .
But the Brits – apparently following a bit of strong - arm tactics from the Americans – did not use " the " .
Lord Caradon , our man at the UN , insisted on putting in the phrase about the " inadmissability of the acquisition of territory by war " in order to stop the Israelis claiming that they could cherry - pick which lands to return and which to hand on to .
Britain accepted Jordan 's rule over the West Back – the PLO were still shunned as super - terrorists at the time – but it did no good .
Abba Eban , Israel 's man on the East River , did his best to persuade Caradon to delete both " the " and the bit about the inadmissability of territory through war .
He won the first battle , but not the second .
That great American statesman George Ball was to recount how , when the Arabs negotiated over 242 in early November of 1967 – at the Waldorf Astoria ( these guys knew how to pick the swankiest hotels for political betrayal ) – the US ambassador to the UN , Arthur Goldberg , told King Hussein that America " could not guarantee that everything would be returned by Israel " .
The Arabs distrusted Goldberg because he was known to be pro-Zionist , but Hussein was much comforted when US Secretary of State Dean Rusk assured him in Washington that the US " did not approve of Israeli retention of the West Bank " .
Hussein was further encouraged when he met President Johnson who told him that Israeli withdrawal might take place in " six months " .
Goldberg further boosted his confidence .
" Do n't worry .
They 're on board , " he said of the Israelis .
Ho ho .
It 's intriguing to note that several other nations at the UN were troubled by the absence of " the " .
The Indian delegate , for example , pointed out that the resolution referred to " all the territories – I repeat all the territories – occupied by Israel ... " while the Soviet Union ( which knew all about occupying other people 's countries ) stated that " we understand the decision to mean the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all , and we repeat , all territories belonging to Arab states and seized by Israel ... " .
President Johnson rebuffed the Soviets and bluntly refused to put the word " all " in the resolution .
Bulgaria , not surprisingly , said much the same as the Soviets .
Brazil expressed reservations – rightly so – about " the clarity of the wording " .
The Argentinians " would have preferred a clearer text " .
In other words , the future tragedy was spotted at the time .
But we did nothing .
The Americans had stitched it up and the Brits went along with it .
The Arabs were not happy but foolishly – and typically – relied on Caradon 's assurances that " all " the territories was what 242 meant , even if it did n't say so .
Israel still fought hard to get rid of the " inadmissability " bit , even when it had got " the " out .
Ye gods !
Talk about sewing the seeds of future catastrophe .
Well , Colin Powell , when he was George W Bush 's secretary of state , gutlessly told US diplomats to call the West Bank " disputed " rather than " occupied " – which suited the Israelis just fine although , as McHugo pointed out , the Israelis might like to consider what would happen if the Arabs talked about those bits of Israel which were not included in the original UN partition plan as " disputed " as well .
Besides , George W's infamous letter to Ariel Sharon , saying he could , in effect , keep large bits of the West Bank , set the seal on Johnson 's deception .
McHugo mischievously adds that a mandatory warning in a city that says " dogs must be kept on the lead near ponds in the park " clearly means that " all " dogs and " all " ponds are intended .
These days , of course , we use walls to keep dogs out .
Palestinians , too .
Some guys need the Mach 5 to go fast .

Raw milk is illegal in many countries as it can be contaminated with potentially harmful microbes .
Contamination can also spoil the milk , making it taste bitter and turn thick and sticky .
Now scientists have discovered new species of bacteria that can grow at low temperatures , spoiling raw milk even when it is refrigerated .
According to research published in the November issue of the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology , the microbial population of raw milk is much more complex than previously thought .
" When we looked at the bacteria living in raw milk , we found that many of them had not been identified before , " said Dr Malka Halpern from the University of Haifa , Israel .
" We have now identified and described one of these bacteria , Chryseobacterium oranimense , which can grow at cold temperatures and secretes enzymes that have the potential to spoil milk . "
New technologies are being developed to reduce the initial bacterial counts of pasteurized milk to very low levels .
Most enzymes will be denatured at the high temperatures used during pasteurisation , which means they will stop working .
However , the heat - stable enzymes made by cold - tolerant bacteria will still affect the flavour quality of fluid milk and its products .
Because of this , research into cold - tolerant bacteria and the spoilage enzymes they produce is vital .
" Milk can be contaminated with many different bacteria from the teat of the cow , the udder , milking equipment and the milking environment , " said Dr Halpern .
" Milk is refrigerated after collection to limit the growth of microbes .
During refrigeration , cold - tolerant , or psychrotolerant , bacteria that can grow at 7 °C dominate the milk flora and play a leading role in milk spoilage .
Although we have not yet determined the impact on milk quality of C. oranimense and two other novel species ( C. haifense and C. bovis ) that were also identified from raw milk samples , the discovery will contribute to our understanding the physiology of these organisms and of the complex environmental processes in which they are involved .
There is still a lot to learn about the psychrotolerant bacterial flora of raw milk . "
There is an ongoing debate about the benefits and risks of drinking unpasteurised milk .
Some people believe the health benefits resulting from the extra nutrient content of raw milk outweigh the risk of ingesting potentially dangerous microbes , such as Mycobacterium bovis , which can cause tuberculosis , and Salmonella species .
Because of these risks , many countries have made the sale of unpasteurised milk illegal .
Pasteurisation involves heating milk to around 72 °C for 15 - 20 seconds in order to reduce the number of microbes in the liquid so they are unlikely to cause disease .
Some bacteria produce extracellular enzymes that are remarkably heat tolerant and can resist pasteurisation .
Lipase enzymes cause flavour defects and proteases can lead to bitterness and reduced yields of soft cheese .
Raw milk is consumed in rural areas of Europe and is also available in large cities .
Distribution of unpasteurised milk is legal in England , Wales and Northern Ireland but illegal in Scotland .
There are around 275 establishments in England that are approved by the Food Standards Agency to sell raw milk .
However , the green - top bottles must display a warning that indicates the content has not been heat - treated and may contain harmful organisms .
Furthermore , farmers are not allowed to sell unpasteurised dairy products if their herd is suspected to be infected with bovine tuberculosis .
" In Israel , dairy companies estimate that cold - tolerant bacteria can cause a 10 % loss of milk fats and proteins .
When researchers looked at these bacterial communities , they found that 20 % of the bacteria isolated were found to be novel species and 5 % of these were members of the genus Chryseobacterium , " said Dr Halpern .
" Because of their effect on milk quality , it is important that we develop sensitive and efficient tools to monitor the presence of these cold - tolerant bacteria . "

OAK RIDGE , Tenn. , Nov. 11 ( UPI ) --
The Cray XT Jaguar supercomputer at the U.S. Energy Department 's Oak Ridge National Laboratory is now the world 's fastest open research supercomputer .
Oak Ridge engineers increased the system 's computing power to a peak 1.64 petaflops -- one quadrillion mathematical calculations per second -- making Jaguar the world 's first petaflop system dedicated to open , as opposed to classified , research .
Scientists said they have already used the upgraded Jaguar to complete an unprecedented superconductivity calculation that achieved a sustained performance of more than 1.3 petaflops .

New Chip Could Counteract Cell Phone Radiation
December 12th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
I do n’t know about you , but I constantly picture radiation penetrating my brain when I ’m talking on my cell phone .
Omega Pharma , a Belgian company specializing in health products , claims it has created a device that can calm my fears — a chip that counteracts mobile phone radiation .
According to Omega , testing of the chip showed that it quelled symptoms like headaches and loss of concentration that are thought to be associated with cell phone use .
The E - waves phone chip was released in Belgium yesterday for 38.95 euros ( $ 50.10 ) .

The Huygens probe has captured an image of what may be the first drop of liquid ever observed on an extraterrestrial surface .
The photo is evidence that liquids may exist on the surface of other planets and moons , not just frozen lakes .
And liquid is more likely habitat for extraterrestrial life .
Among the pictures snapped by the Huygens probe after landing on Saturn 's moon Titan in 2005 , one appears to show a dewdrop made of methane that briefly formed on the edge of the probe itself ( indicated by arrow at bottom of image on right ) .
Scientists think heat from the probe caused humid air to rise and condense on the cold edge of the craft .
Though Huygens may have helped produce it , the methane drop is still the first liquid directly detected at a surface anywhere beyond Earth .
Like Earth , Titan has clouds , lakes and river channels , and it may be the only other place in the solar system where liquid evaporates from the surface and returns as rain .
" Aside from Earth , it 's the most exciting world there is , " said lead author Erich Karkoschka of the University of Arizona in Tucson .
The Cassini space probe , which took data from above the moon after separating from the Huygens lander , detected what scientists believe are lakes of liquid methane on Titan 's surface .
Microbes that eat methane thrive on Earth , and scientists think pools of methane could be comfortable homes for similar organisms on Titan .
Because Titan 's current atmosphere is a lot like the early Earth 's , the lakes could be a lab for studying the origins and early evolution of life .
Astronomers have speculated since they found methane in the atmosphere in 1983 about whether the moon 's methane rain falls in violent thunderstorms , light drizzles or some other form .
So far , no one has caught it on camera .
The hundreds of images snapped by Huygens , from the time it hit the atmosphere until its power ran out an hour after it landed , revealed only faint , wispy clouds that looked nothing like rain clouds , Karkoschka said .
None of the images showed evidence that it had rained during the previous few years , according to an analysis to be published in the journal Icarus .
And some images suggested that Titan ’s lower atmosphere was full of small dust particles , which would have been cleared out by rain .
But the scientists noticed light splotches in some of the pictures that had n't been there moments before .
Some of them had spots that initially looked like raindrops because of their uniform size and smooth edges , but analysis showed they were most likely electronic imprints created by cosmic rays .
However , Karkoschka said , " One of those spots was so big that it really can not be a cosmic ray . "
He concluded that it was a real , short - lived dewdrop , so close to the camera that it must have condensed on a cold metal shield designed to protect the camera lens from direct sunlight .
Robert West , a planetary scientist at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena , California , thinks the dewdrop is " a cute observation , " but he 's more interested in the lack of rainfall .
" There are reports in the literature that concluded there is a drizzle going on near the surface , " he said .
" The fact that Huygens did n’t find anything is significant . "

A man dressed as American gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson for Halloween was stabbed in the neck with a broken beer bottle last night by three masked men who did n't like his costume .
At 3:34 a.m. , police were called to College and Bathurst streets after a man was found on the ground with a stab wound to his neck .
The victim was walking east on College when he came across three men who insulted his costume , police say .
" They were making fun of his costume , " said Staff Sgt. Paul Hargan .
The victim continued walking when the suspects approached him from behind and swore at him before one of the suspects , dressed as Jason from Friday the 13th , stabbed the victim in the neck with a broken beer bottle .
The suspects ran through crowds of people partying , Hargan said .
A bouncer at a nearby club tied a shirt around the victim 's neck and applied pressure to the open wound .
The victim was sent to a nearby hospital .
Because the suspects were masked , police do n't have a description .
Police are looking for witnesses .
" It was a very busy night with people out partying so someone must have seen what happened , " Hargan said .
Anyone with information should call police at 416- 808-1400 or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 416-222-TIPS .

Write a Review
The 14th Amendment was not properly ratified by the states of the Union .
Like the 16th and 17th Amendments , it is a law that does not exist .
We must begin forcing the dialogue in political discussions , meetings and talk radio to these key , core issues .
They are critical to the Unseen Hand and continuing to yap about the symptoms instead of the treatment wo n't get the issues out into the public domain .
The following is a reprint from the Free Enterprise Society 's newsletter , May 1989 .
It is authored by former Arizona State Senator Wayne Stump :
To whom it may concern :
" As my interest in constitutional law has expanded over the past years and the word of my interest spread , I have happily become the recipient of Patriot papers , circulars and letters from all over this great land .
Many folks involved in the research and use of the principles involved in our " Republican " form of government have become personal friends .
These friendships have enabled a great deal of activity , from diverse sources , to develop together for comparison and evaluation .
I have , from time to time , endeavored to pass information , on a limited basis , from one source to another for enlightenment of individuals on general issues .
This time , however , it would appear that the emerging principles are so fundamental to our form of government , and of such magnitude as to encompass every man , woman and child in our united Republics , that one wonders how they could have ever become obscured .
The principles to which I refer are those heralded in the Preamble of the Constitution , which beings : " We , the People .... " and continues " .... secure the blessings of Liberty to
Ourselves and our Posterity . "
These words , without question , were used to represent the interests of the signers of the Constitutional contract .
That is to say , " The Founding Fathers and their Posterity . "
When one reflects on this meaning of " We the People " it would seem to mean that the Preamble People were a class of people who , with the aid of God , originally secured their Liberty with the protections they constructed into the Organic Constitution and the first ten Amendments thereto .
This , being the case , tends to bring the import of the 14th
Amendment into focus .
The 13th and 14th Amendments , as we have been taught , were fashioned to give freedom to slaves and to secure for them privileges of citizenship .
Our Educators , however , neglected to explain that the 14th Amendment creation was that of a new " class " of citizenship .
It becomes clear when one studies the wording of the Organic Constitution , that the original people cited in the " Preamble " could not lose the " Blessings " secured thereby as long as the Constitution was intact , because our Constitution is perpetual .
The 14th Amendment , then had to create another " position " for those persons for whom it was created .
Scrutiny of the 14th Amendment reveals that persons encompassed thereby were " subject " to jurisdiction thereof and may not " question " the validity of the public debt .
Big " C " -- Little " c "
When this Nation was founded each of the individual States of this union had their own Citizens ( spelled with a capital " C " ) .
Today , we have a second class of citizen ( note the small " c " ) , the 14th Amendment citizen .
In law , every letter in a word is important .
A word capitalized may mean one specific thing , while the same word without capitalization may mean something entirely different .
In the case of Citizenship ( or citizenship ) , this is more certainly true .
There is a clear distinction between national and State citizenship , U.S. citizenship does not entitle citizen of the privileges and Immunities of the Citizen of the State .
K. Tashiro v. Jordan , 256 P 545 , affirmed 49 S Ct 47 , 278 US 123
Black 's Law Dictionary , 5th Edition , agrees with the distinction between these different classes of ( C) itizenship :
There are two Privileges and Immunities Clauses in the federal Constitution and Amendments , the first being found in Art. IV , and the second in the 14th Amendment .
Section 1 , second sentence , clause 1 .
The provision in Art. IV states that " The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States , while the 14th Amendment provides that " No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States .
Note the lack of capitalization in the wording used in the 14th Amendment , this specifically means that the words " citizens , privileges , immunities " are not the same as in Article IV .
The State of California was admitted into the Union of the United States in 1949 ; 9 Statutes at Large 452 .
It was admitted on an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatsoever .
The State of California was required to have its own Citizens , who were first State Citizens , then as a consequence of State Citizenship were American Citizens , known as Citizens of the United States .
There was no specific class as this , but for traveling and protection by the United States government while out of the country , they were generally called Citizens of the United States .
The Constitution for the United States of America ( 1787 ) used the term " Citizen of the United States " in Article I , Section 2 , ( capital " C " ) , and numerous other sections .
This referred to the Sovereign Political Body of State Citizens , this Citizen is entitled to all the Privileges and Immunities of the Citizens of the several States under Article IV .
Congress utilized the same term " citizen of the United States " qualifying it with a small " c " to distinguish " federal citizen " in the so - called 14th Amendment .
These " citizens " have only statutory rights granted by Congress .
Thus , Congress and most of the Judiciary , without distinction being properly brought forth have made rulings based upon the federal " citizens " who are resident in a State , not State Citizens domiciled within their own State .
The statement by Chief Justice Taney in Dred Scott v. Stanford , 19 How .
393 , 422 , in defining the term " persons " the Judge stated :
...... persons who are not recognized as Citizens , " .
See also American and Ocean Ins. Co. V. Canter , 1 Pet. 511 , which also distinguishes " persons " and " Citizens . "
These were the persons that were the object of the 14th Amendment , to give to this class of native born " persons " who were " resident " in the union of the United States citizenship , and authority to place other than the white race within the special category of " citizen of the United States . "
To overcome the statement in Dred Scott , supra , that only white people were Citizens , and all other persons were only " residents " without citizenship of the United States , Congress then passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866 , 14 STAT 27 .
The Act of Congress called the Civil Rights Act , 14 U.S. Stats .
At Large , pg 27 , which was the forerunner of the 14th Amendment , amply shows the intent of Congress :
All persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign power , excluding Indians not taxed , are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States , and such citizens of every race and color ... shall have the same right in every state and territory of the United States ... to full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property as is enjoyed by white citizens ,
( Again , note the lack of capitalization )
This was the intent of Congress ; not to infringe upon the Constitution or the state of the de jure Citizens of the several states .
It was never the intent of the 14th Amendment to subvert the States ' authority or that of the Constitution as it relates to the status of the de jure State Citizens .
People v. Washington , 36 C 658 , 661 ( 1869 ) over ruled on other grounds ; French v. Barber , 181 US 324 ; MacKenzie v. Hare , 60 L Ed 297
At this point , I anticipate a lot of folks reading this article are going into shock as they grab for the Constitution to check out the phrase and " question " of the validity of the public debt .
Let me help you by reference to section 4 of the 14th Amendment and caution you to hold onto your chair .
It would seen then , from the foregoing , that there are two " classes " of citizens in this country :
1. Preamble Citizen : persons born or naturalized within the meaning of the Organic Constitution and inhabiting one of the several Republics of the United States who enjoy full citizenship of the Organic Constitution as Citizens of the Republic which they inhabit .
2. Citizen " subject " : persons enfranchised by the 14th Amendment who are born or naturalized in the United States within the meaning of the 14th Amendment and are residing therein as a United States citizen and are enjoying the privileges and immunities of " limited " citizenship .
It is not my intention , in this article , to become technically involved in citations for the information introduced here , but only to outline an overview for those folks who claim " Constitutional Rights " and then wonder why the legislatures , courts and police do n't respond in " kind " to these claims .
When one separates the classes among their appropriate dividing lines , it appears that :
1. Preamble Citizens :
a . Have direct personal access to a God inspired , original Constitution and it's restraints on government for the protection of life , liberty and property .
b. Have direct personal access to the Article III courts known as " justice courts " which deal with law .
2. Citizen " subjects " :
a . Have representative access to the first eight amendments as purviewed by the 14th Amendment .
b.
Have representative access to Article 1 courts , provided by legislature , that are known as " legislative courts " which deal with statutes and are served by bar members , or officers of the court , known as lawyers .
My concern here , stems from my observation that folks involved with the preservation of our beloved Constitution are unaware of the " limited " citizenship created by the 14th Amendment .
Additionally , these folks do n't realize that they are , or have voluntarily become , citizen subjects because of their acceptance of the " benefits " of limited citizenship .
The main " benefit " that I will mention here is Social Security .
There are many other " benefits " such as the benefit of " regulation by licensing " that give control of your children to the State by making them " wards of the State " and subject to the " regulation " of the " legislative courts " by statute , etc .
The intention of this article is to point out the apparent difference in the classes of citizenship and the difference in the courts in serving these classes .
I have noticed that , in many publications , and also personal conversations , people convey their feelings of alarm or despair in finding that " the court " or " government " is in violation of the Constitution without realizing that the court they are addressing is a legislative court and does not hear cases based on justice , but rather , cases based only on statute law .
The reality of the following example of statute law is that the statute specifies a speed limit to be held at 30 m.p.h .
The only question that can be entertained by the court is that of whether the accused did in fact go faster than the limit .
That is a yes or no question .
The accused cannot try to tell the court that it was a six lane highway on a clear day with no traffic in sight and that his speed of 60 m.p.h. did not injure anyone .
The court is not obligated to hear that argument as it is not a justice court .
The final question then would seem to be " where is the article III " justice " court and who can use it ?
I am very aware that many of the folks reading this article are not going to be able to use the justice courts , as they have natural or acquired deficiencies that will not allow them Preamble Citizenship , but for the people endowed with the proper qualifications , it appears that the straight line approach of barring jurisdiction of legislative courts ( tribunals ) through recision of contracts and declaration of Article
IV , Section 2 status is essential , as it appears that only Preamble People can exercise the offices as set forth in the Organic Constitution .
Additionally , it seems that this same class ( Preamble People ) is the only class that may claim the protection of the first ten Amendments as written .
As the truth of our personal status , and the responsibilities connected therewith unfolds , it becomes clear that the Article III " justice " court must be accessed individually by the person claiming the right .
At present it is being done by common law filing of actions " in law " with the County Recorders who have been found to be " ex officio " clerks of the County courts .
The authority for the exercise of the " justice " office is found in the 9th Article of Amendment and I believe all State Constitutions have similar provisions for the Preamble Citizens ( also known as de jure Citizens ) .
I will not go farther with an attempt toward instruction but will leave this in the hands of the many patriots engaged in the research of these developments .
My mission in presenting this information in a general sense is to help the unfortunate individuals who repeatedly bash themselves against the rocks of misinformation or ignorance in vain , though laudable , effort to protect our beloved Constitution .
I hope I have achieved this end . "
What now for California ?
In May , its Supreme Court announced a right to same - sex marriage .
Gays and lesbians rushed to take advantage of the opportunity ; by early November , 18,000 such marriages had been performed .
But on Nov. 5 , they stopped .
By a 52 - 47 percent margin , California voters approved Proposition 8 , an amendment to the state constitution prohibiting same - sex marriage .
Immediately , gay rights supporters filed lawsuits asking to overturn the ruling .
Critics are calling Proposition 8 an illegal constitutional " revision , " fundamentally altering the guarantee of equality – not a more limited " amendment . "
This suit raises a serious question :
When should a majority have the power to take away a constitutional right granted by a court ?
It 's a question that forces us to think about why we have constitutional rights in the first place , and why they are enforced by judges .
But it is not simply a theoretical puzzle .
All of us enjoy constitutional rights , and most of us are at some point in a minority .
All of us could be affected .
American constitutional practice has generally been to expand rights over time , both by amendment and by judicial decision .
Amendments to the federal Constitution , for example , gave women and minorities the right to vote .
Judicial decisions have expanded the constitutional guarantee of equality to protect more and more groups .
Some of these decisions remain intensely controversial , but none have been overruled by a federal amendment .
Of course , amending the federal Constitution is difficult .
It requires approval by " supermajorities " : two - thirds in the House and the Senate and three - quarters of state legislatures .
Federal rights cannot be taken away by a simple majority vote .
Because of this requirement , judicial decisions enforcing the federal Constitution 's equality guarantee have followed a relatively consistent pattern .
At one point in time , a particular practice – say , the racial segregation of public schools or the exclusion of women from the practice of law – is so widely accepted that it seems beyond challenge .
Judges are not likely to strike the practice down , and if they did , the backlash might well be strong enough to create a constitutional amendment .
Some time later , the practice becomes controversial .
It still enjoys majority support – otherwise it would likely be undone through ordinary lawmaking – but it no longer has the allegiance of a supermajority .
It is at this time that judges tend to act in order to protect the freedoms of the minority , striking down the practice as unjustified discrimination .
The decision may be intensely controversial .
It may even be the target of majority disapproval .
But because there is no longer a supermajority , the decision is safe .
As attitudes evolve , the practice comes to seem outrageous .
Almost no one , nowadays , would argue for racial segregation of schools or a ban on female lawyers .
At this point , the judicial decision is no longer controversial .
If a majority could overrule a judicial decision , the process would frequently be stopped by that majority vote .
Judicial interventions against discrimination would just not succeed .
Regardless of where you stand on same - sex marriage , what 's troubling for US citizens in the California case is the idea that an equality guarantee could not be effectively enforced against the will of a majority .
The point of such a guarantee is precisely to protect minorities from discrimination at the hands of a majority .
It would be somewhat surprising , then , if California allowed judicial decisions enforcing the state equality guarantee to be overruled by a simple majority vote .
In fact , as the gay - rights supporters ' suit indicates , it is not clear that it does .
Under the California constitution , " amendments " can be approved by a simple majority vote .
But " revisions , " which make substantial changes , require approval by a supermajority – two - thirds of both houses of the legislature – before being submitted to voters .
Supporters framed the same - sex marriage ban as an amendment , when really it has the makings of a revision .
It makes sense to require supermajority support to overrule a judicial decision that grants rights to a minority .
It shows that the judges were so out of step with society that they were probably wrong .
But a simple majority does not show that , and the constitution would not afford meaningful protection if it could be overruled at the will of the majority .
As the opposition to same - sex marriage in California has shrunk , simple majorities should not be able to reverse decisions made in the name of equality .
This is not an argument that the California court was correct .
The battle for public opinion goes on .
But letting the court 's decision stand against the disapproval of a simple majority is not only sensible , it protects the minority rights of future generations .
Unpopular decisions are the price of constitutional rights .
• Kermit Roosevelt teaches law at the University of Pennsylvania 's law school .
Am Dienstag wurden auf Anordnung eines Berliner Amtsrichters die Wohn - und Arbeitsräume des Journalisten und Telepolis - Autors Burkhard Schröder von der Polizei durchsucht und sein Arbeitscomputer beschlagnahmt .
Der Durchsuchungsbeschluss stützte sich auf den Verdacht eines Vergehens nach den Paragraphen 40 und 52 des im April 2008 novellierten Waffengesetzes .
Paragraph 40 verbietet unter anderem , " zur Herstellung " von Waffen " anzuleiten " .
Unter den Waffenbegriff fallen nach Angaben des Bundesinnenministeriums auch Sprengstoffe .
Schröder wird vorgeworfen , im Internet einen
Text mit einer Anleitung zur Herstellung von Explosivstoffen verbreitet zu haben .
Die Anordnung der Durchsuchung sei im Hinblick auf den Tatvorwurf und die Stärke des Tatverdachts " verhältnismäßig " , weniger schwerwiegende Maßnahmen zur Erreichung des Untersuchungszieles seien " beim jetzigen Stand der Ermittlungen nicht ersichtlich " , heißt es in dem Durchsuchungsbefehl .
Schröder hat sich schon seit Jahren , vor allem im Rahmen von Recherchen über Neonazis , mit dem Thema der Veröffentlichung von Anleitungen zum Bombenbau im Internet beschäftigt .
Der
Text steht nach seinen Aussagen in diesem Zusammenhang : " Er diente im besten Sinne der staatsbürgerlichen Aufklärung . "
Es sei nicht um eine " Anleitung " zum Bombenbau gegangen , es habe sich um einen theoretischen Text gehandelt .
Schröder hatte auf seiner persönlichen Website einen Textbeitrag aus dem Usenet von 1995 wiedergegeben , darüber hinaus allerdings , wie er sagt , einige " Rezepturen " für Explosivstoffe veröffentlicht .
Diese würden aber im Beschluss des Amtsgerichts nicht erwähnt .
Zudem wurden die mit einem Disclaimer versehen , der Text sei " ausschließlich zu Informationszwecken veröffentlicht " worden , " die praktische Umsetzung " sei " teilweise unter Strafe verboten " .
Schröder will nicht klein beigeben , es geht ihm um grundsätzliche Fragen .
Wenn bereits eine Dokumentation verboten sei , dann würde dies die Spielräume von Journalisten erheblich einschränken .
Der zuständige Amtsrichter war am Mittwoch zu keiner Stellungnahme bereit .

Mika Brzezinski Mugged in Washington D.C. ( VIDEO )
Mika Brzezinski , co-host of the Morning Joe show on MSNBC was mugged as she exited an upscale Washington D.C. hotel yesterday .
Joe Scarborough was livid .
Mika is apparently embarrassed and did n't want Joe to give the details to viewers but that did n't stop her working partner from unleashing a rant .
He reported that a guy walked across the street straight for her and demanded $ 20 and nothing would happen to her .
All she had was $ 6 .
Joe was disgusted that the doorman was n't policing the immediate area outside of the hotel .
Scarborough 's morning guest just happened to be D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty .
Put on the spot , he told Joe that the incident would be investigated .
" This is what mayors do .
We are going to look at it and work with the hotel and the police department . "
Apparently Brzezinski was n't holding any grudges as evidenced by her on - air comments after the fact .
Check out photos and video below :
The Chemistry of the cell includes these reactions :
(1) Anode Side : 2H2 è 4H + + 4 e -
(2) Cathode Side : O2 + 4H + + 4e - è 2H2O
(3) Net Reaction : 2H2 + O2 è 2H2O
In one full cycle of the fuel cell , hydrogen gas is first pushed along the etched channels of the anode where it comes in contact with the platinum catalyst .
This platinum catalyst splits the hydrogen molecules into positively charged hydrogen ions and negatively charged electrons ( Hydrogen Fuel Cells , 2006 ) .
These positively charged hydrogen ions are then allowed to pass through the Proton Exchange Membrane while the electrons continue to build up on the anode .
The electrons can only pass on to the cathode through an external circuit , were they can be utilized as an electrical source .
This electron flow can power anything from cell phones to automobiles if managed correctly .
Meanwhile , on the cathode of the cell , oxygen gas is being split apart into oxygen atoms from coming in contact with the catalyst coated on the cathode .
These atoms have a strong attraction for the hydrogen ions passing through the proton exchange membrane and bond with them along with the electrons flowing over from the anode to form water .
The water is directed out of the system and the hydrogen and oxygen gases that did not react are recycled back into the inward flow of fuel into the cell .

Snakes kill more people than either dengue fever or skin cancer , according to a new worldwide estimate .
See an interactive map of the areas affected
Cobras , vipers , black mambas and other venomous snakes take between 20,000 and 94,000 lives each year , and bite another 421,000 to 1,841,000 people .
However , the economic toll of snakebites could be far greater than many infectious diseases , says Janaka de Silva , an epidemiologist at the University of Kelaniya in Ragama , Sri Lanka , who spearheaded the new report .

De Silva is hoping the study will raise the profile of snakebites .
“ We want to get the snake bite classified as a neglected tropical disease , ” he says .
His team trolled published papers , national and regional health data , and hospital records to establish a snake bite death rate for 169 countries where attacks are a problem .
Disabling bite
Because snake bite data for many of these countries , particularly in Africa , did not exist , the team extrapolated figures based on data from neighbouring countries , and produced an upper and lower estimate for snake bite victims .
Snakebites were most common in tropical areas , which are generally home to more venomous snakes than temperate regions .
However , increased rural development in many of these countries also fosters more contact between people and snakes .
Factor in dispersed healthcare centres with little money to stock anti-venom or other treatments , and you have the makings of an epidemic , de Silva says .
Reliance on traditional treatments can also result in higher death rates in some countries , he says .
And while worldwide snake bite deaths pale in comparison to pandemics such as malaria and HIV , or chronic disease such as cancer , many victims of snakebites suffer physical maiming for the rest of their lives .
“ Disability is much higher than in infectious disease , ” de Silva says .
“ In infectious diseases you either die or recover . ”

PHILADELPHIA —
As the setting sun filtered through red and yellow leaves , West Laurel Hill Cemetery ’s Nevin Mann stuck a shovel in the ground .
He was planting a tree .
And , in a way , nurturing the seed of an idea : a shift in the American way of death — a departure from chemicals , concrete vaults and manicured plots .
Mann , cemetery president and CEO , was ceremoniously opening a 3 ﻿1/2 - acre “ natural ” burial ground at the 1869 Lower Merion cemetery , where 100,000 people are buried , including a Titanic survivor and sculptor Alexander Stirling Calder .
No embalmed bodies will be allowed in this area , which has room for 400 .
Only untreated wood and biodegradable shrouds can be used .
Markers will be little more than fieldstones ; Bringhurst Funeral Home , which is on site , will help families conduct at - home funerals and make caskets .
Each year , along with their dearly departed , Americans bury 827,060 gallons of embalming fluid and more than 30 million board feet of timber , according to the Green Burial Council , an advocacy and certification organization in New Mexico .
Its founder , Joe Sehee , says we bury enough steel to rebuild the Golden Gate Bridge , and enough concrete vaults — to keep the ground over graves from sinking , which makes maintenance easier — to pave a highway halfway across the United States .
“ A lot of people do n’t want to feel like their last act is one of pollution , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think people have embraced conventional funeral options as much as tolerated them . ”
Now people are being buried in coffins made of wicker or bamboo .
In Ecopods of recycled paper .
Even in simple shrouds .
A San Francisco company offers them in linen , silk and ethnic textiles .
Green burial sites even include forests , grasslands and other natural areas — with the burial money helping to keep the land undeveloped .
Markers might be non-existent , with GPS coordinates the only thing guiding loved ones to the spot .
Sehee founded the certifying group in 2005 .
So far , the council has approved seven casket and urn companies , more than a dozen cemeteries , a couple of cremation - disposition programs and nearly 200 funeral - service providers .
Though still just a tiny part of the $ 11 billion annual U.S. funeral industry , green burials and funerals are gaining ground , industry officials say , because of the growth of a broader green ethic .
“ It ’s a great movement , ” said Ellen Wynn McBrayer , spokeswoman for the National Funeral Directors Association and a Georgia undertaker who is “ heading in that direction ” herself .
“ Some religions , and some people , prefer ashes to ashes , dust to dust . ”
True , some are repulsed by the idea of not embalming .
But in a 2007 AARP funeral survey , one - fifth of respondents said they were interested in something more eco-friendly .
At West Laurel Hill , people had been asking about green funerals , Mann said after the opening this month .
“ We took the position of , if people want to do it , we ought to figure out how to help them . ”
Indeed , green burials are also seen as one more way people are taking back hallowed rituals , loosely akin to outdoor weddings and birthing at home with a midwife .
Some have sneered that only among baby boomers , so obsessed with youth , could the idea of a green funeral gain traction .
They would n’t so much die as be replanted .
But Liz Cohen , a hospice social worker from Princeton , sees it as “ a true return to the earth , letting our spirits go where they go , and letting our bodies help to preserve life . ”
Prices for funerals , traditional or green , range widely , so it ’s hard to compare .
But Sehee said an eco - death could cost about half of a traditional funeral , or $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 .
Advocates say it ’s not just a way to cheap out .
Direct cremation — without embalming — is still the least expensive .
Among all the “ new ” green burial grounds is a small wooded area deep in the Pinelands , near Tuckahoe , N.J .
Dating to the 1700s , the Steelmantown Cemetery belonged to a Southern Baptist congregation that did not allow embalming or vaults .
The church burned in the 1950s and gradually was forgotten .
Litter piled up .
But housing developer Ed Bixby knew about it .
His mother had belonged to the church .
And his infant brother had been buried there in a wicker basket in 1956 .
It ’s a long story , but Bixby now owns the one - acre cemetery .
He has protected it with a deed restriction , and plans to expand it onto an adjacent 7.5 acres .
“ Everything seems to come around in this life , ” he said .
“ All of a sudden , here we are , back to the way it was . ”
Bob Fertig , owner of the Fertig Funeral Home in Mullica Hill , has handled some of the services .
He ’s seen family and friends carry a loved one to the grave , dug with a shovel .
“ To watch the family be a part of that … to have them help lower the body in the ground , and then watch them as they replace the dirt .
. . .
It ’s a very profound , moving experience , ” he said .
“ We , as a funeral home , decided we wanted to be a part of this . ”
Among the many calamitous events that have marked the current global financial crisis , the U.S. government seized the bank Washington Mutual late last month in what was described as “ by far the largest bank failure in American history . ”
For the generations of people , like me , who grew up thinking of the Great Depression as an historical event — something essentially unrepeatable , like say the Black Plague — it ’s something of a shocker that a Depression - style implosion on the scale of WaMu could even take place in the 21st Century .
Dramatic reversals of business fortune are a reminder that the constants of commercialized life ( in my view , we ’re almost all of us living highly commercialized existences ) are n’t quite as untouchable as we thought .
The concept of “ too big to fail ” is under siege at the moment .
The fact that a company , product or service is so clearly dominant and relied upon is no guarantee of its survival .
In particular , I make this point in regards to Web applications , cloud computing , putting your data online — whatever you want to call it .
Over the past decade , consumers have been relying on Web - hosted services to house their information more and more , and on independent stores of data on their personal computers less and less .
Forget PCs even .
It ’s no secret that vanishingly few people are relying on personally maintained copies of records that exist in the home , like say a checkbook register , too .
Many of you reading this right now probably rely on some form of Web application for your email , spreadsheets , word processing , finances , or even to run your business .
And that ’s just the productivity side : think for a moment about all of the value you ’ve created in the social networks you ’ve built on say Linked In , or the narratives you ’ve weaved on Flickr , or the conversations you ’ve had on Facebook , or the journaling you ’ve done at Tumblr .
It ’s almost all online , and very little of it is on your computer .
Fair Weather Finances
In optimistic financial climates , trusting the cloud seems like a fine idea .
The fact that many small businesses store their mission critical project information in a tool like Basecamp makes a lot of sense because the good folks at 37signals have demonstrated themselves to be reliable and trustworthy keepers of that data , even as ( or especially as ) their business has grown exponentially .
Consumers who manage their personal finances through a tool like Mint are reassured by the strong venture backing and public support standing behind those startups .
And if you do anything using Google Docs , there ’s good reason to feel secure too — their size and future seem soundly protected .
Just consider a moment though : today ’s market capitalization for Google stands at the robust figure of US $ 107 billion , which few would argue qualifies as ginormous .
On the other hand , at the time of its failure , WaMu was said to have US $ 307 billion worth of assets on its books .
And still the bank collapsed .
In my view , it ’s a given that some of these Web businesses will fail .
Personally , I doubt it will be Google , but after watching trillions of dollars of wealth vanish in the market over the past several weeks , I tend to doubt Google ’s potential for implosion a little less today than I did six months ago .
As for smaller players , who knows if they will survive or not ?
The size of a company is certainly not a reliable shield against failure , but being small does n’t necessarily guarantee a company will be around in the long term , either .
I just do n’t think that it ’s realistic to assume that all of the data we ’re storing online is safe .
So a friendly reminder : back up .
Make Note of the Exits
Rather than just coming off as an alarmist , I want to add a few constructive comments to this dire warning .
Part of this situation has very much to do with software architecture : these applications should be designed to allow users to mirror their data on their personal computers , ideally in open formats .
I ’m not just talking about an option to export one ’s data to an archive file , though , but rather about true , seamless mirroring .
For instance , I pay a company to store my mail on the cloud , ostensibly , but I have no more or less trust in their longevity than I do in any other online business .
Through the underestimated miracle and beauty of IMAP though , all of my messages are also mirrored on my hard drive , an invaluable insurance policy against the sudden disappearance of my mail server or host provider .
To me , the IMAP approach is really the ideal approach , and I really wish it was a model for more Web services .
My other idea for mitigating cloud computing risk is a little touchier and will undoubtedly raise some hackles , so I ’m just going to come out and speak its dirty name : government regulation .
Part of the reason that WaMu ’s failure did n’t ignite a run on the bank ( or indeed , on all banks ) is the ( hopefully ) concrete reality of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .
For most intents and purposes , the money in WaMu customers ’ accounts was protected by the U.S. government — not just by the fact that it was insured , but also by the fact that , in order to qualify for the insurance , WaMu had to follow certain regulations in its management of money .
Data is almost as good as money , but I do n’t know of a single consumer Web application where access to data is guaranteed by a third - party private entity , much less by the government .
By no means am I begging for government regulation ; doing so has the potential to undo the innovation equation that defines the digital age .
Personally it ’s my view that that way lies madness .
But so too does the path of inevitable failure that we ’re on .
Essentially , as consumers of cloud computing , we have virtually zero recourse , to say nothing of insurance .
It ’s something we should be thinking about and talking about more explicitly as we continue to move more and more of our lives online .

The icy roads , daunting upcoming schedule and tough conference affiliation might have scared away many potential candidates .
But not Paul Rhoads .
He made a head - long charge into his new job as Iowa State 's new coach , before vowing to create a blue - collar mentality of hard work central for his new team .
Paul Rhoads , a former assistant at Iowa State , is returning to the Cyclones , this time as head coach .

The former Auburn and Pittsburgh defensive coordinator and one - time ISU defensive coach was introduced Saturday as the 31st head football coach in the school 's history .
And he could n't be more excited for what he termed as " a dream job " where he will coach only a couple of long touchdown passes away from the Ankeny , Iowa , area where he was born and raised .
His father , Cecil , is a member of the Iowa High School Football Coaches Hall of Fame .
" There are deep roots here , " Rhoads said .
" My youngest was born here .
I was born 10 miles down the road .
The group over here . . .
I have more support and they are all family .
I could see myself here for a long time . "
Those words were soothing for Iowa State athletic director Jamie Pollard , who was burned when Gene Chizik packed up and left the Cyclones for Auburn after twice telling Pollard he would stay .
Chizik compiled a 5 - 19 record in his two seasons with the Cyclones , leaving with a 10 - game losing streak that is tied for the second - longest among all FBS teams .
Read any good bones lately ?
Visiting biological anthropologist Jill Rhodes has , and they may provide some of the earliest evidence of when modern humans started doing something that would have been a pivotal development in the evolution of hunting and warfare something we all take for granted .
What ’s the crucial development ?
The overhead throw .
New research by Rhodes and Steven E. Churchill of Duke University published in the Journal of Human Evolution addresses the question of when human hunters added long - range projectile weapons ( those thrown overhead ) to their arsenal and whether this was a hunting method also employed by Neandertals of the time .
“ We were able to use analyses of the humerus bone ( upper limb ) to show that early humans in Europe were possibly using projectile weapons as early as the Middle Upper Paleolithic period and that Neandertals did not have or habitually use this form of technology , ” says Rhodes .
Rhodes ’ research calls on recent studies in the field of sports medicine that indicate that individuals who engage in habitual overhead throwing , like baseball pitchers , have increased humeral retroversion angles in their throwing arms and a greater degree of bilateral asymmetry in retroversion angles than do non-throwers .
In other words , if someone forcefully throws overhand a lot and from an early age be it a spear or a baseballit ’s going to leave a signature on the throwing arm that wo n’t be seen on the non-throwing arm .
While their sample sizes were small , Rhodes did find tell - tale signs of the use of overhead projectile use in the bones of the human remains they studied but not in the Neandertal remains .
“ There ’s not a lot we can say definitely , but there are a lot of interesting hints about what might have been going on , ” says Rhodes .
“ Archaeologically , we do n’t really have a lot of information as to the origins of projectile technology , but the osteological record does point to the use of projectile spear use by early humans at this time and not by Neandertals . ”
Rhodes is hesitant to make too much out of their findings but acknowledges that there are interesting implications for those who wonder why humans prospered and Neandertals died out .
“ There are implications about the efficiency of hunting for the two species .
When you are thrusting a spear , you ’re basically an ambush hunter and have to hide behind cover and jump out and stab your prey at short range .
Whereas if you have projectile technology , you can remain at a safe distance where you wo n’t scare your prey and you will increase your efficiency , effectiveness and your kill rate , ” says Rhodes .
Rhodes points out that the use of projectile weapons by humans at this time may have been especially advantageous as it would have coincided with the warming of Europe and the opening up of forests .
“ If the forests are n’t as dense , you do n’t have as many opportunities to hide and ambush prey , ” explains Rhodes .
Rhodes has been studying how the use of different weapons imprints itself on the skeleton ever since her days as a Ph.D. student at The University of Bradford in the United Kingdom , when she identified a biomechanical signature associated with long - bow use among soldiers who fought in the War of the Roses .
She is currently the principle osteologist on the archaeological investigations in the Coastal Zone of Jalisco ( Mexico ) project , where she works with student assistants in applied bioarchaeology and funerary archaeology .
“ Material culture is great , but when I want to know what the people were doing , it makes sense to me to go to the people and essentially read their skeletons , ” says Rhodes .
The blog post you quoted overstates its claim a bit .
FP does n't eliminate the need for design patterns .
The term " design patterns " just is n't widely used to describe the same thing in FP languages .
But they exist .
Functional languages have plenty of best practice rules of the form " when you encounter problem X , use code that looks like Y " , which is basically what a design pattern is .
However , it 's correct that most OOP - specific design patterns are pretty much irrelevant in functional languages .
I do n't think it should be particularly controversial to say that design patterns in general only exist to patch up shortcomings in the language .
And if another language can solve the same problem trivially , that other language wo n't have need of a design pattern for it .
Users of that language may not even be aware that the problem exists , because , well , it 's not a problem in that language .
Here is what the Gang of Four has to say about this issue :
The choice of programming language is important because it influences one 's point of view .
Our patterns assume Smalltalk / C++- level language features , and that choice determines what can and cannot be implemented easily .
If we assumed procedural languages , we might have included design patterns called " Inheritance " , " Encapsulation , " and " Polymorphism " .
Similarly , some of our patterns are supported directly by the less common object - oriented languages .
CLOS has multi-methods , for example , which lessen the need for a pattern such as Visitor .
In fact , there are enough differences between Smalltalk and C++ to mean that some patterns can be expressed more easily in one language than the other .
( See Iterator for example . )
( The above is a quote from the Introduction to the Design Patterns book , page 4 , paragraph 3 )
The main features of functional programming include functions as first - class values , currying , immutable values , etc .
It does n't seem obvious to me that OO design patterns are approximating any of those features .
What is the command pattern , if not an approximation of first - class functions ? :)
In an FP language , you 'd simply pass a function as the argument to another function .
In an OOP language , you have to wrap up the function in a class , which you can instantiate and then pass that object to the other function .
The effect is the same , but in OOP it 's called a design pattern , and it takes a whole lot more code .
And what is the abstract factory pattern , if not currying ?
Pass parameters to a function a bit at a time , to configure what kind of value it spits out when you finally call it .
So yes , several GoF design patterns are rendered redundant in FP languages , because more powerful and easier to use alternatives exist .
But of course there are still design patterns which are not solved by FP languages .
What is the FP equivalent of a singleton ?
( Disregarding for a moment that singletons are generally a terrible pattern to use . )
And it works both ways too .
As I said , FP has its design patterns too ; people just do n't usually think of them as such .
But you may have run across monads .
What are they , if not a design pattern for " dealing with global state " ?
That 's a problem that 's so simple in OOP languages that no equivalent design pattern exists there .
We do n't need a design pattern for " increment a static variable " , or " read from that socket " , because it 's just what you do .
Saying a monad is a design pattern is as absurd as saying the Integers with their usual operations and zero element is a design pattern .
No , a monad is a mathematical pattern , not a design pattern .
In ( pure ) functional languages , side effects and mutable state are impossible , unless you work around it with the monad " design pattern " , or any of the other methods for allowing the same thing .
Additionally , in functional languages which support OOP ( such as F# and OCaml ) , it seems obvious to me that programmers using these languages would use the same design patterns found available to every other OOP language .
In fact , right now I use F# and OCaml everyday , and there are no striking differences between the patterns I use in these languages vs the patterns I use when I write in Java .
Perhaps because you 're still thinking imperatively ?
A lot of people , after dealing with imperative languages all their lives , have a hard time giving up on that habit when they try a functional language .
( I 've seen some pretty funny attempts at F# , where literally every function was just a string of ' let ' statements , basically as if you 'd taken a C program , and replaced all semicolons with ' let ' . :) )
But another possibility might be that you just have n't realized that you 're solving problems trivially which would require design patterns in an OOP language .
When you use currying , or pass a function as an argument to another , stop and think about how you 'd do that in an OOP language .
Is there any truth to the claim that functional programming eliminates the need for OOP design patterns ?
Yep . :)
When you work in a FP language , you no longer need the OOP - specific design patterns .
But you still need some general design patterns , like MVC or other non-OOP specific stuff , and you need a couple of new FP - specific " design patterns " instead .
All languages have their shortcomings , and design patterns are usually how we work around them .
Anyway , you may find it interesting to try your hand at " cleaner " FP languages , like ML ( my personal favorite , at least for learning purposes ) , or Haskell , where you do n't have the OOP crutch to fall back on when you 're faced with something new .
As expected , a few people objected to my definition of design patterns as " patching up shortcomings in a language " , so here 's my justification :
As already said , most design patterns are specific to one programming paradigm , or sometimes even one specific language .
Often , they solve problems that only exist in that paradigm ( see monads for FP , or abstract factories for OOP ) .
Why does n't the abstract factory pattern exist in FP ?
Because the problem it tries to solve does not exist there .
So , if a problem exists in OOP languages , which does not exist in FP languages , then clearly that is a shortcoming of OOP languages .
The problem can be solved , but your language does not do so , but requires a bunch of boilerplate code from you to work around it .
Ideally , we'd like our programming language to magically make all problems go away .
Any problem that is still there is in principle a shortcoming of the language . ;)
I got to thinking about what I like and dislike about interleague play in baseball when I thought of how great it would be to poll some baseball bloggers I know to see what they think .
Here are the results .
If you like it , please let us know in the comments and we ’ll be sure to do this again sometime .
1 . Do you like / dislike MLB ’s Inter League Play ?
Eric Grissom @ PhilliesFlow : Dislike .
David Pinto @ Baseball Musings :
No , I do n’t like interleague play very much .
It was fun for a while , but I ’d rather see teams get back to playing the teams they are competing against for the league title .
Bill Jordan @ Baseball Reflections : I like interleague play .
Asher B. Chancey @ Baseball Evolution : I like interleague play a lot .
Jimmy Scott @ Jimmy Scott ’s High & Tight : I love it as long as we win .
Ribbie3b of RBI Magazine : : I think Inter League Play is great for Major League Baseball .
2 . What do you like / dislike about it ?
Eric Grissom @ PhilliesFlow : NL teams , generally constructed without a DH , are forced to play DH games against AL teams that are built to have one .
AL teams have figure out what to do with their DH in non-DH games .
The schedule is uneven .
For example , last year the Phillies and Mets were in a battle for the NL East .
The Mets played the Yankees six times and Seattle three times .
The Phillies did n’t play either of those teams .
The Mets played the Yankees as many times ( six ) as they played the Cubs , Brewers , Diamondbacks or Giants .
Given how infrequently the teams see each other , it creates a challenge to reschedule games if they have to be cancelled or postponed due to weather or other circumstances .
That can lead to playing games in conditions where they should be stopped .
David Pinto @ Baseball Musings : I like that fans of a particular city get to see different teams every so often .
I dislike the assignment of a rival .
I rather the natural rivalry come up every few years .
Given that teams are competing for a wild card and a division title , they should be playing the same opponents the same number of times .
Bill Jordan @ Baseball Reflections : I like the fact that it creates seldom seen match ups and provides fans a chance to see and relate to teams that they normally would not get a chance to witness in their market .
It also allows fans to be able to see some stars live who have played their entire careers in the other league .
Asher B. Chancey @ Baseball Evolution :
In reality , while the two separate major leagues developed organically as separate , competing leagues , they are no longer separate in any real sense .
They are clearly run under the same organization , Major League Baseball , and there is complete fluidity in terms of dealings between teams , etc .
So , I do n’t think there has been a very good justification for keeping the leagues from playing each other during the season for several decades now .
And one of my favorite things about baseball is seeing different players face off against one another , so this increases the number of players we see go up against each other .
Jimmy Scott @ Jimmy Scott ’s High & Tight : I dislike adding an extra West Coast swing to our schedule .
Ribbie3b of RBI Magazine : : I like Inter League play because it gives fans a chance to see players that they would n’t normally see and players a chance match up against other opponents that they normally would not compete against .
I saw Derek Jeter play for the first time in Philadelphia .
3 . In your opinion , should ALL pitchers know how to hit given today ’s free agency and how frequently players change teams and leagues ?
Eric Grissom @ PhilliesFlow : I think it would be great if all pitchers could hit — but if they have to choose on working on hitting or pitching I hope they spend a whole lot more working on pitching .
I especially think that there are a lot of things that AL pitchers might want to focus on before they get to hitting .
David Pinto @ Baseball Musings : Yes .
Bill Jordan @ Baseball Reflections :
Hitting does n’t seem to be that important for pitchers , especially since so many of them are weak with a bat in their hands .
If more started getting better , it would be more of a requirement , but since that is not the case , it ’s not as pertinent .
American League teams are not going to take time out of practice to have pitchers practice hitting just in case they change leagues , so the time is n’t really available for this except in the off season .
Asher B. Chancey @ Baseball Evolution : Should all pitchers know how to hit ?
I think all pitchers should be expected to hit , given that they should , in theory , have been playing baseball all their lives and are world class athletes .
Seeing pitchers hit .083 over the course of a season is inoffensive , I think , but I do think that when a pitcher goes up to the plate , he should be digging in and taking it seriously .
One of the pivotal moments for the Phillies in their march to the World Series was one amazing at - bat by Brett Myers against C.C. Sabathia in the playoffs .
Jimmy Scott @ Jimmy Scott ’s High & Tight : All pitchers do know how to hit .
They just ca n’t do it .
A more relevant question : Should n’t all hitters know how to bunt ?
Ribbie3b of RBI Magazine : : I think hitting is just an added bonus to having a great pitcher .
Pitching and defense wins games .
As long as a player can get the job done on the mound I would n’t care how bad he is at the plate .
4 . Are you in favor of a good hitting pitcher , like Arizona ’s Micah Owings or CC Sabathia , being used a pinch hitter or a pinch runner if he ’s fast ?
Eric Grissom @ PhilliesFlow : I would almost never use those guys to hit or run unless 1 ) the game was on the line and 2 ) they were the best hitter or fastest runner I had available .
I do n’t think I would put them up there in a situation where I was just trying not to burn a bench player .
David Pinto @ Baseball Musings : Yes .
Bill Jordan @ Baseball Reflections : I am in favor of them being used as a pinch hitter , but pinch running is probably too dangerous to have one of a team ’s valuable pitchers doing .
Since pinch runners are usually counted on to steal a base or run as fast as they can towards the catcher , injury could easily happen and I would imagine most teams do n’t want that in their rotation or pen .
Asher B. Chancey @ Baseball Evolution : I have no problem with pitchers hitting , and I have no problem with pitchers running the bases .
But when you have a guy who is essentially the lynchpin of your staff – like Sabathia – for whom one freak injury could be the difference between making the playoffs or not ( see Chien - Ming Wang ) , then I think pinch running him unnecessarily increases the odds of tanking your team unnecessarily .
On the other hand , with a mediocre starter like Owings , using him as a pinch runner for your catcher with two outs in the ninth is getting value out of a roster spot being taken up by a struggling player , so it is probably a good idea .
There is a risk everytime a guy takes the field , and you just have to decide what you are risking before you send a guy in to run the bases like that .
Jimmy Scott @ Jimmy Scott ’s High & Tight : Of course .
They ’re in favor of it too .
We all want to compete and we all want to succeed .
Rick Ankiel could n’t pitch , so he became a hitter .
Your love for the game can outweigh conventional wisdom .
Ribbie3b of RBI Magazine : : I think Sabathia would be on my roster over Ownings without a doubt .
5 . Should the DH remain in the AL ?
Should it be added to the NL ?
Eric Grissom @ PhilliesFlow :
Whenever they vote on Crash Davis ’s constitutional amendment to ban the designated hitter I hope they let us all know .
Count me in .
David Pinto @ Baseball Musings :
It should be a strategic decision by the home manager before each game .
If he has CC Sabathia pitching and the other team has a poor hitting pitcher , make force the other team to use the pitcher as a hitter .
Bill Jordan @ Baseball Reflections : Yes and No. I enjoy the quirks that the two different leagues have .
It creates for interesting line - up changes and the like .
Obviously , I have never lived without the DH , and while I am a fan of historical happenings in baseball , I do n’t necessarily mind the position , although I do n’t think anyone who plays it should ever win the MVP .
It also creates an opportunity for older players to stay in the game longer because they are able to just play half of the game .
At this point , it has been in the league so long , that it is hard to see why they would take it out .
Asher B. Chancey @ Baseball Evolution : I am agnostic as to whether there should be a DH or not .
Frankly , I enjoy seeing guys play into their forties , and if the DH keeps them around a season or two or three longer , so be it .
But , I will say this – major league baseball needs to either have a DH or not have a DH , and make it the rule across the board .
It is crazy that half the major leagues play by a different set of rules than the other half .
Jimmy Scott @ Jimmy Scott ’s High & Tight : I like the disparity .
Yes , I know it ’s two different sets of rules for two leagues playing the same game , but it does create jobs for guys like Frank Thomas and Edgar Martinez and David Ortiz , guys who are fun to watch .
But it ’s a fun topic to debate .
I think , sometimes , debating an issue is better for the game than the issue itself .
Ribbie3b of RBI Magazine : : I am not exactly sure what would work out the best here .
The pros and cons are almost equal to both leagues .
I do however think the rule should be the SAME for both leagues .
6 . Do you like the insistence on natural rivalries like Boston and Philadelphia , Cubs and White Sox , Mets and Yankees , etc. or do you find them to be forced more than anything ?
Eric Grissom @ PhilliesFlow : I think the number of actual rivalries between AL and NL teams is very small .
They are largely forced .
I particularly feel the Phillies have no natural rivalry with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim .
David Pinto @ Baseball Musings : No .
See my answer to question # 2 above .
Bill Jordan @ Baseball Reflections : I absolutely love when the Indians and Reds face of , but I would n’t want it more than two series every year .
I actually would n’t mind if inter league play were cut back to just have these match - ups .
I do n’t think to much is made for these rivalries because at one time , some were real rivalries .
Perhaps the Red Sox / Phillies series is over hyped , but same city , or state match - ups seem to have more of a ring to them .
Asher B. Chancey @ Baseball Evolution : I like them .
I think they are good for the fans of those cities .
I
also think that , on rivalry weekends , the two NL teams that are n’t playing against AL teams should be the Pirates and the Phillies , so that we can have the battle of Pennsylvania while Chicago , Los Angeles , New York , Missouri , Texas , Florida , etc. have their regional battles .
Jimmy Scott @ Jimmy Scott ’s High & Tight :
They ’re “ natural ” rivalries , so they ’re not forced at all .
Why do you think a Mets / Yankees game sells out in minutes but a Mets / Mariners game finds 5000 empty seats ?
Fans want the rivals .
Rivalries make the game .
Ribbie3b of RBI Magazine : : I do think they are forced .
The energy level is never as high as expected .
7 . In your opinion , should interleague play be longer or shorter ?
Why ?
Eric Grissom @ PhilliesFlow : I ’d go with eliminated , but shorter would be progress .
Maybe even eliminating it for virtually all teams but allowing a very small number of series like a three - game set between the Mets and Yankees .
David Pinto @ Baseball Musings :
It should just be different .
Bill Jordan @ Baseball Reflections :
As I just stated , I would n’t mind if it were shorter .
If they chose one or two teams that would play each other every year .
Or if they had one natural rivalry series and then another that was a team that was a World Series rematch from years past .
For instance … I would n’t mind seeing the Indians face the Reds , Giants , Braves or Marlins , because there is a history there ( although the Giants series was at the Polo Grounds ) .
On the other hand , I do n’t have too much interest in seeing them play the Padres or Diamandbacks .
Asher B. Chancey @ Baseball Evolution : Longer .
See answer to Question # 9 .
Jimmy Scott @ Jimmy Scott ’s High & Tight :
It should not be longer , definitely not .
But I do think it should n’t be broken up into two periods , 10 days in May ( or whatever it is ) and another 10 in June .
It held more cache in the beginning for fans when you knew you were playing teams from the other league for the next 2 - 3 weeks .
It made it more special .
Now , aside from the natural rivalries , games against teams from the other league are just like every other game .
And I do n’t think that was the point of interleague play at the outset .
Ribbie3b of RBI Magazine : : I think the MLB has done a great job concerning the duration .
Inter League play does n’t seem to really drag out .
8 . What teams would you like to see play each other more often ?
Personally , I ’d like to see the Yankees play the Dodgers more ( especially with Torre as the Dodger ’s skipper ) .
Eric Grissom @ PhilliesFlow : I do dislike interleague play , but one thing I would like to see on the schedule if there is any interleague play at all would be a three - game set between the two teams that faced each other in the World Series in the previous season .
David Pinto @ Baseball Musings : None .
I think it should be spread around evenly .
Set two divisions against each other , and every team in one division plays every team in the other division once .
Bill Jordan @ Baseball Reflections :
When there are nitch rivalries like that , perhaps they should play more , but when there is nothing obvious , I do n’t see why there would be a reason to do so .
Asher B. Chancey @ Baseball Evolution : I ’ll assume you mean in the context of interleague play .
I ’d like to see teams from cities matched up against teams from their former cities .
For example – the Athletics vs. the Phillies ; the Orioles vs. the Cardinals ; the Braves vs. the Red Sox ; the Dodgers / Giants vs. the Yankees ; the Brewers vs. the Mariners ; the Twins / Rangers vs. the Nationals .
Jimmy Scott @ Jimmy Scott ’s High & Tight : Yes , there are more natural rivalries than geographic .
There are historic rivalries , Yankees vs. Dodgers being a great example .
Mets vs. Red Sox is another that I ’d like every year .
The problem is there are n’t that many national rivalries that interest a national audience .
Blue Jays vs. Phillies could be good , because of ’ 93 , but the Blue Jays have n’t been good since ’ 93 .
Tough one .
Ribbie3b of RBI Magazine : : Phillies and Rays in the future !
Yankees and Dodgers would also make for a good ballgame more often .
9 . If you had a say in the matter , what changes would you make in interleague play ?
Eric Grissom @ PhilliesFlow : Dramatically reduce the number of games .
Try to play them all in the same week of the schedule .
David Pinto @ Baseball Musings :
See the above answer .
Bill Jordan @ Baseball Reflections :
The only changes would be the ones I stated above .
I do n’t really have a problem with the system as it is today .
I think there are some other things baseball can work on before they focus on fixing interleague play .
Asher B. Chancey @ Baseball Evolution : I ’ve thought a bit about this , and I think interleague should be extended throughout the season , and here ’s why : the reason we have unbalanced leagues is because you have to have an even number of teams in each league or else one team would always be idle .
I say we should go to two 15 team leagues .
Each series , you have seven NL teams against seven NL teams , seven AL teams against seven AL teams , and then the last NL team and the last AL team play each other , with all the teams rotating through that spot throughout the season .
That way , NL Central teams do n’t have to beat five other teams to win the division , and the AL West wo n’t be a giveaway with one less team to beat .
Jimmy Scott @ Jimmy Scott ’s High & Tight : Like I said , do n’t break it up .
Start it with a natural rivalry / 3 - game series , play the other interleague games , and then finish it with a final natural rivalry / 3 - game series .
The only issue , I believe , is the mathematics of each team playing one in another league due to there being more teams in the NL than the AL , so I ’m not sure if it can be played out in the way I just laid out or not .
I left my abacas in my locker .
Ribbie3b of RBI Magazine : :
If it is n’t broken do n’t fix it .
Like I said before , I think the MLB has the duration nailed down perfectly and the fans seem to enjoy it .

This is not exactly a strict regular season interleague play question , but here it goes anyway .
Do you think that the All - Star game should decide who gets home field advantage in the World Series ?
Why ?
Eric Grissom @ PhilliesFlow : No .
Cause it ’s ridiculous that teams play for about four hours 162 different times and that the team that gets the critical advantage in the World Series is not based on the results of those games but on the results of an exhibition game that otherwise does n’t count .
The team with the best record in the regular season should have home field advantage in the World Series .
The current system does n’t just add value to the result of the All - Star game , it also diminishes the value of the regular season .
David Pinto @ Baseball Musings : No .
It ’s an exhibition .
If you are going to assign home field ( rather than the old system of allowing it to rotate ) use a team ’s record , or at least their record .
Bill Jordan @ Baseball Reflections :
In a game with some great innovations , this is the worst rule that has ever been thought of .
Baseball has never set home field advantage in the World Series like it should be set : by the team with the best record .
If they want to make the All Star game count , they could set something like a $ 25 thousand award to each player .
That ’s just an arbitrary number , but you get the idea .
The team who wins the All Star game really has no bearing on which team playing in the World Series is better and since some teams are already eliminated from playoff thoughts by that time , it ’s hard to see why they would be playing hard for something that they have no chance of playing in .
Asher B. Chancey @ Baseball Evolution : Absolutely not .
It is simply one of the dumbest rules in sports .
The whole justification for the rule – giving the All Star game some meaning , and justifying playing extra innings if need be – is absurd ; major league players do n’t need incentive to compete in the All Star game .
Further , what on earth does one thing have to do with the other ?
This was a rare year in which the players that ended up in the World
Series actually decided the outcome in the All Star game – Brad Lidge lost the game , Scott Kazmir won it .
But for the most part , why should the teams that make it to the World Series have their fate decided by a 25 man roster of players who are n’t on their team ?
I do n’t quite get why the ol ’
“ Team with the best record gets home field advantage ” rule is n’t good enough for Major League Baseball .
Jimmy Scott @ Jimmy Scott ’s High & Tight : No , All - Star game should not decide .
I think the league that wins the most games in interleague play should have home field advantage .
It ’s harder to market that vs. the All - Star game , but it makes more sense .
Ribbie3b of RBI Magazine : No . I would like to see the team with the best overall record acquire home field advantage in the World Series .
A team should always determine it ’s own destiny .
Otherwise , why not just flip a coin before Game 1 ?
Now that you ’ve heard from them , what do you think ?
In yet another attempt at revisionist history by the outgoing Bush administration , vice - president Dick Cheney , in an exclusive interview with ABC News , took exception to former presidential adviser Karl Rove 's contention that the US would not have gone to war if available intelligence before the invasion had shown Iraq not to possess weapons of mass destruction .
Cheney noted that the only thing the US got wrong on Iraq was that there were no stockpiles of WMD at the time of the 2003 invasion .
" What they found was that Saddam Hussein still had the capability to produce weapons of mass destruction .
He had the technology , he had the people , he had the basic feed stock . "
The vice - president should re-check both his history and his facts .
Just prior to President Bush 's decision to invade Iraq , the UN had teams of weapons inspectors operating inside Iraq , blanketing the totality of Iraq 's industrial infrastructure .
They found no evidence of either retained WMD , or efforts undertaken by Iraq to reconstitute a WMD manufacturing capability .
Whatever dual - use industrial capability that did exist ( so - called because the industrial processes involved to produce legitimate civilian or military items could , if modified , be used to produce materials associated with WMD ) had been so degraded as a result of economic sanctions and war that any meaningful WMD production was almost moot .
To say that Saddam had the capability or the technology to produce WMD at the time of the US invasion is a gross misrepresentation of the facts .
While one can make the argument that Saddam had the people , insofar as the scientists who had participated in the WMD programmes of the 1980s were still in Iraq and , in many cases , still employed by the government , these human resources were irrelevant without either the industrial infrastructure , the economic base or the political direction needed to produce WMD .
None of these existed .
The argument Cheney makes on feed stock is even more ludicrous .
Precursor chemicals used in the lawful manufacture of chemical pesticides were present in Iraq at the time of the invasion , but these were unable to be used in manufacturing the sarin , tabun or VX chemical nerve agents the Bush administration claimed existed inside Iraq in stockpile quantities prior to the invasion .
The same can be said about Iraqi biological capability .
The discovery after the invasion of a few vials of botulinum toxin suitable for botox treatments , but unusable for any weapons purposes , does not constitute a feed stock .
And as for the smoking gun that the Bush administration did not want to come in the form of a mushroom cloud , there was no nuclear weapons programme in Iraq in any way shape or form , nor had there been since it was dismantled in 1991 .
Cheney 's dissimilation of the facts surrounding Iraqi WMD serves as a distraction from the reality of the situation .
Not only did the entire Bush administration know that the intelligence data about Iraqi WMD was fundamentally flawed prior to the invasion , but they also knew that it did not matter in the end .
Bush was going to invade Iraq no matter what the facts proved .
Cheney defended the invasion and subsequent removal of Saddam from power by noting that " this was a bad actor and the country 's better off , the world 's better off with Saddam gone " .
This is the argument of the intellectually feeble .
It would be very difficult for anyone to articulate that life today is better in Baghdad , Mosul , Basra or any non-Kurdish city than it was under Saddam .
Ask the average Iraqi adult female if she is better off today than she was under Saddam , and outside of a few select areas in Kurdistan , the answer will be a resounding " no " .
The occupation of Iraq by the United States is far more brutal , bloody and destructive than anything Saddam ever did during his reign .
When one examines the record of the US military in Iraq in terms of private homes brutally invaded , families torn apart and civilians falsely imprisoned ( the prison population in Iraq during the US occupation dwarfs that of Saddam 's regime ) , what is clear is that the only difference between the reign of terror inflicted on the Iraqi people today and under Saddam is that the US has been far less selective in applying terror than Saddam ever was .
At a time when the US and the world struggle with a resurgent Iran , the Iranian - dominated Dawa party of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki governs Iraq today in name only .
The stability enjoyed by Iraq today has been bought with the presence of 150,000 US troops who have overseen the ethnic cleansing of entire neighbourhoods in cities around Iraq , and who have struck temporary alliances with Shia and Sunni alike which cannot be sustained once these forces leave ( as they are scheduled to do by 2011 ) .
Invading Iraq and removing Saddam , the glue that held that nation together as a secular entity , was the worst action the US could have undertaken for the people of Iraq , the Middle East as a whole and indeed the entire world .
For Cheney to articulate otherwise , regardless of his fundamentally flawed argument on WMD , only demonstrates the level to which fantasy has intruded into the mind of the vice - president .

Jamaica has one of the worst murder rates in the world
Jamaica 's parliament has voted to keep the death penalty , as the Caribbean nation struggles to contain one of the world 's highest murder rates .
MPs were allowed a free vote , rather than having to vote along party lines .
Jamaica has had a moratorium on the death penalty since 1988 but the governing Jamaica Labour Party , elected last year , has pushed for its return .
Jamaica currently has nine men on death row .
There have been 1,200 murders on the island so far this year .
The vote followed weeks of passionate debate .
Thirty - four members of parliament voted in favour of capital punishment , 15 voted against .
There were 10 abstentions .
Those opposed wanted improvements to Jamaica 's heavily criticised police and justice system , while those in favour pointed to the ever - upward rise in violent crime .
The Jamaica Labour Party was elected with a call to resume hanging immediately .
Concerns had been raised about the risk of sanctions - primarily from the EU - but Prime Minister Bruce Golding said that if due legal process was observed , then the law should take its course .
One of the classic ecological modeling problems is the oscillating populations of predators and their prey in an ecosystem -- as prey population rises , predator population follows suit until prey population begins to fall off , resulting in a subsequent drop in predator population ( illustrated below ) .
The same dynamic also applies , to some degree , to the relationship between oil price ( prey ) and marginal production / demand destruction / energy policy ( predator ) .
This post will explore that relationship and its ability to help us avoid poor energy policy choices .
The prey - predator dynamic has been mentioned in the context of peak oil occasionally on The Oil Drum ( 1 and 2 ) , but usually in the context of human population and carrying capacity .
Both oil price and demand destruction can be modeled , at least in theory , as a predator - prey system .
Here , I would like to look specifically at the relationship between demand destruction , marginal production , and price through the predator - prey lens .
Classic predator - prey system
The simplest predator - prey dynamic is described by the Lotka - Volterra system of differential equations .
The exact values obtained by this system of equations is predicated on several assumptions -- such as exponential growth of a prey population when a predator is absent and that predators can consume infinite quantities of prey .
I do n't propose that these assumptions apply to oil , nor that the Lotka - Volterra equations can accurately predict either oil price or production .
Instead , I propose that the relationship dynamic is analogous between the general predator - prey model and the behavior of oil price , demand destruction , marginal production , and energy policy choices .
Seeing Oil as a Predator - Prey System
When oil price rises , there is an increasing incentive to 1 ) reduce elastic demand , 2 ) produce more oil , and 3 ) make public policy choices that mitigate the impact of high oil prices ( or at least use it as a lever to pander to a voting population or enrich oneself ) .
Likewise , to the extent that each of these three results bears out , it exerts downward pressure on oil price due to relatively greater production and relatively lower demand .
Lower prices , in turn , remove the incentive to reduce demand and to produce more oil -- especially where the lower price impacts the economic viability of marginal production .
Since there is an uncertain lag time between rising prices and reducing demand / increasing marginal production , it seems likely to me that the sequential corrections in price and demand / production will overshoot and create oscillations similar to the Lotka - Volterra predator prey model .
This may not be the case if oil production potential and cost was a constant ( as well as human population , economic growth , etc. ) , but the uncertainty created by a background environment of peak oil will make it very difficult for these oscillations to eventually settle at an equilibrium .
To some extent , we are seeing exactly this effect in America today .
As prices rose steadily from $ 110 / barrel to $ 147 / barrel in early Summer , national attention zeroed in on " America 's Oil Crisis , " as a perpetual counter on CNBC labeled it .
The stage for much of today 's Presidential contest was set during this period .
As oil prices dropped , and CNBC's " Oil Crisis " ticker unceremoniously disappeared , I 've actually heard more than one person comment that " I guess I do n't have to sell the SUV . "
While the macroeconomic situation adds a complicating wrinkle to the simplified predator - prey chart above , we may have already entered the phase where ramped up production plans are being scrapped , efficiency measures postponed , and political will to enact bold energy policy measures fade .
Figure 2 : The predator - prey oscillations of price increases and demand destruction / production increases superimposed on top of a geological depletion scenario - - note how the volatility fo the predator - prey dynamic works to conceal the underlying geological and geopolitical trends .
Conclusion
At the end of the day , this is a very crude model .
It is not intended to predict actual price or production , but rather to illustrate how production and price may interact similarly to predator and prey populations in an ecosystem .
The importance of this analogy is that it may help us to avoid certain policy mistakes ( or at least be aware of them ) .
When the oscillations of price and demand / production are superimposed on top of geological depletion and geopolitical feedback loops , the resulting volatility effectively masks the underlying fundamentals ( see Figure 2 , above ) .
This presents several problems , each of which may be more avoidable if the medium - term fluctuations in price , production , and demand are seen as oscillations on top of a very worrying underlying trend of peak oil .
At the risk of invoking the problematic " awareness " issue , the problem of peak oil cannot be effectively mitigated through political or economic choices until it is understood .
( how effective this mitigation can be , even if the problem is fully understood , is debatable , but at least some mitigation is possible . )
Awareness of the underlying problem , in turn , is being masked by the oscillations of the price / demand / production " predator - prey " dynamic .
If individual consumers realize that price drops ( at least relative to purchasing power ) are temporary in an environment of geological depletion , and if policy makers learn to effectively communicate this point , then we will be positioned to best mitigate the effects of peak oil on a personal , regional , and global scale .
If , on the other hand , we do not see through the fog of these predator - prey oscillations , then we may miss our best opportunity to adapt to the long - term energy reality .
Technophiles may be right -- efficiency gains and high - tech substitutes may allow us to continue " business as usual " indefinitely .
While I do n't share their optimism , my overriding concern is that the lure of their sales pitch -- especially in an environment like today 's where prices are dropping and production is ( arguably ) rising -- will convince us not to make the difficult choices about changing " business as usual " now and force us to make much more difficult choices later .
Editor 's note : the following post is by Dr. Charles Hall and his Phd student David Murphy ( EROI Guy ) , and is part of our on - going series reviewing the World Energy Outlook 2008 , recently published by the IEA .
It is also the first post of a new ' channel ' on The Oil Drum : TOD : EROI , where we will be posting essays , papers , and analysis on the biophysical aspects of energy .
Our intent is to be a real time central clearinghouse for biophysical / net energy research and ideas .
We have debated on calling it EROEI - Energy Return on Energy Invested , but have decided to keep it consistent with the acronym from the energy literature .
The post below critiques the neoclassical economic assumptions underpinning the IEA report and proposes future ' energy watchdog ' reports utilize an alternative approach grounded in biophysical concepts .
This week 's IEA report , predicting 106 mbpd of oil production in the year 2030 , and various price forecasts along the way , gives us more of the same from our international energy institutions whose fundamental assumptions remain broadly unquestioned .
It is an open but critical question why anyone would continue to take conventional ( neoclassical ) economic theory seriously given the events of the last month , not to mention the repudiation of the “ Washington consensus ” by just about all Latin American countries and the many articles that have been written recently ( and not so recently ) that debunk some or all of the basic neoclassical assumptions ( e.g. Leontief , 1982 ; Hall et al. , 200l ; Gowdy and Erickson , 2005 ; Bouchard , 2008 ; Galbraith , 2008 ; Nadeau , 2008 - - from many others ) .
Nevertheless in this report we see the IEA , after making a good initial statement about the reality and importance of peak oil , revert back to predicting future oil supplies based on the same unproven neoclassical economic theories , including , most basically , an assumption of intrinsic growth of demand for oil at 1.6 percent per year indefinitely ( click here for a review of the modeling in the WEO ) .
This economic theory has allowed for the continued abuse of the words ‘ proven ’ and ‘ probable ’ when predicting reserve quantities , and in this case , has led the IEA to report that ultimate recoverable reserves from conventional sources total 3.5 trillion barrels , and from unconventional sources upwards of 6.5 trillion barrels .
This report , and economics more generally , completely lacks the understanding that those numbers are not only quite unproven but irrelevant and useless by themselves , for the important number is not “ how many barrels are in the ground ” but “ how many of those barrels will be gained at a significant energy profit for society . ”
In effect , the notional figure of 106 mbpd gives the impression that oil 's net benefit to society will continue and even grow into the future .
The analyses presented by the IEA assume that only dollars will need to be invested ( and $ 24 trillion at that ) .
But oil , like anything else , requires real resources to procure , and it will be obtained only in proportion to how much real resource ( energy , steel etc ) is spent in getting it .
The main problem is that geology , not the market , holds the key , and the geology of earth is getting more and more parsimonious in two ways : quantity and quality .
Both of these concepts impact the energy return on investment ( EROI ) of national and global oil and gas supplies .
First , the IEA is almost certainly correct in stating that as time progresses an increasing proportion of global oil supplies will have to come from fewer supergiant and giant fields within OPEC , as efforts to expand production worldwide has failed to keep pace with the depletion of non-OPEC fields in e.g. the U.S , Great Britain , Norway and elsewhere .
This will influence EROI because these existing huge , old OPEC “ elephants ” are seriously aging and require more and more energy to maintain pressure through injection of , for example , seawater into the lower parts of these fields .
Second , as time progresses and the best oil has been found and produced ( for example North Ghawar vs. South Ghawar ) an increasing proportion of new fields brought into production yield oil that is more difficult to access as well as heavier and more sulfur - laden , requiring more energy to produce , refine , transport ( for example , Stuart Staniford reported how the oil in Saudi Arabia is becoming harder to access ) .
The combination of quantity and quality reductions has led to decreasing Energy Return on Investment ( EROI ) which has not in any way been compensated for by technology or increased drilling rates .
These ideas have been well understood since at least Hall and Cleveland ( 1981 ) , whose results were published on the first page of the Wall Street Journal but quickly forgotten by the financial community and most of the scientific community .
Just to give you a rough idea as to where we are at present with respect to EROI , “ according to legendary oilman Charles Maxwell ” on The Money Show , most countries report that it costs from $ 55 ( Saudi Arabia ) to $ 70 - 90 ( Russia and most of OPEC ) to $ 90 ( Iran and Venezuela ) to produce a barrel of oil .
That is a lot of money but underneath the surface also represents a lot of energy .
Recent work in our lab suggests that when you divide the energy produced by the energy used by oil and gas industries ( data is available for only a few countries such as the US and UK ) that these industries use about 17 MegaJoules ( MJ ) per dollar spent in 2006 .
This is the energy intensity per dollar spent for seeking and producing oil .
This compares to about 14 MJ per dollar for heavy construction and about 8 - 9 MJ per dollar as a societal average , so it seems to be in the right ballpark .
If we assume 5 percent inflation since 2006 we might expect there to be used about 16 MJ per dollar spent by the oil and gas industries in 2008 .
So if it takes Saudi Arabia $ 55 to produce a barrel then $ 55 times 16 MJ / $ equals about 880 MJ required per barrel .
For Venezuela , which requires $ 90 a barrel , this number would be 1440 MJ required per barrel .
Since a barrel of oil contains about 6164 MJ of energy , the EROI would be about 7:1 for Saudi Arabia to 4.3 for Venezuela or Iran .
These estimates , although crude , indicate the seriousness of the problem and sound a clarion call for opening up data banks all around the world to greater scientific scrutiny while also calling for companies to make their energy , as well as dollar , costs explicit and public .
It is important to remember that this is a rough estimate of the EROI for total “ upstream ” costs , i.e. exploration , development , and production of new wells , and so a calculation of the EROI for simply producing wells within Saudi Arabia would be considerably higher .
( I.e. , it is possible that seemingly high EROI is only 'at the margin ' , ( on wells and infrastructure put in place long ago ) , and is masking a deterioration in the EROI of ' new ' oil and gas requiring new energy and resources to harness ) .
Nonetheless , the cost of getting energy has been increasing greatly of late which implies that the world is approaching a point at which the energy required to get new oil will be a substantial part of , and eventually all of , the energy found within the barrel .
At this point the oil age will be over , regardless of the amount of oil left in the ground or the price that the oil commands .
This concept exists partially and inadequately in economics as diminishing returns , but an advantage of EROI over diminishing returns is that with a good historical data set , EROI allows the calculation of a rough cut off point .
This suggests that the IEA 's prediction of 106 mbpd in 2030 , whether true or not , will not have equivalent impact on society as the readers of the WEO 2008 report might infer .
Many economists will say that EROI undervalues the role that technology will play in accessing deeper and poorer quality reserves .
But as we have stated , EROI in the US obtained at least 100 barrels of oil from each barrel invested in going after it in the 1930 ’s but only about 10 for one in about 2000 , despite the tremendous increases in technology ( Cleveland et al. , 1984 , Cleveland 2005 ) .
Therefore , in the US , and subsequently the world , geologic limits have trumped technological advances , and so we reiterate : the arguments about how much oil is left in the ground misses the point - what is important is not the total oil remaining but how much we can get out at a significant energy profit .
Unfortunately this amount is likely not large , and this increasing differential between gross and net will only exacerbate Peak Oil .
Economics will eventually reflect decreasing energy profits , and even though the price of oil has dropped below what it costs to produce a barrel in many oil - producing countries this will only guarantee larger oil production problems in the ( not far off ) future .
Fancy economic theory will have no ability to change these physics ( Hall et al. , 2008 ) .
As usual , in the long run Mother Nature holds the high cards .
Neoclassical economics and economists have reigned supreme despite their dismal track record of late , as evidenced by governments turning to the same economists who got us into the credit crisis situation to get us out .
It used to work better : economies expanded simultaneously with an expansion of economic departments and economic theory .
It looked like the theories worked , although since more and more oil was being pumped out of the ground perhaps any theory could ' seemingly ' work .
Capitalism may be a giant Ponzi scheme once fueled by ever more investors and ever more oil at its base , but this has ceased , most likely forever ( see here for a definition of Ponzi scheme ) .
The economic theories became ever more analytically elegant as they got further and further from reality .
Our most prestigious economics departments not only did not teach very much about oil or grain or other sources of real wealth but increasingly not even about money .
Rather their focus was far too often complex econometric models using rather stupid starting assumptions ( e.g. Nadeau , 2008 ) .
Acceptance of graduate students was increasingly taken based on their math skills rather than their ability to understand real commodity paths .
Wall Street followed the lead of our major economists .
As we have seen in other disciplines , such as ecology , there has been massive conflation of mathematical and analytical rigor with scientific rigor .
The basic theories of neoclassical economics breaks many conventional rules of science : for starters the boundaries are wrong , the laws of thermodynamics are not respected and the whole edifice is based on “ sets of more or less plausible but entirely arbitrary assumptions ” about the economy that were chosen based on an inappropriate physical analogy and that were analytically tractable ( Leontief , 1981 ; Hall et al. , 2001 ; Nadeau , 2008 ) .
In fact why should economics be a social science at all ?
Real economies are about the flow of real materials and the energy required for those flows and materials .
Earlier economists ( the physiocrats and the classical economists such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo ) understood the physical base for wealth and made no such foolish assumptions , nor should we .
If one were to ask a physicist or chemist or engineer about how something was made in our society they would probably begin with analysis of the resources required for its manufacture and then the energy required for that manufacturing .
But economists , in their Cobb - Douglass production functions , use only capital and labor : P = f ( K , L ) , and sometimes not even labor .
Why ?
The economist Dennison ( 1979 , 1989 ) in many papers wrote that about half of the increase of production over time in the US cannot be explained by the increase in capital and labor .
He explains that the statistical error ( residual ) associated with correlating capital and labor with production is “ innovation ” ( technology ) , something dear to the hearts of economists .
But when Kümmel ( 1982 , 1989 ) adds in energy , as any real scientist would , this error disappears and the increase in energy turns out to be more powerful than either capital or labor ( also see Hall et al. 2001 ) .
Instead of the kind of economics that dominates today what we need is a biophysical approach to our economic system , one that is based on real physical and biological production and distribution possibilities ( Cleveland et al. , 1984 ; Hall and Klitgaard 2006 ) .
The first International Meeting on Biophysical Economics was held in Syracuse , New York in October of 2008 and there is interest in setting up chapters in at least 6 European Countries .
We are attempting to generate case histories , analyses and a textbook , but the road is difficult since conventional neoclassical economics is so firmly entrenched .
But if the events of 2008 are a glimpse into the future , then the transition to this kind of economics is inevitable , and along the way it will render moot a good part of the analysis in this weeks IEA document .
We would do well to understand and guide this transition .

The Economist Has No Clothes : Unscientific assumptions in economic theory are undermining efforts to solve environmental problems .
Scientific American March 25 2008 .
Am I missing something or are there like four or five completely independent reasons not to appoint Larry Summers Treasury Secretary ?
I ’m really having a hard time understanding this one .
Just at the level of optics , since the economy is issue number one right now ( and not just the real economy of jobs and living standards but the financial architecture itself ) and you ’re trying to look forward not back , why would you pick someone for Treasury who was not only in the Clinton administration but was actually Treasury Secretary in the Clinton administration .
Not understanding that .
Next , management shortcomings and controversial statements about women ’s brains that got him canned as President of Harvard .
And on top of that , the new Treasury Secretary will be charged with instituting a beefed up framework of financial sector regulation .
But Summers was a key player in the 1990s deregulatory consensus that laid the groundwork for a lot of these problems .
Not that that makes him verboten — a lot of other people did too .
But it does create an element of of cognitive dissonance going into the job .
I ’m not sure any of these strikes against would be determinative in themselves .
Perhaps each taken together would not be if the crisis of the moment demanded Summers .
But is he really the only one available ?
I do n’t mean that in a snarky or denigrating sense .
Clearly , Summers is an extremely bright and accomplished guy and a highly respected economist .
But really , he ’s the only person with the economist chops and political instincts to manage this arduous task ?
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A government rescue plan has eased investors ’ concerns about Citigroup Inc , but mines lurking in the balance sheets of rivals including Bank of America Corp could still tempt short - sellers .
Bank of America , the No. 3 U.S. bank by assets , has loaded up on mortgages as the world ’s largest economy wrestles with the worst housing market since the Great Depression .
The Charlotte , North Carolina - based bank further heightened its exposure to home loans by acquiring Countrywide Financial Corp , the largest U.S. independent mortgage lender and agreeing to buy Merrill Lynch & Co , which owns the world ’s largest retail brokerage .
If losses on mortgages and other debt securities mount significantly , the bank may see the ratio of equity to risk - weighted assets , known as Tier - 1 capital , dwindle to alarmingly low levels .
“ I would expect there are more banks who are in dire straits and more who can expect to be helped , ” said Michael Farr , president of investment management company Farr , Miller & Washington in Washington , D.C. “ The share price makes it look like Bank of America might be next in line , ” he said .
Before Monday ’s stock market rally , Bank of America shares had lost 52 percent in November alone , making them the second biggest decliner for the month in the KBW Banks index after Citigroup .
Analysts at independent research company CreditSights forecast that in a scenario where the commercial and residential real estate markets really tank beyond banks ’ expectations , Bank of America would have a Tier - 1 capital ratio of 7.15 percent .
The minimum that regulators seek to consider a bank “ well capitalized ” is 6 percent , but any ratio near or below 7 percent tends to spook investors .
Bank of America declined comment .
CreditSights also expressed concern about Wells Fargo &
Co , which it said would have a Tier - 1 capital ratio of 6.98 percent under its worst case scenario .
Wells Fargo recently agreed to buy Wachovia Corp .
Under the same assumptions , and before the government ’s latest investment , Citigroup would have a Tier - 1 capital ratio of 8.64 percent .
Wells Fargo , based in San Francisco , declined to comment .
To be sure , by some measures Citigroup looks worse than Bank of America and Wells Fargo , most notably the ratio of tangible assets to tangible equity , a metric on which some investors have focused .
Citigroup ’s tangible assets are about 42 times shareholder equity minus intangible assets , compared with 11 times for Bank of America .
The U.S. banking system is broadly undercapitalized , perhaps to the tune of more than $ 1 trillion , and the only investor that can bail it out is the U.S. government , analysts said .
“ The banks already have an enormous hole to plug , and the recession will make that hole larger , ” noted Daniel Alpert , investment banker at Westwood Capital in New York , estimating banks may need to write down $ 1 trillion more in bad debt , in addition to the roughly $ 750 billion announced so far .
TOXIC MORTGAGES
Bank of America , through its acquisition of Countrywide , has more than $ 250 billion in residential mortgages and while it has stopped offering some of the most toxic types of mortgages , chargeoffs in the portfolio are increasing .
Wells Fargo inherited a portfolio of more than $ 260 billion in consumer loans when it acquired Wachovia , and JPMorgan Chase &
Co acquired exposure to some of the most risky classes of mortgages , in addition to its own large consumer loan portfolio , when it bought Washington Mutual Inc .
Still , there are big differences .
Critically for Citigroup , investors lost confidence in the company and its management after it failed to buy Wachovia Corp , thereby losing an important potential source of deposit - based funding , analysts said .
“ The difference between Citi and the other three is that Citi clearly had more suspect management , ” said Mal Polley , chief investment officer at Stewart Capital Advisors in Pittsburgh .
“ They had not done enough to take the fat out of the system and right the ship , ” he added .
But management at Bank of America and Wells Fargo , and even JPMorgan , widely regarded as the bank that has best survived the credit crisis to date , will need to allay investors ’ concerns about their capital position as financial conditions worsen .
And if their losses are big enough , or investors fear they will be big enough , Bank of America and Wells Fargo could turn to the same place Citigroup did : the U.S. government .
“ I definitely think other companies will need this help , ” said Paul Miller , analyst at Friedman , Billings , Ramsey & Co in New York .
Django 1.0.1 beta available
Following the previously - announced schedule , today the Django team has released Django 1.0.1 beta 1 ; this is a preview of the upcoming Django 1.0.1 release , which consists solely of bugfixes and other improvements to the Django 1.0 codebase .
This package also follows our policy of maintaining compatibility in the 1.0 release series .
Though it 's labeled a " beta " , this package is considered to be of production quality ; we 're releasing it as a preview of Django 1.0.1 , and the primary goal of this package is to give users of Django 1.0 an idea of what 's been fixed in the codebase since the 1.0 release .
If there 's a particular issue you 're interested in which does n't seem to be resolved in Django 1.0.1 beta , please consider helping the Django team to fix it by working to develop a patch ( see the contribution guidelines for details ) ; Django 1.0.1 is currently scheduled for release on November 14 , 2008 , which provides a roughly two - week window for submitting patches ( and please keep in mind that patches intended for inclusion in 1.0.1 should be against the 1.0.X branch and not trunk ) .
As such , this release is mostly of interest to developers who want to help out with the Django development process ; the final Django 1.0.1 release next month , however , will be a recommended upgrade for all users of Django 1.0 .
Also , this beta release does not contain release notes , as there are no new features , only bugfixes .
When the final Django 1.0.1 release is issued next month , a list of resolved issues since 1.0 will be included in lieu of release notes .
Twitter Gives Back Some Cache to Rails
Over the past couple of years Twitter has been something of a poster child for Rails - and not always in a good way .
When they were having performance issues , they were exhibit # 1 for the " Rails Can't Scale " camp .
But the Twitter performance problems seem to be mainly a thing of the past .
Now they 're contributing some of their solutions back to the wider Rails community .
The giveback is in the form of cache - money , a write - through caching library for Active Record ( announced in a blog entry by Twitter 's Nick Kallen ) .
If you need a refresher on write - through caching , it 's pretty simple : every write to the cache causes a synchronous write to the backing store .
In this case , the backing store is your actual database , and the cache is Memcached .
With write - through caching , you need not worry about cache invalidation ; if something changes , it gets written to the cache and to the database at the same time .
To use cache - money , you install the gem and set up an initializer .
Then you need to go through your ActiveRecord models and indicate the indices that will be used - and that 's it .
The rest happens automatically .
cache - money can't handle every possible query ; it 's optimized for speed and handling the most common cases .
The cases it handles should be enough for many Active Record operations : find , find_all , hash , array , and string conditions , and more .
The unsupported operations will just fall through the cache to the underlying data .
This is n't a panacea that will fix every Rails scaling issue , but it looks a whole lot simpler to use than something like cache - fu .
The current code is marked as a release candidate ; it 's been extracted from the Twitter codebase and has a few to - do items left , though nothing that would block its use in many production environments .

I have never read a book that has fundamentally changed the way I view the world .
My friend offered the label “ consciousness raiser ” .
A People ’s History of the United States by Howard Zinn is the most profound history I have ever read .
It has challenged my core assumptions about the country that I live in .
It is not that history has been misstated in the books we have read in high school and college , it is that they have been understated .
A People ’s History takes the perspective of the poor and underprivileged and shows how they have been repressed and exploited by the privileged few systematically through the centuries .
We as people of the United States of America are and have been led by a small group that does not represent the majority but that of the wealthiest 1 % .
Wikipedia has an a great chapter by chapter summary .
Come with me while I take you through a few examples and quotes from this book .
Chapter 1 : Columbus , The Indians , and Human Progress
An excerpt from Christopher Columbus ’ log regarding the Arawak people in the Bahama Islands :
They have no iron .
Their spears are made of cane … .
They would make fine servants ….
With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want .
Christopher Columbus , Discoverer of America !
( except for the fact America was already populated )
The Spaniards did subjugate Hispaniola ( now The Republic of Haiti and Dominican Republic ) .
Another quote :
They rode the back of Indians if they were in a hurry or were carried on hammocks by Indians running in relays … .
The Spaniards thought nothing of knifing Indians by tens and twenties and of cutting slices off them to test the sharpness of their blades .
Of the estimated 3 - 8 million indigenous people of Hispaniola none survived .
Every last man , woman , and child was killed by disease , hunger , or the sword .
Chapter 13 : The Socialist Challenge
After the Emancipation Proclamation of 1862 was signed by Abraham Lincoln all the slaves were free .
There was no more slavery in America !
Well , do n’t you worry the Establishment has lots of societal and economic pressures to keep the majority in line .
The rights established by the Emancipation Proclamation were not enforced until the Civil Rights Movement was well under way .
So if you are a Native American , Black , Immigrant , Homosexual , or Woman you did not get equal treatment under the law .
In fact , sometimes you had special rules applied to you ( Jim Crow Laws , Do n’t Ask Do n’t Tell ) if you were a woman working as a teacher in Massachusetts in 1900 :
Do not get married .
Do not leave town at any time without permission of the school board .
Do not keep company with men .
Be home between the hours of 8 P.M and 6 A.M.
Do not loiter downtown in ice cream stores .
Do not smoke .
Do not get into a carriage with any man except your father or brother
Do not dress in bright colors
Do not dye your hair Do not wear any dress more than two inches above the ankle .
In the early 1900s people begin to form unions to protect their rights .
Like the right to work a 12 hour day instead of 16 hour days , for enough money to buy food and pay rent , for children to go to school instead of work in the factories under dangerous conditions .
But that was too much for your wealthy masters .
Strike breakers were brought in to take the jobs of those striking .
Union leaders were killed .
Strikers were threatened , beaten , fired upon , and killed by police and by our own National Guard with permission from government .
Chapter 8 : We Take Nothing by Conquest , Thank God
Every war that America has been involved in has had an economic backing .
They are too numerous to note .
Let us take the Mexican - American War .
In the White House now was James Polk , a Democrat , an expansionist , who on the night of his inauguration , confided to his Secretary of the Navy that one of his main objectives was the acquisition of California .
His order to General Taylor to move troops to the Rio Grande was a challenge to the Mexicans .
And do we really think the war in Iraq is about freedom ?
Closing Comments
A People ’s History is a long read weighing in at 688 pages .
Not only that , the content matter is challenging and disturbing .
Everyone should be required to read this book to fill in the gaps in their knowledge of the United States and perhaps to reflect on their unbridled nationalism .
I am aware of the fact that we would not be the world power we are today without the actions of our current and historical leaders , but that still does not make it right .
BAGAMOYO , Tanzania ( Reuters ) - Billionaire Bill Gates and thousands of babies are helping Africa prepare its largest medical experiment ever , in the search for a new vaccine against malaria .

Researchers say the push comes at a crucial time in the battle against a disease which has been beaten back several times before , only to resurge with deadly vigor .
For Dr. Zena Mtajuka , an exhausted warrior on the frontlines of the fight against one of the planet ’s most devastating diseases , a vaccine cannot come quickly enough .
“ Malaria is our number one killer in this district , ” said Mtajuka in her cramped office at Bagamoyo District Hospital north of Tanzania ’s capital Dar es Salaam .
“ The hardest thing is that members of the community come to the hospital too late .
It makes them harder to save . ”
Bagamoyo is one of almost a dozen research sites where scientists are in the final stages of preparing for a large - scale efficacy and safety trial of the “ RTS , S ” vaccine developed by GlaxoSmithKline PLC .
The trial , which is slated to begin in early 2009 and will involve 16,000 children in seven African countries , is the largest ever undertaken on the continent .
Its funders , including groups supported by the Gates Foundation , hope it will result in a new and effective strategy against the disease .
Bagamoyo ’s malaria burden is typical of many places in tropical Africa , home to most of the roughly one million people who die each year because of the mosquito - borne illness .
Public health officials estimate malaria costs Africa $ 12 billion due to deaths and lost productivity , a twin burden the world ’s poorest continent cannot afford .
Public health advocates have cited malaria as an emerging global health success story , with new drugs , bed nets and insecticides contributing to sharp drops in infection rates in a number of countries .
Mtajuka said insecticide - treated bed nets and indoor spraying are not universally available here despite campaigns to promote them .
“ Some people are using bed nets , but not all of them .
Some are simply too poor to afford them , ” Mtajuka said .
“ And since I ’ve been here there ’s been no indoor spraying .
I think we had it once , three years ago , but not since then . ”
Mtajuka , who already manages the hospital ’s HIV / AIDS clinic , had to learn the malaria job fast .
Her predecessor as malaria officer died earlier this year -- of malaria .

MEASURING SUCCESS
Like many African doctors , Mtajuka remains swamped by malaria cases -- which proponents say underscores the need for a vaccine to stop the deadly parasite in its tracks .
“ Drugs and nets are going to assist , but I do n’t think that ’s a long - term solution , ” said Dr. Norbert Peshu , director of the KEMRI Center for Geographic Medicine Research in Kilifi , Kenya , another malaria hotspot .
“ The final thing against malaria has to be a vaccine . ”
Although identified as promising two decades ago , the RTS , S vaccine has only in recent years moved into widespread testing , thanks to funding from the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
For vaccinologists , malaria has proved hard to beat .
The parasite that causes the disease has a complex life - cycle inside mosquitoes and the human body , which helps it evade the immune system .
RTS ,S , named for the antigen it produces , fuses part of a protein from the parasite to the surface of a hepatitis - B viral particle , stimulating the body ’s immune response .
This hobbles the parasite ’s ability to infect and develop in the liver , its main repository in humans , which gives partial protection against the disease .
The vaccine ’s largest test so far , in more than 2,000 children in Mozambique starting in 2003 , showed it reduced all cases of clinical malaria by 35 percent and the worst cases of the disease by almost 50 percent .
The Malaria Vaccine Initiative , which helps coordinate world malaria vaccine research and development , aims for a vaccine that is at least 50 percent effective by 2015 and a second - generation product to confer 80 percent or more protection against clinical disease by 2025 .
“ It may not cover all the bases , but it could cover some of them , ” said Dr. Patricia Njuguna , a Kenyan pediatrician who will be one of the principal investigators for the next series of RTS , S human trials .
“ Traditional vaccines give 80 to 90 percent protection .
Malaria vaccines give less .
But perhaps that is all you need . ”
NO SINGLE ANSWER
Many medical workers in Africa say that while even a partially effective malaria vaccine would be welcome , it would certainly not be the answer to the continent ’s health problems .
Stephen Chakaya , a 27 - year old medical officer at a rural clinic in Junju outside Kilifi , Kenya , said poverty and hunger were just as destructive as malaria in the community and much harder to address .
“ Most of the people around here live on less than $ 1 per day , ” Chakaya noted , standing in his basic clinic that serves nearly 6,000 people in the area .
“ We do n’t have a lab here .
We do n’t have a microscope .
We do n’t have slides , so we can never be sure if a case is malaria or something else .
We need investment , ” he said .
But researchers say the vaccine push is bringing this investment , helping to supply equipment and expertise that will eventually benefit the community at large .
In Bagamoyo , where the vaccine trials are being run by Tanzania ’s Ifakara Health Institute along with the district hospital , vaccine money has helped to purchase new ambulances and equip a bright new pediatric ward that now takes care of all cases of children under 5 admitted to the hospital .
Major investment in bed nets and combination therapies with artimisinin - based drugs have added pressure on the parasite , which already appeared to be on the retreat in at least some areas of Africa .
Wendy O’Meara , a U.S. epidemiologist working at the KEMRI / Wellcome Center in Kilifi , said reviews of local hospital data showed the mean age of children admitted with malaria had been rising over the past 10 years , a signal that the parasite was becoming rarer .
She said the changes came before bed nets and combination drug therapies were widely available in Kilifi , indicating other factors were responsible .
“ There are very few places on the planet where malaria runs its natural course , ” she said .
“ It could be economic development , it could be things we do n’t have data on , or are n’t creative enough to think of yet . ”
As always , as the year comes to a close , there is an inevitable rush to produce top 10 lists .
Top 10 movies , top 10 books , top 10 music albums .
Not content to let Hollywood and the entertainment industry have all the fun , the news staff at Science magazine have compiled their year - end top 10 list of the scientific breakthroughs that broke through with the potential for lasting impact .
These range in scale from protons to planets and include nearly everything in between .
Science 's Breakthrough of the Year : Reprogramming Cells
As the writers at Science spin the opening sentence , the breakthrough of the year is " a long - sought feat of cellular alchemy . "
Whereas the ancient alchemists sought to transmute mundane metals into gold or silver , modern scientific wizards have found ways to convert human skin cells — the base metal — into induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPS ) — the modern biological equivalent of gold .
These iPS cells are capable of growing into a variety of tissues , which could ultimately lead to the capacity to cure certain diseases with a patient 's own cells .
In a second cellular programming trick , scientists transformed mature cells in live mice from one specialized type to another .
This bit of biological witchcraft flew in the face of years of results that suggested that cell development was a one - way street .
It has provided much greater understanding into the nature of biological and chemical processes that enable cells to stably adopt a specialized role , and has opened the doors to the field that 's now being called cellular programming .
Both of these techniques potentially side stepp the political mine - field that surrounds human embryonic stem cells .
Ten years ago , a team from the University of Wisconsin - Madison developed a technique to get human embryonic stems cells ( hES ) from human blastocysts .
This , not terribly surprisingly , ignited a large debate over bioethics since the procedure often destroys the blastocyst .
The potential for a new source of embryonic - like stem cells came via breakthrough paper from a team of Japanese researchers .
Named the number two breakthrough of the year by Science magazine , the Japanese team created iPS cells from mouse tail cells through the simple insertion of four genes .
When the next logical step was taken — using the technique with human cells — researchers were off to the races .
Two groups announced stunning breakthroughs within weeks of each other this year .
The first group derived iPS cells from the skin of an elderly woman suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS , or Lou Gehrig 's disease ) .
They then directed the cells to develop into neurons and glia , two of the cell types most affected by ALS .
Shortly after this announcement , a second group reported the creation of patient - specific iPS cell lines for 10 additional diseases .
Many of these 10 disease are not well suited , or even possible , to study via animal models .
Ignoring the lure of stem cells , another group of researchers demonstrated that one does not need them to produce various mature cell types ; instead , they forced mature cells to change their form and function .
Working with live mice , an American research team demonstrated that pancreatic exocrine cells can be forced to function as beta cells .
Using a trio of viruses as their gene delivery vectors , the team inserted a set of genes believed to be responsible for beta cell growth into the exocrine cells .
Within days , they observed that the " treated mice formed insulin producing cells that acted like bona fide beta cells . "
Since beta cells are responsible for producing insulin and are destroyed in people suffering from type - I diabetes , this technique could have major ramifications if it can be modified for human use .
While these breakthroughs are major , much more work is needed before we start to see custom - made , individually constructed cures for diseases .
We currently lack a reliable method of triggering developmental changes and need a more detailed understanding of how the conversion process works and a much more detailed understanding of the nature of the newly formed cells .
Even though this field is not ready for human consumption , the potential it presents warranted it being named the biggest scientific breakthrough of the year , according to Science .
Runners - Up :
Direct
Views of Exoplanets :
Astronomers first found a planet orbiting another star in 1995 , after
hundreds of years of speculation that the probability of other planets
must be infinitesimally close to unity .
In the intervening 13 years , 332 more planets
have been found orbiting other stars .
Until earlier this year , however , all were
found using indirect techniques .
The vast majority of these
exoplanets — 307
to be exact — were found not because we saw the
planet , but because we were able to observe the star it orbits wobbling
due to the planet 's mass .
Starting in the latter part of this year ,
astronomers have been reporting on the direct observation of
exoplanets .
Using adaptive optics and " virtual coronograph " software ,
teams have found 11 planets by directly looking at them , rather than
relying on secondary effects .

The DNA of
Cancer :
It is known that DNA mistakes can lead to cell
growth that is unregulated , which can produce a cancerous tumor .
Thanks to the completion of
the human genome and affordable sequencing equipment , several groups have looked deeper
into the genetic mistakes that can cause cancer .
Through the study of
various cancer genomes , scientists have concluded that treatments that block common cellular pathways could be more effective then a
' magic bullet ' treatments directed at individual cancer genes .

New Class of
High - T Superconductors : since the discovery of high - temperature superconductors in 1986 , all had been a ceramic made up of lanthanum - barium - copper oxides .
Earlier this year , there was a flurry of papers from a number of research groups that announced they had found a new
class of high - temperature
superconductors , ceramics made of lanthanum , iron , arsenic ,
oxygen , and fluorine .
While their critical temperature is , by high - temperature superconducting standards , a not - so - hot 55 K , they have
opened a new pathway into the mystery of superconductor research .
Follow
up work has n't been able to determine whether these materials
behave the same as their more familiar cuprate cousins .

Protein
flopping and folding :
How proteins dock with target
molecules has long been a subject of debate among biologists ,
biochemists , and biophysicists .
The leading theory is that , when a
protein molecule comes upon a target , it will change its shape so that
it will fit in a lock - and - key manner .
However , some postulated
that proteins in solution randomly oscillate between a number of
related but slightly different conformations .
New computational
biology work performed by teams in the US and Germany has given support to the
latter model .
The researchers discovered that a oft - studied protein will " dance "
between many different configurations before finding the one that enables it to
interact with its target molecule .

Splitting
Water :
With the summer 's historic rise in oil
prices , interest in renewable energy sources was front and center
view in the mind of many people .
Even as technology for solar and wind
power advances and prices for the power they generate
falls , storing that energy remains a challenge .
One suggestion is to
hydrolyze water into hydrogen and oxygen , which can later be burned
or used in a fuel cell setup .
The problem is efficiently
spitting water ; platinum is a good catalyst
for this reaction , but its scarcity and price are turn offs for large
scale work .
This year saw the development of
a new catalyst , comprised of phosphorous and cobalt , that
can efficiently hydrolyze water on industrial scales .

Beginning of
Life , the Movie : Most of us have have probably seen a video of the first cells of an embryo dividing , starting from a sperm+egg , then dividing to form the first few dozen individual
cells .
When it comes to vertebrates , though , scientists only had , at best , a partial view of what comes next .
This year , researchers from Germany created a
specialized microscope and observed the formation and growth of a zebrafish embryo .
They watched it from a single cell until it reached a cluster of almost 16,000 individual cells .
The
movies are freely
available on the Internet , and well worth watching .

Color Coded
Fat :
It has been known for over 400 years that there are
two types of fat : white and brown .
Brown fat cells
have a much higher concentration of mitochondria and burn energy for
heat ; white fat cells are what many of us readily see in
our midsection .
Both types of fat cells were assumed to be related and come from the same
progenitor cell type .
Using the observation that the gene PRDM16 spurs
specialization of brown fat , US researchers expected that if they blocked PRDM16 activity , the brown
fat precursor cells would become white fat cells .
They did not get what
they expected as , in the absence of PRDM16 , the brown fat
cells of mice turned into muscle cells .
The team was also able to reverse the process , turning cells
differentiating into muscle cells into brown fat .
Using a
technique to trace cell linages , the team found that muscle and brown
fat cells in mice were related , but neither was related to white fat
cells .

Computing the
Basics :
While protons , neutrons , and other light hadrons
are considered basic particles , the mathematics
describing their innards is incredibly complex .
The simple picture of
the inside of any hadron is three quarks that exchange gluons ,
the messenger particle of the strong nuclear force , among themselves .
Reality is much more complicated , and our best description of the strong force — quantum chromodynamics
( QCD ) — requires incredibly powerful computers to have any hope of
accurately modeling even a " simple " hadron .
Using massively parallel
computers and a technique known as lattice quantum chromodynamics ,
researchers in Europe have predicted
the mass of a proton using only the theory behind the strong
force .
The fact that their computed mass is within a few percent of the
experimental answer suggests that QCD properly describes the strong nuclear force .

DNA on the
Cheap :
When the human genome was decoded a few years
ago , it used techniques that are now considered somewhat antiquated .
Hardware from a number of companies has become available over the past few years
has blown the doors off genome sequencing .
The " sequencing by
synthesis " technology from 454 Sequencing ( now owned by Roche ) has allowed researchers to to sequence partial genomes of extinct cave bears and
Neanderthals , along with 80 percent of a woolly mammoth's .
As sequencing
technology advances , more and more genetic codes will be cracked and ,
like in consumer technology and electronics , the price will continue to
fall .
Given this list , it would appear that 2008 was a productive year in the
natural sciences .
To see how this list compares to last year 's , have a
look at our past coverage .
If you were watching 60 Minutes last night , you saw a segment about the next wave of mortage defaults that is coming .
That link takes you to an online video of their segment , which I urge you to watch .
This is the best concrete evidence I 've seen so far that validates what many of us here at the Nolan Chart have been saying or suggesting for months now .
The worst is not behind us .
The next round of failures will come over the next 3 - 4 years , and they will more than double the losses created by the sub - prime lending market .
The one thing the 60 Minutes segment did not mention , just as no one else mentions it , is the role that the Federal Reserve played in creating this financial crisis .
Again , both myself and other columnists here have written extensively about this , so see the many other articles here for details about that .
What it did acknowledge is that the next round of mortgage defaults is coming from two classes of mortgage lending that are slightly ( but barely ) more financially responsible than sub-primes .
There were nearly $ 1 trillion in sub - prime mortages , but these new ( to most Americans ) forms of mortgages , the Alt - A and Option ARM mortgages , total roughly another $ 1.5 trillion .
Given the fact that the banking industry has already sustained some devastating shocks , there is increasing doubt about the continued viability of many of the largest banks still left standing .
Worse , it 's going to take another 3 - 4 years for these loans to default , because that 's how long it 's going to take for the interest rates on these loans to reset to higher levels .
Given the fact that a large segment of these loans are already defaulting even before the interest resets take place , the expert interviewed on the program claimed that he expects roughly 70 % of these loans to default based on current , pre-reset default rates !
So all the efforts we 've heard about to have the big banks renegotiate existing loans so that homeowners can afford them is likely to be largely wasted motion in most cases .
According to the chart they showed , some of these loans are already defaulting , and there will be peaks in default rates for these loans .
The first peak comes at the end of 2009 .
The second , higher peak , comes in mid-2010 .
The third , and highest peak comes in mid-2011 , when the default rate will exceed the highest peak in sub - prime default rates which occurred in August of this year .
Numerous reports say that more than 10 % of all homeowners are already defaulted or are currently “ under water , ” meaning that they are behind in their mortgage payments and in danger of defaulting .
It will not be surpring if that number doubles or even triples over the next 3 - 4 years .
Well folks , it 's over .
Barack Obama is the 44th President of the United States , John McCain is crying over an early bird dinner special somewhere in Phoenix , and meteorologists are predicting a 99 % chance of beautiful rainbows shooting out of everyone in America 's asses at least through the end of this weekend .
I guess this means election season is officially over .
It 's been a wild ride , what with all the plumbers and slander and Palin - themed hardcore pornography , and if you 're like me , you probably got caught up in it like everyone else .
And while it 's all well and good to follow politics , when the mainstream media focuses its attention so narrowly on one particular story , it 's easy for other equally ( if not more ) important stories to fall through the cracks .
This week on Ross Wolinsky Hates The Internet , I 'd like to bring you up to speed on some of the stories you might have missed thanks to election fever .
5 BONO BUSTED !!!
Remember Bono ?
You know - the world - famous frontman of the 22 - Grammy - Award - winning , 140 - million - album - selling rock band U2 ?
You know - the guy who is as well known for his philanthropic work as he is for singing in one of the most successful rock bands of the 20th century ?
Well guess what ?
Pictures of him surfaced on Facebook that show him enjoying a " RENDEZVOUS " with two " SEXY TEENS ! "
Let 's take a look at the picture , shall we ?
That 's a rendezvous face if I 've ever seen one .
Hmm .
Well , okay , I do n't think anyone would deny that those are some " sexy teens . "
And judging by the picture , I 'm pretty sure that Bono wasto be enjoying a rendezvous with them .

But does that make this a noteworthy news story ?
Yes it does , and I 'll tell you why : Everyone knows that being a rock star is awesome , but if Bono , debatably one of the biggest douchebags in the history of rock music , can still get chicks when he 's pushing 50 , then most of us clearly do n't have a clue as to how awesome being a rock staris .
Although to be honest , I seriously doubt he sealed the deal .
Based on the look on his face , I think if things went any further than posing for this picture his boner would have literally exploded .

Until that day , the British had described Tibet as autonomous , with China having a “ special position ” there .
This formula did not endorse the Tibetan claim to independence .
But it meant that in the British view China ’s control over Tibet was limited to a condition once known as suzerainty , somewhat similar to administering a protectorate .
Britain , alone among major powers , had exchanged official agreements with the Tibetan government before the Chinese takeover in 1951 , so it could scarcely have said otherwise unless it was to vitiate those agreements .
Image Credit ... David Suter
After the People ’s Republic of China joined the United Nations in 1971 , British politicians refrained from referring to their country ’s recognition of Tibet ’s autonomy to avoid embarrassing Beijing .
But that did n’t make it less significant .
It remained the silent but enduring legal basis for 30 years of talks between the Dalai Lama and Beijing , in which the Tibetans have called only for autonomy and not independence  a position that a conference of Tibetan exiles in India reaffirmed on Saturday .
Mr. Miliband described the British position as an anachronism and a colonial legacy .
It certainly emerged out of a shabby episode in colonial history , Francis Younghusband ’s cavalier invasion of Tibet in 1903 .
But the British description of Tibet ’s status in the era before the modern nation - state was more finely tuned than the versions claimed by Beijing or many exiles , and it was close to the findings of most historians .
Britain ’s change of heart risks tearing up a historical record that frames the international order and could provide the basis for resolving China ’s dispute with Tibet .
The British government may have thought the issue of no significance to Britain ’s current national interests and so did not submit it to public debate .
But the decision has wider implications .
India ’s claim to a part of its northeast territories , for example , is largely based on the same agreements  notes exchanged during the Simla convention of 1914 , which set the boundary between India and Tibet  that the British appear to have just discarded .
That may seem minor to London , but it was over those same documents that a major war between India and China was fought in 1962 , as well as a smaller conflict in 1987 .

More bashing of my dear friend .
I ’m in the last stages of the book ms , and trying to come to grips with his legacy .
This following excerpt concerns the seeds he planted for fascism .
It is clear that Elisabeth distorted Nietzsche ’s philosophy in serious ways .
Nietzsche was of course no German nationalist ; he prided himself on being “ a good European , ” and practically disowned his German nationality ( in his autobiography , he claimed bizarrely to be descended from Polish nobility ) .
He was no anti-Semite , and loathed the anti-Semites of his time , including his brother - in - law , Bernhard Förster .
( It would be fairer , though , to call him an “ anti-anti - Semite , ” rather than any devoted defender of Judaism . )
He wrote glowingly of wars , and the strength one gains through battle , but he surely would not have approved of the nationalistic swagger that resulted in two world wars .
Nevertheless , there is certainly enough in Nietzsche ’s writings to see how fascists might take him as their own philosopher .
Perhaps the most startling is found in the first treatise of On the Genealogy of Morality ( 1887 ) .
Nietzsche first describes how the strong and noble men eventually succumbed to the slave morality promoted by the weak and insidious , as if birds of prey were coaxed by lambs into believing that it is a sin to be a predator , and a great virtue to be a prey .
These predators internalize the values preached by the lambs , and their behavior is kept in check by customs , social mores , and “ mutual surveillance . ”
But , Nietzsche continues , once those predators are placed in foreign territory , where the rule by lambs is no longer effective , there is a radical change in their behavior :
There they enjoy freedom from all social constraint ; in the wilderness they recover the losses incurred through the tension that comes from a long enclosure and fencing - in within the peace of the community ; they step back into the innocence of the beast - of - prey conscience , as jubilant monsters , who perhaps walk away from a hideous succession of murder , rape , arson , torture with such high spirits and equanimity that it seems as if they have only played a student prank , convinced that for years to come the poets will again have something to sing and to praise .
( GM 1 , 11 )
He goes on to mention the Romans , Arabs , Germans , Japanese , ancient Greeks , and Vikings as having shown themselves historically to be such jubilant monsters .
And , indeed , it is impossible to deny the monstrosity of what is done on battlefields by young men raised to be as civilized , as “ moral , ” and as restrained and gentle as any lamb .
One wonders if some of Nietzsche ’s own military experience is surfacing in this passage .
Fair enough : in war , humans reveal themselves to be jubilant monsters .
But to what extend is Nietzsche condoning or even extolling the beast - of - prey conscience ?
Towards the end of this section , he excuses anyone who cannot escape the fear of “ the blond beast ” — the human propensity to cruelty in war is something worth fearing .
But , he continues , who would not prefer both fearing and somehow admiring our beasts of prey to being “ unable to escape the disgusting sight of the deformed , reduced , atrophied , poisoned ” ?
In other words : who would n’t prefer to see the “ student pranks ” of the bloody battlefield to the grotesque spectacle of predators pretending to be lambs ?
Hmm .
Two sections later , he counsels his predators to “ look on this a little mockingly and perhaps say to themselves , ‘ we do not feel any anger towards them , these good lambs , as a matter of fact , we love them : nothing is more tasty than a tender lamb ’ ” ( GM 1 , 13 ) .
This is because it is profoundly unnatural for strength to be disguised as anything other than what it is :
To demand of strength that it not express itself as strength , that it not be a desire to overwhelm , a desire to cast down , a desire to become lord , a thirst for enemies and resistances and triumphs , is just as nonsensical as to demand of weakness that it expresses itself as strength .
( GM 1 , 13 )
A quantum of power , he goes on to explain , just is its expression ; it is a philosophical or grammatical illusion to believe in some hidden “ doer ” behind the action , issuing behaviors according to its conscious control .
To be powerful is to do things expressing that power .
Thus it is impossible to expect a beast of prey to ever truly be a lamb .
Power will out .
It is hard to read these passages as anything other than a ringing endorsement of letting the beast - of - prey conscience range freely .
It is but a short step from this endorsement to full - blown fascism .
The elements are all in place .
A core theme of Nietzsche ’s thought is inegalitarianism , or elitism : clearly , some people are better than others ( healthier , freer , stronger ) .
He frequently expressed a fundamental distrust of democracy , or majority rule .
He did not believe weaker or disenfranchised people should receive the protection of law , since such protection would only preserve or reinforce their weakness .
He criticized the principles of liberalism , believing that an individual ’s rights are somehow a function of their breed , race , or class ;
In short , only the superior ones have rights , and their rights are commensurate with their power .
What then should the superior ones do , and what is their responsibility to the inferior ones ?
The Nietzschean answer is , fundamentally , that the superiors have responsibility to one another only to the extent that others can help them to build their own power .
To the inferior ones , the superior have no responsibility at all , except to present them with adversity , in the hope of building their strength and fashioning them into worthy opponents .
At the same time , it is true that Nietzsche would not expect the “ superior / inferior ” division to fall along nationalistic or racial lines .
He does , of course , write of races and breeds , and he launches broadsides against types of people ( the Germans , the English , women , etc. ) .
But it is hard to see this “ racism ” or chauvinism as committing him to anything more ( or less ) than a distinction among people based on their mental , emotional , or spiritual temperament .
This is perhaps enough to distinguish him from any historical fascism .
Against the liberals of his day , he resisted any doctrine of “ equality ” among individuals .
Against the nationalists and anti-Semites of his day , he resisted any shallow , ready - made typology of human beings .
He insisted upon his own typology , one grounded in the richness of one ’s psychology , subtlety of one ’s aesthetics , and command of one ’s strength .
As fascisms go , this has to rank as one of the most interesting ones .
The standard criticism against any political structure in which a few have all or most of the power , and most are relatively powerless , is that there is no effective guarantee that those with the power will yield it benevolently .
In Nietzsche ’s brand of fascism , there is very nearly a guarantee that the power will not be wielded benevolently , at least upon any intuitive notion of “ benevolence . ”
It would be interesting to try to work out the specific mechanics of a Nietzschean state , in the manner of Plato ’s Republic , where it is explained how individuals would enter the ruling class and what sorts of order would be imposed upon the masses .
Would it resemble the Spartan state , with warriors who not only fought valiantly but also created nuanced works of art ?
Would it be a less rigid free - for - all , like a lawless gangland , where the bosses respected not only firepower but also depth of soul ?
Whatever the details , one thing is clear : no one would wish themselves to be counted among the dispossessed .
WASHINGTON --
A top adviser to President - elect Barack Obama said Tuesday that the transition team would raise about $ 7 million to cover its costs , supplementing $ 5 million in government funds , but would reject donations from lobbyists or corporations and rely instead on the same pool of small donors who helped propel the Democrat to victory .
“ We ’ll raise all that money from individuals , ” said John D. Podesta , who is a co-chairman of Mr. Obama ’s transition team .
“ There ’s a $ 5,000 limit on those contributions . ”
In his remarks to a packed briefing room in the temporary transition offices here , Mr. Podesta , a former of chief of staff to President Bill Clinton , seemed intent on striking a tone of brisk efficiency and in advertising what he insisted would be historically high standards .
Under the rules announced by Mr. Podesta , federal lobbyists will not be allowed to raise money for the transition , nor continue lobbying while working in the transition .
In addition , he said that someone who became a lobbyist after being involved in the transition would be prohibited from lobbying the administration on related matters for 12 months .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are central to the US housing market US mortgage giant Fannie Mae did not cause the crisis in the American housing market , its former boss has told a key Congressional committee .
By the time Fannie Mae had started its riskier loan investments in 2005 , " the roots of the present crisis had long taken hold , " said Franklin Raines .
Mr Raines ' comments came in written testimony to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
Fannie Mae and sister firm Freddie Mac had to be bailed out in September .
They were rescued by the government in a move that could cost the US taxpayer $ 200 bn ( £ 137bn ) .
Giant losses
The two firms are now being administered by the Federal Housing Finance Agency until their long - term future is decided by President - elect Barak Obama 's new administration in the New Year .
FREDDIE MAC & FANNIE MAE
The two firms :
Buy mortgages from approved lenders and then sell them on to investors - rather than lending directly to borrowers Guarantee or own about half of the $ 12 trillion US mortgage market
Are relied on by almost all US mortgage lenders Supply funds to meet consumer demand for mortgages
Link mortgage lenders with investors - keeping the supply of money widely available and at a lower cost
Have no direct UK equivalent
Q&A : Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae
The importance of Freddie and Fannie Together , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantee or own about half of the $ 12 trillion US mortgage market - and the US government has now effectively assumed responsibility for that sum .
They do not lend directly to homeowners , rather they buy mortgages from approved lenders and then sell them on to investors .
As a result , they are relied upon by almost all US mortgage lenders .
Over the year to September the two companies lost nearly $ 14bn as growing numbers of homeowners defaulted on their mortgage loans .
The giant losses led to the government bail - out .
US President George Bush said at the time that they were taken over because they posed " an unacceptable risk " to the economy .
Mr Raines left Fannie Mae in 2004 following an accounting scandal .
The crisis in the US housing market - which sparked the wider global credit crunch - was caused by multi-million bad mortgage debts .
It spread around the world because much of this bed debt was repackaged into wider debt offerings which were subsequently resold .
Critics say that the two mortgage giants , which as government - sponsored enterprises could borrow money cheaply for their mortgage business , were too lightly regulated .

Watch this space folks -- it 's the end of an era .
Apple has just issued a press release stating that this coming MacWorld in January will be its last , and Steve Jobs wo n't be on hand to say goodbye .
Instead , Phil Schiller will be heading up the proceedings , thus marking a quiet end to a conference that 's been the launching point of some of the most important pieces of consumer tech in recent memory .
In Apple 's words : Apple is reaching more people in more ways than ever before , so like many companies , trade shows have become a very minor part of how Apple reaches its customers .
The increasing popularity of Apple 's Retail Stores , which more than 3.5 million people visit every week , and the Apple.com website enable Apple to directly reach more than a hundred million customers around the world in innovative new ways .
Apple has been steadily scaling back on trade shows in recent years , including NAB , Macworld New York , Macworld Tokyo and Apple Expo in Paris .
Oh , and just to clarify , this is merely Apple 's last MacWorld , not the last MacWorld .
IDG just made a statement confirming that it's on for an Apple - free MacWorld 2010 at the Moscone Center -- January 4th through 8th if you 're planning ahead .

Funny test answers , funny exam answers , that 's what we offer .
I have always answered every question on every test , even if that meant making something up .
This blog is my collection of tests from other people that done the same .
The Internet Watch Foundation has lifted its ban on a Wikipedia page and image of a record album cover showing a young nude girl , in an unprecedented move .
The IWF also acknowledged has its initial ban had the reverse effect that it wished — and spread the image further around the net instead of removing it .
The initial move last Friday by the IWF , which acts as a watchdog — and in effect censor — for internet content visible in the UK meant that some people could not see any pages on Wikipedia at all , while others were unable to edit pages on the user - generated encyclopedia .
The offending picture , from the 1976 album cover Virgin Killer by the German rock band Scorpions , showed a nude girl with a crack in the camera lens obscuring her genitals .
The band has said that the choice of picture was made by their record company , and it was later changed .
The IWF banned it after the web page location was sent to it last Thursday .
But a protest from the Wikimedia organisation on Monday led the IWF into an unprecedented reconsideration of its earlier ban .
Normally the IWF bans about 10,000 web pages from around the world every year , adding them to a blacklist whose contents are kept secret — but implemented — by all the biggest internet service providers and mobile operators .
After more than a day of consideration , the IWF has issued a press release in which it says that it has lifted the ban , after considering the " context " of the image — something which it had previously said would not affect the legitimacy of an image .
" The procedure is now complete and has confirmed that the image in question is potentially in breach of the Protection of Children Act 1978 , " the statement says .
" However , the IWF Board has today ( 9 December 2008 ) considered these findings and the contextual issues involved in this specific case and , in light of the length of time the image has existed and its wide availability , the decision has been taken to remove this webpage from our list . "
That is a surprising move , because it opens up the possibility that any site which finds itself blocked could claim that its content is , contextually , artistic — and so get a ban reversed .
It also throws into question the application by the IWF of its banning system , which is carried out by a four - strong team of analysts who work with the police 's Child Exploitation and Online Protection ( CEOP ) unit .
Copies of the image hosted abroad — such as on the Amazon US shopping site , which until yesterday did have the cover — will not be subject to a ban , the IWF said .
But it added that " any further reported instances of this image which are hosted in the UK will be assessed in line with IWF procedures " .
That means that an image could be considered pornographic in the UK but not the US — further confusing the role of the IWF .
The IWF also acknowledged that its efforts had had the reverse effect that it had intended .
" IWF 's overriding objective is to minimise the availability of indecent images of children on the internet , however , on this occasion our efforts have had the opposite effect .
We regret the unintended consequences for Wikipedia and its users . "

Bail Out Main Street NOT Wall Street !
Tens of millions of working and poor people are facing the most dire economic crisis since the Depression of the 1930s .
Yet our government is planning to hand over the U.S. treasury to Wall St. bankers .
All that the politicians offer to people who are losing their homes , jobs , health care , education and pensions are bigger and bigger budget cuts to vital social services .
Enough is Enough !
I say NO to this injustice .
NO Bailout of Wall Street bankers !
Instead , I demand the following emergency measures :
1. Moratorium on home foreclosures and evictions .
2. Freeze all job layoffs and extend unemployment benefits .
3 . Freeze all utility cutoffs & roll back gas , food and utility prices
4. Protect workers ’ pensions and savings — hands off Social Security .
5 . Debt cancellation for working and poor people — no repossessions or wage garnishing .
6. Moratorium on budget cuts in all social programs like health care , education , mass transit , youth programs , seniors programs , veterans programs and others .

A group of Human and Civil Rights activists working across America have faced repeated ( similar ) physical assaults by members of The Church of Scientology in San Francisco , Battle Creek , Michigan , Toronto , Ontario and internationally .
These pattern of attacks have come to be known as the " Catch Me If You Can Tech " by Scientology critics ; said to be part of a new Scientology method in dealing with street protests .
A Scientologist will first call the police and falsely report being chased by protesters .
They then sneak up on an unsuspecting activist , " punch them in the face " and run away .
One such occurrence ( caught on video ) in Los Angeles , California showed the crazed man admitting to an unprovoked attack and being arrested .
Another case on Sunday , October 26th near Golden Era Studio ; A young man & a female friend were lured in to bushes by Scientology Security Guards and beaten .
A Riverside Sheriffs officer arrived and arrested the male victim on " charges of trespassing . "
An investigation is underway .
One such remonstrance on L Ron Hubbard Way received major media coverage and drew international interest after a resident of L. Ron Hubbard Way and free speech activist spoke before the Los Angeles City Council to ask for a denial to Scientology 's motion to close the public street .
The Church of Scientology sought to continue having private parties every week , all year long .
This was the first time in two years that residents realized they had legislative recourse and means to end the loud noise , driveway blockages , threats and harassment they had endured .
In a Upland , Hollywood protesting ( over the death of Uwe Stuckenbrock ) , a young man was punched in the head while two witnesses filmed his fleeing attacker and awaited the police .
The victim stated , " There was absolutely no provocation on my part .
The guy came from behind me , punched me and tried to get away . "
Scientologist attorney Kendrick Moxon was on hand and demanded cameras to stop recording or he would be forced to sue .
There was an attempt to lie to the LAPD .
The attacker had called them and reported " being chased by Anonymous . "
If not for the video tape , there would have been no evidence to collaborate the story .
Luckily the criminal was arrested .
Uwe Stuckenbrock , was a German national and former International Security Chief of Scientology , who died October 8 of multiple sclerosis while in a Scientology compound on L. Ron Hubbard Way .
Stuckenbrock was undergoing a form of Scientology punishment called RPF ( Rehabilitation Project Force ) , which includes reduced rations and hard labor , meted out to the elite Scientology Sea Organization members for perceived crimes against Scientology .
The Church of Scientology media releases have encouraged a hatred against the demonstrators linking them with an online hacking group called 4 Chan and defining them as terrorists , thieves , cyber - punks , murderers , etc .
One such statement from John Carmichael , the president of the Church of Scientology in New York City , falsely accused the Civil & Human Rights Protesters ' Anonymous ' with an involvement in the November 2007 shooting at Jokela High School , in which a young man named Pekka - Eric Auvinen shot and killed nine people , including himself .

But who decides exactly what time it is ?
Professor Brian
Cox meets the man in charge of all our timekeeping - the world 's director of time .
Time is something we all take for granted .
Morning turns to evening ; autumn drifts into winter and another year becomes history as the earth completes one more journey around the sun .
But what is time ?
How do we measure its passing ?
Does it always tick at the same rate ?
Did it have a beginning , and will it ever end ?

These are questions that might seem better placed in a philosophy course , but in fact they are immensely important , not only for understanding our place in the universe but also for the functioning of the 21st Century world .
From financial transactions to satellite navigation , we rely on everyone on the planet agreeing on a unique , precise timestamp .
Get the time wrong and money and lives could be lost .
The responsibility for ensuring we all keep the right time rests with Dr Dennis McCarthy , the world 's director of time .
More than anyone , Dr McCarthy appreciates the need for the world 's population to be synchronised .
But for those who do n't spend their working day checking atomic clocks , why is knowing the time so important ?
Think for a moment about how the GPS satellite navigation system works .
There is a network of over 30 satellites orbiting earth that broadcast a high - precision time - stamp down to the GPS system in your car .
These signals travel at the speed of light , which is very nearly one foot every thousand - millionth of a second - or one nanosecond ( for the more metrically minded , that 's around 30 cm , which is far less elegant .
If there is a God , he built the universe using imperial measurements ) .
Wind resistance
By measuring the time delay between all the different signals , your GPS can work out your position relative to all the satellites , and therefore your position on earth , assuming that all the clocks remain precisely in sync .
The atomic clock is actually putting out an electronic signal which is essentially analogous to the ticking of a pendulum clock
Dr Dennis McCarthy , director of time
The GPS system is accurate to better than 16ft ( 5 m ) , which means that everyone in the world using GPS must agree on the time to within 16 nanoseconds .
How difficult is this ?
Until 1967 the second was defined using the motion of the earth .
This is perhaps in accordance with our intuition .
The earth rotates once on its axis every 24 hours , and there are 3,600 seconds in one hour .
That would be fine if the earth kept good time , but in fact it does n't .
The earth 's rotation rate changes every day by thousands of nanoseconds , and this is due in a large part to wind .
When winds push against mountain ranges , they can either speed up or slow down the rate of spin of the solid ground , transferring that spin into the atmosphere .
Over the course of thousands of days , these changes in the rate of spin of the earth can result in the earth 's rotation getting " out of sync " with the high - precision atomic clocks that we use to keep the GPS system ticking over .
Leap second
That 's where Dr McCarthy comes in .
Based in the US capital , Washington DC , Dennis McCarthy 's job is to keep an eye on the effects of small variations in the earth 's rotation and add or subtract " leap seconds " .
The next one will be on 31 December this year - December 2008 will last one second longer than December 2007 , when no leap seconds were added .
One of the atomic clocks at the Washington Observatory The director of time works for the equally grandly named International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service .
It receives data on the earth 's rotation from a series of observatories around the world that plot the earth 's exact position relative to a grid constructed from extremely bright , distant astronomical objects known as quasars .
These are distant galaxies , some over 10 billion light years away , powered by super - massive black holes which devour entire star systems and shine with the light of a trillion suns .
Because they are so distant , their position in the sky is absolutely fixed relative to the earth and they form a very steady and precise reference system relative to which we can measure the earth 's rate of spin , and thereby keep our clocks in sync with the Earth 's rotation .
" We have a number of clocks at the naval observatory located all over the grounds , " says Dr McCarthy , as he gives me a tour of the Washington facility .
9bn ticks a second " The atomic clock is actually putting out an electronic signal which is essentially analogous to the ticking of a pendulum clock ... which might tick once every second or once every couple of seconds , " says Dr McCarthy .
" This thing is providing us something which is going nine billion times per second so it provides us with a very fine definition of the time . "
As if this was n't enough , there is a more fundamental problem for global timekeeping .
In 1905 , Albert Einstein 's theory of relativity showed that there is no such thing as absolute time .
Every clock , everywhere in the universe , ticks at a different rate relative to every other clock .
For GPS , this is an enormous issue because it turns out that the clocks on the satellites drift by almost 40,000 nanoseconds per day relative to the clocks on the ground because they are high above the earth 's surface ( and therefore in a weaker gravitational field ) and are moving fast relative to the ground .
Forty - thousand nanoseconds is 40 thousand feet , so you see the problem .
Einstein 's equations first written down in 1905 and 1915 are used to correct for this time - shift , allowing GPS to work , planes to navigate safely and you to get to your relations ' house at the other end of the country without getting lost this Christmas .
There is a complex and wonderful industry behind the seemingly simple job of keeping the world in sync .

Interesting article , but for the stupid push towards the Imperial system .
If I remember well , on one of the last UK attempts to launch a probe , it missed its target by billions of miles because some British scientist measured acceleration in inches per second .
If you want to grow up and stay up to date in science , stop promoting the imperial system .
Or it will keep your research at imperial level .
Osylc , London " ... which is very nearly one foot every thousand - millionth of a second - or one nanosecond ( for the more metrically minded , that 's around 30 cm , which is far less elegant .
If there is a God , he built the universe using imperial measurements ) "
What utter nonsense - " very nearly one foot " , " that 's around 30 cm " .
How very precise and scientific !
And God does not use imperial measurements - it 's just dumb humans .
Ian , Glos , UK " The GPS system is accurate to better than 16ft ( 5 m ) , which means that everyone in the world using GPS must agree on the time to within 16 nanoseconds . "
Errm , no it does n't .
Obviously it does n't .
Only the satellites have to agree , users simply compare the differential between the signals , their knowledge of the actual time is irrelevant .
Stew , Phnom Penh , Cambodia
This very interesting article omits saying anything about the fact that the rotation of the earth is slowing down , due to the action of the tides .
Also if we harness the energy of the tides to produce electricity for mankind 's needs , we are actually taking the Earth 's kinetic energy of rotation for the purpose , making it slow down even more .
But this energy would otherwise simply be expended in causing erosion of coasts .
Perhaps our activities are actually good for the environment here .
David Butcher , Luton , UK " December 2008 will last one second longer than December 2007 , when no leap seconds were added " - that 's amazing considering that 2008 had 29 days in it in 2008 but not 2007 .
Curph , London 2008 is a leap year it's a day and one second longer than 2007
Awen Saunders , Portland , Oregon , USA
The question is what to do with the extra second this year ?

Future Fund head David Murray says the financial crisis means the Government will not have the money it wants to set up three new infrastructure funds .
The Government wants to create a $ 20 billion ' Building Australia ' fund , an $ 11b education investment fund , and put $ 10 b into a health and hospitals fund .
Some of the money was to come from this year 's budget surplus and some from next year's .
But Mr Murray says the downturn means those plans will have to change .
" I do n't know the timing but on a cyclical basis there 's no way those sort of surpluses will be available to any Australian government , " he said .
" The currency has fallen , commodity prices have fallen , the global economy is contracting quite noticeably .
" Asia is not decoupled from that .
And so on that basis it will be far more difficult to manage the Budget than it has been . "
Guarantee concerns
Mr Murray also says there is no need for the Federal Government to charge a fee for guaranteeing big bank deposits .
Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan announced last week that there would be a fee of about 1 per cent for deposits above $ 1 million to get the Government 's backing for the next three years .
Mr Murray says the guarantee was needed , but the Government could have given more thought to the way it was done .
" In my view , this guarantee should be viewed as a public good because there was no bank insolvency problem , " he said
" The taxpayer here is not coming to the rescue of any individual bank in difficulty .
For that reason there is no argument for a fee at all on this guarantee .
" But what the Government must do is get out of the guarantee in that three - year period . "
Mr Murray also suggested the Government should buy into the investment funds which have frozen withdrawals .
The Federal Government is currently talking to the investment industry about ways to unlock some of the money .
The funds have frozen withdrawals to stop people transferring their money to take advantage of the Government 's guarantee on bank deposits .
Mr Murray says that is a problem .
" There is a market distortion caused by the guarantee , " he said .
" What the Government and the banks should do , with the support of the Reserve Bank , is to get in and find a way of providing some liquidity into these funds by buying their securities at market prices .
Not necessarily up to the value of the whole fund , but to provide some liquidity . "
A public servant who worked with ACT Health 's alcohol and drugs services has been sentenced to two - and - a - half years jail for growing marijuana .
Mark Vincent Blattman , 51 , was arrested in June after police found 75 marijuana plants on his property in Sutton , north - east of the ACT .
Police say the plants were valued at $ 150,000 .
Blattman pleaded guilty to cultivation of cannabis and other charges .
He told the Queanbeyan District Court he grew the plants to help his wife who suffers from chronic migraines .
Blattman worked as a drug and alcohol counsellor with ACT Health before his arrest .
Today District Court Judge James Bennett SC sentenced Blattman to two - and - a - half years ' jail , with eligibility for release in June next year .
MONTREAL–While Jean Charest enjoyed the sweet taste of historic electoral success , his fierce rival , the one - time boy wonder of Quebec politics , bitterly announced his resignation today after five failed attempts to become premier .
Charest 's Liberals were re-elected with a razor - thin majority government as he became the first Quebec premier in more than half a century to capture three straight terms .
But Monday 's result carried a stunning reversal of fortune for Mario Dumont – who just 20 months ago came within a whisker of becoming premier .
In a whirlwind political career that saw him become a household name in his early 20s , build the Action democratique du Quebec party from scratch and become a poster child for the province 's conservatives over five elections , Dumont 's career in Quebec politics appears over .
The ADQ leader said he would not lead his party into the next election following a disastrous result Monday that saw him tumble from official Opposition status to third - party annihilation with just a handful of seats .
Dumont is so closely associated with the ADQ that the party 's official six - word title carries his name .
His departure from the provincial scene will stir the imagination of federal Conservatives who have long sought to bolster their weak Quebec ranks by adding him to their roster .
Dumont 's frequent policy shifts in whichever direction the public - opinion winds blew – including on the sovereignty question – earned him the derisive nickname , " The Weathervane . "
The man who coined the insulting moniker was smiling Monday .
After having his political obituary penned repeatedly , Charest celebrated an electoral feat not even attained by giants of Quebec politics like Rene Levesque , Lucien Bouchard and Robert Bourassa .
Charest became the first Quebec premier since the 1950s to win three consecutive mandates as his Liberals won a slim majority mandate after 20 months of minority rule .
But success risked carrying a bittersweet twist for Charest .
The margin of the coveted majority is so miniscule that it risks being wiped out by Liberal floor - crossings , health scares , or even the selection of a Liberal as Speaker in the national assembly .
Charest 's victory carries a host of potential implications for Canadian politics and will be greeted as welcome news in the nation 's capital .
His Liberals were hovering just above the 63 - seat total needed to gain a majority in the 125 - seat legislature .
The Parti Quebecois won the bulk of the remaining Opposition seats as Leader Pauline Marois outperformed expectations in guiding the party back from third - party status .
The ADQ , the upstart right - wing party that found itself last year within a whisker of power , was restored to its traditional place in Quebec 's electoral wasteland with barely a half - dozen seats .
The left - wing Quebec solidaire party elected its first - ever member , a Montreal microbiologist and party co-leader named Amir Khadir , in a downtown Montreal riding .
When Charest called the election Nov. 5 , he invited a flood of accusations that he was cynically holding an unnecessary vote only to take advantage of his party 's strong poll numbers .
He argued that Quebecers needed a stable majority government to weather the coming economic storm and hammered the theme right up to the last moment .
" The backdrop to this election is the economy , which for us is very important , " Charest said as he cast his own ballot in Sherbrooke , Que .
" Choosing the next government that will have the responsibility of leading Quebec in this economic period is extremely , extremely important . "
Voter turnout was extremely low – roughly 60 per cent , compared with 71 per cent in the last election – following a campaign that failed to inspire much public interest .
Charest called the vote one day after Barack Obama 's U.S. election win , prompting pundits to lament the bland state of the province 's politics compared with the historic vote down South .
The provincial campaign was later eclipsed by the political crisis in Ottawa and banished from the front pages .
But Charest 's election gamble paid off for his party .
After nearly losing power in the March 2007 provincial election , party members were whispering about replacing Charest as recently as last fall .
But several key events propelled his improbable journey from lamentable poll numbers to some of the highest recorded levels of voter satisfaction in provincial history .
The ADQ bombed in opposition .
Charest reorganized his office .
And the premier bolstered his nationalist credentials by picking the occasional fight with Ottawa .
He now becomes the first premier since strongman Maurice Duplessis to win a third term and the reverberations of his win will be felt across the nation 's political landscape .
Already , Charest 's name comes in Parliament Hill chatter whenever the subject turns to possible future leaders of the federal Conservative party .
Monday 's result will do nothing to quell such talk .
But the more immediate result is that the sovereignty debate remains relegated to the back burner of the national conversation .
Such stability will come as a relief to Prime Minister Stephen Harper .
A Charest loss would have produced an extremely rare alignment of Canada 's political stars : a separatist government in Quebec City facing a federal government headed by a non-Quebecer .

Pierre Trudeau , Jean Chrétien and Brian Mulroney held office for all but a few months while the PQ governed in Quebec – the only exceptions being the brief reigns of Joe Clark and John Turner .
The recent federal election campaign offered vivid examples of the potential volatility Harper has been spared with Monday 's result .
His Conservatives were overwhelmed by a backlash in the province over arts - funding cuts , and after failing to detect it they were so badly thumped by the Bloc Quebecois in the ensuing public - relations war that it likely cost them a majority government .
Charest was , to the dismay of Conservatives outside Quebec , among the more vocal critics of those funding cuts .
It was the latest twist in his increasingly strained relationship with Harper .
Ironically , the ups - and - downs of that relationship have been as pronounced as the topsy - turvy trend lines of Charest 's own improbable career path .
A one - time wonder kid of federal politics , Charest was practically forced to abandon his job as federal Progressive Conservative leader in 1998 and make the leap to provincial politics .
He lost his first provincial election several months later .
He was given up for dead by the province 's pundits as he entered the 2003 campaign in third place among francophone voters .
But a solid performance in that year 's leaders ' debate capped a surprise comeback win .
Then , halfway through a gaffe - plagued first mandate , Charest appeared destined to remain a one - term premier as he recorded some of the worst polling numbers in Canadian history – with approval ratings spiralling into the teens .
That 's when Harper took office .
With a province - friendly government in Ottawa , Charest made a staggering political comeback as he gained a series of concessions for Quebec : more federal cash transfers , a special spot for at the UN 's cultural forum , and a recognition of the Quebecois nation within a united Canada .
But the relationship with Harper began to sour when Charest immediately used Ottawa 's so - called fiscal imbalance cash to cut taxes .
Conservatives expressed their displeasure that Charest 's move could prompt a taxpayer backlash elsewhere in Canada – and Charest replied that he did n't owe Ottawa an explanation for his budgetary choices .
Charest lost his majority government and almost lost power in the election last year .
A few months later , he and the prime minister nearly stopped speaking when Harper attended an event with Dumont .
The prime minister could hardly be forgiven : many members of Charest 's own party were musing that his days were numbered .
One potential successor had even jokingly printed up T - shirts for his leadership campaign .
It was around that time that Charest reorganized his office .
Bolstered by a staff that included former aides to Bourassa and one - time Ontario premier David Peterson , Charest stuck to a more narrow and focused agenda and struck a more nationlist tone with Ottawa .
Meanwhile , the ADQ was flopping during its big audition .
Dumont himself admitted that his party was ill - prepared for a stint as the official Opposition , one he hoped would serve as a stepping stone to victory the next time around .

Omar Osama Bin Laden has publicly condemned terrorism
One of Osama Bin Laden 's sons has asked for political asylum in Spain , local officials say .
Omar Osama Bin Laden , aged 27 , made his claim after a scheduled stopover at Madrid 's Barajas airport on a flight from Egypt to Morocco .
The reasons for his asylum request were not immediately clear .
The self - declared pacifist son of the al - Qaeda leader was earlier this year refused entry to live in the UK with his 52 - year - old British wife .
The Spanish authorities said they would deal with Mr Bin Laden 's case " speedily " , Spain 's El Pais newspaper reported .
He was carrying a Saudi passport , the Spanish interior ministry officials said .
He currently lives in Cairo , with wife Zaina Alsabah - Bin Laden , formerly named Jane Felix - Browne , from Cheshire .
They had hoped to move to Mrs Bin Laden 's home in north - western England .
The couple said the visa application was rejected in April after the British authorities had judged that it might not be " conducive to the public good " .
It is thought the authorities were referring to comments made by Mr Bin Laden that he could not prove 100 % that his father - whom he says he has not seen since he was 19 - was responsible for the 2001 attacks in the US or the London bombings in 2005 .
Mrs Bin Laden , who is severely visually impaired , said she needed access to medical treatment in the UK but refused to be apart from her husband .
Mr Bin Laden is one of 19 sons of the al - Qaeda leader .
ANCHORAGE 
Two days after he was convicted on seven felony counts in Washington , Senator Ted Stevens returned to Alaska on Wednesday night to begin a six - day campaign sprint , telling several hundred supporters at a rally here that he would be vindicated on appeal and asking them to elect him to a seventh term .
“ I will represent Alaska in the senate while my lawyers pursue the appeals to clear my name , ” Mr. Stevens said .
Mr. Stevens faces a strong re-election challenge from Mark Begich , the mayor of Anchorage , a Democrat .
Even as top Republican leaders have called on Mr. Stevens to resign and many political experts believe his chances of re-election are slim , some people refuse to rule out the possibility of his winning , given his stature here .
Image Senator Ted Stevens autographed campaign signs after his return to Anchorage .

The senator , a 40 - year incumbent known for delivering billions of dollars of federal money and projects to Alaska , was met in an airplane hangar here on Wednesday night with chants of “ We need Ted . ”
Can policy be both wise and aggressively partisan ?
Ask any Republican worth his salt and the answer will be an unequivocal yes .
Ask a Democrat of the respectable Beltway variety and he will twist himself into a pretzel denying it .
For decades Republicans have made policy with a higher purpose in mind : to solidify the GOP base or to damage the institutions and movements aligned with the other side .
One of their fondest slogans is " Defund the Left , " and under that banner they have attacked labor unions and trial lawyers and tried to sever the links between the lobbying industry and the Democratic Party .
Consider as well their long - cherished dreams of privatizing Social Security , which would make Wall Street , instead of Washington , the protector of our beloved seniors .
Or their larger effort to demonstrate , by means of egregious misrule , that government is incapable of delivering the most basic services .
That these were all disastrous policies made no difference :
The goal was to use state power to achieve lasting victory for the ideas of the right .
On the other side of the political fence , strategic moves of this kind are fairly rare .
Instead , for most of my lifetime , prominent Democratic leaders have been chucking liberalism itself for the sake of immediate tactical gain .
Former President Bill Clinton , who is widely regarded as a political mastermind , may have sounded like a traditional liberal at the beginning of his term in office .
But what ultimately defined his presidency was his amazing pliability on matters of principle .
His most memorable innovation was " triangulating " between his own party and the right , his most famous speech declared and end to " the era of big government , " his most consequential policy move was to cement the consensus on deregulation and free trade , and many of his boldest stands were taken against his own party .

And here ’s the first couple paragraphs from the front page article in today ’s New York Times :
But the judge has permitted Mr. Rather to go forward with the core of his case , including his argument that CBS had limited his work as a correspondent after he left the anchor desk and , in the process , damaged his reputation .
The case is on track to go to trial soon , possibly early in the new year .
Those who have worked on the case with Mr. Rather , 77 , say he has approached it with the zeal of a correspondent trying to report out a “ 60 Minutes ” segment about himself , burying himself in deposition transcripts late into the night and providing his lawyers with road maps of leads he thinks they should pursue .
He rarely misses a court hearing on the case .
“ I want to go the distance , ” Mr. Rather said recently over a lunch of chili and cornbread at a barbecue restaurant .
“ Like any good reporter , I want to get as many as facts as possible ; I want to get to the bottom of the story . ”
Some of the documents unearthed by his investigation include notes taken at the time by Linda Mason , a vice president of CBS News .
According to her notes , one potential panel member , Warren Rudman , a former Republican senator from New Hampshire , was deemed a less - than - ideal candidate over fears by some that he would not “ mollify the right . ”
Meanwhile , Mr. Thornburgh , who served as attorney general for both Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush , was named a panelist by CBS , but only after a CBS lobbyist “ did some other testing , ” in which she was told , according to Ms. Mason ’s notes , “ T comes back with high marks from G.O.P . ”
Another memorandum turned over to Mr. Rather ’s lawyers by CBS was a long typed list of conservative commentators apparently receiving some preliminary consideration as panel members , including Rush Limbaugh , Matt Drudge , Ann Coulter and Pat Buchanan .
At the bottom of that list , someone had scribbled “ Roger Ailes , ” the founder of Fox News .
Asked about the assembly of the panel in a sworn deposition , Andrew Heyward , the former president of CBS News , acknowledged that he had wanted at least one member to sit well with conservatives : “ CBS News , fairly or unfairly , had a reputation for liberal bias , ” and “ the harshest scrutiny was obviously going to come from the right . ”
The new headquarters of one of the world ’s most popular websites is 3,000 square feet of rented space furnished with desks and chairs bought on the cheap from EBay and Craigslist .
A sheet of printer paper taped to the door says the office belongs to the Wikimedia Foundation , the nonprofit that runs Wikipedia , the online almanac of anything and everything that users want to chronicle , from Thomas Aquinas to Zorba the Greek .
With about 300 million page views a day , the site by some estimates could be worth many hundreds of millions of dollars if it sold advertising space .
It does n’t .
Wikipedia ’s business plan is , basically , to hold out a tin cup whenever it runs low on funds , which is very often .
When it comes to money , “ we are about as unsophisticated as we could possibly be , ” Executive Director Sue Gardner said as she swept up Styrofoam packing nuts in the office , the foundation ’s home since it relocated in January from St. Petersburg , Fla .
“ It ’s time for us to grow up a little bit . ”

Growing up can be hard to do .
Wikipedia , the “ encyclopedia anyone can edit , ” is stuck in a weird Internet time warp , part grass - roots labor of love , part runaway success .
A global democracy beloved by high school term paper writers and run largely by volunteers , the site is controlled for now by people who seem to view revenue with suspicion and worry that too much money -- maybe even just a little money -- would defile and possibly ruin the biggest encyclopedia in the history of the written word .
“ Imagine if the other top 10 websites in the world , like Yahoo or Google , tried to run their budgets by asking for donations from 14 - year olds , ” said Chad Horohoe , a 19 - year - old college student in Richmond , Va. , who was until recently a Wikipedia site administrator , one of the 1,500 or so people authorized to delete pages or block users from making changes to articles .
“ It is n’t sustainable . ”

Looking at it one way , it ’s cheap to run Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation ’s other endeavors , which include an online compendium of quotations and a multilingual dictionary and thesaurus .
The annual budget is $ 4.6 million , more than half of it dedicated to 300 computer servers and other equipment .
On the other hand , the foundation has a tough time raising a few million dollars .
The last fundraising campaign featured a video of co-founder Jimmy Wales literally wringing his hands in desperation .
The 45,000 or so individuals who contribute annually give an average of $ 33 each , so campaigns , which are conducted online , raise only about one - third of what ’s needed .
For the rest , foundation directors have to hit up outside donors , such as Stephen J. Luczo of Seagate Technology and U2’s Bono .
Recent money - making proposals include a Wikipedia television game show , a Wikipedia board game and Wikipedia T - shirts .
Gardner said that a board game might by OK but that a game show would be problematic , because game shows are competitive and Wikipedia is collaborative .

How about selling advertising space like most big - time websites do ?
Do n’t go there unless you want to start a Wikipedian riot .
Some members of the foundation ’s board of trustees and most of the site ’s editors and contributing writers zealously oppose advertising .
After a staff member in 2002 raised the possibility in the Wikipedia community , a facet of the Spanish - language branch quit and created the forever ad - free Enciclopedia Libre Universal en Espanol .
Its founders said that advertising “ implied the existence of a commercialization of the selfless work of volunteers . ”
Ads would be “ threatening to Wikipedia ’s neutrality , ” said Michael Bimmler , a 16 - year - old high school student who has been a contributor for more than four years and is president of the foundation ’s Swiss chapter .
Readers would be suspicious about articles if ads were near them , he said , and would wonder why certain articles were longer than others .
Besides , he added , ads are ugly .
The debate over Wikipedia ’s future took a tabloid turn last week when gossip sites started buzzing over allegations by former Wikipedian Danny Wool , who recently launched Veripedia , which says it authenticates Wikipedia articles .
Wool posted on his blog claims that co-founder Wales had , among other things , been imprudent with Wikipedia funds , asking the foundation to pay for visits to massage parlors and other non-Wikipedia - related activities .

As those allegedly scandalous tidbits zoomed around the Internet , the website Antisocialmedia .net ( which says it is in the business of “ exposing user - generated discontent ” ) got the attention of the blogosphere when it posted a rant about Wales supposedly having fiddled with one Wikipedia article on behalf of a girlfriend before he broke up with her and doctoring another in exchange for a $ 5,000 donation .
Tech industry gossip site Valleywag got involved by posting what appeared to be instant message exchanges between Wales and the ex-girlfriend , political commentator Rachel Mardsen , who put some of his clothes up for sale on EBay .
Wales and Wikimedia said he had never misused foundation funds , and Wales posted a statement online saying that he cared deeply about Wikipedia ’s integrity and would never abuse it .
Gardner said in a statement that Wales “ has consistently put the foundation ’s interests ahead of his own . ”
In San Francisco , Gardner said that she was n’t planning wholesale changes as executive director , and that her first task was to “ fix the basics and get the house in order . ”
Gardner , a petite woman with black hair and a tattoo of a black widow spider on her wrist , joined Wikipedia nine months ago after leaving Canadian Broadcasting Co. , where she oversaw the introduction of advertising on its website .
She said she did n’t foresee a time when Wikipedia would go that route , though she added that she should never say never .

So far , Gardner has hired a staff lawyer , an accountant and a head of business development .
She has created a travel policy , reimbursement policy and code of conduct for employees and instituted criminal background checks for potential hires ( Wikimedia got unwanted publicity after a technology site revealed in December that the foundation ’s chief operating officer until July had been convicted of theft , drunk driving and fleeing a car accident before being hired . )
Now comes the hard part : money .
The foundation makes some -- less than 2 % of its budget -- from ways other than flat out asking for it , Gardner said .
For instance , it licenses the Wikipedia logo to companies such as Nokia , which used it to advertise a new phone , and it charges websites such as Answers.com for real - time feeds with page updates .
“ The most difficult issue for a nonprofit is always how to raise money in ways which are consistent with the mission , ” Gardner said , “ and do n’t distract too much from the mission - related work . ”

In the early days , funding was n’t a problem .
Wales helped launched Wikipedia in 2001 with money he made through Bomis Inc. , a Web portal known for directing users to pictures of women and celebrities , clothed and unclothed .
By February 2004 , the English - language Wikipedia had nearly 250,000 alphabetized articles .
Today the English version has more than 2 million articles .
Global interest in the volume of information -- and the fact that it ’s free -- helped the site grow from the 100th most visited in 2005 to the ninth most visited now , according to Web - traffic tracker Alexa .
Decisions , financial and otherwise , are made by the Wikimedia Foundation board , whose seven directors include Wales , a French plant geneticist , a classical bassoonist studying law in Virginia and an Italian computer programmer .
Most board members are nominated and elected , via e-mail debate and balloting , by Wikipedia editors and contributors .
As Wikimedia adds features to its pages , such as videos , costs will rise .
“ Without financial stability and strong planning , the foundation runs the risk of needing to take drastic steps at some point in the next couple years , ” said Nathan Awrich , a 26 - year - old Wikipedia editor from Vermont who supports advertising .

Outsiders find it hard to see how the site can avoid selling ad space .
“ They either have to charge people or run ads , or both , ” said Greg Sterling , an analyst at Sterling Market Intelligence , which specializes in consumer behavior online .
E-mail traffic among Wikipedia contributors shed light on the depth of financing anxiety and the details that cause angst .
One worried about the tax implications of the site accepting more than $ 200 from any individual .
Another complained about a proposal to give T - shirts to donors .
Wrote one person : “ All of this fundraising talk is very nice and dandy , but it sounds like plans for the local glee club , not an international foundation . ”
Foundation Director Erik Moeller said the foundation had to be “ very , very careful with the kinds of deals we want to make ” to sustain itself .

“ We do n’t want to endanger the mission by entering into deals that would conflict with it , ” said Moeller , a German technology writer who was elected to the foundation board in 2006 and named director last year .
Some people have abandoned Wikipedia for Wikipedia - like companies and organizations , including Citizendium and Veripedia , and speak of joining Google ’s yet - to - be- launched “ knol ” project .
Co-founder Wales started a for - profit that operates a Google - like search engine and allows users to write Wikipedia - like articles .
Wales ’ site , called Wikia , runs ads .
Wales said that the free culture movement , as it ’s called , has to think creatively if it wants to keep spreading information to computers around the world .
“ There are some real problems with a nonprofit structure , ” he said .
“ One of the basic problems is funding :
We can get enough money to survive but do n’t really have the funding to push forward or innovate . ”

New Bigger , Flashier Times Square Ball is Powered by LEDs
December 24th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
There ’s no amount of money that could convince me to spend New Year ’s Eve in Times Square , but even I have to admit that this year ’s Ball is innovative .
The new Ball , which weighs 11,875 pounds and is double the size of previous Balls , will light up with help from 32,256 Philips Luxeon Rebel LEDs .
The LEDs create billions of patterns , 16 million colors , and make the Ball 10 to 20 percent more energy efficient than last year .
Skeptics may try to point out that that does n’t make the showy orb truly energy efficient , but they ’re wrong — it consumes the same amount of energy per hour as two traditional home ovens .
Times Square will also feature a slightly less exciting green element this year : a people - powered 2009 sign .
Revelers can already pedal on bicycles in Duracell ’s Times Square “ power lodge ” to generate energy for the sign .
According to organizers , 95 pedal hours have been stored thus far .
230 hours are necessary to power the sign for 10 to 15 minutes .
Clearly , the “ power lodge ” is designed more to create energy awareness than to actually make a difference — but considering how many people have their eyes on Times Square come January 1 , maybe it ’s not such a bad idea .

Turn Left at the Last Traffic Light
It happened a while ago – before GPS devices , and before Google Maps or Mapquest .
I was trying to drive to an address in a small town and I did what reasonable people did back then : I asked someone at a gas station for directions .
One detail from the directions stands out in my memory : the gas station attendant told me to “ turn left at the last traffic light . ”
I was so astonished that it took me a few seconds just to react .
Then I asked him , “ How do I know which traffic light is the last one ? ”
Maybe you ’ve never gotten directions like that , but I ’ll bet you ’ve seen or heard similar statements .
Here are a few of my favorites :
Crazy Statements
– Buy at the bottom .
Of course we ’ll only know we were at the bottom after the market has climbed for a while , but the advice sounds good .
– Cook it until it ’s done .
This is actually meaningful to some people , but not to someone who does n’t know how to recognize the appearance of food that is fully cooked .
I fall into the latter category .
– Keep testing until you find the last bug .
I guess in theory there is a “ last bug , ” but I ’ve never found it .
There always seems to be one more hiding out there somewhere .
– Just make the new system do the same things the old one did .
It ’s not obvious when you first hear it , but this kind of requirement includes three parts :
1 . The documented things that the old system does
2 . The things the old system does that are n’t in the documentation ( some of them probably just work that way by accident – they were n’t designed that way at all )
3 . The things the old system does n’t do that are in the documentation
Good luck finding them all .
And you ’ll need even more luck to have the new system recreate them .
– Give me a disaster recovery plan that anticipates every possible disaster .
I guess that should include the possibility that I go crazy and destroy all of the backup hardware .
– The IT Strategy should align with the business strategy ( but I wo n’t tell you the business strategy ) .
A passive - aggressive classic .
The “ Catch - 22 ” of IT .
What do all of these statements have in common ?
They all sound meaningful at first glance , but they provide advice that is useless to the listener without additional information – information which is n’t being provided , or which maybe does n’t even exist .
What should you do when you ’re given one of these crazy statements ?
Ah , that ’s the important question !
I ’ll answer that for each of the statements I ’ve included so far .
How to Answer Crazy Statements
– Turn left at the last traffic light .
Ask how you ’ll recognize the “ last ” traffic light .
Is there a street name ?
A landmark ?
Does it have a sign that says , “ last traffic light ” ?
– Buy at the bottom .
This one ’s a matter of risk .
Statistically , you can assume that there ’s been a short - term bottom when the index or stock you ’re following gains a certain amount .
The more the stock gains , and the longer it stays above the bottom , the more likely it is that a worthwhile bottom was reached , and that it ’s time to buy .
It all comes down to how much of a premium you want to pay for risk minimization .
Wait a day or a week and the stock may go below its last bottom .
Wait a year and the bottom is more assured , but you ’ll have to pay a higher price for the stock .
– Cook it until it ’s done .
Ask for hints :
About how long will that take ?
What should I look for ?
Bubbles around the edge ?
Browning ?
Smoke coming out of the oven ?
– Keep testing until you find the last bug .
I ’ve heard people suggest that you base this on time : that you test until you have n’t found a bug within a certain amount of time .
But time is n’t a good predictor if you ’re just running the same tests over and over .
I once heard a better solution ( I think it came from Jerry Weinberg ) that suggests that you take a piece of software that is being tested and you artificially create a certain number of bugs in the software – in effect you “ seed ” the software with bugs .
Then you see how many of the seeded bugs are discovered during testing , and how long it takes .
This should give you some idea of how many real bugs still lurk out there waiting to be discovered .
In most cases – assuming the people who plant your seed bugs try to make them subtle – you ’ll probably find it difficult to find all of the seeded bugs .
( Remember to take the seeded bugs out of the software – and then retest – before you release the software . )
– Just make the new system do the same things the old one did .
The best way to deal with this requirement is to refuse to accept it .
It is virtually impossible to exactly duplicate the way a piece of software works without developing it using all of the same tools .
Since in most cases you ’re replacing the software because it uses obsolete tools or technologies , you need to go back to square one when redefining the requirements .
Work with the system users to extract the essence of what the old software does .
Focus on the process the users go through in using the old software , and try to find ways to improve the process .
Then develop new software that optimizes the performance of the users with the new improved process .
If the user process is improved , then no one will care whether the new software works exactly the same way as the old software .
– Give me a disaster recovery plan that anticipates every possible disaster .
Disaster recovery is a risk / reward game .
It ’s OK to brainstorm a set of crazy risks ; in fact , it ’s a good idea to try to list anything that might possibly go wrong ( I say “ try ” because you ’ll never anticipate everything ) .
Then try to categorize all of the risks on your list into scenarios where the disaster recovery can be done the same way .
You ’ll eventually arrive at a short list of scenarios that you need to plan for .
Evaluate the cost of providing for each scenario and compare it to the probability and cost of not having any disaster recovery plan available .
Then work with the business to make decisions about how much to spend on preparing for each scenario .
– The IT Strategy should align with the business strategy ( but I wo n’t tell you the business strategy ) .
This happens more often than you ’d think .
I tell IT executives that when they ca n’t get business executives to tell them the business strategy ( or when the IT executives ca n’t be involved in the creation of the business strategy in the first place ) , then the IT executives should write down what they think the business strategy is , and what the corresponding IT strategy should be .
Then they should go back to the business executives and give them this speech :
“ I have n’t been able to get a clear idea of what our company ’s business strategy is , so I ’ve put together my own assumptions .
Here they are ( show them the key points of your version of the business strategy ) , and here ’s what I think IT should do to support this business strategy . ”
What you ’ll find is that most business executives who are hesitant to reveal what they consider “ privileged ” information are much more likely to correct your own assumptions .
So through their corrections you ’ll end up getting the business strategy information you need .
Conclusion
If you ’ve been watching any of the political debates lately , you know that although most debates start with a question , a good politician knows how to use the question as a springboard to answer another question that better suits his or her agenda .
When you ’re confronted with one of these crazy statements , treat it the same way .
Use it as a starting point , and then ask clarifying questions to get at what the speaker really means .
This is an obvious approach for many people , and yet it ’s not obvious to most IT people ( see my July , 2006 newsletter article “ 5 Reasons Why IT People Love Lists ” for a little bit about why IT people think that every question needs to be answered ) .
When confronted with a crazy statement , you need to “ uncrazy ” it before it can become useful .
US air strikes have been blamed for many civilian deaths Afghan President Hamid Karzai has said about 40 people were killed in a US air strike in southern Kandahar province .
Many more were wounded when a wedding party was hit .
US officials confirmed civilian deaths and are investigating .
" We cannot win the fight against terrorism with air strikes , " Mr Karzai said in comments directed at US President - elect Barack Obama .
Mr Karzai has repeatedly criticised the high level of civilian casualties in such bombings .
The latest civilian deaths underline the challenges facing the US president - elect and future commander - in - chief .
Demand
The incident happened late on Monday evening in Shah Wali Kot district , a remote part of Kandahar province .
International forces had been involved in an operation against the Taleban - an air strike was called in but the missile struck a wedding party by mistake , killing as many as 40 people , women and children among them .
" My wounded son was in my arms , right here , bleeding , " the father of the bride , Roozbeen Khan , told AFP news agency .
" He died last night .
" I lost two sons , two grandsons , a nephew , my mother and a cousin . "
Villagers said a wedding lunch had just ended when someone , perhaps a Taleban fighter , fired at international troops on a nearby hill , AFP reported .
The soldiers returned fire and called in air support .
A spokesman for US forces confirmed there had been civilian casualties and expressed sorrow for what had happened .
An investigation is under way into what went wrong .
In a statement , Mr Karzai demanded an end to civilian casualties .
" My first demand from the US president , when he takes office , would be to end civilian casualties in Afghanistan and take the war to places where there are terrorist nests and training centres , " he told reporters .
The BBC's Ian Pannell in Kabul says there may be little sympathy for the Taleban in many parts of Afghanistan , but there is even less sympathy for coalition forces when incidents like this leave innocent Afghans dead .
It is likely to loom large in the new relationship between Presidents Karzai and Obama when the new US administration is sworn in , our correspondent says .
Deaths Correspondents say that civilian casualties are hugely damaging to foreign forces trying to wage a " hearts and minds " campaign in Afghanistan .
The issue of civilian casualties is hugely controversial Last month the US military said that air strikes on 22 August killed 33 Afghan civilians , many more than previously acknowledged .
And in another notorious incident , an Afghan parliamentary investigation in July found that a US air strike in the same month killed 47 civilians in the eastern province of Nangarhar .
Regional officials said those casualties were also attending a wedding party and that the bride had been killed .
Figures released in September by the United Nations said there had been a sharp increase in the number of civilian casualties - some caused by the coalition but most by the Taleban - in Afghanistan in 2008 .
It said that from January to August 2008 , 1,445 civilians were killed - a rise of 39 % on the same period last year .

Whenever I play a game , I look for design lessons that I can learn and apply to my own games .
Recently , I decided to show these lessons in the form of a video tour of games that make interesting design decisions .
The first one is about World of Goo by 2Dboy .
Please forgive the stiff narration ; I am still getting used to talking to myself :)

Just got a response from Kyle Gabler from 2Dboy !
" Wow thanks David !
I laughed out loud at some of the very small , and embarrassingly correct , details you managed to pick up on .
I remember the day we got the balls stretching and squishing along the velocity vector - an entirely cosmetic feature - but it instantly made the game more fun and tactile .
Also , you noticed we used blurred foreground and background textures as a sneaky way to have higher image compression ratios .
That 's completely right , which is funny , since that was a case of a technical limitation that actually caused the game to look better with more depth .
Very perceptive , thumbs up ! "

The Moon has a fascinating and colored place in human history .
The Earth ’s only natural satellite , and the fifth largest natural satellite in our solar system is also the only celestial body to which humans have traveled and landed on , with the United States Apollo program being the only one to achieve manned missions to date ( a total of six landings between 1969 and 1972 ) .
Let ’s take a brief journey through some of the more interesting aspects of our moon .
Phases of the Moon
Understanding the phases of the moon can seem complex and confusing at first .
However , if you pay attention to the diagram above , you ’ll find that the whole process is quite easy to make sense of .
At the very right we have sunlight coming from the sun , followed by the eight different phases of the moon ( based on the position of the moon relative to the earth and the sun ) , and the earth in the center of the diagram .
The phases start with the new moon when the moon is between the sun and the earth and the full moon , when the earth , the moon , and the sun are aligned with the earth in the middle , and the first quarter and third quarter phases ( also called half moon phases ) occurring in between .
Finally the in between waxing and waning phases describe how much of the moon is illuminated and if it is increasing or decreasing in illumination – waxing refers to increasing , waning refers to decreasing , crescent means the moon is less than half illuminated , and gibbous means it ’s more than half illuminated .
Lunar Eclipses
Eclipses occur when the earth , the moon , and the sun are in a straight line .
When the earth is in the middle ( at full moon ) , we have a lunar eclipse because the sun , which is behind the earth , causes the moon , which is in front of the earth , to temporarily exist in the earth ’s shadow and therefore be partially obscured .
The most recent lunar eclipse , on February 20 , 2008 was a total eclipse .
The Two Sides of the Moon
Because one side of the moon always faces towards the earth and the other always faces away ( they never switch places ) , we refer two them as the two sides of the moon .
The side that faces the earth is called the near side , and the side that faces away , often inaccurately called the dark side ( in actuality both sides are illuminated the same amount time , once every lunar day ) , is known as the far side of the moon .
As you can see in the photographs above ( the first image is the near side , and the third image is the far side , while the other two are 90 - degree angle shots ) , the two sides are visually distinguished from each other in that the near side is full of dark lunar plains while none exist on the far side .
The Moon ’s Relationship with the Earth
Our moon is n’t just a pretty rock in the sky or the backdrop to many a couple ’s romantic night out , it has a profound relationship with and impact on our planet .
The moon makes a complete orbit around earth approximately every four weeks , and its gravitational pull is responsible for the tidal effects on earth .
Not only that , but the cellestial body is responsible for spurring human imagination as it has provided the basis for countless works of literature , art , music , and as representative of the power of human endeavour .
The Moon from Around the World
The moon has proven to be an incredible subject for photographers all over the world .
The fact that it does n’t look the same from any two different places , or on any two different days ( partly due to it ’s course and partly due to weather conditions and city lights ) , gives it the versatility that many dream of having in a subject .
Pictured : As George Bush starts looking for a new job , may we suggest children 's entertainer ?
With a smile and wink , the outgoing President of the United States turns his amusing , friendly charm to a new audience .
These are n't the fierce stares of a combative congress or the confused faces of foreign dignitaries , but children invited to a special Christmas play at the White House .
However it was n't clear who was more excited to meet the other - the children trying to concentrate on the play or the President more interested in making friends with the audience .
High five little man : Bush bonds with young guests during the Children 's Holiday Reception and Performance at the White House on Monday
Hello again :
The outgoing President distracts a few of the children during the Christmas play , held for children whose parents are serving in the United States military and can not be with them for the holiday
Yes it 's me : Bush catches another youngster 's eye during the play
The special White House visit was organised for children whose parents will be away for Christmas as their parents are serving in the U.S. military .
They were treated to an inside look of the Presidential home and enjoyed a Christmas - themed play , as as well as a sing - a- long organised by ministers of the Sweet Heaven Kings of the United House of Prayer For All People .
But it was the winking President who gained the attention of the crowd , bringing out the enjoyable clownish persona which has kept the world amused even during the most serious situations .

Seen this wink before ?
Bush sends his charm to the Queen , although she was Not Amused
This will be Bush 's last Christmas in the White House after serving two terms as President .
Democrat Barack Obama will take over the household early next year following his election success in November .
Bush will move into a $ 2 million bungalow in Texas .

Linux , netbooks threaten Microsoft 's fat profits Nov. 07 , 2008
Microsoft 's bottom line is hurting from Linux gains in netbooks , says a Bloomberg.com story .
A recent drop in Windows revenues is due in part to the fact that leading netbook vendors Acer and Asus run Linux on about 30 percent of their netbooks , says the story .
( Click for larger view of Acer's Aspire One )
Last quarter 's Windows sales fell short of forecasts , says the story , and Microsoft has curtailed growth projections for the year from over nine percent to as little as two percent , citing lower revenue from netbooks .
The story quotes Microsoft as estimating that Windows products run on about 70 percent of netbooks , a category that is never defined , but which typically reflects an under - $ 600 mini-notebook with displays ranging from seven to 11 inches .
The story quotes Acer and Asus executives , meanwhile , as saying that Linux runs on about a third of their netbooks .
This is significant , considering that the story estimates that the two companies together control some 90 percent of the netbook market .
Asus is credited with touching off the netbook explosion with its Eee PC ( pictured below , right ) , which originally shipped as a Linux - only system for $ 400 in Nov. 2007 .
Although the original Asus Eee PC shipped with an Intel Celeron , the new versions of the Asus and Acer netbooks , as well as the vast majority of netbooks , ship with Intel Atom processors , and offer a choice of Linux or Windows XP .
Asus Eee PC
( Click for details )
The Bloomberg.com story did not quote an exact figure for the Linux share of the booming netbook market , but given the Microsoft , Acer , and Asus estimates , it appears likely to be over a quarter of the market .
If accurate , that figure dwarfs Linux 's share of the higher - end PC system market , reported by research firm Net Applications last month at 0.71 percent , up from 0.47 percent in Aug. 2007 .
The story quotes Dickie Chang , an IDC analyst based in Taipei as saying , " [ The netbook market ] is a real threat to Microsoft .
It gives users a chance to see and try something new , showing them there is an alternative . "
New life for XP
Just as troubling for Microsoft , says the story , the vast majority of Windows netbooks run Windows XP , which offers lower margins than does Vista .
Yet , if Microsoft had not extended XP 's availability beyond its planned discontinuation in June , the company may well have surrendered considerably more of the market to Linux .
Microsoft 's Vista has appeared on relatively few netbook models , and is widely considered to be too resource - intensive for systems that must meet low netbook price expectations .
Microsoft claims , however , that its upcoming Vista successor , Windows 7 , will run much better on netbooks .

Linux distro

The story also cites a Citigroup study as saying that netbooks will represent " about a third " of PC growth in 2008 , and will grow at an annual rate of 60 percent through 2010 , when Citigroup expects 29 million netbooks to sell .
Despite the arrival of dual - platform netbooks from heavy hitters like Dell and HP , which recently introduced a Mini 1000 netbook ( pictured ) that runs a homegrown Linux distribution called " Mobile Internet Experience " ( MIE ) , early market entrants Asus and Acer still represent some 90 percent of the netbook market , says the story .
By most accounts , Asus has dominated the market .
Yet , according to the Bloomberg.com story , Acer President Gianfranco Lanci recently claimed that Acer 's $ 380 Aspire
One was the world 's best - selling netbook in the third quarter .
The story quotes an Asus exec as saying that Linux has shipped in 30 to 40 percent of its Eee PCs , and that it expects Linux models to sustain a 30 percent rate going forward .
Asus expects to sell 5 million Eee PCs in 2008 , says the story , whereas Acer is said to predict sales of 5 million to 6 million Aspire One units , with about 20 percent offering Linux .

QUOTE ( Debbie Johnson @ Nov 6 2008 , 09:16 AM )
What is the difference between Fixed Rate and Variable Rates ?
Fixed Rates :
When you allow your funds to have a fixed daily return , you will receive your daily income based at the fixed rate , everyday for the duration of the investment .
Say you made it fixed at 2 % daily , then for the duration of your investment , your daily income for that particular investment will be at 2 %
Variable Rates :
When you allow your funds to have a varied daily return , you will receive your daily income based at varying rates , everyday for the duration of the investment .
Say you made it varied at between 1 % and 3.5 % daily , then for the duration of your investment , your daily income for that particular investment will be between 1 % and 3.5 % .
This means that one day you might receive 1.5 % and another day receive 3.2 % .
You will not receive less than 1 % and you will not receive higher than 3.5 %
Hope this will help ?

So they manage forex trading and make profit for us ?
Is there any proof that they actually invested our money into forex market ?
I will post their faqs here .
What is the Forex market ?
With 4xFunds .
Com you do not need to know the meaning of this as the management of 4xFunds .
Com handles everything .
But if you must know :
The online trading environment for foreign exchange encompasses the largest , most dynamic capital market in the world with more than USD 1.5 trillion traded daily .
The Forex market is a continuous , 24/5 marketplace open from Sunday afternoon ( 4 PM EDT ) through the close of the US markets on Friday ( 5 PM EDT ) .
The Forex market is where investors can trade one currency against another currency .
What is a currency cross ?
With 4xFunds .
Com you do not need to know the meaning of this as the management of 4xFunds .
Com handles everything .
But if you must know :
Currencies are always priced in pairs .
All trades take place between two different currencies resulting in the concurrent purchase of one currency and sale of another .
For example , when you trade EURUSD , the currency cross is Euros versus US dollars .
One currency will be bought ( long position ) while the other currency is sold ( short position ) .
What is the Bid-Ask Spread ?
With 4xFunds .
Com you do not need to know the meaning of this as the management of 4xFunds .
Com handles everything .
But if you must know :
The bid-ask spread is the buying and selling spread between two currencies .
The bid price is the price at which the currency is sold .
The ask price is the price at which the currency is bought .
The difference between the bid price and the ask price is known as the bid-ask spread .
The bid-ask spread differs between currency crosses with more common crosses ( majors ) having tighter spreads .
What is a PIP ?
With 4xFunds .
Com you do not need to know the meaning of this as the management of 4xFunds .
Com handles everything .
But if you must know :
Currencies are quoted using 5 significant digits .
The last digit , called a " pip " , represents the smallest potential move in an exchange rate , and is very similar to ticks or points in other financial products .
In the example below , a 10 pip increase in the Ask price would result in a quote of 1.2287 .
Likewise , a 10 pip decrease in the Ask price would result in a quote of 1.2267 .
Half - pips are a more recent development offering traders even tighter spreads and more competitive and transparent accuracy in pricing .
When trading foreign exchange , the value of a pip is dependent on two variables � the amount of currency and the currency pair .
USD Value of a Pip
Below , we have calculated the US Dollar value of a 1 pip movement for some of the more frequently traded currency pairs .
All values are calculated using 100,000 units of the base currency ( the left - hand currency in the pair ) .
EURUSD USD 10.00
USDCHF USD 8.00
USDJPY USD 9.06
GBPUSD USD 10.00
USDCAD USD 7.92
AUDUSD USD 10.00
EURCHF USD 8.00
EURJPY USD 9.06
EURGBP USD 17.98
Types of FX Trade
A spot FX trade is an immediate execution of one currency against another at an agreed rate , settlement of which traditionally takes place two business days later .
offers spot trading on streaming real - time prices for over 150 different currency crosses , with deep liquidity on the most liquid currency pairs .
What is a Forward Outright ?
With 4xFunds .
Com you do not need to know the meaning of this as the management of 4xFunds .
Com handles everything .
But if you must know :
A Forward Outright is a trade that will commence at an agreed upon date ( in the future ) .
There is no centralized exchange for Forwards and forward trading is often customized to meet the needs of the buyer and seller .
Forward Outrights are expressed as a price above ( premium ) or below ( discount ) the spot rate .
The forward FX price is the sum of the spot price and the margin .
This price is a reflection of the FX rate at the forward date where if the trade were executed at that rate there would be no profit or loss .
What is Trading on Margin ?
With 4xFunds .
Com you do not need to know the meaning of this as the management of 4xFunds .
Com handles everything .
But if you must know :
Trading on margin means that an investor can buy and sell assets that represent more value than the capital in their account .
Forex trading is typically executed on margin , and the industry practice is to trade on relatively small margin amounts since currency exchange rate fluctuations tend to be less than one or two percent on any given day .
Margin , or leverage , implies that the investor is " gearing " his or her funds .
Margin rates of 1 % on the first USD 25,000 in your account , and 2 % on assets greater than that , are common in online trading .
What this means is that a margin of 1.0 % enables one to trade up to USD 1,000,000 even though there is USD 10,000 in the account .
In terms of leverage this corresponds to 100:1 , because 100 times USD 10,000 is USD 1,000,000 , or put another way , USD 10,000 is 1.0 % of USD 1,000,000 .
Margin is a powerful accelerator
Using leverage opens the possibility to generate profits quickly , but increases the risk of rapidly incurring large losses .
It is important to review the margin thresholds and limitations in your trading agreement to determine the range of trading activities you can undertake .

What is One Cancels Other ( OCO ) ?
With 4xFunds .
Com you do not need to know the meaning of this as the management of 4xFunds .
Com handles everything .
But if you must know :
This most common linked order , OCO , stipulates that if one part of the order is executed , then the other part is automatically canceled .
In FX trading , OCO often refers to a buy order and sell order linked together so that when one of the orders is executed , the other is canceled .
Consider the OCO as follows : the trader protects an existing position from loss ( stop order ) and ensures that profits are taken ( limit order ) .
What is If Done ( ID ) ?
With 4xFunds .
Com you do not need to know the meaning of this as the management of 4xFunds .
Com handles everything .
But if you must know :

As the market rises ( for long positions ) the stop price rises according to the proportion set by the user , but if the market price falls , the stop price remains unchanged .
This type of stop order helps an investor to set a limit on the maximum possible loss without limiting the possible gain on a position .
It also reduces the need to constantly monitor the market prices of open positions .

Com you do not need to know the meaning of this as the management of 4xFunds .
Com handles everything .
But if you must know :
Tom - Next
Spot Forex positions are traded with a standard Value Date of 2 business days � the theoretical delivery date for the currency exchange if we were going to take delivery of a currency .
For example , positions opened on Monday would have a Value Date of Wednesday .
As we are speculating on Forex and not actually taking delivery ( settlement ) , positions are never allowed to reach their Value Date and are ' Rolled Over ' to a new Value Date instead .
So if the position we opened on Monday is still open on Tuesday , it will be closed then reopened again immediately at almost the same market price with the new Value Date of
Thursday .
Sample of Tom - Next Rollover Report :
Tom - Next Rollover Report
Financing Charge / Credit
When a position is rolled over to a new Value Date any profit or loss associated with that position is also rolled over to the new position but a small component of interest on the profit or loss is added or deducted from the opening price of the new position .
Swap Price
To summarize , Spot Forex positions held past the end of a trading day ( 4 PM CST ) are rolled over to a new Value Date .
At rollover , the position is closed and reopened with a small difference between the closing and the reopening price .
This small difference is called the swap price and includes :
* The Rollover charges principally account for the interest rate differential between the two currencies traded
* The Financing credit / charge from any profit / loss on the position

When you allow your funds to have a varied daily return , you will receive your daily income based at varying rates , everyday for the duration of the investment .

Com handles everything .
But if you must know : Currencies are always priced in pairs .
All trades take place between two different currencies resulting in the concurrent purchase of one currency and sale of another .

What is the Bid-Ask Spread ?
With 4xFunds .
Com you do not need to know the meaning of this as the management of 4xFunds .
Com handles everything .
But if you must know :
The bid-ask spread is the buying and selling spread between two currencies .
The bid price is the price at which the currency is sold .
The ask price is the price at which the currency is bought .
The difference between the bid price and the ask price is known as the bid-ask spread .
The bid-ask spread differs between currency crosses with more common crosses ( majors ) having tighter spreads .
What is a PIP ?
With 4xFunds .
Com you do not need to know the meaning of this as the management of 4xFunds .
Com handles everything .
But if you must know : Currencies are quoted using 5 significant digits .
The last digit , called a " pip " , represents the smallest potential move in an exchange rate , and is very similar to ticks or points in other financial products .
In the example below , a 10 pip increase in the Ask price would result in a quote of 1.2287 .
Likewise , a 10 pip decrease in the Ask price would result in a quote of 1.2267 .
Half - pips are a more recent development offering traders even tighter spreads and more competitive and transparent accuracy in pricing .
When trading foreign exchange , the value of a pip is dependent on two variables � the amount of currency and the currency pair .
USD Value of a PipBelow , we have calculated the US Dollar value of a 1 pip movement for some of the more frequently traded currency pairs .
All values are calculated using 100,000 units of the base currency ( the left - hand currency in the pair ) .

Com you do not need to know the meaning of this as the management of 4xFunds .
Com handles everything .
But if you must know : A Forward Outright is a trade that will commence at an agreed upon date ( in the future ) .
There is no centralized exchange for Forwards and forward trading is often customized to meet the needs of the buyer and seller .
Forward Outrights are expressed as a price above ( premium ) or below ( discount ) the spot rate .
The forward FX price is the sum of the spot price and the margin .
This price is a reflection of the FX rate at the forward date where if the trade were executed at that rate there would be no profit or loss .
What is Trading on Margin ?
With 4xFunds .
Com you do not need to know the meaning of this as the management of 4xFunds .
Com handles everything .
But if you must know : Trading on margin means that an investor can buy and sell assets that represent more value than the capital in their account .
Forex trading is typically executed on margin , and the industry practice is to trade on relatively small margin amounts since currency exchange rate fluctuations tend to be less than one or two percent on any given day .
Margin , or leverage , implies that the investor is " gearing " his or her funds .
Margin rates of 1 % on the first USD 25,000 in your account , and 2 % on assets greater than that , are common in online trading .
What this means is that a margin of 1.0 % enables one to trade up to USD 1,000,000 even though there is USD 10,000 in the account .
In terms of leverage this corresponds to 100:1 , because 100 times USD 10,000 is USD 1,000,000 , or put another way , USD 10,000 is 1.0 % of USD 1,000,000 .

Freshfuel and the Dieline point to some new logos from big players .
Cluelessness on the half shell .
Smart marketers understand that a new logo can’t possibly increase your market share , and they know that an expensive logo does n’t defeat a cheap logo .
They realize that the logo is like a first name , it ’s an identifier .
So , when Pepsi and BestBuy start ‘ testing ’ logos , and proclaiming that a new logo might change their market share , I get nervous .
You ca n’t test a logo any more than you can test a first name .
Sure , you can eliminate Myxlplyx as an outlier , but given the success of the Starbucks mermaid and the Dunkin Donuts typeface ( two outliers ) you can see that this testing is sort of meaningless .
I guess the punchline is : take the time and money and effort you ’d put into an expensive logo and put them into creating a product and experience and story that people remember instead .

This is one smart kitty cat .
On a scale of 1 - 10 , this cat rates an eleven .
I personally have never seen a cat that could do what this kitty does .
Naturally , the cat uses its highly advanced intellect for illicit purposes -- like stealing peanuts .
Have you ever seen a cat unscrew the cap off of a bottle ?
I have n't .
Incredible little kitty .
Hopefully , someone can train this kitty to use its intellect for good rather than evil .
Think of the possibilities -- like a nomination for Vice President in 2012 .
The sky is the limit .

I ’ve been thinking a lot lately about Tom Brokaw ’s book “ The Greatest Generation , ” that classic about our parents and their incredible sacrifices during World War II .
What I ’ve been thinking about actually is this :
What book will our kids write about us ?
“ The Greediest Generation ? ” “ The Complacent Generation ? ”
Or maybe : “ The Subprime Generation : How My Parents Bailed Themselves Out for Their Excesses by Charging It All on My Visa Card . ”
Our kids should be so much more radical than they are today .
I understand why they are n’t .
They ’re so worried about just getting a job or paying next semester ’s tuition .
But we must not take their quietism as license to do whatever we want with this bailout cash .
They are going to have to pay this money back .
And therefore , we have an incredibly weighty obligation to make sure that we not only spend every stimulus dollar wisely but also with an eye to creating new technologies .
We not only need to bail out industries of the past but to build up industries of the future  to offer the kind of big thinking and risk - taking that transforms enormous challenges into world - changing opportunities .
That is what made the Greatest Generation great .
This money ca n’t just go to patch up our jalopies .
“ Remember , this money will not be neutral , ” said Andy Karsner , a former U.S. assistant secretary of energy .
“ We are talking about directing an unprecedented volume of cash at our housing , energy , transportation and infrastructure industries .
This cash will either fortify the incumbent players and calcify the energy status quo , or it will facilitate the economic transformation we seek .
The stimulus will either be white blood cells that will heal us or malignant cells that will continue to sap our strength . ”
Researchers Develop Cost - Effective , Flexible OLED Displays
December 8th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Organic Light Emitting Diodes ( OLEDs ) — high - quality , energy - efficient displays — are already used in some flat screen TVs .
But they ’re about to become common in everything from electronic paper to adaptive clothing thanks to researchers at the VTT Technical Centre in Finland .
The ROLLED project has found a way to print OLEDs on flexible protective films .
The films use a technique called roll - to - roll processing that allows OLEDs to be printed in a fast , cost - effective manner .
In comparison , current OLEDs are produced in a glass substrate .
Since the devices require minimal energy , they can be powered by solar cells , small watch batteries , and even radio waves .
Once the ROLLED research makes OLEDS affordable , they may be embedded in clothing , used in “ smart ” product packaging , used as paper billboard replacements , and more .

Citigroup said the blast - off was likely to occur within two years , and possibly as soon as 2009 .
Gold was trading yesterday at $ 812 an ounce .
It is well off its all - time peak of $ 1,030 in February but has held up much better than other commodities over the last few months – reverting to is historical role as a safe - haven store of value and a de facto currency .
MIAMI  Public defenders ’ offices in at least seven states are refusing to take on new cases or have sued to limit them , citing overwhelming workloads that they say undermine the constitutional right to counsel for the poor .
Public defenders are notoriously overworked , and their turnover is high and their pay low .
But now , in the most open revolt by public defenders in memory , many of the government - appointed lawyers say that state budget cuts and rising caseloads have pushed them to the breaking point .
In September , a Florida judge ruled that the public defenders ’ office in Miami - Dade County could refuse to represent many of those arrested on lesser felony charges so its lawyers could provide a better defense for other clients .
Over the last three years , the average number of felony cases handled by each lawyer in a year has climbed to close to 500 , from 367 , officials said , and caseloads for lawyers assigned to misdemeanor cases have risen to 2,225 , from 1,380 .
“ Right now a lot of public defenders are starting to stand up and say , ‘ No more :
We ca n’t ethically handle this many cases , ’ ” said David J. Carroll , director of research for the National Legal Aid and Defender Association .
Mumbai Terrorists Used Google Earth , Boats , Food
The Mumbai terrorists used Google Earth to help plan their attacks .
This is bothering some people :
Google Earth has previously come in for criticism in India , including from the country ’s former president , A.P.J. Abdul Kalam .
Kalam warned in a 2005 lecture that the easy availability online of detailed maps of countries from services such as Google Earth could be misused by terrorists .
Of course the terrorists used Google Earth .
They also used boats , and ate at restaurants .
Do n’t even get me started about the fact that they breathed air and drank water .
A Google spokeswoman said in an e-mail today that Google Earth ’s imagery is available through commercial and public sources .
Google Earth has also been used by aid agencies for relief operations , which outweighs abusive uses , she said .
That ’s true for all aspects of human infrastructure .
Yes , the bad guys use it : bank robbers use cars to get away , drug smugglers use radios to communicate , child pornographers use e-mail .
But the good guys use it , too , and the good uses far outweigh the bad uses .

Season Wrap Up
The Cardinals won as many games in 2008 as they did when they won the World Series just two seasons earlier , but they found themselves outside of the playoff picture when the season ended .
With an 86 - 76 record , the Cards once again had a very solid season with Tony La Russa at the helm .
Having the MVP in Albert Pujols certainly did n’t hurt , but the lack of pitching did n’t help either .
Offense was not the team ’s problem in ’08 as they posted the second best OPS in the league at .783 and scored the fourth most runs in the league with 779 .
Pitching is where the team experienced some trouble as they really did n’t have any big names to turn to when they really needed a win .
While the pitching was n’t putrid , it was just bad enough to keep them from making the post season as their 4.19 team ERA ( which ranked seventh in the NL ) and their 725 runs allowed ( ranking tenth in the league ) .
Second year general manager John Mozeliak will try to remedy this problem in the off season .
Holes to Fill
As spoken about above , the Cardinals need to address the issue of pitching if they want to be playing deep into October next season .
With five pitchers from last season currently in free agency , the Cards will have to fill those holes as well as the ones that were already created during the season .
Former ace Chris Carpenter will have to come back to form next season after having surgery on his elbow for the Cards to have a valid number one starter .
Even though the rotation is not the only place that help is needed , it would be a good start .
The Cards basically started the off season by giving Kyle Lohse a four - year extension worth $ 41 million .
Lohse should provide some stability to their pitching staff , but he by no means fixes the problem .
In addition to the rotation , the Cards will also need to look to some holes in the bullpen .
With the offense the team has , they cannot afford to give away leads late in games as they did last season and expect to be able to win the game .
At least they have a few decent right handers in the pen , which means they can concentrate on wooing a few left handers to create better match - ups during late game situations .
Other than pitching , their everyday line - up is pretty steady from top to bottom .
They may need to add a role player or two , but if players like Rick Ankiel and Troy Glaus continue to produce , the team ’s offense should stay strong .
Free Agents
Going into the off season , the Cardinals had nine players who filed for free agency including pitchers Ron Villone , Russ Springer , Mark Mulder , Jason Isringhausen and Braden Looper , infielders Felipe Lopez and Cesar Izturis , outfielder Jaun Encarnacion and catcher Jason LaRue .
The team already came to terms with LaRue on a one year contract more than a month ago .
There are considerable questions about what other players the Cards are going to bring back .
Lopez seems to be a lock to be handed a contract that will probably coerce him to end up back in St. Louis , which is good for an aging team .
Looper is probably gone as Mozeliak is probably not going to be willing to hand him the value or length in a contract that it is believed Looper and his agent are seeking .
There are many questions surrounding Isringhausen as he is coming off of surgery , and while the team does need help in the pen , he may be too much of a risk to take when they could delegate their funds some other place .
The Outlook
With a solid lineup already in tact , the baseball world probably would n’t be surprised if the Cardinals compete strongly for the playoffs again .
While the Cubs certainly seem like the best team in the division , there ’s no reason to believe that the Cards ca n’t vie for the second spot , which could very well be the wild card winner .
Even though they finished ten games above five hundred last season , they still placed fourth in their division .
Their payroll ( which was ranked 11th in the majors at $ 99.6 million in 2008 ) could see some growth this off season , but probably not much with the prices in the open market not being as large as they have been in the past .
It is unclear whether the Cards are pursuing any trades this off season .
They do not have any major contracts that would be movable for people to fill up cap space at the end of next season just yet , but they could consider moving one of their outfielders if the right deal is made .
St. Louis ’ farm system does have a good number of players who are just about ready to reach the big leagues at various positions .
They have about four players who could be ready to play in the outfield in the Bigs at the end of spring training ( which is the reason Ankiel or even Ryan Ludwick could be expendable at the right price ) .
Their farm system also boasts a good number of pitchers who seem primed for big league success , meaning the Cards may be able to fill some of their pitching holes internally if they are just willing to wait long enough .
With La Russa at the helm once again in 2009 , even the average baseball fans know that his innovation alone adds some extra strength to their team , and a second season without a playoff appearance may be deemed very disappointing to those in St. Louis .
Off Season Moves So Far
The St. Louis Cardinals have traded for former Padres SS Khalil Greene for two minor league players , one is pitcher Mark Worrell and a player to be named later .
That ’s not much for a major league SS with pop in his bat .
I ’m surprised that the Padres could n’t get more for him than that .

Our sources tell us that Mark Foley wound up backing out of the " Today " show interview late yesterday and flying back to Florida upon learning that Matt Lauer would not be doing the interview .
( Lauer was n't going to make it back from Alaska where he interviewed Sarah Palin in time , we 're told . )
And , it seems Foley 's former staffers know him well .
One told us yesterday : " I would be shocked if it 's not Matt Lauer — not because there 's anything wrong with Meredith [ Vieira ] , but this is a dream fulfilled .
Matt Lauer on ' Today . ' . "
Ah , this is n't the last we 've heard on Foley on " Today . "
It 's his dream , right ?
Matt Lauer , are you listening ?
Still , the AP , though no Matt Lauer ( or TV ) , caught up with Foley and got its interview .
In part :
And while he concedes his behavior was " extraordinarily stupid , " he remains somewhat unwilling to accept full public scorn .
These were 17 - year - olds , just months from being men , he insists .
" There was never anywhere in those conversations where someone said , ' Stop , ' or ' I 'm not enjoying this , ' or ' This is inappropriate ' ... but again , I 'm the adult here , I'm the congressman , " Foley said .
" The fact is I allowed it to happen .
That 's where my responsibility lies . "
And :
A Republican won back Foley 's congressional district last week after the Democrat who replaced him was caught in an adultery scandal .
It 's become known as " The Curse of the Mark Foley Seat . "
" It 's not what I had hoped would be my lasting legacy , " he said , pausing to brush away tears .
So what does the man who once was such a popular figure in politics and high - society do now ?
" I do n't know .
I do n't know , " he said .
" I 'm just going to take it a day at a time . "

Frankie the feline exposed as the cat burglar stealing toys from his neighbours ' homes
A real - life cat burglar has left his owner feeling less than purr - fect - by swiping dozens of cuddly toys from nearby homes .
Frankie the tom cat has got his claws into 35 teddies and soft toys in the last year .
Owner Julie Bishop believes the two - year - old feline is sneaking into her neighbours ' homes .
He drags each one of his finds through the catflap before depositing them on the same spot in the living room .
All mine : Frankie the cat with his collection of stolen toys
Julie , 52 , said : ' Frankie looks very pleased with himself when he comes in with these presents .
' He 's been going out of the house and coming back with all these toys for pretty much as long as he 's been allowed out .
' They 're all soft toys for cats I think .
About 15 of them are all the same leopard .
He does n't really play with them .
He dumps them down and goes out looking for something else . '
In the past year alone Frankie 's haul has included teddy bears , leopards and a giant squeaky beefburger .
Now Julie has plastered her home town of Swindon with posters to try and trace the rightful owners .
Look what I 've found : Frankie has returned home with 15 toy leopards in the last year
In you go :
The devious feline deposits his latest find inside the front door of Mrs Bishop 's home
Julie , who lives with her partner Gary Witts , 47 , got Frankie from a Wiltshire farm in 2006 .
She said : ' I 'd be interested to find out what 's happening when he goes out .
' Frankie is quite independent and comes in and out of the cat flap all through the day and night .
' He 's quite a friendly cat and likes to sleep on your shoulder , although he lets you know if he wants to be on his own . '
Two weeks ago Frankie stole two green witch 's heads , which must have come from a recent Halloween party .
He has also swiped a range of old socks , nappy sacks , half - eaten beefburgers and chips - as well as the traditional dead mice and birds .
What a steal : Frankie shows off his haul of soft toys
Downtown BogotÃ¡ may proclaim itself a modern city with skyscrapers and a financial centre , but the world of international commerce seems far away as we pass old men selling cigarettes from trays and cramped shops with their stock spilling out on to the pavement .
In minutes we move from the morning havoc of the backstreets into Teusaquillo , where the roads are slightly wider and the craters fewer .
The well - to - do used to live here , but they moved on long ago , leaving it to human rights lawyers , civic groups and non-government organisations .
We stop at a house with a low brick wall .
The graffiti that used to read " Death to trade unionists ! " has been painted over .
Now there is nothing to announce that this ordinary house is home to Sinaltrainal ( Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Industria de Alimentos - the National Union of Food Industry Workers ) .
This is the biggest trade union in the " Coca - Cola system " in Colombia , representing more than half the organised Coke workers - although , after more than a decade of attacks and intimidations , the membership is nothing like as big as it once was .
Current membership in plants where Coca - Cola is bottled is only 350 .
This building is where we meet two men , Giraldo and Manco .
They arrive on different days and give their testimonies separately , but they tell the same story .
Campaign posters in the room where we talk demand boycotts and justice ; the images are of handguns painted in the company colours of red and white .
The names and pictures of dead trade unionists are everywhere .
Giraldo and Manco knew these men , they were friends and relatives .
Now they speak of how they died .
Oscar Alberto Giraldo Arango is 42 , but he carries a few more years on his shoulders .
Colombia is the most dangerous place in the world for trade unionists - since 1986 , 2,500 of them have been killed .
" To be a trade unionist in Colombia is to walk with a gravestone on your back , " the two men told me the first time we met - and they looked as weary as if they had physically borne their stone .
Giraldo was raised in Carepa , UrabÃ¡ , in the north - west of the Colombian countryside near the Panama border .
He started work bottling Coca - Cola in 1984 , at the Bebidas y Alimentos de UrabÃ¡ ( Drinks & Foods of UrabÃ¡ ) bottling plant .
When he told his friends , they congratulated him on landing such a good job .
And it was , too .
The union had done well for the men , securing bonuses , overtime and health benefits .
But this was not to last .
Graffiti announced the paramilitaries ' arrival in Carepa in 1994 : " We are here ! "
Shortly after the graffiti appeared , so did the bodies .
The first Coca - Cola worker and trade unionist in Carepa to be assassinated was JosÃ© Eleazar Manco , in April 1994 .
The second was killed days later on April 20 .
He was Giraldo 's brother , Enrique .
In the mornings , Enrique travelled to work on the back of a friend 's motorbike .
Three men emerged from the side of the road and aimed guns at the bike , forcing it to stop .
Enrique was dragged off into the bushes .
When Giraldo got to work , everyone was talking about the kidnapping ; soon , anxious speculation turned to mourning .
Another man arriving had seen Enrique 's body dumped at the side of the road .
The Colombian paramilitary groups were spawned in the conflict between the state and revolutionary guerrillas .
In 1982 , officers under General LandazÃ¡bal , the defence minister , worked with multinationals and cattle ranchers to organise and fund " defence groups " .
Ostensibly they were to fight leftwing insurgent groups , but increasingly the paras , as they are known , became entwined with the drug cartels and the army .
They formed death squads , attacking and killing anyone considered to support the leftwing guerrillas - basically anyone working in human rights or trade unions .
It is a common refrain among the establishment and security forces that the guerrillas and trade unionists are one and the same .
Carlos CastaÃ±o , leader of the paras , claimed that 70 % of his organisation 's funding came from the cocaine industry .
But he was also an ardent supporter of neoliberal economic policies and of multinational investment in Colombia - so why should n't national and international companies support them ?
In a newspaper interview , CastaÃ±o maintained there was always a reason for the paras ' attacks .
" Trade unionists , for example .
They stop the people from working .
That 's why we kill them . "
The International Trade Union Confederation ( ITUC ) puts the conviction rate of trade union murderers at 1 % .
Certainly President Alvaro Uribe has shown little inclination to rectify this situation .
" There are no assassinations of workers in Colombia , " he has stated , adding that there are " rotten apples " in the trade union movement .
Giraldo has lived with the story of his brother 's murder for 14 years .
No one has been charged with Enrique 's murder .
" There was n't very much of an investigation , " he says .
Almost a year to the day later , another Sinaltrainal leader working at the Coca - Cola plant in Carepa was killed .
His name was Enrique GÃ³mez Granado , and on April 23 1995 he was shot on his doorstep in front of his wife and children .
When the surviving union leaders were threatened and intimidated , it became blindingly obvious that there was a campaign against the union at the Coca - Cola plant .
These men were followed as they left work , cards were delivered to their homes saying , " Go now or face death ! "
The union leadership fled to BogotÃ ¡ en masse , which left the workers at the Carepa plant with no effective union .
So they began meeting in secret .
" We agreed to set up a new underground union , " Giraldo says .
The president was Luis HernÃ¡n Manco Monroy ( Manco ) , whom I was to meet in BogotÃ ¡ a few days later .
As president of the newly formed union leadership , Manco helped draw up a proposed collective agreement , and the union came out into the open .
" We informed Coca - Cola that we had new leadership , so we started having meetings with the management at the Coca - Cola plant . "
The manager at the time , they allege , knew and socialised with the paramilitaries .
On one occasion , Manco said , the manager sat drinking with the local commanders outside the plant .
" There was a meeting with Cepillo and Caliche [ the commanders ] at the kiosk - they were drinking with the plant manager , and he said that if he wanted to end the union , it would be very easy . "
Giraldo says they were not overly concerned at the time : " We did n't know how bad it would get . "
They were soon to find out .
December 6 1996 was Carepa 's darkest day .
The body of Isidro Gil lay inside the plant .
The first bullet had hit him between the eyes .
The remaining five shots were fired out of spite or bravado .
Another Coca - Cola union leader had been disposed of .
The two paras who killed him had arrived by motorbike and gone to the security hut by the main gates , where Isidro was working .
Manco was working on a machine nearby .
The manager had disappeared and was nowhere to be found .
" The production line stopped , " Manco says , " but we stayed there in the afternoon because we were too scared to leave ...
Not working , just waiting there . "
Another trade union organiser , Adolfo Luis Cardona , nicknamed El Diablo , a local footballer of some renown , had also seen Isidro killed .
While his friends and workmates waited in the plant , he went to Carepa .
The paras spotted him and called out that the local para commander Cepillo wanted to see him .
" Come , nothing will happen , " they said .
" Get in the lorry , we will drive you there . "
El Diablo made a fateful decision .
He ran .
He took off down the village street , screaming , " Van a matar a mÃ­ ! " - they are going to kill me .
He ran towards the police station , four blocks away .
Behind him , the paras gave chase , one on motorbike , the rest on foot .
They were hunting him down in broad daylight .
None of the onlookers in the street did anything .
El Diablo burst into the police station begging for protection and sanctuary .
The police all but shrugged : " What can we do ? "
But they did escort El Diablo home , waited while his family packed and then drove them to the airport .
The family went first to BogotÃ¡ and then on to the US , where El Diablo lives today .
The morning had seen the murder of Isidro Gil , the afternoon the attempted abduction of El Diablo .
That night , Sinaltrainal 's offices in Carepa were firebombed and burned to the ground .
Manco had gone into hiding , but the following day Cepillo sent out messages that he wanted to talk .
Manco agreed .
The meeting was held at an ice - cream shop in Carepa .
Two other union men arrived with Manco to find Cepillo - a chubby man , aged about 25 - at a table with a group of paras .
" Cepillo said they had killed Isidro and burned down the headquarters .
And they said the union was over , that the union was the guerrillas , " Manco says .
The paras issued their orders .
At 9 am the following morning , all Sinaltrainal members were assembled at the Coca - Cola bottling plant .
There the paras made them sign letters resigning from the union .
The letters were apparently prepared by a man who worked for the company .
The union in Carepa was smashed .
The leadership was in hiding , exiled or dead .
The members , cowed by guns , threats and intimidation , had signed away their rights .
Meanwhile , the managers of the plant introduced a pay cut - according to Sinaltrainal , the wages for experienced workers dropped from between $ 380 and $ 450 a month to $ 130 a month : Colombia 's minimum wage .
When asked about this , Coca - Cola failed to respond .
In BogotÃ¡ , Manco and Giraldo tell how they lived for six months in the union office - there was nowhere else for them to go .
Eventually , Giraldo 's family came to join him in BogotÃ ¡ and he moved out .
He has not had a full - time job since .
" I have n't been able to earn much .
I have just been doing odd jobs with three - or four - month contracts ...
Sometimes days go by where we have no food . "
Manco says it 's horrible being forced to remain in BogotÃ¡ .
" I lost my house , my family , everything . "
His family stayed in Carepa .
" Serious charges demand a serious response , " said the Coca - Cola company CEO Neville Isdell , referring to allegations of abuse by the company 's Colombian bottlers .
According to Sinaltrainal , the murders at the Carepa plant were part of a countrywide campaign against the union .
They claim seven trade unionists have been killed by paramilitaries , the bottlers have links with the paras , and the bottlers are accused of union - busting , intimidation and harassment of workers .
What was the Coca - Cola Company 's response ?
Its website displays the only public audit by the Coca - Cola Company into their bottlers in Colombia .
This was conducted in spring 2005 , more than eight years after Isidro Gil was shot dead .
Intriguingly , the audit conducted by the Cal Safety Compliance Corporation focuses on compliance issues : the report notes several health and safety breaches , including the absence of a protective guard on a syrup container at one plant , the incorrect number of fire extinguishers at two plants , and incorrect documentation for an employee at one plant .
I am happy to report that the appropriate remedial action has been taken to comply with health and safety regulations .
To this day the Coca - Cola Company itself has not investigated the alleged links of Colombian bottling plant managers with the paramilitaries .
From the outset , the company 's Atlanta headquarters denied " any connection to any human - rights violations " and distanced itself from the bottlers , saying , " The Coca - Cola Company does not own or operate any bottling plants in Colombia . "
This is the standard use of the " Coca - Cola system " , operating as an entity but claiming no legal lines of accountability to the Coca - Cola Company .
Coca -Cola does not own the bottling plants ; the bottlers operate under a franchise .
But the case here is similar to that of Gap and Nike in the 90s .
In these instances , the clothes giants had outsourced their production to factories in the developing world that operated sweatshop conditions .
It was not Nike or Gap that forced the workers to do long hours for poor pay , it was the contractors .
However , campaigners insisted the companies should have enforceable human rights standards applied throughout the supply chain , compelling the companies to take action .
The argument was then , and is now , that no matter where the human rights abuse occurred , if it 's your name on the label , then you 're responsible for sorting it out .
In the Coca - Cola Company 's case , the argument is made more compelling by the fact that although it franchised Coke production to Bebidas y Alimentos and Panamerican Beverages ( Panamco ) , Coca - Cola held 24 % of Panamco 's shares - a controlling interest .
Which gives it considerable clout in how the business is run .
This view of the company 's responsibilities is shared , in particular , by Councilman Hiram Monserrate from New York City .
He represents a large Latino community and became aware of the situation through some of his constituents .
And so I visit New York for the first time , to talk to him .
Monserrate represents District 21 in Queens , across the East river from Manhattan , where the houses and salaries are much smaller .
An ex-marine , he has the politics of a Queens Democrat , a combination of liberalism on issues such as immigration mixed with a strong populist streak .
He has been a persistent critic of the Coca - Cola Company since 2004 .
He worked with New York City 's pension fund on how they might use their stockholding in Coke to influence the company , tabling critical resolutions at shareholders ' meetings .
He has spoken out against the company on US campuses , with students subsequently boycotting Coke .
The councilman was introduced to Sinaltrainal 's officials in New York in 2003 and found their tale compelling enough to help organise a delegation to Colombia in 2004 .
" I wanted to know more , " he says .
" At the very least it seemed to me there had to be some truth in what the workers were telling me .
That labour reps and workers were being killed . "
While planning for the delegation , Monserrate decided he ought to invite the Coca - Cola Company along , too .
" We have to have some fairness .
They could have been a partner in this delegation .
They refused . "
Monserrate 's 2004 report found a lack of action by the Coca - Cola Company and the bottlers , and an alarming laissez - faire attitude .
Although the delegation was denied access to Coke 's bottling plants , Juan Manuel Alvarez and Juan Carlos Dominguez , representatives of Coca - Cola Femsa ( a huge bottling company operating in several central and South American countries , including Colombia ) did meet them .
The delegation asked what they had done to investigate the allegations of ties between plant managers and paramilitaries .
At first " these allegations were vigorously denied " , the report states , but continues , " Alvarez and Dominguez acknowledged that Coke officials had never undertaken any internal or external investigations into these assertions , nor into any of the hundreds of human rights violations suffered by the company 's workers . "
Monserrate leans forward : " Isidro Gil was killed inside the bottling plant .
That alone , to me , puts the onus on the Coca - Cola Company ... "
He nods his head and stares at me , as if he were Robert De Niro .
" There 's a causal relationship between the trade unionists ' deaths and working at Coca - Cola .
So , at the very least , the company in Atlanta has an obligation to try and get to the bottom of it ...
Coca - Cola , just like any other major corporation , has a responsibility to be responsive corporate neighbours .
You can't just chalk it up to the politics of the country .
You 're Coca - Cola and your logo is worldwide and it started here in America .
" I mean , we would n't accept it in America .
Could you imagine if , in a Coca - Cola plant in the US , a worker was killed because he was part of the union - what kind of outrage there would be . "
Coca -Cola represents American capitalism , he says .
" And American capitalism should never be about allowing your workers to be subject to violence or death because they are organising to defend their rights .
What does it say about America ? "
The Carepa murders were the starting point of a new saga of violence and intimidation for the union .
Sinaltrainal decided to take action .
In July 2001 , they brought a lawsuit in the US against the Coca - Cola Company and its Colombian bottlers ; and in 2003 they initiated a call for an international boycott of Coca - Cola products .
The bottlers retaliated by taking the union to court , claiming that in bringing the US lawsuit the union had libelled and defamed them .
The bottlers even went after 500 million pesos in damages .
In 2004 , the case was dismissed as being without merit .
According to Coca - Cola , over the years the Coca - Cola bottlers have frequently and publicly denounced violence against union members .
Sinaltrainal 's lawsuit has had mixed fortunes .
It began in July 2001 when the United Steelworkers of America union and the International Labor Rights Fund filed an Alien Tort Claims Act ( ATCA ) suit on behalf of Sinaltrainal in the US Federal Court in Miami .
( The act allows for companies and individuals to be taken to court in the US for complicity in the crimes of kidnap , torture and murder committed outside the US . )
The suit , claiming $ 500 million compensation for the plaintiffs , alleges that the bottlers Panamco and Bebidas y Alimentos " contracted with or otherwise directed paramilitary security forces that utilised extreme violence and murdered , tortured , unlawfully detained or otherwise silenced trade union leaders " , and that the Coca - Cola Company as the parent company bore indirect responsibility .
The Colombian bottlers deny the charges .
The Coca -Cola Company argued that the Colombian bottlers were separate companies , so Coca - Cola had no case to answer , stating , " We deny any wrongdoing regarding human rights or any other unlawful activities in Colombia or anywhere else in the world " and adding that , " The Coca - Cola Company does not own or operate any bottling plants in Colombia . "
The union 's legal team argued that the Coca - Cola Company exerted control over its bottlers by way of a legal agreement , called " the bottlers ' agreement " .
The argument went thus : the Coca - Cola Company licenses the production of its drinks , it provides the syrup with which to make them , and dictates the types of bottles , cans , industrial processes , adverts and promotions that the bottlers are to use .
Thus it exerts a degree of legal and economic control .
Furthermore , the Coca - Cola Company not only possessed " a controlling 24 % interest " in Panamco 's stock , but had two seats on Panamco 's board .
In a landmark ruling in March 2003 , District Court Judge Martinez ruled that the case against Panamco and Bebidas y Alimentos could go ahead - the first time a US judge has allowed a case against a company for alleged human rights violations committed overseas to be heard under the ATCA .
But the judge dismissed the case against the Coca - Cola Company on the grounds that the " bottlers ' agreement " did not give the company explicit control of labour issues over the bottler .
Neville Isdell , Coca - Cola chief executive officer from 2004 - 2008 , and current chairman of the board of directors , told the 2005 annual meeting of shareholders , " There are no threats or attempts by management to attack or intimidate workers for being affiliated with a union ...
The people employed by our Colombian bottling partners work in facilities where their labour and human rights are respected and protected . "
It was noteworthy that the CEO of the world 's most popular brand felt compelled to defend the company , which also says that it meets regularly with Colombian government ministers in an effort to stamp out violence directed at union organisers .
In 2006 , Judge Martinez reversed his previous decision and dismissed the case against the bottlers , now arguing that the case could not be brought in the US because of " lack of ... jurisdiction " .
Sinaltrainal lawyers submitted an appeal on both rulings on March 31 2008 , and a result is expected by the lawyers in 2009 .
If successful , it means the case can be heard and Sinaltrainal will have its day in court in the US with both the Coca - Cola Company and their bottlers .
Across the world , the Coca - Cola boycott had mixed results .
In Dublin , Trinity College and University voted to " Kick Coke off Campus " and refused to stock its products in student - run facilities , as did New York University and Michigan University in the US .
They were joined in the UK by Sussex , Manchester and Middlesex universities , and London 's School of Oriental and African Studies .
Even though the contracts with US universities are usually worth millions , kicking Coca - Cola off campuses is unlikely to dent the balance sheet of a company that last year made $ 5.98 billion profit .
But the accompanying media attention , and headlines such as " Has Coke become the new McDonald 's " in the Guardian , and the Nation calling Coke " the new Nike " , must surely be part of the reason it has seen its " brand value " drop .
( Brand value is what turns a sweet , fizzy brown liquid into a product that is desirable and saleable worldwide .
In 2007 , Coca - Cola 's brand value was estimated by Business Week / Interbrand at $ 65,324 million - top of the league , but $ 2,201 million less than in 2005 . )
Something had to be done .
Publicly , Coca - Cola increasingly described the lawsuit brought by Sinaltrainal as an " out of date " allegation or " an old story " .
But behind the scenes , it was involved in negotiations with the union to settle the case .
Crucially , Martinez 's 2006 decision was not at a hearing of the case itself ; instead , it was to decide if the US courts were the correct venue for the trial .
And once Martinez decreed that the US courts did not have jurisdiction , this left the union lawyers free to launch their appeal , bringing the company back into the dock .
If the union lawyers were successful in their appeal , then the case would go to full trial and the Coca - Cola Company would face the legal procedure of disclosure , forcing it to hand over internal documents detailing its relationship with the bottlers .
I can't speak for the company , but I would imagine this prospect was about as appealing as syphilis .
Six weeks before Martinez 's ruling , the Coca - Cola Company began to negotiate with Sinaltrainal , on August 19 2006 .
When I asked Coca - Cola about these talks , it portrayed them as " fruitful and informative " .
The purpose of the talks , the company said , was " to assess whether a mediated resolution of the parties ' differences could be achieved " .
In short , it was looking to settle out of court , and with a settlement such as this comes money - a lot of money .
How much ?
A barrowful .
Although I cannot disclose the exact sum offered to Sinaltrainal and the plaintiffs in the lawsuit , it is my understanding that it had six noughts at the end of a dollar sign and a couple of digits in between .
If the company was offering money , what were the conditions attached to it ?
I spoke to Ed Potter , the Coca - Cola Company 's global workplace rights director , a man with intimate knowledge of these negotiations .
I said to him that the company had history in this department : " Financial settlements are reached , but part of that financial settlement is that you do n't criticise us again , you shut up , you go away . "
Potter replied , " All I will say , as a general matter , is we 've had several different resolutions ...
You 've described one of them . "
Sinaltrainal did not use the words " fruitful and informative " to describe the talks .
" We were in a process that lasted almost a year and a half , where we talk and talk and talk with them in order to find a solution to the conflict - and it did n't give us any result at all , " says Edgar Paez , the union 's international officer .
He is sitting in his office , by the same table where Giraldo and Manco gave their testimonies .
The only reason Coca - Cola negotiated , he believes , was " because they do n't want us to keep reporting them [ campaigning ] ...
What the company wanted was to buy the silence of the people involved .
They give some money to the victims in order not to denounce the problem . "
The negotiations broke down in early 2008 .
Coca - Cola said " no final resolution was possible .
An impasse was reached and no further discussions are anticipated at this time . "
Arguably , the impasse was a result of the conditions of the settlement :
Coke would pay millions of dollars , but anyone working for Coca - Cola Femsa and involved in the lawsuit had to leave their jobs - they could no longer work for Coke 's contractors .
But more than this , they would be legally bound never to criticise Coca - Cola again .
According to Paez , this would apply " not only in Colombia but everywhere in the whole world .
They wanted us to sign an agreement that n o one would denounce Coca - Cola any more , for the rest of their lives . "
In effect , the agreement , if signed , would prevent them from campaigning against any multinational that Coca - Cola had business with .
From the moment they signed until the day they died .
The end result of key members of the union having to leave - in effect , being gagged - would mean the end of the union .
Sinaltrainal would cease to exist in the Coca - Cola plants .
The money was on the table and all Sinaltrainal had to do was agree and take it .
So the men and women who had fought for the right to be in a trade union would become silent .
For men such as Giraldo and Manco , the prospect of compensation was money they literally could only dream of .
The union refused to sign .
They refused to be silent .
Leaving the Coca - Cola Company with an " old story " that would not go away .

SAN FRANCISCO 
After decades of debate , and unknown numbers of lost lives , the board that controls the Golden Gate Bridge took a major step toward building a suicide barrier on Friday , voting to erect a net under the span .
The 14 - to - 1 vote came after several failed efforts over the years to support a physical barrier on the Golden Gate , where troubled souls have long leapt to their deaths .
The current plan still must pass a final environmental review , including a look at how a net might affect pelicans and cormorants , which frequent the bridge .
It also needs financing : the estimated cost of the metal net is $ 40 million to $ 50 million .
Despite the uncertainty , supporters of the plan hailed the decision .
“ This is a red- letter day in the history of San Francisco , ” said Dr. Mel Blaustein , the president of the Psychiatric Foundation of Northern California , which has lobbied for a barrier .
“ It ’s a suicide magnet .
And sometimes all they need is a certain amount of time to stop and reflect and change their mind . ”
Abundance is , in large part , an attitude .
Sue Patton Thoele
Living an abundant life is everyone ’s dream .
We all want to live a prosperous life where we can be happy and fulfilled .
While it may seem difficult for some people , in reality we already have what it takes to live an abundant life .
As the quote above says , the most important ingredient for abundance is attitude and your attitude is something you can control .
With that in mind , here are nine tips to help you live an abundant life :
1 . Have abundance mentality
Abundance mentality says that there is enough for everyone , so someone else ’s gain is not your loss .
This is the opposite of scarcity mentality which says that there is only a fixed amount of reward so someone else ’s gain is your loss .
By having abundance mentality , you wo n’t feel envy when someone else succeeds .
You know that you can have your own success .
2 . Be grateful for what you have
More than anything else , being abundant is about how you see life .
Some people may have everything but they still feel poor .
Some other may have fewer but they feel abundant .
You need to look at what you already have and be grateful for them instead of complaining for things you do n’t have .
Some people need to go through painful loss before they can appreciate what they have .
Do n’t let that happen to you .
Here are some things to be grateful for .
3. Smile
I know it sounds simple , but smiling is an easy way to change the tone of your day .
Even if your day does n’t go as good as expected , you can always choose to respond positively .
By smiling you are sending a positive message to yourself and others that you are a winner in life .
4 . Start your days right
How you start your days greatly influences how they will be .
That ’s why you should make sure that you start your days right .
While only you can define how to start your days right , here are some ideas :
Rise early
Get out of the bed right away
Meditate or pray
Exercise
5 . Prepare yourself for opportunities
The way you use opportunities that come your way matters a great deal .
Those who know how to best use opportunities will advance faster in life than those who do n’t .
The first thing you should do is preparing yourself for opportunities so that you are ready when they come .
Here are some things you can do to prepare for opportunities :
Know your strengths
The opportunities you get could be unexpected , but most likely they ’re related to your strengths .
So it ’s essential that you know what your strengths are .
Books like Now , Discover Your Strengths and Strengths Finder 2.0 have tests that can help you identify your strengths .

Be observant
Open your eyes and your ears .
Be on the lookout for opportunities .
The best opportunities are those that are overlooked by others .
6 . Make the most out of every opportunity
Once you have an opportunity , explore the full extent of it .
Do n’t let it pass half - used .
Is there other ways to use it ?
Can you combine it with something you already have to create something new ?
Can it open related opportunities ?
7. Build friendships along the way
Relationships give you a lot of joy in life .
It ’s through relationships that you love and be loved .
Furthermore , you can get the help you need from your network of friends .

8. Build upon what you ’ve built
The easiest way to achieve greater things in life is to build upon what you ’ve built .
Rather than starting again from scratch , leverage what you already have to jump to the next level .
This applies to many aspects of life .
For example :
You can apply for a better job based on the resume you ’ve built .
You can cross promote a new business to the customers of your existing businesses .
You can find new connections through the network of friends you have .
9 . Enjoy your life
Living an abundant life means you should be able to enjoy your life now without waiting for something big in the future .
You do n’t need certain amount of money or certain level of success to be happy .
You can be happy right now with what you have .

More than a fifth of the world 's reptiles are threatened with extinction , a new method of monitoring the fortunes of groups of species revealed today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Instead of assessing each individual species to see if it is at risk of dying out , the Sampled Red List Index ( SRLI ) examines a sample of 1,500 species from a group such as reptiles , and uses it to model how groups are doing overall .
The method , which revealed 22 per cent of reptiles are at risk of extinction , can be used to track large groups such as insects , where it is not feasible to monitor every individual species .
Complete assessments have been done on all known bird , mammal and amphibian species - but they only make up around 2 per cent of the world 's wildlife , according to Dr Jonathan Baillie , director of conservation programmes at the Zoological Society of London ( ZSL ) .
Other plants and animals are covered on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species , but the picture is far from complete - which means conservation decisions are being made on the basis of knowledge of less than 4 per cent of the Earth 's biodiversity .
The new index , which uses the IUCN 's criteria for threatened species , is " an amazing tool for communicating the status of the world 's biodiversity " , he said .
It will enable conservationists to identify families of species which are under threat - for example the results showed 43 per cent of crocodiles were at risk of extinction - and also which ecosystems or parts of the world have high levels of at - risk wildlife .
Dr Baillie said : " This is a quantum leap forward in our understanding of biodiversity .
The disadvantage is you can't look at all individual species , but to address the bigger problems we have to understand things at an ecosystem , or habitat , level .
" The index enables us to identify a family of species or region that is particularly threatened . "
Adding the new data on reptiles to the assessments on birds , mammals and amphibians has revealed that a quarter ( 24 per cent ) of the world 's land - based vertebrate species are threatened with extinction .
The scheme , developed by ZSL and IUCN , will go on to sample other groups such as crayfish and lobsters , dung beetles , butterflies , freshwater molluscs and squid and octopuses .
The findings will feed into work toward halting the loss of global biodiversity by 2010 .
Bloc Québécois supporters
By Richard Fidler
October 19 , 2008 -- Once again , the Bloc Québécois has taken a majority of Quebec ’s seats in Canada 's House of Commons — 50 out of 75 , one less than in 2006 , although down by three percentage points .
In doing so , it dashed Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s hopes of a Conservative breakthrough in Quebec that would deliver him a majority government in Ottawa .
Working people throughout Canada heaved a sigh of relief .
The Bloc ’s support is more than a rejection of the Tories ’ right - wing policies .
As Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe declared on election night , October 14 , it is a clear demonstration “ that Quebec is a distinct nation linguistically , culturally , socially and economically ” .
This was the sixth consecutive federal election since 1993 in which the pro-sovereignty Bloc has won a majority of Quebec ’s seats under the first - past - the - post system .
Any credit the Tories may have won for their parliamentary vote in 2006 recognising the existence of a “ Québécois nation within Canada ” has been dissipated by subsequent events revealing the superficiality of that non-binding motion .
Even on the eve of the election , Ottawa made drastic cuts in federal funding to arts and culture programs in Quebec as elsewhere , undermining its claims to respect and foster Francophone culture .
So strong was the reaction in Quebec that even Liberal Premier Jean Charest , a firm federalist , came out publicly for transferring all control over culture and communications to Quebec jurisdiction .
Earlier , parliament had rejected a Bloc motion to force federal government institutions in Quebec to comply with Quebec ’s Charter of the French Language .
Ottawa continues to defend its alleged right to create and fund programs in areas that are constitutionally within Quebec ’s jurisdiction .
And during this election campaign , the Tories promised youth justice reforms that would jail 14 - year - olds — a clear violation of Quebec ’s rehabilitation - oriented juvenile justice system , which has helped the province achieve one of the lowest crime rates in Canada .
The Tory mocking of Liberal leader Stéphane Dion ’s English ( when he had difficulty understanding a question put to him ) was a painful reminder of anti-French chauvinism in the rest of Canada ; as many Québécois noted , they welcomed Harper ’s attempts to speak French although his mastery of that language is much less than Dion ’s of English .
Such incidents , which may seem trivial to some , reflect an important underlying reality : Quebec , for all the progress it has made through educational reform , social programs , language legislation , etc. , is still threatened by its minority status within Canada and its lack of control over key powers essential to its survival and development .
It is an oppressed nation within the Canadian state .
And in federal elections , the Québécois vote is strongly influenced by their consciousness of their vulnerability as a minority lacking even constitutional protection of their national rights .
As if to drive this point home , on the day after the election Harper threatened to proceed with plans for an elected Senate , which would further reduce Quebec ’s weight and influence within the federation .
It was a reminder that Quebec is becoming increasingly marginalised as a political force within Canada .
The Bloc Québécois platform , while proclaiming its support of Quebec independence , was essentially defensive , vowing to defend “ Quebec ’s interests ” against “ Alberta oil interests , Ontario financial interests ” and “ free of compromises with the centralizing left or doctrinaire right of Canada ... ”
NDP has little impact
As in past elections , the social - democratic New Democratic Party [ NDP -- Canada 's ``Labor Party '' ] was not a serious contender in Quebec , largely because of its perception as a Canadian nationalist party .
Although its platform claimed to recognise “ the national character of Quebec ” and opposed federal spending on “ new programs in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction ” , its proposals on “ Canadian federalism ” were little more than bromides about such things as the “ unique role and responsibilities of the Quebec National Assembly ” .
Among its “ key priorities ” were support for “ Our Canadian Cultural Identity ” , with no reference to the need to defend the French language and culture .
In fact , when Impératif français , a French language rights group , polled the federal parties on their views during the campaign , neither the NDP nor any of its candidates responded — while the Bloc provided detailed answers describing its own record and making concrete proposals for positive measures at the federal level .
The NDP undermined its own memberships ’ convention resolutions in support of Quebec ’s right of self - determination when its MPs voted in 2000 to support the Chrétien - Dion “ Clarity Act ” , giving Ottawa the power to override a Quebec referendum vote for secession .
That decision , which shocked many Québécois , continues to block the party ’s electoral prospects in Quebec .
Its only victory this year was the re-election of one MP , an Anglophone ex-Liberal running in a multicultural Montréal riding .
The NDP in Quebec lacks the identification with the trade unions that it has in English Canada .
The Quebec Federation of Labour ( FTQ ) , the largest union central , endorsed the Bloc and some Bloc candidates were prominent FTQ activists .
A four - page pamphlet explaining the FTQ ’s position stated that the choice in the October 14 election was “ between two diametrically opposed visions of society ” .
“ Despite the nice words on the recognition of Quebec as a ‘ nation ’ , none of the federalist parties in Ottawa — and especially not the Conservatives — has undertaken to entrench this in the Canadian constitution .
Without that commitment , all the motions voted in Ottawa are just symbolic .
“ The Bloc ’s presence in Ottawa shows that English Canada is still not prepared to accept in fact that Quebec is a nation .... ”
Events in the last five decades have demonstrated over and over that Quebec workers , as they develop political consciousness , do so in a nationalist context that sees Quebec sovereignty as the framework for resolving their social problems .
This has important implications for the left in both Quebec and English Canada .
Unable to build a strong base in Quebec , the NDP lacks credibility as a contender for governmental office in Ottawa .
Conversely , the lack of a credible political ally in English Canada has seriously hampered the Quebec left ’s ability to build a viable alternative to the nationalist but neoliberal Bloc .
The result is a left in both nations that has no viable governmental perspective at the level of the federal state — notwithstanding NDP leader Jack Layton ’s unconvincing claim that he was running to be prime minister !
Debate among Quebec socialists
These dilemmas were the subject of a lively debate during the election campaign among supporters of Québec solidaire , the fledgling left - wing pro-sovereignty party .
( For a report on earlier stages of this debate , see http://tinyurl.com/3kpaye and also http://links.org.au/node/663.)
Writing in the September 30 edition of the on - line journal Presse - toi - à - gauche ( PTàG ) , Jean - Paul Pelletier put the issue clearly :
“ I am well aware that a recommendation to vote for the Bloc does not lead straight to a unified progressive alternative in Quebec and Canada , as we would like .
But does a call for an NDP vote do that , either ?
...
We have enough trouble building an independentist left - wing party in Quebec ; in addition , do we have to convince the Quebec working class to vote for a federalist and centralizing left party ?
...
“ Federally , we need an alliance between an independentist left party based in Quebec and a left party based in the rest of Canada that truly recognizes Quebec ’s right to self - determination and rejects the Clarity Act .
But there is no such thing .
This is the tragic history of two working classes that constitute two solitudes , that engage in struggles and develop their political consciousness in accordance with their own completely different dynamics . ”
Pelletier said he would vote for the Bloc in order to defeat the Conservatives , but “ without illusions ” that it would provide real protection against neoliberal policies .
A Conservative defeat , he said , might give us some needed time in which to organise resistance to the coming right - wing offensives .
André Frappier , in a further contribution to the debate , was more positive about the value of the NDP .
In his view , the real task is “ the construction of a pan-Canadian left alternative ” :
“ The NDP is a vehicle on the basis of which we can begin working with English - Canadian progressives , ” he wrote in the October 10 PTàG .
“ Recognition of Quebec ’s right to sovereignty is an issue on which we must work to achieve a break with the Canadian ideology .
If it turns out that the NDP is no longer the tool to achieve this , it will be necessary to create a Canada - Québec solidaire alternative .
“ In Quebec , the challenge is to bring about a break with the bourgeois nationalist solutions of the PQ and the Bloc , in order to take our place and impose the solutions of the workers movement and the progressive and feminist movements .
From this perspective , the conjunction of the Canadian and Québécois workers movement is decisive , and the only promising one . ”
Short - term “ lesser evil ” strategies to block the right , Frappier argued , did nothing to advance the task of building a left alternative .
In parliament , the Bloc voted with the Tories in support of free trade deals and in favour of the war .
In Quebec itself the so - called strategic vote for the PQ has impeded the emergence of a genuine party of the left .
More than a voting formula
Summing up the PTàG debate — which included several other contributions — Jean - Paul Pelletier noted in the October 14 edition that it was much more than a debate on a voting formula .
More fundamentally , he said , it comes down to the place occupied by the demand for independence in the perspective of the left in Quebec :
“ Which should prevail ?
A sovereigntist vote , or a social - democratic vote ?
Some posed the question very directly in those terms .
Others were less direct , but strongly emphasized the NDP ’s good social positions while minimizing the importance of its unacceptable positions on the question of Quebec and the Clarity Act .
“ The question of independence does not seem important enough to prevent them from voting for the NDP , but the Bloc ’s weaknesses on Afghanistan and NAFTA categorically prohibit a vote for the Bloc .
There is a certain ‘ hierarchization ’ here which leads to a dichotomy between the social question and the national question .
Are we sovereigntists first or leftists first ?
Is that the right way to pose the question ?
“ Personally , I am unable to answer a question put that way .
It reminds me too much of the old hobbyhorse of a certain left that sought to dissect the reality into `principal contradiction ' and `secondary contradiction ' .
Of course , the proper proletarian morality always had it that the national question was simply a secondary contradiction , and thus subordinate .
Today , we no longer use these old - fashioned terms , but it seems that the same schematic thinking tends to rise from the ashes .
It is always more reassuring to be able to classify things that way , in hierarchical order , but it has little do with the reality .... ”
Pelletier was referring , of course , to the approach taken in the past by Quebec ’s largest far - left organisations , the so - called Marxist - Leninists or Maoists , whose opposition to Quebec nationalism and support of Canadian nationalism was a major cause of their quick decline and demise in the early 1980s .
He continued :
“ Is it the disarray and retreat of sovereigntist fervour under a neoliberal leadership that has promoted a tendency to relativize the importance of the national question within the left ?
I tend to think so when I read certain interpretations of the position of Québec solidaire , according to which [ citing a contribution by Mario Charland ] ‘ political independence is meaningful only to the degree that it strengthens the possibilities of achieving a substantial reduction in inequalities between social classes and not in a so - called pressing need for national affirmation or some sort of search for identity of the Québécois . ’
This way of opposing independence as a mere tool for social justice , on the one hand , and the search for identity on the other , seems to be another way to reduce the importance of the national question .
And that is a serious error . ”
A pan-Canadian left ?
As to the perspective of building a pan-Canadian left alternative held out by André Frappier , “ a genuine left independentist ” , Pelletier responded :
“ If I really believed in the possibility of such a pan-Canadian left alternative , with the objective of course of taking power and implementing a progressive social program respectful of the Quebec nation , I would no longer be an independentist .
What would be the use , if the national question could be resolved in the pan-Canadian context ?
Instead , I would be a partisan of a left - wing version of the ‘ beau risque ’
[ PQ premier René Lévesque ’s phrase to describe his gamble in accepting Mulroney ’s promise to reintegrate Quebec “ in honour and dignity ” within the Canadian constitution by recognizing its distinctiveness ] .
Perhaps I would keep the independentist option in my pocket , just in case it did n’t work ( I ’m not completely crazy ) , but I would no longer be an independentist .
I , too , would end up relativizing the importance of the national question .
“ If it were possible , it would certainly be the best way to go .
But all of history shows us the contrary , and I see nothing in the Canadian political landscape to convince me otherwise .
Quite the contrary ....
The search for a pan-Canadian strategy is illusory .
We can intervene only indirectly on some players who will never clearly reflect our values . ”
This , then , is the challenge that Quebec socialists put to the left in English Canada .
As long as it is posed in the restrictive context of an electoral contest in which socialists in both nations confront only a choice among lesser evils , there are no obvious answers .
But the debate in Quebec touches on a fundamental issue that has long haunted the left in both nations : whether an alliance can be built between us and on what basis .
There is no disagreement that a genuine alliance would aid the struggle for socialism in both nations .
Quebec socialists are clear that any meaningful alliance must be based on the defence of Quebec ’s right to national self - determination , not just in words but in deeds .
It is indeed virtually excluded that the social - liberal Canadian nationalist New Democratic Party can serve as an adequate vehicle for Quebec ’s aspirations .
But it is equally true that no anticapitalist force can be built in the Rest of Canada that does not put Quebec self - determination at the centre of its program .
Addendum
Marc Bonhomme , a member of Québec solidaire , has expressed a different view of this debate in a comment posted on my blog , at http://tinyurl.com/6sarom, and ( in French ) in a document he circulated privately to his contacts .
In Marc ’s view , the PTàG debate is a “ diversion ” , a false debate that , in the electoral context , is necessarily limited to impossible choices for socialists .
As he puts it in his document , the debate reflects an insufficient consciousness in the Quebec left of “ the tragic impasse it is stuck in since the strategic defeat ” suffered by the unions under the Clarity Act and Charest ’s anti-labour laws “ and its corollary , the rapid social - liberalization and electoralist diversion of the party born from the anti-neoliberal globalization protest movement ” , i.e. Québec solidaire .
A call to vote for either the Bloc or the NDP wrongly suggests that those parties have some answer to the present crisis , Marc says .
He concludes :
“ Better the angst of the vacuum , which pushes us to build an anticapitalist and independentist party while openly criticizing the social - liberal orientation of the Québec solidaire leadership , substituting in its place an ecosocialist orientation . ”
And in his comment on my blog he argues that a marginal increase in the NDP ’s vote in Quebec cannot help to build meaningful unity with the working class in English Canada .
The Quebec workers can ally with the NDP only at the cost of “ putting aside their strategic struggle for their liberation from the historical and still actual oppression by the Canadian state ” .
The “ multinational Canadian proletariat ” , Marc says , cannot be unified unless the working class in English Canada takes “ a public stand for the independence of Quebec , and not only for the abstract right of self - determination ” .
Which , of course , it is manifestly not prepared to do .
Unless and until it does so , there is little prospect for socialism in Canada or Quebec .
For the key to revolutionary change in both nations lies in the secession of Quebec , the weak link in the capitalist power structure .
That alone can shake the bourgeoisie by jeopardising its territorial base .
So the argument goes .
It ’s a grand schema , and there is no denying that there will be no socialist revolution in Canada or Quebec that does not entail an end to Quebec ’s national oppression .
But are the present strategic options as stark as Marc portrays them ?
The strategy and tactics that would most effectively advance today ’s struggles in either nation cannot be derived directly and automatically from general principles , still less grand objectives .
To get from here to there requires a serious assessment of such things as mass consciousness and the historical culture and state of organization of the working class .
I think Marc tends to put the cart before the horse .
It would be wonderful if the working class in English Canada fully understood the nature of Quebec ’s oppression and supported the cause of Quebec ’s national liberation .
But is the achievement of that level of consciousness a necessary precondition to united action in the here and now with Quebec working people ?
History suggests otherwise .
More to the point , perhaps , how can workers in English Canada be won to that necessary understanding and solidarity ?
The workers ' movement in English Canada has indicated , on various occasions , its ability to sympathise with and defend Quebec ’s right to self - determination .
In 1961 , the presence of several hundred Québécois at the founding convention of the NDP inspired the delegates to recognise Quebec ’s national character .
In 1971 , an alliance between the NDP ’s left - wing Waffle caucus and a strong Quebec delegation led by teachers ' union leader Raymond Laliberté , based on a common platform that recognised Quebec self - determination , gave Waffle candidate Jim Laxer 44 % of the votes in a final leadership ballot against the establishment candidate David Lewis .
In 1976 , Quebec and Canadian workers mobilised together in powerful mass actions to protest Pierre Trudeau ’s wage controls .
The Canadian Labour Congress and many pan-Canadian unions have long accepted the autonomy of their Quebec affiliates to develop their own organisational structures and policies — even to the point of supporting different political parties in each nation .
Although the labour movement in English Canada did not mobilise in 1995 in support of Quebec independence , the CLC and some unions did issue statements supporting Quebec ’s right to secede and opposing the federalist obstruction and blackmail tactics in the referendum .
Marc is right when he points to Quebec ’s oppression as the major fault line in the structure of capitalist rule in Canada .
But that also means , does it not , that every major step taken by the Québécois to fight their oppression and achieve national liberation will be met by anti-democratic measures by the Canadian state .
We have many instances of this in Canadian history — one of the most notable being the imposition of the War Measures
Act repression in October 1970 , which ultimately unleashed a wave of solidarity with Quebec in the Rest of Canada and stimulated a further rise in the independence movement in Quebec .
It is this democratic axis — self - determination for Quebec , opposition to repression — that has the greatest potential in English Canada to mobilise working people in support of the Québécois .
If the English - Canadian working class displays little fervour over Quebec ’s national cause today , this is due not only to their Canadian nationalism but to their lack of awareness of the existence , and the nature and extent , of Quebec ’s oppression , an ignorance that is fueled in part by the decline in mobilisations by the Québécois themselves .
As part of a common state structure , the working class in each nation is not completely insensitive to the moods and actions of the other .
A rise in Quebec workers ’ struggles would be greeted by workers in English Canada , just as any mobilisation of Canadian workers — especially one in defence of Quebec ’s democratic rights — would be welcomed by the Québécois .
That much we know .
But it is equally clear that , for the foreseeable future , workers in English Canada will be far more receptive to defending Quebec ’s democratic right of self - determination than they will be to fighting for its independence — especially when the current independence movement in Quebec is led by capitalist politicians .
Socialists in English Canada can and should study and explain the nature of Quebec ’s national oppression — they can disseminate the ideas of the independentists — but the case for Quebec independence has to be made primarily by the Québécois .
In English Canada , the focus has to be on defending Quebec ’s right to choose and to pursue its course .
And , of course , building solidarity in action with the Québécois as they pursue their agenda .

A British jury has cleared six Greenpeace activists of causing criminal damage when they vandalized a power plant last year in a protest over global warming , based on the defense attorneys ’ argument that the protesters were trying to prevent even worse damage from climate change .
Yesterday ’s verdict is expected to embarrass the government and lead to more direct action protests against energy companies [ The Guardian ] .
Last October , the Greenpeace protesters scaled the smokestacks of a coal - fired power plant as a publicity stunt to protest the United Kingdom ’s continued reliance on coal - fired power plants , which emit large amounts of the greenhouse gases responsible for global warming .
The protesters were halfway through painting a slogan on the side of one smokestack ( “ Gordon , bin it , ” a British way of asking Prime Minister Gordon Brown to chuck coal ) , when the police served the activists an injunction by helicopter and forced them to stop .
They were charged with causing more than $ 50,000 in damages based on the cost of removing the paint .
E.ON , which owns the power plant , said that the company was in a state of shock over the verdict [ The Times ] .
Jurors accepted defence arguments that the six had a “ lawful excuse ” to damage property at Kingsnorth power station in Kent to prevent even greater damage caused by climate change .
The defence of “ lawful excuse ” under the Criminal Damage Act 1971 allows damage to be caused to property to prevent even greater damage – such as breaking down the door of a burning house to tackle a fire [ The Independent ] .
The trial was a remarkable affair featuring testimony by an Inuit leader from Greenland and NASA climate scientist James Hansen , who argued that the world needs an immediate moratorium on new coal - fired power plants .
The reprieved activists greeted the verdict with delight .
“ This verdict marks a tipping point for the climate change movement , ” said Ben Stewart , one of the six .
“ If jurors from the heart of Middle England say it ’s legitimate for a direct action group to shut down a coal - fired power station because of the harm it does to our planet , then where does that leave government energy policy ?
We have the clean technologies at hand to power our economy , it ’s time we turned to them instead of coal ” [ Reuters ] .

Traditional machine learning systems work with relatively flat , uniform data representations , such as feature vectors , time - series , and probabilistic context - free grammars .
However , reality often presents us with data which are best understood in terms of relations , types , hierarchies , and complex functional forms .
The best representational scheme we computer scientists have for coping with this sort of complexity is computer programs .
Yet there are comparatively few machine learning methods that operate directly on programmatic representations , due to the extreme combinatorial explosions involved and the semantic complexities of programs .
The plop project is part a new approach to learning programs being developed at Google and elsewhere that takes on the challenges of learning programs through a unified approach based on reducing programs to a hierarchical normal form , building sequences of specialized representations for programs as search progresses , maintaining alternative representations , and managing uncertainty probabilistically by applying estimation - of - distribution algorithms over program spaces , and exploiting probabilistic background knowledge .
For more information on this approach to learning programs , see my doctoral dissertation .

Violin Memory 's 1010 memory appliance is at last available with flash memory instead of DRAM .
Positioned as a networked tier zero storage resource , it is said to be faster than solid state drives tucked in storage array drive shelves .
The 1010 DRAM - based memory appliance was launched in August 2007 .
At that time the flash version was promised for early 2008 .
The appliance can have up to 500GB of DRAM in its 2U chassis , supports three million IOPS ( Input / Output operations Per Second ) and has a 3 microsecond latency .
The flash version has an eight times larger capacity of 4TB , starting at 320GB and consists single level cell ( SLC ) NAND flash .
Its latency is around 23 times slower at 70 microseconds .
It supports more than 100,000 sustained random write IOPS and 200,000 read IOPS ( 4 K blocks ) and can do so for ten years .
According to Violin , users would need 500 15,000 rpm Fibre Channel drives to deliver this level of performance .
Violin says the RAID memory scheme for the 1010 does not rely on read - modify - write operations .
Fibre Channel , Ethernet and PCIe connectivity are present , a network head being needed though for Fibre Channel and Ethernet .
The main Linux releases , Open Solaris and Windows ( 32 - bit and 64 - bit ) operating systems are supported .
Violin says it costs less than $ 50 / GB suggesting that a fully - configured TB flash 1010 would be $ 200,000 .
< pTexas Memory System 's RamSan 500 , a rival product .
also a flash - based networked solid state drive , can have 2TB of SLC flash , 64GB of DRAM cache , and costs , wait for it , $ 200,000 .
Strange , that .
It offers 100,000 random read IOPS and 25,000 random write IOPS , and latency of 200 microseconds with a cache miss or 15 microseconds with a cache hit .
Compared to that it looks like Violin plays a better flash sonata . ®
A couple of months ago , I spent a week preparing a rage - and sorrow - filled column decrying John McCain ’s victory over Barack Obama .
For the next six weeks , ideas and phrases were added and subtracted , resulting in a ready - made article about disillusionment and the American dream .
By Monday , I had already forgotten everything in it and was planning a really interesting essay about recycling .
Fortunately for all of us , something happened on Tuesday night , and recycling will have to wait a week .
Yes , yes , Obama won the election , and as a matter of duty this column — written within 24 hours of the victory — really ought to be about such a significant moment in history .
But everyone else has been talking about it and this recycling thing seemed such a unique decision , a step beyond the past and into the future , if you will .
Then , in the wee hours of Tuesday night / Wednesday morning after everyone else had gone to bed , something momentous happened .
At around 2 a.m. , CNN put on an election recap montage that ended with its “ Barack Obama , President - Elect ” graphic .
And when the graphic came up , well , uh , I cried .
I ’m talking about tissue - to - dab - your - eyes - and - cheeks tears mixed with puffy red eyes and a runny nose .
It only lasted a few minutes , but damn .
Even a day later , let ’s just say it got a little dusty in the apartment while I was reading countless articles about the victory .
This is rather abnormal behavior on my part .
You could count on one hand the amount of times I ’ve cried in the past several years .
It probably averages out to about once a year , but you have to remember that of those five or so times , two have been Michigan football - related and once was because I watched Field of Dreams ( which will make me cry every single time I watch it ) .
If you ’re into crying , that ’s all good , but my emotional composition ranges from “ chatterbox elated ” on one end to “ basically a robot without empathy or human - being - like compassion ” on the other .
Getting a grip on emotions has never been that difficult , because , frankly , there are n’t really that many emotions to wrangle .
Things that will provoke tears could basically be reduced to the following themes : Michigan football , the Baltimore Orioles winning the World Series , Field of Dreams , and gunshot wounds .
You can imagine the shock of feeling that first tear well up and tumble out of its duct .
I was completely unprepared for this .
The victory and follow - up speech had incited extreme relief and certainly jubilation , but I had not felt even close to emotional the entire night .
It was cool , it was amazing , it was historic , but it was n’t a tearjerker .
Obama ’s speech had nothing on Kevin Costner “ having a catch ” with his pop or even Archie “ Moonlight ” Graham crossing the first base line .
Left alone with CNN in a half - drunk , sleep - deprived state , though , I began to realize what this election meant to me .
Not what this election meant to the rest of the world or black Americans or any of the millions of people this election inspired .
Me .
Now , I am white .
I am upper - middle - class and came from a nice suburb .
I went to a good public high school and a fine university .
My background has virtually guaranteed success .
For so many people , Obama represents the ideal that someone without my insanely lucky background can succeed .
On an intellectual level , that makes me incredibly happy , but it does n’t inspire an emotional breakdown because , frankly , it would feel odd to co-opt the sentiments of a group of people whose struggles are not mine and whose experience I can never fully understand .
Since I was a little boy , my parents have always told me I could be anything I wanted .
They still do .
This is America , where my last name is irrelevant .
I can do what I want and it does n’t matter who my parents or grandparents or great - grandparents were .
But I realized along the way that my last name was in fact a barrier .
I could never under any circumstance — no matter how qualified I was — be the president .
Neither could my children , their children , their children ’s children , and so on .
This is because I am Jewish and so is my last name .
To a degree , this does n’t affect day - to - day life all that much .
Frankly , the presidency is just about the only thing I can’t attain as a Jewish person .
On the surface , I am still a part of the majority and receive the unspoken benefits of being such ( getting cabs in New York , the ability to drive through most major cities without raising suspicion , the unfortunately natural comfort of being surrounded by people who look like you almost all the time ) .
The job of president is the ultimate aspiration in the United States , one that I probably was n’t going to achieve no matter what my last name is .
But once I was old enough to understand politics , I realized how important Christianity was in a candidate , what a huge deal it was on the campaign trail and to so many people in our nation .
No non-Christian could ever win the presidency .
Shit , Catholics can barely get elected ( we ’ve only had one , John F. Kennedy , and he was assassinated ) .
When you see what limitations you have based on birth — not who you are , not what you can do , not what you ’ve done — you start to worry that you may not be as much a part of this country as you like to tell yourself .
The whole “ You will never be President because you are a Jew even though we will never say it aloud ” thing shows you that a majority of people do n’t consider you a real part of the national fabric .
It is much stronger , much more hurtful proof than Sarah Palin ’s divisive comments to the same effect .
For my whole life , I have always identified with my American - ness much more than anything else , including my Jewish - ness .
So to be reminded that those categorizations are occasionally at odds , to have that faith appear misplaced is a jarring aspect of being a Jewish - American that I like to forget .
If I consider myself an American but history indicates I could never ascend to the country ’s highest office , do I still get to be an American ?
Am I betraying myself by attaching my sense of who I am to an institution that has n’t yet entrusted its greatest powers to a Jewish person ?
Am I betraying my Jewish heritage ?
Can I be Jewish and American ?
These questions should n’t have to be raised , but the election nonetheless reminded me of my limitations .
Because , really , being Jewish does n’t hold me back .
You know , except when it does .
Honestly , anti-Semitism is little more than a specter in America .
America is the safest place for Jews in the world ( unfortunately including Israel ) .
No other nation — save Israel , of course — has truly accepted us as its own .
One barrier — and it really is just the one — does n’t make bigots of an entire nation .
When I hear some people talk about anti-Semitism in America , I tell them they are paranoid idiots .
But I have trouble negotiating the feeling that America truly accepts me as an American with this other , latent discomfort that I usually tuck away without thought .
The discrimination is there , it is a part of the world , but it ’s not my world , at least the world I like to think exists .
So what the hell do I make of this mess ?
Therein lays the essence of American - ness .
It is the struggle between the majority , made of white Christians , and the ideological foundation of a free , religion - less , race - less nation .
It is the fact that nowhere else on earth brings their immigrants — and especially immigrants ’ children — into society as fully and naturally as America , matched with the symbolism of that wall we ’re building down south .
It is our slave - owning past , still - racist present and the fact that we just elected a black president .
But he is n’t just black : his name is a lot scarier to most people than mine .
He is n’t just black : his old pastor rants against white people and America .
He is n’t just black : he sucks at bowling and eats arugula .
He is n’t just black : he is very well - educated and talks like it .
He is n’t just black : he ’s the product of a white single - mother who had a child out of wedlock with a black Kenyan .
Barack Obama is not like me , and he is not like you .
He is unlike almost everyone in the United States .
And we elected him because he was the best choice .
And I cried .
Robert Stacy McCain :
I 've got news for the Christopher Buckleys of the world -- if Sarah Palin is enough to make you decide you 're not a Republican , you 're not a Republican .
Larison and Conor sigh .
It looks as if backing Palin will be the litmus test for the base right after the election for inclusion within the Republican coalition .
Are they that suicidal ?
Do they even know who she is ?

A pilot who lost his sight flying a light aircraft back from a family holiday and had to be guided to safety by an RAF jet was seriously ill in hospital .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Solo pilot Jim O'Neill was taking the two - seat Cessna back from Scotland to Essex , when he was suddenly blinded over North Yorkshire .
It is reported that Mr O'Neill had a stroke mid-flight and blood at the back of his head put pressure on his optic nerves , immediately blinding him .
Mr O'Neill put in a mayday alert and attempted to land his plane at Full Sutton Airfield near York , but was unable to complete the manoeuvre even with the help of air traffic controllers .
A RAF team from nearby Linton - on - Ouse was scrambled and a Tucano T1 jet took off to find the aircraft and guided the stricken pilot to the ground .
Mr O'Neill , 65 , with 18 years ' flying experience , was taken to York Hospital before being transferred to Queen 's Hospital in Romford , Essex .
He is thought to be seriously ill in a brain unit at the hospital .
Mr O'Neill told the Daily Mirror from his hospital bed : " I should not be alive .
I owe my life - and those of dozens of people I could have crash landed on - to the RAF .
It was terrifying .
Suddenly I could n't see the dials in front of me " .
Net Neutrality & the White Hot Spotlight of Public Attention
Over just the past 24 hours , there ’s been quite a hullabaloo surrounding the Wall Street Journal ’s controversial front - page story on Google ’s edge caching plan and whether it violates Net neutrality .
( See Cord ’s post and Bret ’s ) .
Lessig calls it a “ made - up drama “ , David Isenberg says it ’s “ bogus ” and “ bullshit , ” and Google ’s Rick Whitt has said it ’s much ado about nothing .
Regardless , here ’s the important thing not to overlook about this episode :
It is a prime example of the what Tim Lee has referred to as “ the fundamental problem of backlash ” that ensues whenever there is even a hint of a potential violation of network neutrality ( however one defines it ) .
As Tim argued in his excellent Cato paper on Net neutrality , “ No widespread manipulation would go unnoticed for very long , ” and a “ firestorm of controversy would … be unleashed if a major network owner embarked on a systematic campaign of censorship on its network . ” ( p. 23 ) .
Indeed , this ( non -) story about Google ’s edge - caching plans have spawned an intense “ firestorm of controversy ” over the past 24 hours and it does n’t even involve serious network meddling or censorship !
I ’ve been trying to keep up with all the traffic about this on TechMeme and Google News during that time , but I have given up trying to digest it all .
( Take a look at those snapshots I pasted down below to get a feel for the volume we are talking about here ) .
In that regard , I love this quote from the always - bloodthirsty Tim Karr of the ( inappropriately - named ) regulatory activist group Free Press :
If Google or any other tech company were secretly violating Net Neutrality , there would be an absolute and cataclysmic backlash from the grassroots and netroots who have made Net Neutrality a signature issue in 21st Century politics .
The Internet community would come crashing down on their heads like Minutemen on Benedict Arnold .
Indeed , that ’s exactly what we saw today .
But it was n’t just pro-regulatory fanatics like Free Press .
The entire tech and business blogoshere and even some of the mainstream media were on top of this .
That ’s the “ fundamental problem of backlash ” at work , and with a vengeance .
Edsall ….
The McCain campaign , in running TV ads which defy prior political standards , is gambling that the traditional rules governing what is permissible in presidential contests — as defined by the mainstream media — can safely be discarded this year .
The normally cautious and even - handed Associated Press on Thursday declared , “ Even in a political culture accustomed to truth - stretching , McCain ’s skirting of facts has stood out this week . ”
The controversies have surrounded McCain television commercials and stump speeches asserting that Barack Obama “ supports ” comprehensive sex education in kindergarten , that Obama called Sarah Palin a “ pig in lipstick , ” and that Palin stood firmly against the “ bridge to nowhere ” — despite videotape evidence that the Alaskan governor provided support for the earmark before she opposed it .
So far , based on polling over the past two weeks , McCain ’s roll of the dice has paid off .
Not only has McCain made substantial gains , pulling modestly ahead in most national polls , but his assaults on Obama appear to have damaged the Democratic Party as well , raising Republican hopes of minimizing House and Senate losses .

You know something ?
There 's a hilarious video doing the rounds on the internet at the moment .
Now , this information obviously wo n't be forcing understaffed news desks across the globe to coax former reporters out of retirement ; if your job involves the use of a computer , you 'll do well to get through a working day without being sent a web - link to a video someone thinks is side - splitting .
But , as supposedly hilarious video clips go , this is a pretty good one .
It features a well - groomed eight - piece band called Sonseed , all wearing their Sunday best , performing a ditsy little ska tune called " Jesus Is My Friend " on an early Eighties religious show on American TV – and if you have n't seen it , do force yourself to have a look ; it 's at d95.com / jesus .
It has many of the ingredients of a copper - bottomed viral hit : dated haircuts , dubious fashion sense , questionable musical value and , above all , mind - boggling peculiarity .
But there 's an equally strange phenomenon occurring on the web these days : a profound disbelief that things are what they claim to be .
Wary of being seen as gullible , people simply assume that everything is fake .
Within a very short time of the Sonseed video appearing , many had decided that this religious rock band was the brainchild of bloggers hellbent on duping people .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
All kinds of supposed inconsistencies were highlighted : why was the footage in such good condition after 25 years ?
Why is there no other reference to Sonseed online ?
Hang on – surely that bass guitar he 's playing was n't in production when the footage was apparently shot ?
One website , convinced of the veracity of the clip , tracked down the lead singer and interviewed him – but still the doubters were n't convinced .
" Nice fake interview , " posted one sceptical commenter .
No one wants to be seen to fall for a hoax .
It 's almost the most embarrassing thing you can do online – on a par with being caught absent - mindedly sucking your thumb on a webcam .
But millions of people fall for online hoaxes every day .
Almost every email you receive that warns you about a computer virus is a good example ; the renowned " Good Times " email played on our naivety in the early days of the internet , informing us how , if our computers were unlucky enough to become infected , they would immediately enter an " nth - complexity infinite binary loop " .
Which does n't exist .
Parodies , inevitably , followed : " Good Times will give you Dutch elm disease .
It will leave the toilet seat up .
It will make a batch of methamphetamine in your bathtub . "
But , even today , people fall for similar emails in their millions .
Ditto with get - rich - quick schemes ; we all know that a surprising number of people are happy to send off money in brown envelopes if they think it 'll make them a quick buck .
A chap called Dave Rhodes – if indeed he exists at all – used an email known as " Make Money Fast " to dangle the possibility of pocketing $ 50,000 in 60 days in return for sending out $ 5 in cash to complete strangers .
Needless to say , this unmissable 1 million per cent investment opportunity did n't work ; all that happened in 60 days was that you lost $ 5 worth of your self - esteem .
Pranksters will always play on the gullibility of the majority by setting up hoax websites such as the Online Pregnancy Test ( see below ) and other sites have achieved greatness and won awards purely because they push the boundaries of satire to the point where it starts to be believed by people .
The Onion ( theonion.com ) blazed a trail in this regard : the Danish television station TV2 was actually taken in by a spoof news story that The Onion ran a few years back , with the headline " Sean Penn Demands To Know What Asshole Took seanpenn@gmail.com " .
Part of the fun , of course , is being in on the joke ; we desperately want to be part of the savvy group who can look upon the poor , confused idiots who have been taken in with a degree of smugness and self - satisfaction .
But that desperation has led to the cry of " Fake ! " being heard everywhere .
The " comments culture " of websites these days makes it a piece of cake to accuse people of fakery , and you see it all over the internet – from videos of sleight - of - hand ( " Fake ! " ) to first - person accounts of alien abduction ( " Fake ! " ) , and from previously unseen photos of terrorist atrocities ( " Fake ! " ) to claims of astounding success on gambling sites ( " Fake ! " ) .
There 's very little you can do when someone shouts " Fake ! " at you , other than say , " No , it 's true , really " – but by that time your detractor will long since have disappeared into the ether , along with his or her staunchly held beliefs .
They do n't seem to have grasped that shouting a highly sceptical " Fake ! " at everything does n't make them an independent , intelligent thinker – it actually means that they 've lost the ability to be sceptical about voices of scepticism .
The colossal popularity of conspiracy - theory websites should probably bear some of the blame for our confusion as to what 's real and what 's not .
It seems to be a badge of honour to suspect any " officially accepted " view of events , and on sites devoted to September 11 , the assassination of JFK or the Moon landings , you can see an incredibly skewed rationale for believing a piece of information , with all kinds of dubious sources being perceived as having the same weight .
You do n't have to have a balanced , rational argument to be taken seriously ; you just have to have an argument .
So we can see " proof " that Flight 93 did n't crash into a field on September 11 , and actually landed safely at Cleveland ; and that the London explosions on 7 July 2005 were actually caused by a power surge , with actors hired to play survivors and a demolition company brought in to make the whole thing look convincing .
And throughout these web pages , you will repeatedly see the word " truth " deployed in a range of eye - catching fonts .
If you decide that it 's the government accounts you believe , you are either a blinkered imbecile or , worse , part of the conspiracy .
In short , you can't win .
Scepticism , even cynicism , are healthy attitudes when you 're online .
But so is common sense – and if we deployed more of it , some of the most infamous hoax sites would never have become viral sensations .
But , while we know , deep down , that we should neither believe nor disbelieve everything we see online , there will always be examples that sneak under our radar ...
Psycho Ex -Girlfriend

Rambling answerphone messages from hysterical ex-partners are prime candidates for immediate deletion , even before you 've reached the bit that says , " To replay this message , press 1 , " but Mark McElwain rewound , replayed , recorded and immortalised 53 of them on a hugely popular website .
Voices of suspicion were raised when attempts to track down the jilted woman failed .
The website disappeared not long afterwards and , seven years on , no one really knows whether it was real or just an elaborate way of letting the world know that ladies just can't get enough of Mark McElwain .
The Secret Diary Of Steve Jobs
d95.com / fakesteve
The name of this blog should have dispelled any notions that it might be real , but it took months to unmask the hoaxer who brilliantly lampooned the egotistical reputation of Apple boss Steve Jobs .
It was n't until a book manuscript started circulating that it was revealed to be journalist Dan Lyons – not an Apple insider , as had been thought , but someone who actually had to go out and buy books and biographies to do his research .
" My plan at this time is to live forever and to remain in charge here , " wrote Fake Steve back in July 2007 , " though perhaps with fewer restrictions on my power .
The truth is , I am not human – I am a man - god , son of Zeus . "

Genochoice does n't feel any urge to own up to being a joke , preferring instead to tease out any secretly held sub -Nazi views on eugenics from the site 's visitors , and allow them to believe for a fleeting moment that it would be possible to mail off a cheque to ensure that their son wo n't be blighted in later life by male - pattern baldness .
I mean , what right - thinking parents would n't be willing to cough up $ 5,875 to " cure " their as yet unborn child from its 98 per cent predisposition to homosexuality ?

Free Online Pregnancy Test
thepregnancytester.com
The net has revolutionised communication , allowed us to buy goods and services from the supposed comfort of our own homes , and has placed a dizzying selection of pornography at our fingertips – so surely it can help us to find out if we are pregnant ?
Common sense should tell us that the medical scanning abilities of our computer screen are likely to be somewhat limited but , as this site appears towards the top of Google 's search results for " pregnancy test " , there 's no doubt that it has taken a few people in .
Note the very light grey writing tucked away in an obscure corner of the site that says , " It 's a joke , OK " , and maybe get yourself down to the chemist .
Pets ?
Or Food ?
petsorfood.com
You'd have thought , would n't you , that a site set up to sell unwanted pets as food – ready - to - eat hamsters , Doberman steaks , exotic Komodo dragons – would be identified instantly as a fake ?
And of course it 's fake – but that did n't stop debate raging as to its veracity among the wide - eyed and pea- brained at such hotbeds of radical thought as Yahoo !
Answers .
" Is there a way that we can delete the website ?
That would be a good idea , " says one upset animal lover .
" I emailed them about it , and apparently it is REAL ! " said another .

Catching Glasses On Your Face
d95.com/sunglasses
Flipping a cigarette from a pack and catching it in your mouth has finally been superseded as the epitome of cool ; the new trick is to catch a pair of shades that have been flung casually across the room squarely on the bridge of your nose .
How we 'd love to believe that this video is kosher , and that it 's a trick we could accomplish with a few hours of practice , during which we'd only occasionally be stabbed in the left eye by one of the arms .
Sadly , it 's a very neatly executed trick involving reversed camera footage and , well , a piece of string .
See the full explanation here : d95.com/sunglasses2 .
History of a Victorian Era Robot
bigredhair.com/boilerplate
The discovery of evidence relating to Boilerplate , a prototypical robot built in the late 19th century from sheets of iron , pistons and grease , would have been an important moment for historians everywhere had it not been dreamt up by artists Anina Bennett and Paul Guinan .
Again , the facts relating to Boilerplate 's pivotal role in the Mexican Revolution should have ensured that no one was taken in ; but apparently Guinan receives emails from students asking about Boilerplate 's means of propulsion , and the robot even appeared in a novel , The Shroud of the Thwacker , after some less than diligent research on the part of the author .
Neiman - Marcus Cookie
d95.com/ cookie
The story goes like this : after enjoying some cookies in the cafeteria of her local Neiman - Marcus department store , a woman asked the waitress for the cookie recipe and was told it would cost " two - fifty " .
After discovering that she had been billed $ 250 instead of the $ 2.50 she expected , the customer took revenge by emailing the recipe to all her friends , urging them to spread it far and wide and " stick it to the man " .
Thing is , Neiman - Marcus never had a cookie recipe ( although they have developed one since , in a savvy marketing ploy ) and the $ 250 cookie recipe is merely a cookie recipe .
Although it has become the most famous cookie recipe in the world as a result – no mean feat .
Hot Tub Accident
d95.com/hottub
Some virals can't help but furrow brows and trigger debates .
This clip of a woman having what you might term an " accident " in a hot tub is too slick to be real .
But why would anyone spend time and money setting up a scene of someone defecating in a whirlpool bath ?
Are they trying to sell us something ?
What , for goodness ' sake ?
Anti-diarrhoea tablets ?
Surely not hot tubs ?
Home insurance ?
Is it a film trailer ?
Or what ?
Landover Baptist church
landoverbaptist.org
It 's not that difficult to satirise the views of far - right Christian fundamentalists such as Fred Phelps ( he of " God Hates Fags " fame ) , but to keep it up for as long as Chris Harper has , creating the ludicrous persona of Pastor Deacon Fred Smith and regularly delivering mock sermons that are posted on YouTube , shows true dedication to the atheist cause .
Harper succeeds in provoking fury across the board , from left - wingers who do n't get the joke and berate him for his extreme views , to right - wingers who realise that they 're being savagely mocked ; but the million visitors a month the site receives surely proves that it 's working for some people .
So Who Can I Believe ?
snopes.com
Named after an irksome family in the novels of William Faulkner , this is a renowned myth - busting , rumour - scotching website that 's the first place to go when you want tall tales denied or , more rarely , confirmed .
The layout might be hamfisted , decidedly 2001 , and long due an overhaul , but the information is extensive , meticulously researched and entertainingly written .
Was Houdini really killed by an unexpected punch to the stomach ?
It would seem not .
Is Michael Jackson 's phone number contained within the barcode of the album Thriller ?
Of course it is n't – but that has n't stopped hundreds of people dialling it on the off - chance ; if they 'd gone to Snopes first , they could have saved themselves a few cents and a few seconds of embarrassment .
The site was founded by husband and wife team Barbara Hamel and David Mikkelson , who first met online in a discussion forum dedicated to urban myths , folklore and debunking stories of questionable origin .
The strength of the site is that it 's level - headed , completely unhysterical and considers each story purely on the evidence available .
And it 's certainly not hellbent on dismissing every possible rumour that circulates – although , in the internet age , more will be baloney than not ; it just provides a simple colour - coding of true , false or undetermined , along with references to information sources .
When you see online forums full of tedious speculation on a topic , Snopes comes as a welcome relief because you know you 'll be told it straight .
Having said that , some people inevitably think that Barbara and David are part of some evil New World Order .
But hey , that 's the internet for you .

Dr. Marcus Heinrich Hermanns from the Department of Archaeology at the University of Cologne has recovered three lead bars which may originate from the third century before Christ , 39 meters under the sea off the north coast of Ibiza .
One of the bars has Iberian characters on it .
According to the German Mining Museum in Bochum , the lead originates from the mines of Sierra Morena in southern Spain .
With the help of local volunteer divers , some of whom he also trained in crash courses in underwater archaeology financed by the local government , Dr. Hermanns examined the three lead bars .
A fourth specimen had already been found on an earlier occasion .
The characters on the upper surfaces of two of the four known bars are syllabary symbols from the script of Northeastern Iberian .
“ The characters must have been added to the metal before it had set , shortly after it had been cast , ” says the underwater archaeologist Dr. Hermanns , “ in which case , the characters are more likely to be related to production as opposed to commercial information . ”
The meaning of the characters has not yet been determined , however , the dating of the objects to the third century B.C. , i.e. the period of the Second Punic War , raises further questions .
The reason for this is that there is very little evidence for the downsizing of silver works in the Sierra Morena region for this period .
There is , however , evidence for this in the mining area around Cartagena in the eastern part of the Iberian Peninsula , i.e. the language area of Northeastern Iberian .
For this reason , scientists suspect that the raw lead was processed and branded in this area , before it was placed on board a freighter that was shipwrecked off the north coast of Ibiza .
The destination planned for the lead remains unknown .
The reason why the lead was transported from the Spanish mainland to the Balearic Islands , even though silver mines were in operation on the islands , has not been established .
During antiquity , lead was a by - product of silver mining and used mainly for coinage .
Dr. Hermanns therefore assumes that the lead was used as munitions for mercenaries provided by the Baleareans during antiquity .
Due to the dating of the lead , it would make sense that this was for the Second Punic War .
“ The examination of the recovered lead bars provides a further basing point for the examination of the pre-Roman metal industry in the western Mediterranean region , ” according to Dr. Hermanns , “ there have been some relevant discoveries in the past , however , it is very difficult to establish anything concrete with certainty , due to the research done so far . ”
This project was sponsored by the Fritz - Thyssen - Stiftung , Cologne .
Barack Obama is no Anglo- phile , said Ben Macintyre in the London Times .
Nor has he any reason to be .
It recently emerged that Obama ’s Kenyan grandfather , Hussein Onyango Obama , was imprisoned and tortured by colonial British authorities for two years during the 1950s , when the Mau Mau insurgency was rebelling against British rule .
Obama is far too sophisticated to have “ some knee - jerk anti-British attitude ” because of the long - ago treatment of a relative he never knew .
Yet Obama apparently feels little warmth toward Britain .
In his memoir , the British come across as “ ill - dressed , pasty - faced , and racially arrogant ; cramped , spotty , and joyless . ”
The Obama era , then , could pose an uncharacteristic challenge to British - U.S. relations .
We will have to interact with Obama based not on “ the glory of shared victory over evil in the Second World War , ” but on “ the more complicated history of decolonization . ”
It was certainly “ an inglorious chapter ” in British history , said TheTimes in an editorial .
All through the 1950s , the British authorities brought “ the full panoply of repression ” to bear in crushing the Mau Mau insurgency , including “ detention , compulsory registration , livestock seizure , reeducation measures , ” and the most brutal forms of torture , including pliers to the genitals .
According to Obama ’s paternal grandmother , “ Mama Sarah ” Onyango , her husband was whipped twice a day while in custody .
No wonder Obama is “ less than impressed ” with Britain .
Still , we know from his appointment of Hillary Clinton as secretary of state that he is “ magnanimous ” with former rivals .
“ Britain may yet be able to start afresh . ”
Let ’s face it , said Owen Bowcott in the London Guardian online , U.S. relations with Great Britain are not exactly at the top of Obama ’s to - do list .
With the global economy in free - fall and his country mired in two wars , Obama surely will not be “ fixated on extracting revenge from the U.K. ”
Britain ’s “ colonial sins ” are unlikely to “ pose a risk to our relationship with the soon - to - be most powerful person on Earth . ”
True enough , said Andrew Anthony in the London Observer .
But still , instead of wallowing in our guilt , let ’s learn from it .
The Obama family ’s experience demonstrates the horrors of imperialism .
“ Yet similar atrocities are being committed today in the name of anti-imperialism . ”
In Zimbabwe , President Robert Mugabe has driven his country into “ poverty , ruin , and disease ” while loudly boasting that he is guarding the people ’s independence from white rule .
In Sudan , leaders who have been charged by the International Criminal Court with crimes against humanity claim that the court is an agent of Western powers seeking to subjugate them .
In those cases , “ anti-imperialism is little more than an excuse for tyrants to visit misery and terror on their own populations . ”
If the West has learned anything from the experience of Hussein Onyango Obama and others like him , it will denounce all such abuse — no matter whom the perpetrator is .
Samsung Electronics has started mass production of 256G - byte solid - state drives , which could make their way into laptops in a few months , the company announced Thursday .
Solid - state drives , or SSDs , store data on flash memory chips and are often compared to hard drives , which store data on magnetic platters .
SSDs consume less power and have no moving parts , making them less vulnerable to failure compared to hard drives .
Growing adoption has erased initial concerns about SSD durability , but it has a lesser storage capacity and remains more expensive than hard drives .
The 256G - byte SSD is the highest - capacity to date for the consumer electronics market so this announcement is big for laptop users , said Gregory Wong , president of analyst firm Forward Insights .
Most laptops today that have SSDs have 128G - byte drives .
The new SSD is available now , a Samsung spokeswoman said .
She could not provide pricing information .
It could be about two months until the new SSDs are in laptops , Wong said .
Companies that use Samsung SSDs include Apple and Dell .
The new SSD doubles sequential data transfers compared to Samsung 's earlier SSDs , the company said .
It offers read rates of 220 M bytes per second and write rates of 200 M bytes per second .
Sequential data transfers occur when PCs are booted or large files are copied , for example , Wong said .
However , because most PC tasks are random rather than sequential it makes more sense to use random performance as a measure , Wong said , adding that random performance tends to suffer if the SSD is set up to measure sequential performance .
Samsung could n't immediately provide the measurements of the SSD 's random read and write cycle .
Users may initially pay a premium for the new SSD , Wong said .
Potential buyers might also compare prices and realize that hard - drive capacities are increasing while prices are dropping and that could hinder adoption of Samsung 's 256G - byte SSD .
" Even with NAND flash prices coming down , there will be a sequential premium compared to hard - disk drives , " Wong said , with the new SSD costing more .
For an industry that many people wo n't admit they 've ever patronized , pornography has had an amazing impact on virtually every new medium , from cave painting to photography .
Dirty pictures have been credited with ensuring the future of the VCR , boosting cable TV subscriptions , helping to kill off the Betamax and HD DVD formats , and ( perhaps most important ) driving the growth of the Internet .
In fact , the adult entertainment industry has been on top of many of the Net 's most crucial tech innovations -- but not because it invented any of them .
According to Lewis Perdue , author of Eroticabiz : How Sex Shaped the Internet , " without business and technical pioneers in the online sex business , the World Wide Web would never have grown so big so quickly . "
( Not that we think size matters . )
The innovations happen because porn is " an ecosystem in which participants are willing -- indeed forced -- to experiment , and where experimentation is n't hobbled by common sense , good taste , or bureaucracy , " says Bruce Arnold , principal of Caslon Analytics , a research and analysis firm from Braddon , Australia , that specializes in regulatory issues , demographics , social trends , and technologies .
In an industry notorious for erecting walls of secrecy , hard numbers are difficult to come by , and most evidence is anecdotal .
Still , it 's clear that the adult industry has helped shape the Internet as we know it today , even if it has also been at the forefront of a number of less savory innovations .
Let 's take a look at a not - entirely - dirty dozen .
1. Nice : Online Payment Systems

The next time you buy something at Amazon or another online retailer , marveling at the ease and security of e-commerce , do n't just thank Jeff Bezos , thank Richard Gordon .
In the mid-1990s Gordon founded Electronic Card Systems , which pioneered credit card transactions for a wide range of disreputable sites , according to the New York Times .
" While riches were being minted and squandered in the dot - com '90s , Gordon made a fortune by taking a commission for processing sales on a range of sites ... like ClubLove , which published the Pamela Anderson - Tommy Lee sex tape , " wrote the Times ' Brad Stone .
( Through his lawyer , Gordon officially denies having been involved with pornography , but Stone found more than a dozen current and former employees who suggested otherwise . )
According to Forrester Research , Web users spent about $ 1.3 billion on online porn in 1999 .
That represented about 8 percent of all Net commerce that year , and more money than people spent online on books or plane tickets .
Back then , it was the Internet 's leading industry .
By 2006 , however , Net porn was generating just $ 2.8 billion in revenues -- a much smaller piece of the online pie , which had grown to $ 150 to $ 200 billion .
Richard Gordon also owns a Web design firm that created sites for the American Bible Society - - or at least it did so until Stone contacted the ABS last May -- proving that Gordon could swing both ways .
2. Naughty : Spam
Artwork : Chip Taylor
The sex industry did n't invent spam , but it provided ample proof of just how profitable a spam - driven business could be .
In the late 1990s countless daily come-ons for porn sites were a fact of life for most people with an inbox .
Between 2001 and 2002 , adult - oriented spam rose by 450 percent , according to Cyber Atlas .
By April 2003 , one out of every five spam messages sent were for adult sites .
However , by October 2008 , that number had shrunk to a puny 2 percent , according to Symantec 's State of Spam report [ PDF ] , eclipsed by unsolicited offers for loans , pills , and other spam scams .
3. Nice : Streaming Content
Before CNN.com or YouTube started filling the Internet with streaming video , X - rated sites were pumping out videos of adult stars doing what comes naturally ( or not ) , over and over and over .
In a May 2001 interview with NPR , Danni Ashe ( pictured ) , founder of seminal softcore site Danni's Hard Drive , noted that " the adult entertainment industry was the first to use streaming JPEG push video , which was video that worked ... in the browser and did n't require a plug - in .
I think as an industry we tend to jump in a little bit faster and tweak the technology and try to get it to work faster . "
In 2003 , Acacia Research sued dozens of porn sites for allegedly violating its patents on streaming video .
The patent portfolio company sued the pornsters in part because they were easy targets , but also because that 's where most of the video action was .
Subsequently Acacia got around to securing licenses from Disney , the New York Times , and other less titillating video streamers .
" Without programming pioneers trying to perfect video streaming software that would deliver images of copulation and procreation to paying customers hooked up with a 28.8 kbps dial - up modem , it is unlikely that CNN would be effectively delivering news clips of global breaking news , " wrote Lewis Perdue in Eroticabiz .
Snus is being used from the past time .
It is a type of oral ingestion tobacco and does not require smoking .
For those who eagerly want to quit smoking and finding a substitute , this tobacco would be the best to try .
However , it also includes some health risks with it but apart less than smoking .
The product contains dissolved nicotine that is addictive .
It is available in different varieties in the market .
One can use this product to smoke tobacco , such as camel sticks , cigarettes , camel orbs , etc .
Snus is generally put into the mouth in between the lips and gums .
The nicotine present in it thus acts on gums ’ blood vessels and provides the feeling of sensation .
The tobacco is sold in round tins apart from loosely packed teabags that are used earlier .
The best way to quit smoking is to switch to any other addictive nicotine product .
Nowadays , the majority of smokers are using Snus as an alternative tobacco sensation .
The tobacco is available in two forms that are loose and packed .
Mainly the loose one is manufactured for villages and construction workers .
It is easy to use and can be carried comfortably .
Nowadays , tobacco - free Snus is also available as the substitute for original Snus .
Check out the manufacturing process of smokeless Snus tobacco .
The product is quite different from other oral tobacco , as it involves dissolved nicotine indigents .
The preparation of good quality Snus includes three essential processes that include grinding , preparation , and packaging of products .
Moving further , let ’s discuss all three steps , one by one in detail .
PHNOM PENH ( Reuters ) - A 19 - year old Cambodian man has survived the H5N1 bird flu virus which has killed seven other people in the poor Southeast Asian nation since 2005 , a health ministry official said on Sunday .
The youth , who became infected after eating dead poultry , was discharged from a Phnom Penh hospital on Saturday after being treated for 10 days , Ly Sovann , deputy director of communicable disease control department , said .
“ He left safe and sound , ” Ly Sovann told Reuters .
Cambodia began culling poultry near its capital last week , and ordered a three - month ban on poultry being moved from the province of Kandal , 50 km ( 30 miles ) south of Phnom Penh , after tests confirmed it was hit by the deadly virus .
The young man , the eighth person in Cambodia to have contracted bird flu since its first case in 2005 , fell ill on November 28 but was only confirmed as having bird flu on Dec 11 .
All seven of Cambodia ’s previous human cases have died .
Since H5N1 resurfaced in Asia in 2003 it has killed more than 200 people in a dozen countries , according to the WHO .
Experts fear the constantly mutating H5N1 virus could change into a form easily transmitted from person to person and potentially kill millions worldwide .
The lawsuits are ending .
It 's about time .
According to the Wall Street Journal , the recording industry has halted its mass litigation campaign against music fans for Internet file - sharing , a campaign that has targeted more than 35,000 Americans over more than 5 years ( for a complete history of the lawsuits , see our RIAA v. The People white paper ) .
Ending the lawsuit campaign is long overdue .
The campaign has been , by any measure , a failure .
The lawsuits have not reduced unauthorized file - sharing and have not gotten a single artist paid .
But the news today is not all good .
First , the recording industry will continue to press the thousands of pending lawsuits , presumably pushing for the usual four figure settlements .
How is it going to feel to be the last college student to settle in a fight that the recording industry has now admitted is n't worth the candle ?
More troubling is the news that the RIAA is pressuring U.S. ISPs into adopting some sort of " 3 strikes " approach , similar to those it 's been seeking in Europe ( see , e.g. , the French " digital guillotine " proposal ) .
According the the Wall Street Journal article :
[ T ]he Recording Industry Association of America said it plans to try an approach that relies on the cooperation of Internet - service providers .
The trade group said it has hashed out preliminary agreements with major ISPs under which it will send an email to the provider when it finds a provider 's customers making music available online for others to take .
Depending on the agreement , the ISP will either forward the note to customers , or alert customers that they appear to be uploading music illegally , and ask them to stop .
If the customers continue the file - sharing , they will get one or two more emails , perhaps accompanied by slower service from the provider .
Finally , the ISP may cut off their access altogether .
This means more music fans are going to be harassed by the music industry .
As Wired 's Elliot Van Buskirk points out :
Due process has been prohibitively expensive for the RIAA .
The organization has long sought a more efficient way to exert pressure on suspected file sharers , and these new agreements will grant it that wish , saving it money and allowing it to pressure far more suspected file sharers , all without filing a single subpoena .
The recording industry 's efforts to push " 3 strikes " legislation in Europe have been definitively rejected by the European Parliament and by Sweden .
While UK ISPs have agreed to send notices for rightsholders , they 've stopped short of automatic Internet disconnection .
This leaves France as the sole European aberration .
The problem is the lack of due process for those accused .
In a world where hundreds of thousands ( or millions ) of copyright infringement allegations are automatically generated and delivered to ISPs , mistakes are going to be made ( just look at the innocents , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , who were swept into the RIAA litigation machine ) .
Anyone who has ever had to fight to correct an error on their credit reports will be able to imagine the trouble we 're in for .
And being added to a nation - wide " Internet blacklist " — like that in the pending French legislation — is a disproportionate punishment , even for those who are " caught " file sharing .
By conservative estimates , 1 in 5 American Internet users is an active file - sharer .
Does the recording industry really think that banning 20 % of Americans from the Internet is the right answer ?
Do ISPs ?
Or will the millions of ISP " warnings " just give rise to more encrypted and anonymized file - sharing mechanisms , all the while getting no artists paid ?
We still need a better way forward , that legalizes file - sharing and gets artists paid .
So , while today 's news is long - overdue , the more interesting development is the recording industry 's recent willingness to discuss collective licensing with universities .
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The global financial crisis could have been avoided if every country had had a banking system like Canada ’s , the governor of the Bank of Canada said on Saturday .
Asked in a BBC interview if the world could have been spared the crisis if everyone had had a banking system “ as sober and sensible ” as Canada ’s , Mark Carney said : “ Yes , I think , is the short answer . ”
“ What we did was that we had an absolute restriction on how much leverage , how much borrowing our banks could do , ” he said .
“ They did n’t like that and they would come in and complain about it regularly because it was stopping them from doing some of the sexier things that their international competitors were doing .
But it turns out some of the sexier things that they were doing were quite foolish , ” he told the BBC World Service .
Canada has the soundest banking system in the world , according to the World Economic Forum .
However , Canada reinforced its banking sector with loan guarantees last month in a bid to mute the impact of a global financial crisis that is forecast to push the country to the edge of recession .
Banks that had got into difficulties had “ short - circuited some of the very basic aspects of banking , ” Carney said .
They had relied on other people to make judgments about loans or felt that as long as they could get rid of a “ hot potato ” loan quickly it did not matter , he said .
“ Well , the music stopped eventually ( and ) they still had it .
And because they had it in such size , it has been a very painful process to work that out , ” he said .
Bankers who had not been on top of their business were gone or going , Carney said .
“ There is vicious natural selection going on right now in the financial services industry and it ’s appropriate . ”
The crisis would probably reinforce the rebalancing of global economic power that had already gathered pace this decade , he said .
“ Financial systems in Asia are likely to do relatively better through this period than the financial systems in the West who have some restructuring to do .
But it ’s a healthy thing to have economic growth spread more widely , ” he said .
Time for a change ?
Apple and the enterprise — two words that have historically gone together like peanut butter and cheese curds .
For much of its history , the computer - cum - iPhone maker has been on the outside of enterprise computing looking in .
In fact , it 's debatable how much Apple was even looking in .
The company has shown little interest in doing what is necessary to woo corporate IT departments and make its case to CIOs .
When I visited the topic of Apple and the enterprise a bit over five years ago , I concluded that Apple had a long , long way to go in order to get its foot in the door .
At the time , Mac OS X was still relatively immature , a lot of business software was n't yet running native on Apple 's newest OS , and its machines stood out like sore thumbs among the x86 beige boxes with their PowerPC processors .
But nowadays , my , how things have changed .
Apple now has Intel Inside .
A larger number of business - oriented apps like Microsoft Office and Lotus Notes now run on Mac OS X , and the increasing number of web applications make the operating system an afterthought for many users .
The iPhone is not only the sexiest smartphone around , it 's one of the most popular .
Most importantly , Macs can do Windows , either through Boot Camp or virtualization .
So times have definitely changed , but have they changed enough to get Apple anything more than a toehold into the enterprise ?
Some new data from the Information Technology Intelligence Corp . shows that all of these factors have had an impact on Apple 's enterprise uptake .
ITIC surveyed 700 IT managers and executives and discovered that 80 percent of the respondents had Macs in their corporate environment .
Half of those taking the survey said they were ramping up their iPhone integration over and against the popular BlackBerry .
And around 30 percent of them are running Windows on their Macs via virtualization products such as VMware Fusion and Parallels Desktop .
Still , a stroll through your average cubicle farm turns up little other than Dells , HPs , and other commodity boxes .
Is that going to change anytime soon ?
Not in a meaningful way .
There are definitely some opportunities present , but Apple still seems disinclined to follow up on them .
Forces working in Apple 's favor
There are three Important trends right now that are giving Apple a foot in the enterprise door : the consumerization of IT , Microsoft 's botched Vista launch , and the increasing popularity and visibility of Apple products , especially the iPhone .
In October , Citrix decided to give its employees a $ 2,100 stipend so that they could purchase a laptop of their choice to use for business and home .
Other companies are taking similar steps , and with Apple 's US market share growing steadily , consumers who have become accustomed to having a Mac at home are now getting the chance to bring them to work .
Mac OS
X plays nicely in mixed environments , and the vast majority of Windows - running mission - critical apps can easily be accommodated via virtualization solutions .
If IT consumerization takes off as some expect , it 's going to open the door even wider for Apple .
Still , it 's not going to open the floodgates .
The video from Discovery 's " Science Channel " summarizes the story of the Citicorp Center , which underwent major structural retrofits barely a year after its completion , when the architect , William LeMessurier , realized that a design flaw could lead to the building 's collapse in a strong wind .
The truth only became known to the public nearly twenty years later , in a 1995 article that appeared in New Yorker magazine entitled " The Fifty - Nine - Story Crisis " ...
How would you write a fast , internally synchronized queue , one that callers can use without any explicit external locking or other synchronization ?
Let us count the ways ... or four of them , at least , and compare their performance .
We 'll start with a baseline program and then successively apply three optimization techniques , each time stopping to measure each change 's relative performance for queue items of different sizes to see how much each trick really bought us .
All versions of the code we 'll consider have one thing in common :
They control concurrency using ( the equivalent of ) two spinlocks , one for each end of the queue .
Our goal in refining the code is to allow separate threads calling Produce and / or Consume to run as concurrently as possible , while also improving scalability to get more total throughput through the queue when we use larger numbers of producer and / or consumer threads .
I 'll analyze the throughput of each version of the code by varying three values :
The number of producer threads .
In my test harness , each producer thread is a tight loop that calls Produce with no other work .
with no other work .
The number of consumers .
Each consumer thread is a tight loop that calls Consume with no other work .
with no other work .
The size of the queued objects : I 'll test queues of objects of two different sizes " small " and " large " objects that each contain 10 and 100 strings , respectively , of length 26 characters , so that enqueueing or dequeueing an object costs 10 or 100 deep string copies .
This actually lets us accomplish two things : a ) to measure how performance depends on the size and copying cost of the queued objects ; and b ) to indirectly simulate the performance effect of how much " other work " the producer and consumer threads may be doing on real - world workloads , which do n't usually call Produce and Consume in tight loops that just throw away the values without using them .
Let 's dive in .
Example 1 : Baseline
The baseline program is adapted from the code in [ 1 ] by adding a spinlock on each end of the queue to allow only one producer and one consumer to update the queue at a time .
We will allow some concurrency among producer threads because the producer spinlock does n't cover the entire body of the Produce function , but we will allow only one call to Consume to run at a time .
This code follows the policy in [ 1 ] that only producer threads ever actually change the queue ; consumed nodes are n't freed by the consumer , but are lazily cleaned up by the next producer .
The contained objects are held by value :
// Example 1 : Baseline code // template < typename T > struct LowLockQueue { private : struct Node { Node( T val ) : value ( val ) , next ( nullptr ) { } T value ; atomic < Node *> next ; } ;
The control variables include pointers to the first and last nodes in the underlying list , and a pointer to a divider element that marks the boundary between the producer and consumer :
Node * first , * last ; // for producer only atomic < Node *> divider ; // shared atomic < bool > producerLock ; // shared by producers atomic < bool > consumerLock ; // shared by consumers
Note that , as described in [ 1 ] , we always maintain at least one dummy node at the front , so the first unconsumed node is actually the one after divider .
Any nodes before divider are already consumed nodes that can be lazily freed by the next producer .
The constructor sets up that invariant , and the destructor ( in Java or .NET , the disposer ) simply walks the list to free it :
public : LowLockQueue ( ) { first = divider = last = new Node ( T( ) ) ; producerLock = consumerLock = false ; } ~ LowLockQueue ( ) { while ( first != nullptr ) { Node * tmp = first ; first = tmp -> next ; delete tmp ; } }
Consume copies the value contained in the first unconsumed node to the caller and updates divider to mark that the node has been consumed .
Note that the entire body of Consume is inside the critical section , which means we get no concurrency among consumers in this version of the code :
bool Consume ( T& result ) { while ( consumerLock.exchange( true ) ) { } // acquire exclusivity if ( divider -> next != nullptr ) { // if queue is nonempty result = divider -> next -> value ; // copy it back to the caller divider = divider -> next ; // publish that we took an item consumerLock = false ; // release exclusivity return true ; // and report success } consumerLock = false ; // release exclusivity return false ; // queue was empty }
Produce allocates a new node and adds it to the tail of the list , then performs the lazy cleanup of consumed nodes at the front of the list , if any .
Note that not all of the body of Produce is inside the exclusive critical section many producers can concurrently be allocating their new nodes and copying their new item 's value into them , which allows some concurrency among producers :
bool Produce ( const T& t ) { Node * tmp = new Node ( t ) ; // do work off to the side while ( producerLock.exchange ( true ) ) { } // acquire exclusivity last -> next = tmp ; // publish the new item last = last -> next ; // ( more about this later ) while ( first != divider ) { // lazy cleanup Node * tmp = first ; first = first -> next ; delete tmp ; } producerLock = false ; // release exclusivity return true ; } } ;
How well would you expect this version of the code to scale for different numbers of producers and consumers , or for different kinds of queued objects ?
Let 's find out .
Measuring Example 1
Figure 1 shows the results of running Example 1 using different numbers of producer and consumer threads , and the two sizes of queued objects .
The larger the circle , the better the throughput ; and each graph has a corner note showing the " max " ( largest circle ) and " min " ( smallest circle ) values on that graph .
Note the size of each circle represents the relative throughput for that graph only ; in this example , even the smallest result on the left - hand graph ( where the minimum value is 18,700 objects moved through the queue per second , where each object contains 10 strings ) is better than the largest circle on the right - hand graph ( 11,300 objects per second , where each object contains 100 strings ) .
This test already illustrates four important properties to consider for parallel throughput .
The first key property is overall throughput , or the total amount of work the system is able to accomplish .
Here , we can move up to 88,000 small objects or 11,300 objects through the Example 1 queue every second .
The second key property is scalability , or the ability to use more cores to get more work done .
For both sizes of queued objects , Example 1 is n't very scalable at all :
We get our best throughput at two producers and one consumer , and adding more producers and consumers does n't get more objects through the queue .
[ Click image to view at full size ]
The third key property is contention , or how much different threads interfere with each other by fighting for resources .
The small - object case ( left graph ) shows acute contention , because total throughput drops dramatically when more producers and / or consumers are addedeven when those producers and consumers are running on otherwise - idle cores , which unfortunately is a great example of negative scalability .
For larger queued objects , the problem is still visible but much less acute ; throughput does not drop off as rapidly , at least not until we get to the dashed line .
Incidentally , speaking of that dashed line , I never described the hardware I used to run these tests .
If you 've been wondering about how many cores were available on my test machine , you can read the answer off the right - hand graph :
The dashed line where we see a major performance cliff is where # consumers + # producers = 24 , the number of CPU cores on the test system .
The right - hand graph 's diagonal dropoff is a classic artifact of the fourth key property , the cost of oversubscription , or having more CPU - bound work ready to execute than available hardware to execute it .
Clearly , we can't scale to more cores than actually exist on a given machine , but there can be a real cost to exceeding that number .
In this example , especially when more than half the available threads are producers , oversubscription causes a dramatic increase in churn and contention and loss of overall system throughput .
In this test case , a larger number of consumers had less effect , as illustrated by the " spillover " across the top part of the graph .
Let 's see if we can improve total throughput and scalability , while driving down contention and the cost of oversubscription .
The Nag Hammadi Library , a collection of thirteen ancient books ( called " codices " ) containing over fifty texts , was discovered in upper Egypt in 1945 .
This immensely important discovery includes a large number of primary " Gnostic Gospels " – texts once thought to have been entirely destroyed during the early Christian struggle to define " orthodoxy " – scriptures such as the Gospel of Thomas , the Gospel of Philip , and the Gospel of Truth .
The discovery and translation of the Nag Hammadi library , initially completed in the 1970's , has provided impetus to a major re-evaluation of early Christian history and the nature of Gnosticism .
For an introduction to the Nag Hammadi discovery and the texts in this ancient library , we offer several resources .
First , read an excerpt from Elaine Pagels ' excellent popular introduction to the Nag Hammadi texts , The Gnostic Gospels .
Then , for an overview of the Gnostic scriptures and a discussion of ancient Gnosis , read this excerpt from Dr. Marvin Meyer 's introduction to The Gnostic Bible .
For another brief general overview , we offer an Introduction to Gnosticism and the Nag Hammadi Library by Lance Owens .
For further reading , The Gnostic Society Library Bookstore provides a selection of the foremost books on the Nag Hammadi library and Gnostic tradition .
Texts in the Collection :
All the texts discovered at Nag Hammadi are available in the Gnostic Society Library ; the collection is indexed in alphabetical order , and by location in the original codices .
A subject categorized list of the writings is also given below .
You may search the entire collection of texts for keywords or phrases using our custom Nag Hammadi Search function .
We have special collections of resources dealing with two particularly important texts , the Gospel of Thomas , and The Secret Book ( Apocryphon ) of John .
Several introductory lectures on the Nag Hammadi materials are provided , below .
For many of the major writings in the Nag Hammadi collection more than one translation is provided in our library ; where multiple translations are made available , we have listed the translators ' names in parenthesis below the name of the scripture .
Many of these translations are based on the work originally sponsored by the Coptic Gnostic Library Project of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity , Claremont , California .
Several prominent scholars have granted us permission to present their original translations of Nag Hammadi texts here in the Gnostic Society Library .
We are particular indebted to the assistance and contributions of Dr. Willis Barnstone , Dr. John Turner , Dr. Stevan Davies , and the late Dr. Marvin Meyer .
Copyright information is given with the various translations in the library ; contributors to this collection retain all copyright to their works .
The International Edition of The Nag Hammadi Scriptures ( published in 2007 , edited by Marvin Meyer ) provides authoritative translations for all of the Nag Hammadi texts , along with introductions and notes on the translations .
We also highly recommend The Gnostic Bible , edited by Willis Barnstone and Marvin Meyer ; this comprehensive volume includes excellent introductory material and provides beautiful translations for the most important Nag Hammadi scriptures .
In preview , we provide an excerpt from Dr. Marvin Meyer 's introduction to The Gnostic Bible .
Other important primary Gnostic texts – ancient writings discovered in the century before the recovery of the Nag Hammadi Library , including texts like the Gospel of Mary – are cataloged in the Classical Gnostic Scriptures section of the The Gnostic Society Library .
Many scriptures in the Nag Hammadi collection were influence by Valentinus ( c. 100 – 160 AD ) and his tradition of Gnosis .
Due to his importance , we have a large section of the library dedicated specifically to Valentinus and the Valentinian Tradition .
If you would like to see the ancient manuscripts themselves , digital images of the original Nag Hammadi Codices are available online at the Claremont Colleges Digital Library .
A voter - approved law prohibiting sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of a school or a park amounts to additional punishment for the offenders ' original crimes , a state appeals court has ruled in a case that could affect thousands of parolees .
The ruling Wednesday by the Fourth District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana was the first by a California court to find that the residency restrictions in Proposition 83 , a November 2006 initiative , are not just public safety measures but also would punish ex-offenders by forcing them out of their homes .
Prop. 83 , called Jessica 's
Law by its sponsors , imposes " traditional banishment under another name , " the court said .
The ruling leaves the law in effect but could limit its application .
The U.S. Constitution forbids laws that retroactively impose criminal penalties or increase punishment for past offenses .
A lawyer for four men who are challenging Prop. 83 before the state Supreme Court said Thursday that the ruling should prevent the state from imposing the residency restrictions on parolees who committed sex crimes before the ballot measure passed .
The attorney , Ernest Galvan , said the state now is applying the 2,000 - foot buffer zone requirement to any former sex offender who has been paroled since Prop. 83 passed , even if the parolee committed a sex crime many years earlier and was serving a sentence for an unrelated crime .
He said at least 2,000 parolees fall into that category , and the number is growing by hundreds each month .
" You can't criminalize conduct after it 's already happened , can't increase the punishment , because everyone 's entitled to notice of what 's criminal now , " Galvan said .
Lisa Page , spokeswoman for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , said the administration is reviewing the ruling .
" The governor strongly supports Jessica 's Law and keeping families and children safe , " she said .
Prop. 83 , approved by 70 percent of the voters , increased sentences for various sex crimes and also barred all registered sex offenders - whose crimes range from forcible rape to indecent exposure - from living within 2,000 feet of a school or park where children regularly gather .
State law previously prohibited only convicted child molesters from living within a quarter - mile of a school .
Prop. 83 makes most densely populated areas of California off limits to paroled sex criminals , including nearly all of San Francisco .
The state initially sought to apply the residency restrictions to all 90,000 registered sex offenders in California , but federal judges ruled that it did not cover anyone paroled before Prop. 83 passed .
In the case pending before the state Supreme Court , the four parolees say the residency restrictions are an unconstitutional retroactive punishment and an unreasonable parole condition .
They say the limits should be applied only to those who committed crimes against children .
In Wednesday 's ruling , the appeals court overturned the residency restrictions on an Anaheim man , Steven Lloyd Mosley , who was convicted in 2007 of assaulting a 12 - year - old girl four years earlier but acquitted of committing a lewd act .
The trial judge nevertheless concluded that Mosley had committed a sex crime , ordered him to register with police as a sex offender and barred him from living within 2,000 feet of a school or park .
In a 3 - 0 ruling , the court said the judge 's order would have been valid if the Prop. 83 requirements were simply nonpunitive measures to protect the public .
But because they have an " overwhelmingly punitive effect , " the court said , they can be imposed only after a jury trial and conviction for a sex crime .
That also means the restrictions can't be applied retroactively .
The law forces many parolees to leave their homes and leaves them under " constant threat of ouster " from their new residences if a new school or park opens nearby , said Justice Raymond Ikola .
Mr Strauss - Kahn said the IMF would again lower its global growth projection More spending by governments will be needed to stimulate worldwide economic growth , the head of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has told the BBC .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn said he feared measures announced by the Group of 20 nations last month would not be enough .
The IMF has already cut its forecast for global growth next year , and he said the next projection , due in January , would be even worse .
Mr Strauss - Kahn spoke of " 2009 as really being a bad year " .

" I 'm specially concerned by the fact that our forecast , already very dark ... will be even darker if not enough fiscal stimulus is implemented , " he said in an interview with BBC Radio 4 .
' Less bad solution '
He said it would take a spending stimulus equivalent to about 2 % of global Gross Domestic Product , or about $ 1.2 trillion ( £ 800 bn ) , to make a real difference .
He added that given the choice between increasing the deficit and not fighting the recession , he favoured the " less bad solution " .
HAVE YOUR SAY
One of the first things that has to be done is restore honesty and ethics to financial markets Brian Hind , USA He described European Central Bank chief Jean - Claude Trichet 's warning that eurozone governments must keep a lid on borrowing as " noble " .
" He 's the head of the central bank - it's his job to say things like that , " Mr Strauss Kahn said .
" We are in the biggest crisis we have experienced for 60 or 70 years and we have to take that into account , " he added .
In November , the IMF lowered its global economic growth forecast to 2.2 % from 3 % .
In the BBC interview , Mr Strauss - Kahn was asked about the level of debt in the UK - 44.2 % of GDP .
Shaun Ley , of BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend , asked Mr Strauss - Kahn : " Markets seem to have made their own judgements about this : it is cheaper to get insurance against big multinationals like BP and McDonald 's defaulting than it is to get insurance against UK government bonds going under .
That is quite disturbing , is n't it , when a country is viewed in that way ? "
" Yes , it is , " Mr Strauss - Kahn said .
" That is a good example of the fact that we are facing something which is almost unknown . "
Last week , Mr Strauss - Kahn said the IMF could cut its 2009 forecast for China to around 5 % amid an " unprecedented " global slowdown .

( CNN ) --
Seven members of the Mexican military were found inside the United States on Friday , telling border agents they had become disoriented while on patrol and accidentally crossed into the country , the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol said .
The incident began about 8 a.m. Friday , when the Border Patrol 's Yuma , Arizona , sector was notified that a military - style Hummer was broken down , Customs and Border Patrol said in a written statement .
Agents said they found the vehicle about 200 yards from the Colorado River , and the seven individuals were dressed in military - style clothing .
Customs and Border Patrol later determined that the troops ' entry was unauthorized .
U.S. agents told the Mexican troops they were inside the United States and " peaceably " took them into custody , the statement said .
" At no time were any hostilities exchanged between the agents and military officials . "
Watch how Mexican troops found their way in the United States »
The Hummer was equipped with a turret - mounted machine gun , the Border Patrol said .
According to Customs and Border Patrol , the soldiers were assigned to the 23rd Regiment Motorized Cavalry of the Mexican Army .
The soldiers said they believed that they were still in Mexico because they remained on the south side of a newly constructed border fence .
" The soldiers , weapons and vehicle were placed in Border Patrol custody and transported to the CBP San Luis , Arizona , Port of Entry , where each of the subjects was processed in accordance with Border Patrol policy , " the statement said .
None of the seven had any criminal or immigration history , the agency said .
The soldiers , weapons and vehicle were repatriated and " remanded into the custody of their commanding officer , " the Border Patrol said .
The incident remains under investigation , however , and the Border Patrol 's Office of Internal Affairs was notified , the statement said .
" This is not an uncommon occurrence , " Rep. Tom Tancredo , R- Colorado , told CNN .
" Often times , it is the result of the Mexican military providing cover essentially for drug transportation across into our country , and / or creating a diversion so it will draw our people away from the place where the drugs are coming across . "
In August , the Border Patrol said Mexican troops had crossed the border illegally 42 times since October 2007 .
Tancredo said the U.S. State Department lodged a complaint with the Mexican government for the first time over the military incursions a few weeks ago .
Attempts to contact the State Department and the Mexican government Friday were unsuccessful .
CNN 's Casey Wian contributed to this report .

I am not really in a position to say too much about role - playing in Japan because I did n’t get much chance to do any .
This is because , like in Australia , role - playing just is n’t a very well - known phenomenon there .
The Japanese computer game market is heavily crowded with some very role - playing - oriented computer games ( like the Final Fantasy series ) and there really is a lot to keep a young nerd occupied just with them .
Of course most of the foreign games would have to be translated , which is also something of a problem .
D&D has been , and there is a native game called Sword World which is popular with players , but there is n’t actually a big role - playing scene .
Since I lived in the country I was n’t exactly in a position to pursue it .
I wanted to play in a Japanese group before I left , in the Japanese language , but since I left 2 years before I was meant to , I was n’t quite ready for the experience language wise and I never got a chance to meet anyone .
I certainly knew lots of nerds , but many of them had never heard of fantasy role - playing ( even using the Japanese name , “ Table talk role - playing ” they still had n’t heard of it ) .
When she was teaching my partner occasionally mentioned my hobby to some of her more mature , more nerdy students , but she reported that most of them had n’t heard of it either .
Those that had thought it sounded too difficult , but none of them reported any kind of disapproval .
The general level of shyness Japanese people have , and their unwillingness to draw attention to themselves or their ideas , means that they do n’t respond warmly to the kind of environment role - playing represents – in that sense I think it ’s a very western kind of activity .
However , there are a lot of stereotypes about Japanese people ’s lack of initiative and imagination which get bandied about in connection with their unwillingness to present ideas publicly , and I think those stereotypes are quite shallow and untrue , so one should n’t confuse a Japanese person ’s unwillingness to join such a group environment with any such stereotype .
Certainly , though , I do think that the traits of diffidence and humility are strongly admired and treasured in Japanese society , and they are n’t compatible with a gaming environment where drunk nerds yell their actions in an imaginary world before an audience of their peers .
Given these combined factors – console game dominance , translation costs and shyness – it ’s no surprise that role - playing is not so popular here .
But if I go back ( not such a big if ) I will go to a major city , and then I shall have a better chance of finding out what Japanese RPGs and their players are all about .
Pakistani General Goes In - Depth On Details CNN Refused to Broadcast
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , December 10 , 2008
Former Pakistani ISI chief Hamid Gul appeared on the Alex Jones Show yesterday and shared his contention that the 9/11 attack was an inside job , laying out details that were censored during a CNN interview on the same subject last weekend .
Gul served as the director general of Pakistan ’s Inter Services Intelligence during 1987 - 89 and worked with the CIA in the covert war against the Soviets in Afghanistan , helping to train the U.S. - backed mujahideen .
During the CNN interview on Sunday , host Fareed Zakaria attacked Gul and claimed his opinions on 9/11 were “ thoroughly discredited , ” but the majority of the evidence he presented for 9/11 being a false flag attack was edited out by CNN bosses .
No such censorship took place during the interview yesterday as Gul got in depth on why he considered 9/11 to be a staged event .
Gul said that he first went public on who he thought was behind 9/11 UPI two weeks after the attacks , but that the report was blocked by the western news media .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The UPI interview with Gul remains online and in it he questions the delayed response to the hijackings by the U.S. Air Force .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
“ 9/11 took place on American soil , not a single person has been caught inside America even though for doing such a job I think a huge amount of logistic support is required in the area where such an operation is carried out , ” Gul told the Alex Jones Show , adding that fighter jets were scrambled in the opposite direction to where the hijacked planes were heading as the attack unfolded .
“ It is quite amazing that for a very long period of time the air traffic control did not report this nor did the U.S. Air Force act in time , ” said Gul , noting that fighters were scrambled from bases further away than where the hijacked planes were .
“ The time that it took was enormous , it was 120 minutes , a very long time in which to act – was the U.S. Air Force sleeping and if it was sleeping which heads were rolled ? ” asked Gul , adding that if the botched response was a mere intelligence failure then why was nobody disciplined or taken to task and why had nobody resigned .
“ The air traffic control should have been re-hashed , it should have been turned inside out , but nothing of the sort happened , ” said Gul .
Gul then questioned why standard operating procedure was not followed , stating , “ In the past within minutes the U.S. aircraft has been on the wing of the hijacked aircraft , in this case it did not happen , the U.S. alert system is so high and it is so sophisticated that if a missile was to take off from Moscow and was to head towards New York , the U.S. Air Force and the missile system is supposed to intercept it within nine minutes ….
the system is in place but it did not work and nobody tried to question this . ”
Gul then highlighted the implausible proficiency of alleged Flight 77 lead hijacker Hani Hanjour , who according to his flight instructors could barely fly a Cessna yet supposedly pulled off maneuvers that crack military pilots would have difficulty achieving in order to hit the Pentagon .
“ The height ( of the plane ) was 9,000 ( feet ) and it came within seconds to a height of 1,000 and then went straight into its target , this is not possible for a person who has been trained on a light aircraft to be able to do this , ” said Gul .
Gul said that he routinely confronts American journalists about why they do not probe into 9/11 , and that they respond by telling Gul that the Patriot Act gets in the way and they are “ not supposed to ask such questions ” .
Gul said that as a result of 9/11 “ everything has gone wrong with the world ” and the motive behind the events being staged were largely geopolitical , and were used to exploit a window of opportunity for the U.S. to go into strategic areas where there was no U.S. presence before , as well as beating China in dominating the energy tap of the world , the middle east and south Asia .
Gul joins a raft of former government officials and intelligence heads in questioning 9/11 , the most recent of which was former Italian President Francesco Cossiga , who last December said that the attacks were carried out by elements of the CIA and Mossad .

Suge Knight is picking a nasty fight with Kanye West over a diamond earring -- 3 years after the broke - ass record mogul was shot and then allegedly robbed of his ice at one of Kanye 's parties .
Suge -- who recently filed for bankruptcy -- blames Kanye for allowing someone to smuggle a gun past security at West 's pre-MTV VMA party at The Shore Club in Miami back in 2005 , where an unknown person managed to shoot Suge in his upper right leg , shattering a bone .
According to the lawsuit filed on September 12 in US Bankruptcy Court in L.A. , Suge claims he did n't just lose blood -- he also lost a 15 - carat , $ 135,000 diamond stud earring inside the club during the incident -- and that too is Kanye 's fault .
Now Suge , who claims he was so hurt that he needed to take a private jet back from Miami , is suing for all his bullet wound - related expenses AND " for damages for the loss of use and enjoyment of the earring . "
But check this -- even though Suge is bankrupt , he 's worked out a deal with the Court that will allow him to keep a percentage of any dough he collects from the suit .
In my mind , the Christmas season does n't officially start until CBS shows A Charlie Brown Christmas .
Who out there does n't picture Snoopy dancing joyfully with his nose in the air whenever they hear the familiar strains of that jazzy piano music ?
Interestingly enough , this Christmas staple - the longest - running holiday special on TV - started out as an afterthought .
The Original Dog-umentary
Back in 1963 , TV producer Lee Mendelson had the idea to make a documentary film about cartoonist Charles Schulz and his popular Peanuts comic strip .
Schulz agreed , and collaborated with animator Bill Melendez to create two minutes of the first - ever animated Peanuts footage .
The rest of the special featured " Sparky " 
Schulz in his studio , driving his kids to school , and even bowling a few frames .
Songwriter Vince Guaraldi agreed to write some original music for the special , and the first composition he came up with was an incredibly catchy tune he called " Linus and Lucy . " 
The Peanuts documentary never sold , but one of the interested advertisers included Coca - Cola .
Executives from the soft drink giant asked Mendelson if he'd be interested in putting together an animated Peanuts Christmas special .
Within a few days , Mendelson and Schulz had the outline of a script ready , with notes like " sad Christmas tree , "  " school play , "  and " ice skating "  scribbled in the margins .
The " Lucy and Linus "  song was resurrected for use in a scene that featured the characters dancing at their play rehearsal , and a choir of children were gathered from a Bay Area ( California ) church to record vocals for " Hark ! The Herald Angels Sing . " 
Why Snoopy Gets all the Action Scenes
When it came to actually producing the special , Charlie Brown was truly a problem child .
Unlike most of the other characters , Chuck 's head was completely round , which made it difficult for the animators to turn and indicate movement from side to side .
Snoopy , on the other hand , was the easiest character to manipulate , which is why they had fun making him do everything from the jitterbug to impersonating a vulture .
The Blockheads at CBS Hate
It ( then change their minds )
When CBS executives previewed A Charlie Brown Christmas , they were vastly underwhelmed .
There was just so much wrong with it .
There was not enough action .
It moved too slow .
The voices had been done by real kids , not adult actors .
There was no laugh track .
And Linus read from the Gospel of Luke in one scene .
( " You ca n't read from the Bible on network television ! "  they declared in unison . )
At the end of the meeting , Mendelson was told : " Well , you gave it a good shot .
Believe me , we 're big Peanuts fans , but maybe it 's better suited to the comic page . " 
But CBS had made a commitment to their sponsor , so they aired the special as scheduled on December 9 , 1965 .
And , as often happens in the world of entertainment , the original gut reaction of the suits was completely wrong .
A Charlie Brown Christmas drew in 15.4 million viewers , placing it second in the ratings that week after Bonanza .
A few months later , Charles Schulz and Lee Mendelson found themselves onstage accepting an Emmy Award for Outstanding Children 's Program .
( See ? Christmas really is the season for miracles . )
A GROUP of about 50 cafes has signed up to do the unthinkable — ask Melburnians to pay for a glass of tap water .
- Cafes to charge for tap water
- Goal to make people water - wise
- Profit used for saving measures
Token sum : A group of Melbourne cafes will charge for tap water during Drink for Change .
The project , touted as a way to make people water - wise , is backed by the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and will run for a week from December 1 .
Money raised from a " token sum " charged during Drink for Change is to be used by the businesses to install water - saving measures , but it has raised concerns that it could be a softening - up step towards making charging for tap water an accepted practice .

What Saudi women can and cannot do [ American Bedu ]
A few years ago , I had some ideas about a real - world trading game .
In short , a combination of the game play of “ Settlers of Catan ” , the cute pseudo - medieval world of “ The Settlers ” ( the computer game ) , which you can play in your every day live along , without having to sit in front of the computer for a long time .
I then started some code , lost motivation and let it sit there for a while .
Recently , I re-developed interest in the idea and started from scratch , using Haskell and HAppS .
To avoid losing interest again , I ’m now putting the code online and set up the server .
I invite everyone to play around with it , maybe have a look at the code , send me patches or comments .
As you can see , the web user interface is plain ugly HTML and could need some love .
Some CSS is definitely needed , some AJAX would be nice .
Also , the resource tree is very small at the moment – there are a lot of things to work on , even if you do n’t want to touch Haskell !
You can register at http://mumer.net/.
You will be either given a forest ( a source for wood ) or a source of stone .
You can reap your source , and trade on the “ Free Market ” , which is where you can always trade online , at bad prices .
The idea is that you find real trade partners , to get better prices .
For now , trading without physical contact is possible .
You can create so - called issue ids , which represent stips of paper .
You can then load resources on them , and give the paper ( i.e. the number ) to other players , who can then redeem them .
Eventually , it is planned that these pieces of paper are provided centrally and ( sufficiently ) unforgeable , so that it is clear who owns a resource .
You can also bid on certain stuff , such as a sawmil , which allows you to turn wood into boards .
It will regularily be re-leased to the highest bidder .
You can get the code ( in a darcs repository ) from http://darcs.nomeata.de/mumer2 and also browse the code .
If you happen to be at the CCC right now and would like to talk about it , please do so !
David Archuleta , David Archuleta
Official Release Date : November 11
The Verdict :
We know , we know — David Archuleta 's album wo n't be in stores until next Tuesday .
And we swore we'd wait until we could pick up a copy on heavyweight vinyl and listen to it through a decent reference - grade stereo system , the way that God intended .
But , last night , someone sent us a link and , well , we could n't stop ourselves .
So how is it ?
Excellent , as expected !
Unlike the music of a certain baldness - afflicted American Idol winner from Blue Springs , Mississippi , who appeared as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live this past weekend ( we think you know who we 're talking about ) , Archuleta 's songs are n't pitchy , angsty meditations on his own grumpy depression — they 're happy , life - affirming pop songs , mostly about hand holding , selflessly sung in the second - person ( eleven of the twelve tracks are about " YOU " ) , all with big exploding choruses .
When lead single " Crush " first dropped , even haters were forced to admit it was an earworm , and there are at least five other songs just as catchy ( so far we like " A Little Too Not Over You " and " Barriers " the best ) .
We can't really envision any circumstances under which David Archuleta wo n't be a massive , chart - killing success .
Top this one , Cook .

Always nice to get a bit of feedback :
I have just taken pains to read your confusion which u conly try to put togetherto deceive the world … you are the number 1 liar in the world …
I have no time to waste on cyber murderers like you but i hand you over to god who will judge … GOD BLESS YOU …
And here :
You are wicked , crooked , crafty , poisonous , and dangerous to women in general …
If not what connection does it have with your subject matter but just to show your in - depth hatred for God ’s vessel , you connected it so as to disgrace her and make your money and gain cheap popularity .
Plus :
This is to inform you that you know you cannot defend what you are insinuating .
Your interest is in the money you make out of NGO and your cliques …
And now :
You are trying to delve into what you do not know , so that you will recieve unnecessary applause …
Now , you see Richard , only SMALL and FOOLISH minds spend enormous amount of their time talking about what they do n’t know about others .
But Richie dear , why do n’t you grow up ?
I ’d like to talk to you when you do .
Ordinarily , I do n’t spend prescious time talking with unreasonable minds .
Please , on a serious note , GROW UP !
The authors are defenders of Helen Ukpabio , a Nigerian evangelist known for promoting the idea that children can be witches – two of the comments apparently come from members of her faimily .
The writers are all upset with my blog entry on Ukpabio from December last year , in which I suggested that Ukpabio ’s activities have helped to whip up a hysteria , with unhappy consequences .
They assure me :
She preaches the word of God and ministers to people wihout even touching them because they are always too many .
Adult ’s witches , male and females come to her confessing that they are witches and wizards .
Begging her , to please deliver them .
Parents bring their self confessed witchcraft children begging her to deliver them .
The counselling sessions are free a thing you can never see in UK or Europe .
Deliverance is completely free without even collecting offering during such deliverance sessions …
Many children have been abandoned in the church , without her knowing the parents she takes them up trains them and makes the church to care for them without attracting the press .
She has a child rescue foundation which she does under the church to help restore wandering children who come to her back to their parents .
and :
I have personally come in contact with a child witch in my extended family who publicly made confessions on her witchcraft involvements and why the mother was getting sick to death and equally explained how the mother could be set free .
When the conditions she gave were met , the mother was rescued .
I was not told .
I was there !
You are trying to delve into what you do not know , so that you will recieve unnecessary applause .
Even when I know that children can be witches , I have never heard that Helen ever labelled a child ‘ witch ’ .
I have , on the other hand , heard of several children who were labelled witches by their own parents , and Helen reprimanded the parents for labelling the children witches just because they were stubborn at home .
This is in fact , a very little I can tell you about Helen as a publisher .
I ’ll advice you read our KINGS VIEW WORLD CHANGERS magazine that carried the heading , WHO IS THIS HELEN UKPABIO ?
They also connect me with an activist opposed to all this , a certain Kelli Stowe .
I ’d never heard of her before , although I now see she runs a heartfelt blog , called Children of Nigeria .
Stowe put a petition on Care 2 opposing Ukpabio ’s “ Liberty Foundation ” ; Ukpabio ’s supporters responded with a “ STOP KELLI STOWE FROM TRAMPLING ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF AN ENTIRE NATION ( NIGERIA ) , LIBERTY FOUNDATION ” counter - petition .
Stowe responded to that with a counter - counter - petition .
( Picture from Children of Nigeria )
UPDATE : The Lagos Daily Independent carries an interview with Ukpabio , in which she denounces the work of Sam Ikpe - Itauma , who runs an NGO that looks after children accused of being witches .
In a semi- coherent rant , Ukpabio calls on the government to ban such “ fake NGOs ” , which she claims are under the control of “ Europeans ” who are “ coming to feed on Africa ” .
She also tells us that those who have made complaints about her to the state govenor of Akwa Ibom are “ stupid ” , because
… their people shoot Nigerian children on the street , in the shop , in the supermarket , in schools .
There is no week that they do n’t shoot blacks .
The black people that do n’t have money to make a case are never heard .
She also explains the nature of witchcraft :
In my own ministry I do n’t label people witches , witches look for me .
They come because they want to be delivered , adult , very old , young , married , lecturers , even doctors …
A witch is anybody that can practice any of these acts voodoo , sorcery and magic .
It is broad .
But in Africa you can practice it without knowing that it is a craft because it is a spirit .
When this spirit enters a human spirit , the spirit reacts at night .
It is not the human being that willingly wants it , but you see yourself doing that , and people come and say please ma , I attended witchcraft meeting .
Now , these are not babies …
God anointed me specifically because of the works of witchcraft , how the craft penetrated the church and were killing pastors .
UPDATE : More today .

Ros-Lehtinen hangs up on Obama .
Twice .
Is Ileana Ros-Lehtinen a little paranoid ?
Maybe .
On Wednesday , the Republican congresswoman got a call from President - elect Barack Obama , did n't believe it was him , and hung up on him .
Twice .
According to Ros-Lehtinen 's flack Alex Cruz , the congresswoman received the call on her cell phone from a Chicago - based number and an aide informed her that Obama wanted to speak to her .
When Obama introduced himself , Ros-Lehtinen cut him off and said , " I 'm sorry but I think this is a joke from one of the South Florida radio stations known for these pranks . "
Then she hung up .
Moments later , Obama tried again , this time through his soon - to - be chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel .
" Ileana , I can not believe you hung up on the President - Elect , " Emanuel said .
And then -- yes , you know what 's coming -- she hung up on Emanuel saying she " did n't believe the call was legitimate . "
A short time later , Ros-Lehtinen received an urgent call from Rep. Howard Berman ( D - Calif . ) , the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee , who informed her that she indeed hung up on Obama .
So , Obama tried again and this time he was successful .
( Phew ! )
" It is very funny that you have twice hung up on me , " Obama said .
Ros Lehtinen responded by telling Obama that radio stations in South Florida always make these sorts of jokes .
Obama said similar pranksters reside in Chi-town .
" You are either very gracious to reach out in such a bipartisan manner or had run out of folks to call if you are truly calling me and Saturday Night Live could use a good Obama impersonator like you , " Ros-Lehtinen joked with the president - elect .
Ros-Lehtinen then congratulated Obama on his victory and pledged to work together on behalf of all Americans .
She also asked Obama to call Sen. Bob Menendez ( D - NJ ) and Rep. Albio Sire ( D - NJ ) to discuss Cuba policy .
Here 's hoping they do n't hang up on him .
Amie Parnes is the Hill ’s White House correspondent .

If true , I love this : According to Pioneer , this 16 - layer 400 GB optical disc can be read in any normal Blu-ray player .
And it 's only the beginning , because they have planned 1TB for 2013 .
The technology of the super multi-layer read - only disc is based on Blu-ray Disc ( BD ) with a breakthrough in material of reflective layers , according to Pioneer High Fidelity Taiwan .
The specifications of the pick - up head ( PUH ) of the disc is the same as those for the PUH of blank BD discs , and therefore the Pioneer discs can be read on BD players .

How is this possible , you ask ?
I do n't know for sure .
In theory , it may be compatible , since they both use 405 nanometer heads , but then again , the track pitch is different ( 10 and 14 nanometer in the Pioneer super - disc versus 25 nanometer in a Blu- ray disc ) .
But Pioneer seems pretty adamant about it in their statement .
Maybe existing Blu-ray players would only need a firmware update ?
We will have to wait and see when it 's released during the next year .

Advertisement Gordon Brown has attempted to play down a slip of the tongue in which he said the government had " saved the world " .
The gaffe , during House of Commons exchanges over the economy , provoked howls of laughter on the Tory benches .
Mr Brown had meant to say ministers had " saved the banks and led the world " on tackling the downturn .
His spokesman later gave the more usual government line that the PM had been " reflecting on helping hardworking families through the downturn " .
Mr Brown 's verbal faux pas , uttered during prime minister 's questions , came in response to criticism of his handling of the banking crisis .
To uproar from the opposition benches , he said " we not only saved the world , er , saved the banks and led the way ... " before being drowned out by laughter .
The Speaker repeatedly had to shout " Order " , as Tory MPs waved their papers , punched the air and jeered .
After the mood in the chamber calmed down , Mr Brown said : " The opposition may not like the fact that we led the world in saving the banking system , but we did . "
As the prime minister sat down , a biblically minded MP mockingly shouted : " Moses . " ' Forgotten about businesses '
Tory leader David Cameron then got up to speak , saying : " Well , it 's now on the record .
" He 's so busy talking about saving the world , he 's forgotten about the businesses in the country that he 's supposed to be governing . "
The prime minister , whose gaffe is already an internet hit , managed a smile .
The mistake comes at a time when Mr Brown is travelling to summit after summit in an effort to persuade fellow world leaders that his " fiscal stimulus " policies should be repeated .
Some detractors have jokingly compared him to the fantasy film hero - and partial namesake - Flash Gordon , who rescued earth from attack by Martians .
That followed the marketing push from the early days of his premiership when he was promoted under the slogan Not Flash , Just Gordon .
Asked at a government briefing later whether Mr Brown had meant to say he had saved the world , his spokesman said : " The prime minister has been reflecting on helping hardworking families through the downturn . "

The controversial law sparked protests in Nebraska
The governor of the US state of Nebraska has signed a bill curbing its controversial " safe - haven " law allowing the abandonment of unwanted children .
The new law puts a 30 - day age limit on the provision permitting children to be legally abandoned at hospitals .
The previous law approved in July set no age limit and had seen more than 30 children - some as old as 17 - dumped at hospitals .
Governor Dave Heineman had urged the state legislature to revise the law .
Legislators voted for the change by 43 votes to five .
The law passed in July was intended to prevent vulnerable parents abandoning newborn babies in potentially dangerous situations .
But analysts say Nebraska was embarrassed by the way the law had been used .
On one day in September , 11 children , some from the same family , were abandoned at one hospital .
Nebraska was one of the last states to introduce a safe - haven law .
All others limit abandonment to infants .
Only the District of Columbia is without such a law .
We usually get really excited when things on Earth happen the way they should and that ’s what could happen now that President Bush has made a public proposal last week .
He wants all the 15 islands in the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and parts of the islands in the Pacific to be granted the national - monument status , which would lead to the world ’s largest marine reserve on the planet as big as Texas and Alaska combined .
“ Life on Earth changes all the time , but these are like time machines that take us back to the time when humans did n’t impact coral reefs in any significant ways , ” said Enric Sala , a marine ecologist and National Geographic fellow and emerging explorer .

“ These places are completely different from what we know anywhere else .
They ’re totally dominated by their predators .
Imagine the Serengeti with five lions per wildebeest .
This is Kingman Reef , ” said Enric Sala
The proposal is great , but can we be sure these pristine reefs wo n’t be “ vandalized ” by fishing or other similar activities .
Let ’s hope so because it ’s too beautiful .

With some spare boredom I had this morning , I was skimming the section on functors in RWH .
A little ways down they introduce the type :
data Eq a =>
Bar a =
Bar a instance Functor Bar where fmap f ( Bar a ) = Bar ( f a )
And point out how the constraint does not allow a valid functor instance .
But what if it did ?
What I ’m getting at is that nobody ever uses constraints on data definitions like that , because they ’re basically useless ( AFAIK , they just impose the constraint on each constructor and nothing more ) .
Perhaps they could work in this way : the mention of the type Bar a implies the constraint Eq a .
Thus :
fmap :: ( a -> b ) ->
Bar a ->
Bar b
The caller already provides the dictionaries Eq a and Eq b for you , because the types “ Bar a ” and “ Bar b ” come from his environment .
I ’m not sure what I mean by environment there .
The time you would be required to provide a dictionary would be if you used a Bar in the body of a function without mentioning it in the type signature .
If this makes sense ( I ’m not convinced it does in the least ) , it might be a nice way to solve the class restriction problem .
A year ago this month , armed raiders broke into the Pelindaba nuclear research facility in South Africa , where that nation stores its weapons - grade nuclear material , in circumstances that strongly suggest inside knowledge and even insider complicity in the raid .
They shot an employee in the chest and made a clean escape from the supposedly high security facility , and still know one knows who they were and there are n't even any worthwhile leads to tracking them down .
Tonight , 60 Minutes talks to Anton Gerber , the shot employee , who only deepens the mystery .
The raiders had detailled knowledge of the security and layout of the plant .
They had breached and shut off a 10,000 - volt barbed - wire fence and eluded security cameras and guards at one of the country ’s most secure facilities .
As the attackers approached the door , Gerber called security and said they were under attack .
" It should n't have taken more than three minutes to get there , " says Gerber .
He says it took 24 minutes to respond to his call .
Gerber has filed suit against the Pelindaba facility for damages .
Another fact he finds suspicious is that the police never questioned him until 60 Minutes began investigating the story .
" It is strange , " Gerber tells Pelley .
Theories have included a raid by terrorists , criminals and some kind of highly organised " lover 's triangle " revenge attack on Gerber himself .
But there have been no arrests , no suspects named , no clues .
And what the 60 Minutes piece does n't reveal is that the raiders almost got what they came for .
The NYT , last year , reported :
when four gunmen burst into the room .
Mr. Gerber pushed his fiancée under a desk .
The attackers shot him in the chest , grabbed a computer and fled , but abandoned their booty as they came under assault by guards .
At no point did the raiders attempt to seize nuclear material - but that computer seems to have been important to their plans .
They went right to it , grabbed it and ran .
Perhaps it contained details of how South Africa built its nuclear weapons , perhaps incriminating details of their suspected partners in that bomb - building project .
But whatever the real motives and real identities of the raiders , Pelindaba underscored the harsh reality that in facilities across the globe nuclear material is secured , but not all that strongly .
Plants in the former Soviet Union , in Pakistan and in South America are judged as especially vulnerable , and could hand a non-state actor - a terrorist group - the knowledge and materials for bomb making .
It 's a threat that the Nunn - Lugar Act of 1991 and the subsequent Cooperative Threat Reduction Program , focused on the former Soviet states , has tried to address even as the Bush administration has tried to underfund it and to use it as a bargaining piece in posturing over Georgia .
It 's a subject we know is close to Barrack Obama 's heart , as he 's seen for himself how loose the security at such facilities can be .
Such bipartisan deals are n't enough , though .
Obama has also made it clear that he would like to see the U.S. renew its Non-Proliferation Treaty commitment to ultimate nuclear disarmament even by the major powers .
He will be under intense pressure from the military to walkback those words , as generals scrabble to keep their individual feifdoms fully funded during the economic crisis .
Their fearmongering overlooks the fact that the NPT is one of the most successful treaties in history .
It is that very success that could provide a jumping off point for a new treaty to move non-proliferation into this new century .
Every nation but three has signed on to it ; only one has withdrawn .
The number of nations possessing nuclear weapons has remained in the single digits , contrary to expectations when the treaty was proposed in the 1960s .
It has done what it promised very well , even though there are some problems with it .
It is a great jumping - off place for the next moves .
A new treaty will take time to develop and be ratified , but it will be able to move past entrenched difficulties .
Amending the NPT is likely to flame out in old and nonproductive arguments .
Foreign policy luminaries like George Schultz , William Perry , Sam Nunn and Henry Kissinger have written that the goal of total disarmament is an attainable one .
A follow - on to the NPT would be an excellent start and would contain commitments to downsize nuclear arsenals , a strengthening of the powers of the IAEA and promises of aid for peaceful nuclear energy uses in return for commitments to remain non-weapon states .
It might also include an extension of any workable missile defense umbrella to all nations of the world .
We could return to Reagan 's original publicly stated vision .
As Martin Hellman wrote in Newsday at the time :
If SDI is for global benefit , the work should not be Top Secret .
If we really plan to share the technology with the Soviets , let us answer their mistrust by sharing the technology with them now , not at some indefinite point in the far future .
Or , if we have no real intention of ever sharing with them , let us be honest and say so .
We will not have fooled the Soviets , and the American public would then assess SDI in a very different light .
Let us be honest with ourselves and the world .
Will the real SDI please stand up : a futile , “ old - mode , ” secret attempt at military superiority or an honest , “ new - mode ” , open effort to use technology for the benefit of all humankind ?
Pelindaba underscores the danger , and Obama already has the background and previous policy work to see that a new , hopeful course for non-proliferation is doable in the current world climate .
It 's an area where I have great hopes for his administration , if only he does n't succumb to the old - school and unimaginative hawks within his own administration or to the clamor of generals who wish to keep their expensive but useless toys .
The Minnesota Senate recount has n't started , but the already fierce campaign continues to escalate .
No amount of complaining will win this election , but both sides seem content to try .
Each campaign is spewing propaganda , but the vast majority of media coverage seems to involve Republican talking points , rather than facts .
This is an obvious problem ; as a result the actual information takes a backseat to spin and deception .
Using the current results , as provided by the Minnesota Secretary of State 's Office , the reasoning behind the right - wing 's focus can be extracted :
There 's a lot of information in the image above that may not be directly apparent ; I will do my best to explain its meaning ; if you do n't care about the peculiarities of each maps ' coloration , skip to the ellipses .
Franken vs Coleman ( 0 % , 1 , 3 )
The upper left most map of Minnesota depicts the percent margin of victory in each county using the unofficial results of the Minnesota Senate election .
All totals pertaining to unlisted candidates are included in our analysis .
The color purple represents counties decided by less than 3 % of the final margin , decrementing by 1 percent for each change in color .
The darkest purple represents a voting margin of 1 % or less , the middle purple between 1 % and 2 % and the lightest purple between 2 - 3 % .
The blue and red then represent counties that were decisively won by either Al Franken or Norm Coleman , respectively .
The red and blue counties follow a 3 % scale .
The lightest blue ( or red ) represents a 3 - 6 % margin , followed by 6 - 9 % as the color grows darker , then finally a 9 % + margin of victory for the darkest blue ( or red ) .
Obama vs McCain ( 0 % , 1 , 3 )
Instead of depicting the unofficial Senate Results , the upper right most map shows the result of the Presidential Election between Barack Obama and John McCain ; the color scales are identical to those used in the first Senate map .
Franken vs Obama ( 12 % , .166 , 1.5 )
The lower left most map differs from the previous two , but conveys a combination of their data .
Based on the current statewide result , Al Franken received 12.07903 % less votes than Obama .
For the proposes of this graph that number was rounded to 12 % and used as a baseline .
If Al Franken performed better than that 12 % difference in a given county , the county is designated as blue ; if Obama did better , the county was colored orange .
The purple represents counties where the adjusted margin , after the 12 % is applied , lies within .5 % .
The darkest purple shows counties decided by .166 % or less , the middle purple .333 % or less , and the lightest purple .5 % or less .
The blue and orange counties follow a 1.5 % scale .
The lightest blue ( or orange ) represents a 1.5 - 3 % adjusted margin , then a 3 - 4.5 % margin for the next darkest color .
followed by the darkest blue ( or orange ) representing a 7 % + adjusted margin of victory for the associated candidate .
Residual Votes ( 0 % , 200 , 2000 )
The final map , the lower rightmost , reveals the most interesting conclusion of the currently unofficial result .
This map illustrates the difference between the number of total ballots cast and the number cast in the Senate Election ; this difference is commonly referred to as the residual vote .
The counties are colored with respect to the first map , but the degree of coloration corresponds to the number of residual votes in a given county .
The lightest color depicts a county with fewer than 200 residual votes , followed by the middle color with 200 - 2,000 residual votes , and finally the darkest color representing a county with more than 2,000 residual votes .
...
The right - wing ( LetFreedomRingBlog.com , Amanda Carpenter , HotAir.com , RedState.com ) seems content to perpetuate misinformation of the residual vote variety .
Contrary to their belief , the relationship between Franken 's outcome and Obama 's outcome has absolutely nothing to do with the current , and likely spread of residual votes .
Are they simply refusing to accept the empirical facts or are they already starting to play the blame game ?
The raw data , our results , depict a very plausible comeback by Al Franken during the recount .
Drawing from our Residual Votes map , there were 34,703 votes cast on a presidential ballot that were not cast in the Senate race .
Of those 34,703 residual votes , 17,839 ( 51.04 % ) of them occurred in counties that Franken won , a margin of 975 .
If just 21.13 % of the statewide residual votes are classified as either undervotes or overvotes Al Franken should statistically pull ahead during the recount .
If you want a higher degree of residual vote accuracy , perhaps the county and precinct level results should be taken into consideration .
Using county level data , Franken needs slightly less than 40 % of the 34,703 previously identified residual votes and just 13.2 % of that total using precinct data .
All modes of interpretation clearly point to a likely surge by Franken during the recount process due to these residual votes ; a fact the right seems content to ignore .
If you do n't trust my analysis , perhaps you should argue with Dartmouth College or MIT instead .
Update :
The obvious discrepancy in my initial result revolved around the exclusion of Presidential residual votes .
The MN SOS website happens to provide a count for the total number of ballots cast in each county which allows us to find the number of Presidential residual votes through a simple subtraction .
The Presidential residual vote was then added to the Senate residual vote to arrive at the total number of residual votes cast in the Minnesota election .
I 've updated the numbers within the the article to reflect this change .
The inclusion of this new information increased the number of effective residual votes needed , for a Franken victory , by roughly 10 % ; definitely good news for Norm Coleman 's reelection effort .

SACRAMENTO , Nov. 9 ( UPI ) -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger
Sunday said " we will ... maybe undo " a measure passed by voters Tuesday stripping same - sex couples of the right to marry .
Proposition 8 amends the state constitution to declare that " only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California . "
It came in reaction to a state Supreme Court ruling that laws prohibiting same - sex marriage violated the state constitution .

In an appearance Sunday on CNN , Schwarzenegger said the state Supreme Court might overturn Proposition 8 , the Los Angeles Times reported .
He also said it is likely Proposition 8 will have no effect on the estimated 18,000 same - sex marriages already recorded in California .
" It 's unfortunate , obviously , but it's not the end , " Schwarzenegger told CNN .
" I think that we will again maybe undo that , if the court is willing to do that , and then move forward from there and again lead in that area . "
The comments seem to represent a change in Schwarzenegger 's thinking , the Times said .
In the past he has said he believes marriage should be between a man and a woman , but he has also said the matter should be decided by voters or the courts and he opposed Proposition 8 .
He told backers of same - sex marriage they " should never give up . "
" They should be on it and on it until they get it done , " he said .
A few years ago I heard programming language people talk about the " Nuclear Winter " in languages caused by Java .
The feeling was that everyone had so converged on Java 's computational model ( C # at that point seen as little more than a rip - off ) that creativity in programming languages had disappeared .
That feeling is now abating , but perhaps a more important thaw that might be beginning - the longer and deeper freeze in thinking about databases .
When I started in the software development profession , I worked with several people who had evangelized relational databases .
I came across them in the object - oriented world .
Many people at that time expected OO databases to be the next evolutionary step for databases .
As we now know , that did n't happen .
These days relational databases are so deeply embedded that most projects assume an RDBMS right out of the gate .
Tim Bray 's thought - provoking keynote talked about storage ; including highlighting several alternatives to the conventional database world
At QCon last week , there was a strong thread of talks that questioned this assumption .
Certainly one that struck me was Tim Bray 's keynote , which took a journey through several aspects of data management .
In doing so he highlighted a number of interesting projects .
Drizzle is a form of relational database , but one that eschews much of the machinery of modern relational products .
I think of it as a RISC RDBMS - supporting only the bare bones of the relational feature set .
Couch DB is one of many forays into a distributed key - value pair model .
Although a sharply simple data - model ( nothing more than a hashmap really ) this kind of approach has become quite popular in high - volume websites .
Gemstone was one of the object database crowd , and I found the Gemstone - Smalltalk combination a very powerful development environment ( superior to most of its successors ) .
Gemstone is still around as a niche player , but may gain more traction through Maglev - a project to bring its approach ( essentially a fusion of database and virtual machine ) to the Ruby world .
As well as this talk , there was a whole track on alternative databases hosted by Kresten Krab Thorup .
One of the additional tools mentioned there was Neo4J - a graph ( network ) database tool that earned some rare praise from Jim Webber .
The natural question to ask about these products is why they should prevail when the ODBMSs failed .
What 's changed in the environment that could thaw the relational grip ?
There are many hypotheses about why relational has been so dominant - my opinion is that their dominance is due less to their role in data management than their role in integration .
Kresten Krab Thorup does a great job as a leader of the technical content of the JAOO and QCon conferences .
For many organizations today , the primary pattern for integration is Shared Database Integration - where multiple applications are integrated by all using a common database .
When you have these IntegrationDatabases , it 's important that all these applications can easily get at this shared data - hence the all important role of SQL .
The role of SQL as mostly - standard query language has been central to the dominance of relational databases .
The heating of the database space comes from the presence of alternatives to integration - in particular the rise of web services .
Under various banners there 's a growing movement for applications to talk to each other by passing text ( mostly XML ) documents over HTTP .
The web , both in internet and intranet forms , has made this integration mode even more prevalent than SQL .
This is a good thing , I 've never liked the approach of multiple applications tightly coupled through a common database - you can't get bigger breach of encapsulation than that .
If you switch your integration protocol from SQL to HTTP , it now means you can change databases from being IntegrationDatabases to ApplicationDatabases .
This change is profound .
In the first step it supports a much simpler approach to object - relational mapping - such as the approach taken by Ruby on Rails .
But furthermore it breaks the vice - like grip of the relational data model .
If you integrate through HTTP it no longer matters how an application stores its own data , which in turn means an application can choose a data model that makes sense for its own needs .
I do n't think this means that relational databases will disappear - after all they are the right choice for many situations .
But it does mean that now application developers should think about what the right option is for their needs .
As non-relational projects grow in popularity and maturity , more and more will go for other options .
Kendra Wilkinson and Hank Baskett Engaged
It sure did n't take " Girls Next Door " and formergirlfriendlong to find a new love .
E! is reporting that Kendra and boyfriend Philadelphia Eagles football player are engaged to be married .
A close friend to Wilkinson confirmed that Hank got down on one knee and proposed in front of both of their families atop Seattle 's Space Needle last weekend .
Kendra 's reps have yet to confirm or deny the rumor .
This is very interesting and if it is true I bet Holly Madison is freaking out .
Madison , who is now dating magician Criss Angel , has never held back her feeling about wanting to marry and have a family .

As Congress contemplates what kind of bailout to give the American auto industry — or indeed , whether to give one at all — during its lame - duck session beginning today , the Chrysler Loan Guarantee Act of 1979 is sure to be on lawmakers ’ minds .
In the late 1970 ’s , crises in the Middle East had sent fuel prices soaring , and Chrysler was sinking under the weight of a gas - guzzling fleet of models .
To stave off bankruptcy , the company received $ 1.5 billion in loan guarantees from Congress .
But as The Detroit Free Press noted this morning , the money came with lots of strings attached :
If the hard - fought Chrysler bailout of 30 years ago is any kind of template , expect shared sacrifices from all of the companies ’ stakeholders and significant taxpayer protection .
Chrysler , too , was dropped in a government - built fishbowl , forcing it to seek approval on all major decisions .
“ It was a tough piece of legislation .
There were a lot of conditions , really , ” former Michigan Gov. James Blanchard , who in 1979 served in Congress , said in an interview with the Free Press .
When Lee Iacocca , the chairman of Chrysler at the time , went to Congress to ask for help , he painted a picture of the situation in the auto industry that , other than the quaintly low dollar amounts , could be a description of today .
Here is how Charles Hyde summed up his testimony in his 2003 history of Chrysler , Riding the Roller Coaster : A History of the Chrysler Corporation :
Lee Iacocca ’s opening testimony on 18 October 1979 before the House Banking Committee , which was considering a loan guarantee bill , laid out Chrysler ’s basic argument for passage .
Given more breathing room , Chrysler would introduce fuel - efficient cars and return to profitability .
Bankruptcy was not an option , nor was a merger with another car company .
A Chrysler bankruptcy would result in the loss of more than 500,000 jobs nationally and directly affect over a million people .
In the first year alone , bankruptcy would cost federal , state , and local governments $ 10 billion in welfare and unemployment payments , lost taxes , pension liabilities , and other costs .
The next month , the Carter administration announced its support for aid to the struggling car company , and the deal passed the House and Senate .
“ This legislation does not violate the principle of letting a competitive free enterprise system in our country function on its own , because Chrysler is unique in its present circumstances , ” President Carter said as he put his signature to the act on Jan. 7 , 1980 .
The gamble seemed to pay off for the government .
Chrysler settled its debt by 1983 , years ahead of schedule , and the Treasury made a profit of more than $ 300 million on the loans .
But some on the right argued that the company ’s resurgence was much less of a success story for government intervention than the conventional wisdom has it .
Just how much 2008 resembles 1979 is a question lawmakers will have to consider this week .
Other creatures may try to anthropomorphize me based on what parts of my environment I arbitrarily choose to interact with , but I would n’t know about that .
I am a bird .

The Iraqi journalist who hurled his shoes at President George Bush was viciously beaten after being taken into custody , according to a police officer who accompanied him to prison .
Wrestled to the ground and then buried under a frantic mound of security officers , Muntazer al - Zaidi was last seen being dragged into detention .
Controversy has since raged over what treatment was meted out to the man hailed a hero in many parts of the Arab and Muslim world for his protest against the invasion of Iraq .
Yesterday there were further demonstrations in the Middle East calling for his immediate release .
Witnesses to his arrest and imprisonment have told the Observer Zaidi was badly beaten , during and after his arrest last Sunday , and that he risks losing the sight in one of his eyes as a result .
He is expected to be charged with insulting a foreign leader , which carries a prison sentence of up to two years .
His family have received offers from hundreds of lawyers across the region willing to represent him .
An Iraqi judge appointed to investigate his treatment , and who has seen him in his prison cell , said Zaidi has bruises on his face and around his eyes .
These , said the judge , had been sustained during his arrest at the Baghdad news conference during which Zaidi threw both his shoes at Bush , shouting : " This is the farewell kiss , you dog . "
His family , who have been denied access to him , have claimed he suffered far more extensive injuries and was subjected to a prolonged and vicious beating , suffering a broken arm , broken ribs and internal bleeding .
The allegations appear to be borne out by those who have seen him since his arrest .
One police officer , who accompanied him to prison , said the journalist , a Baghdad correspondent for the Cairo - based Al - Baghdadia TV , had been subjected to violence throughout the journey .
The officer , who asked not to be named , said he witnessed security forces beating Zaidi in the car with such force that his ribs were broken .
" I felt sorry when I saw them beating him .
His mouth was badly injured and he did not utter a single word throughout until one of the guards hit him in his left eye with a gun .
Then he cried out that he could n't see , and I saw blood inside his eye .
I am a police officer but even I have to say I felt proud of what he did . "
A doctor called to examine Zaidi said his right arm had been broken and he had haematomas - indicative of internal bleeding - all over his body , particularly on his left leg , shoulders , face and head .
The doctor , who also asked to remain anonymous , said specialists called in to treat him warned security guards that they must make sure his eye was protected for fear of a further haemorrhage which could cause him to lose his sight .
Zaidi's family allege that it is because of the severe nature of his injuries that he has not been called before a public court .
As calls for his release were continuing , details of how he planned his extraordinary protest have begun to emerge .
Born into a traditional Shia family , Zaidi made no secret of the fact he was vehemently against the US - led occupation of Iraq and , according to family and friends , had said many times he would like revenge on Bush .
A younger brother , Haythem , said Zaidi had unexpectedly found himself called on to cover the press conference held by Bush and Iraqi prime minister Nouri al - Maliki .
His first action , it seems , was to return home immediately to change his foreign - made shoes into Iraqi - made ones .
A colleague at the TV station said Zaidi mentioned just before going home that " if something had to be done , it had to be 100 per cent Iraqi " .
" Muntazer had repeated many times that if he had the chance , he would take revenge against the US president , " said the colleague .
" He held him responsible for the deterioration of the conditions we were living in .
He just did n't have the chance before , and being asked to cover the conference was an opportunity for him .
I am proud of him because he did what all of us have dreamed of doing , but were too scared to do . "
Yet there is some confusion over whether the world 's most famous shoes were indeed Iraqi .
While another brother , Durgham , has insisted they were from the Baghdad factory of Iraqi shoemaker Alaa Haddad , cobblers from Turkey , Lebanon and even China - where most of Iraq 's shoes are produced - have lodged rival claims .
Istanbul producer Ramazan Baydan insists the brown thick - soled shoes are his and currently known as Model 271 but soon to be renamed the Bush Shoe , or the Bye - Bye - Bush Shoe .
He has hired an agency to promote them , claims to have taken 300,000 orders since the protest and plans to employ 100 extra staff to meet demand .
The originals , however , have been destroyed by investigators trying to determine whether they had contained explosives , which may come as a blow to Zaidi when he learns that Saudi Arabian Mohamed Makhafa had , reportedly , offered $ 10 m for his ' shoes of dignity ' and their ' high moral value ' .
Friends of Zaidi speak of a dedicated journalist who lives in a small flat filled with books , many of them religious , and who was deeply interested in humanitarian issues .
His political beliefs , however , remain unclear .
One colleague alleged he had been a Baathist under Saddam Hussein 's rule and after the US - led invasion turned into a defender of religious cleric Muqtada al - Sadr 's ideals .
" I know people are seeing him as a hero , but he would do anything to become famous , " said the colleague .
" He said many times that he would like to become president of Iraq . "
Others , however , vehemently disagree with these claims .
Ahmed Ayssam , who graduated with him at the Communication College in Baghdad , described him as hard working and preferring to spend time with his books and family rather than going out .
" He wanted to make a difference since he was a student , and he did it , ' said Ayssam .
" He is an example of faith and strength .
He is a loyal friend , a hard worker , and if the Iraqi government allows it , a brilliant journalist without limits . "
Zaidi , according to the prime minister 's spokesman , has since written a letter begging for a pardon and regretting his " ugly act " .
His family are sceptical about this , believing it either to have been written under duress , or to be a straightforward fake .
" I am suspicious ... because I know my brother , " said Durgham .
The family believe his actions may have placed both them and himself in danger and claim to have received threatening calls .
" There are thousands of supporters out there who applaud what he did , but there are also thousands that regret his actions and it has put his life in danger , " said another brother .
" I am worried this has become dangerous for him , and about how long he will be alive for when he comes out of prison .
It is a very delicate situation .
I believe we will have to fight to stop him becoming a martyr . "

Us - frequenting parents were put out of their comfort zone , not sure if they wanted their kids playing with dolls whose very existence almost necessitated “ the sex talk , ” but demand increased and the hussie - tastic plastics now rival Skipper and Ken for shelf space .
This was back in 2001 , and no toypocalypse has yet followed .
Toys certainly are n’t the same as they were back in the 1940s .
Barbie prevails , but the spinning tops and “ Dick and Jane ” of white - bread America are n’t working their way into Generation ADD .
But that does n’t necessarily mean that today ’s children are learning from dolls with shiners how to grow up and lose custody of their babies .
It may appear that those High School Musical kids are shaking nudie - internet - pic drama into the values of Count Chocula eaters , but some of these frighteningly adult - themed toys might just be overzealous marketing that indicates little about what kids actually use toys for .
In order to understand the essence of play , it ’s best to examine the types of toys that have lasted decades and compare them to flukes that one can only hope will be tossed aside by fastidious tykes .
What kids will always like :
1 ) Toys that allow them to act like grown - ups .
One visit to Toys R
Us will make it clear that the baby doll still rules .
Along with it are mock cash registers , ovens , construction sets , and doctor kits .
There ’s even a toy line called “ Parents ” that makes a set of keys ( including a garage opener and a door beeper ) that ’s designed to be chewed on .
Operating a cash register definitely is n’t as fun as chasing a neighbor around with a Nerf gun , but it ’s the grown - up power imposed on that toy ( combined with the joy of primary colors ) that makes it worthwhile during playtime .
2 ) Bodily functions .
Probably at least one in five baby dolls can pee .
The “ Little Mommy Real Loving Baby Gotta Go Doll ” even comes with its own toilet .
Other than peeing , baby dolls can blink , take in food , say a word or two and move their heads .
Bratz baby dolls can even burp .
What was once merely called a “ stuffed ” animal now needs a new category , because many animal toys are n’t too huggable but do seem to mimic some sort of agency , or at least a propensity to be classically conditioned to learn tricks , sniff at food , and grab food from a kid ’s hand .
See Biscuit the Fur Real friend .
Why do kids like to see orange juice come out of plastic babies and sadly mechanical dogs do the same things over and over ?
Seeing that they ’re just coming off of getting their nappies changed , they probably like the rush of controlling something else ’s hungers and uh , leaks .
3 ) Imposing fantasy worlds on inanimate objects .
Beanie Babies , figurines from Disney movies , Star Wars toys , anything that you can collect and line up in any sort of order are a delight to children .
With such null , lifeless artifacts they can re-create the plot of The Rescuers , their own experience of receiving detention in school , or countless other pseudo - sadistic games of kidnapping , wars , and cat fights .
But look up “ violent children ’s games ” and you ’ll only find links about how badly video games affect children ’s behavior .
Challenge : watch kids play for one hour with a Rainbow Brite doll and you ’ll see that the violence was there anyway , no Grand Theft Auto required .
4 ) Tiny versions of real things
Observe : Littlest Pet Shop , Polly Pocket , Matchbox Cars .
Tiny toys separate the kids who put things in their mouths and choke from the kids who can keep their cool .
Just kidding .
Tiny toys take boring things out of their own context and make them seem novel and magical .
However , the recent big - head - ification of tiny toys remains unexplained , but is possibly related to the introduction of anime .
Observe : the new Littlest Pet Shop line ’s big - headed specimen .
Play is about power and imagination .
Kids do n’t know what ’s real and what ’s not yet , but they definitely know that they ’re small and meek in a world of tall people .
In play , they can escape that and make their own rules .
Compare those toys to a few heavily - market ones that ignore basic kid needs in their quest to impose bells and whistles of technology and commercialism onto playtime .
Toys like these are cropping up rampantly , but do kids actually like them ?
1 ) Toys that use too many pulleys and tricks of physics .
You ’re sitting at McDonalds and the toy theme is Indiana Jones .
You get some kind of plastic car that has a lever you can pull and it flies across the table , pushing a few packets of salt on the floor .
In the car , you lose the lever and throw away the rest of the toy .
Anticlimactic .
2 ) Toys that regurgitate trends of the plastic - surgeried older generation .
Two words : Tini Puppinis .
Watch the commercial and feel inexplicable fear :
3 ) Toys that promise to defy genetic determinism .
( AKA toys marketed to rich parents )
One study actually found that kids who watched “ Baby Genius ” videos had smaller vocabularies .
The researchers were sued .
I remember looking up as the noisy family burst into the railway carriage – and immediately noticing that one of the boys had the unmistakable countenance created by an extra 21st chromosome , otherwise known as Down Syndrome .
Unmistakable , yes , but I had never before seen the condition in the flesh , and felt a frisson of shock and discomfort .
That was 30 years ago .
Today I have two children of my own , and the younger , Domenica , has Down Syndrome .
Now , if I was sitting in a railway carriage , and another child with Down Syndrome were to come in , I would smile , rather than just stare .
Yet nothing would have changed in those children : it is I who have changed .
It seems that this change is slowly happening on a national scale .
Yesterday BBC Radio 4 broadcast Born With Down's , which revealed that for the first time there are more British children born annually with Down Syndrome than there were before widespread screening was introduced almost 20 years ago .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
According to Carol Boys , the chief executive of the Down Syndrome Association , there are several reasons for this .
One is , frankly , startling : about 40 per cent of those who refused to terminate the pregnancy – after amniocentisis had detected the extra chromosome – did so because they did n't believe the diagnosis .
That 's as clear an indication as you could have of a generalised distrust of the medical profession , but it has little to do with attitudes to disability .
There are two other principal reasons given by Carol Boys , who herself is a mother of a man with Down Syndrome .
One is that as children with the condition are now welcomed into the educational mainstream , rather than institutionalised , parents - to - be have been able to see with their own eyes that people with the condition are not uneducable fairground freaks .
The second reason is linked to the fact that women are tending to have children later in life .
Not only does this make them more painfully aware of the prospect of not being able to have any children at all ; women who have a career of their own behind them are more likely to have the confidence not to be intimidated by doctors into having a eugenic termination .
For make no mistake : despite all the progress which children with Down Syndrome are now making in schools and homes up and down the country , the medical profession in general still has a visceral bias in favour of eugenic termination , which its practitioners are often startlingly crude in expressing .
This is not based on a realistic and up - to - date assessment of the possibilities open to those with Down Syndrome , still less of the happiness which such people can and do bring to families and even communities as a whole : it is a function of the fact – which is undeniable – that people with Down Syndrome are likely to cost the NHS more in subsequent medical treatment than a child without any disabilities .
Yesterday the BBC News website ran a selection of comments on this issue by members of the public .
One in particular , by Heather of Livingston , Scotland , is worth reproducing in full here : " I was told that my daughter had Down 's when I was about 12 weeks pregnant and every doctor , gynaecologist I saw tried to convince me a termination was the best option .
I was still offered this at 26 weeks !
One reason given to me by a cold - hearted consultant was that ' these babies put a strain on the NHS ' .
My daughter was stillborn and when pregnant again , I refused all tests apart from a scan .
It 's not society who are looking for the ' perfect baby ' , it 's the medical profession . "
Thirteen years ago , our own decision not to find out whether our unborn child was " perfect " or not provoked a similar comment from the ex-nurse and agony aunt , Claire Rayner .
She wrote that the Lawsons had behaved selfishly , because of the " misery " and cost to society of such children : " People who are not yet parents should ask if they have the right to inflict such burdens on others . "
This , of course , is the classic eugenic argument , which was taken to its logical conclusion in Germany 70 or so years ago .
Astound - ingly , Claire Rayner was at the time of those remarks a patron of the Down 's Syndrome Association – a position which was instantly terminated by an outraged Carol Boys .
Yesterday I spoke to Carol after she had appeared on Woman 's Hour with Joanie Dimavicius of the NHS Down Syndrome screening programme .
Carol said she had the impression that Dimavicius was distinctly unsettled by the figures which showed that an increasing number of women were resisting the pressure to abort babies diagnosed with Down's .
If Ms Dimavicius is uneasy about this trend , it would hardly be surprising .
After all , the NHS Down Syndrome screening process is hugely expensive , justifiable on cost - benefit grounds purely on the basis that it will detect and destroy children who would otherwise cost the Health Service much more as survivors .
If there are now more children born each year with Down 's than there were before the national screening programme was introduced , then Ms Dimavicius might be wondering how much her own job is worth to society .
This question is all the more pertinent because the NHS does not factor into its life - or - death calculus the fact that every year hundreds of children without any disability are lost as a direct result of amniocentesis , which carries with it a 1 per cent risk of miscarriage .
The other invasive test , Chorionic villus sampling ( CVS ) , carries a 2 per cent risk of miscarriage .
Given the huge numbers of " false positives " in the initial scanning process , this has resulted in some very disturbing statistics from the National Down Syndrome Cytogenetic Register , which were unearthed last July by the Down Syndrome Educational Trust .
The Register shows that in 2006 – the last year for which results are published – 400 babies without Down Syndrome were " lost " , in order to " prevent " 691 births of babies with the condition .
Just pause for a second to take in the human misery captured in this remarkable statistic , and include in it the misery of those who terminated an " imperfect " child , and later bitterly regretted the choice they had made .
Victoria Lambert wrote a very affecting piece in The Sunday Times last weekend , on her decision to abort a baby diagnosed with Patau Syndrome , a chromosomal abnormality which results in a very short natural lifespan : " What I often think is that if my son had been born alive and perhaps with two years to live , were those not two years of my life that I could have spared to nurse him ?
Would it really have been such a big deal ?
With hindsight , I think I could have offered that at the very least to a child I had wanted so much . "
Yes , there are arguments about the quality of life a disabled child can have .
The truth , however , is that a congenitally disabled person knows no other existence than that which he or she has : it is others who might deem their lives to be inadequate , not they .
When I look at Domenica I see someone with a vast joy in just being alive , and I am indescribably happy that she is .

How The Women 's Movement Taught Women to Hate Men By Erin Pizzey , founder of the modern women 's shelter movement
e-published with permission
W e were sitting around a coffee table in my house , in Goldhawk Road , Hammersmith in London listening to a bossy woman wearing National Health round glasses and a long Indian skirt .
She smelled of incense and too few baths .
We were all nursing large gin and tonics which was the staple drink in the Women 's Lib .
Goldhawk Road weekly meetings .
We were trying to follow her convoluted explanations about our ' role in society . '
As far as I knew , I had a very simple role in society .
I had always wanted to have lots of children , be happily married , and free to tend my house and garden and cook three course meals for my husband .
' What could possibly be wrong with that I asked ? ' ' Why , ' she said angrily , 'are so many married women deprived of the status of independent human beings ? '
The answer was ; because marriage is based on the property concept , therefore it must be abolished .
I looked at the other women in the group , Angela , a teacher , had more of an idea of what was going on .
She had trained as a teacher and was used to this confusing amount of jargon .
' What is wrong with owning a house ? '
I asked .
I was obviously a hopeless brain drain .
' You , ' she said turning on me , ' live in a mink - lined trap , ' her face was frozen with rage .
I decided I 'd better shut up and see what else I was getting wrong .
' Why are the mores of our society unfair to women ? ' was her next question .
The answer to that was ' Because men are natural oppressors . '
This was not the time to confess to the fact that I had not only a son but seven adopted sons .
Certainly , my daughter Cleo and I waged war in a family where two women were pitted against nine males .
The most oppressive thing the boys ever did was to leave hair in the wash - basin and they could all cook , iron , sew and clean .
The final question was even more confusing .
' Why is the love of a woman for a man , which involves her being the servant to his needs , lauded as ' her ' greatest fulfillment ? '
The answer reduced the room to a puzzled silence . ' Er , ' I asked ' are we talking about lesbians ? '
We were .
' We , ' they always use the royal We ............... ' do n't like men nor do we like hetero - sexual women .
If there is ever to be any equality , marriage and the family must be abolished . '
We sat there gawking like fish and she smiled a very satisfied smile and glared at me .
I had followed the career of a journalist called Nancy Spain .
She worked on ' SHE ' magazine .
Her radical lesbian ideas interested me and she was writing for the Guardian long before the Guardian Mafia of feminist journalists got going .
She died in an aeroplane crash but left behind many of her acolytes .
These were the faces I saw in those early days of the feminist collectives .
I went to work in the Women 's Liberation Work Shop in Newport Street , off Shaftesbury Avenue .
I also attended the first women 's conferences and I was struck by the hundreds and hundreds of women claiming to be radical militant lesbians .
The first women 's conferences were destroyed by violent fisticuffs between these women and most of us were very afraid of them .
As far as I was concerned these women did not speak for my gay friends anymore than the radical feminists spoke for all women in our country who were very happy at home with their husbands and their children .
In reality , this was a very minor group of women who were only able to hurl abuse at heterosexual women and their families because they were white , middle class and had media jobs .
Before very long they were employing each other and ' marginalizing ' the men who tried to work alongside them .
Men , intimidated by their brutal , violent behavior , moved on and out of many jobs .
According to these women all women were victims of men's violent behavior , any attempt for men to fight back met with behind - scenes maneuvering and men LET IT HAPPEN .
Fed up with the war , I decided to stay away from the in - fighting that dominated the women 's liberation movement and turn my attention to helping in my own local community .
I got a letter from the women 's liberation office , throwing me out and banning me from attending any of the collectives .
The so - called women 's liberation ' movement spread like a cancer across the English chattering classes .
I visited the houses of feminist women with my son who carried his action - man toys .
In their houses there was no vestige of anything ' boyish ' at all .
No Tonka trucks , no boys toys  nothing that could encourage a boy to think of himself as masculine .
The whole idea of men and masculinity in those houses , we considered disgusting .
We , the mothers , sat around the kitchen tables rearranging the world according to Marx .
I , who had enjoyed men's company enormously , for the feeling that these women underneath all the political chatter , really disliked men .
There was nothing sensual about their houses .
They disliked cooking and if they had to cook for guests , it was not producing good food and wine that delighted their guests , but a rather rapid need to compete with each other .
Was it , I wondered , an English middle class phenomenon ?
This dislike and need to sneer at men ?
Certainly their boys were confused and crying .
There was no way I could interest my sons in dolls , not that I would want to try .
Useless to tell these women that Marx never did anything to women , was unkind to his family and refused to have women in the Politburo .
The feminist gurus had done their job well and most of the women I knew complained about their awful lives .
I could n't see what was awful about having the freedom to do exactly what I pleased and when I pleased .
Not for me the daily office rush .
I pushed my pram around Shepherd 's Bush Market loaded with other people 's children and my own .
I dreamed of finding a house where I could build a useful community centre in our midst .
The dream materialized but with it , the awful certainty that if I attracted funds and publicity .
I would hear the tramp of the man-hating feminists trying to oust me and take over .
That is what happened , and the first little get together I ran to encourage other groups to open refuges was dominated by the lesbians and feminists who crowded into our little church hall and voted themselves into a national movement .
We , horrified and unused to political maneuvering , abstained .
' There is n't a working - class women among you , ' one of my mothers yelled .
This has always been the truth of this disastrous movement .
Born in ivory tower academia , it had no relevance to women on the street .
' If only you were all lesbians , you would have no problems of violence , ' we were told .
We often had women beaten up by their female partners in our refuge .
The worst beating I ever saw was between a vicar 's daughter and her lover .
All through my career , as a journalist , a writer and a social reformer , I have been hounded and bullied by feminist women and their coat - trailing ' new men . '
Any of us who have gone to all girl schools , particularly boarding schools , will verify the awful bullying and violence that goes on amongst the girls .
For so many years women were tyrants behind their front doors .
They were able to sexually abuse , batter and intimidate their children and their husbands now , with the advent of the women 's movement , they moved out into the world .
They took their aggressive , bullying and intimidating behavior with them .
Talking with the men who were accused of abusing their women , I was aware of this movement with its wild and extravagant claims against men had fueled the flames of insecurity and anger in men .
I watched horror - stricken , as in home after home , I saw boys denied not only their access to their fathers , but also access to all that was normal and masculine in their lives .
Our universities rushed into grasping funding for ' Women 's Studies . ' ' Gender politics , ' became the new way to brain - wash women with very little education .
By now the Politically Correct movement was beginning to hatch and a new form of ' mind control ' was devised .
Feminists became the new ' thought police . '
The sudden promiscuity of women came as a shock to me .
The atmosphere of intense dislike for men and anything male lay like a miasma in so many English middle class houses .
Overnight in the late sixties in England , confusion reigned .
If feminists hated men so much why were so many of them sleeping with the enemy ?
I am the daughter of a diplomat born in China and it was my Amah who was the one to insist that my twin sister and I be put out on the hill side .
Failing to achieve that , she wanted our feet bound .
It was women in Africa who practised ritual circumcisions on their daughters .
I knew that because I worked with missionaries in Africa .
I was fighting a lost cause and what bothered me then and bothered me now , is that men made no attempt to defend themselves .
By now the ' new man ' was beginning to emerge and he was not a pretty sight .
Parroting everything in the woman in his life was teaching , he could usually be found in woman 's conferences running the crèches and trying to look ' caring . '
Mostly he was stoned , confused and angry .
Maybe because as far as I could see , the new feminists made no effort to share an equal relationship with their male partners .
They saw themselves as ' superior beings . '
The new men were expected to take their places a few steps behind their women and to do as they were told .
Mostly , they had to accept the dictates of the dictators and quietly get on with the household chores and take care of the children .
But what ever a new man did , he could never atone for the sins of other men .
Any man who disobeyed his partner , was subjected to expulsion from the matrimonial home and in many cases , from a relationship with his children .
Now , there were a legion of feminist lawyers and therapists to make their ' sisters ' were fully supported in the battle to destroy men .
Why did the relationship between men and women go so badly wrong ?
I think it goes back to my pooing about the choices men and women made in the sixties .
Men were tired of their roles as ' macho men . '
They were strangled in their uniforms of ties and suits .
They had no choices in the late fifties but to take on a wife and children and the cost of a mortgage dangled around their necks .
In the sixties they rebelled and wanted to take a less violent and domineering role in their lives .
They turned to this romantic image of women as soft and gentle .
They saw this image as an emotional life style denied to men .
Women , however , rebelled against this image of themselves , indeed in so many cases it was a false image , and doomed the masculine concepts of authoritarian rule and aggression and even to wearing the hated suits and ties that men had discarded .
Men , for so long , subjected themselves emotionally to women and hated women for their dependence .
Women adopting male bullying and aggressive roles and still hating the fact that they need and want men in their lives .
What needs to happen ?
First of all there has to be a carefully worked out and civilized dialogue that cannot be invaded by the extremes of the right or the left .
Both men and women have been guilty of politicizing human relationships .
Human relationships are not a matter of political solutions .
Any country that has tried to create a political solution to human problems has ended up with concentration camps and gulags .
The deep wounds between men and women will take time to heal .
It is imperative that women who do not hate men and wish to live in peace with them , should be given space in newspapers and magazines to have their say .
Films should be made about women who have made a success of their homes and their families .
Bringing up a family requires a large degree of maturity .
An ability to sublimate the personal needs and wishes until such time as the children are grown and have left the home .
Later , those years of sacrifice will bring the parents such joy .
Of course , there will be women who want to work and not have a family .
As long as the women have clearly thought out their priorities , there is no harm .
Just lately my life is too full of nearly forty something women , who have had fulfilling careers but the biological clock is ticking and they are afraid .
Now they decide they do want children and a father for their children  for many it is too late and the future , for them , is not bright .
Some women will be able to balance a home and a career .
These women tend to be wealthy and can afford the help needed to bring up the children .
Many women will be forced to go out to work against their will .
This is because we live in a Western world where caring for children has become devalued and only work outside the house carries with it monetary compensation .
I believe that love between men and women is the strongest relationship on this earth .
For now , we have to fight to protect family life .
Hopefully , as we move , into a new century , men and women can meet each other not only as equals , partners and friends but also as lovers .

The MacBook Air weighs a little over three pounds .
Airy , but there 's lighter .
Not surprisingly , Apple wants to weigh that little — under three pounds .
The easiest way to cut the fat is to use a material less heavy than aluminum that wo n't compromise the body 's integrity .
Enter carbon fiber , which AppleInsider says might replace the Air 's lower aluminum case .
AppleInsider says a pre-production MacBook
Air running around looked exactly the same as the current model , but with a black carbon fiber bottom .
According to the teardown geeks at iFixit , the heaviest structural component besides the unibody chassis — which supposedly will continue to be machined from a single block of aluminum — is the bottom cover .
Replacing it with carbon fiber would bring the Air's weight down by 100 grams to 2.78 pounds , lighter than the Samsung X360 , and that 's without shaving slivers of weight off elsewhere in the Air 's design .
AppleInsider reiterates that they 're publishing the info on the carbon fiber redesign " strictly as a rumor , " but adds that it 's far enough along in the dev cycle to show up in a MacBook Air revision next year .
It sounds plenty plausible to us , though maybe not with that mismatched black bottom .

Q From Steve Gearhart :
Where does the term baited breath come from , as in : ‘ I am waiting with baited breath for your answer ’ ?
A The correct spelling is actually bated breath but it ’s so common these days to see it written as baited breath that there ’s every chance that it will soon become the usual form , to the disgust of conservative speakers and the confusion of dictionary writers .
Examples in newspapers and magazines are legion ; this one appeared in the Daily Mirror on 12 April 2003 : “ She has n’t responded yet but Michael is waiting with baited breath ” .
It ’s easy to mock , but there ’s a real problem here .
Bated and baited sound the same and we no longer use bated ( let alone the verb to bate ) , outside this one set phrase , which has become an idiom .
Confusion is almost inevitable .
Bated here is a contraction of abated through loss of the unstressed first vowel ( a process called aphesis ) ; it means “ reduced , lessened , lowered in force ” .
So bated breath refers to a state in which you almost stop breathing as a result of some strong emotion , such as terror or awe .
Shakespeare is the first writer known to use it , in The Merchant of Venice , in which Shylock says to Antonio : “ Shall I bend low and , in a bondman ’s key , / With bated breath and whisp ’ring humbleness , / Say this ... ” .
Nearly three centuries later , Mark Twain employed it in Tom Sawyer : “ Every eye fixed itself upon him ; with parted lips and bated breath the audience hung upon his words , taking no note of time , rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale ” .
For those who know the older spelling or who stop to consider the matter , baited breath evokes an incongruous image ; Geoffrey Taylor humorously ( and consciously ) captured it in verse in his poem Cruel Clever Cat :
Sally , having swallowed cheese ,
Directs down holes the scented breeze ,
Enticing thus with baited breath
Nice mice to an untimely death .
[ I ’m indebted to Rainer Thonnes for telling me about this little ditty , which appears in an anthology called Catscript , edited by Marie Angel .
However , it was first published in 1933 in a limited edition of Geoffrey Taylor ’s poems entitled A Dash of Garlic . ]
You would n’t think gay people would need tips on staging a splashy event from Mexican immigrants .
Yet since they lost the right to marry in California , gays appear to have no game plan , marching around West Hollywood and Silver Lake with their old “ No on 8 " signs , which makes about as much sense as holding a John McCain rally next month at John McCain ’s house .
That ’s why I ’m declaring Dec. 5 No Gays for a Day day .
Patterned after the 2006 Great American Boycott organized by Latino immigrants , on that Friday , gays should stay home from work , school and do no shopping , to prove how crucial they are to American society .
No Gays for a Day will demonstrate what it would be like if -- as so much of the non-coastal U.S. seems to desire -- gays just disappeared .
You may not even know who all your daily gays are , so there ’s no predicting the impact .
It probably wo n’t shut down the restaurant industry like the immigrants did , but know this for certain : Dec. 5 will be a day that fashion does not move forward .
To gauge this strategy ’s effectiveness , I called Sonja Eddings Brown , the spokesperson for the Protect Marriage coalition that put Proposition 8 -- which defined marriage as exclusively heterosexual -- on the ballot .
Brown , to my surprise , sounded defeated .
I reminded her that Proposition 8 passed , so maybe she should pep up a bit .
“ Did we win ? ” she asked .
“ It does n’t feel like it . ”
When I ran No Gays for a Day by her , Brown said , “ I have so many dear friends who are such invaluable parts of this city and California who are gay . ”
It was the boldest use of “ some of my best friends are ... " I had ever heard .
My main concern about enacting my plan is that I ’m not gay .
And my previous attempt as an outsider to rally folks to a cause was a miserable failure :
Right before I applied to college , I suggested Asian students protest being stereotyped as overachievers by skipping the SAT .
Advertisement
Also , I ’m really lazy .
So I called Amy Balliett for help .
Balliett is a lesbian in Seattle who , just last Friday , created JoinTheImpact.com , which has organized an expected 250,000 people nationwide to march Saturday in protest of Proposition 8 .
Balliett immediately embraced No Gays for a Day as JoinTheImpact ’s second event .
We worked out some kinks , like “ pretending you are sick ” for people who are n’t out of the closet at work .
For economic impact , we picked a Friday -- one of the big shopping days before Christmas and the day People , Us Weekly and Star usually sell out at newsstands .
We also decided that because this is a general strike , not a directed boycott , even gay - owned , gay - patronized businesses should shut down .
“ I hate to say this , but we should even say , ‘ Do n’t even go out to the bars , ’ ” she said .
“ I just do n’t know if the community can stick to that . ”
To get media attention , Balliett -- a search - engine marketer -- is going to use the social networking sites she used for Saturday ’s march .
Although that sounded promising , I decided to hunt for a No Gays for a Day celebrity spokesperson .
I chose Kathy Griffin because she ’s so well connected to the gay community and because it ’s hard to get Ellen DeGeneres on the phone at 10 p.m. when you ’re drinking and coming up with ideas like No Gays for a Day .
Griffin -- who is a spokesperson for the Foundation for AIDS Research , AIDS Project Los Angeles , Aid for AIDS and , I ’m guessing , AIDS , AIDS , AIDS -- was thrilled to get the official celebrity spokesperson job .
And she thought our impact would be significant .
“ Forget Pinkberry .
It ’s over for them .
They could go under in one day , ” she said .
“ If you do two days without gays , Bravo would go under too . ”
People , we figure , will have no assistance at libraries or gym class and will madly butcher their hair .
Subaru dealerships should n’t bother opening .
Entertainment journalism will take such a hit , TMZ will have to report hockey scores .
Griffin was getting more excited about our plan until I mentioned this might slow up the remodel of her house .
“ My remodel ?
What about the audience for my shows ?
The only reason I ’m doing this is on Dec. 5 , I do n’t have a show .
I ’d never do this if I had a show that day in Palm Desert , ” she said .
Then -- and you ’ll have to trust me that this actually happened -- Griffin got quiet for a few seconds .
“ If my assistants do n’t go to work , ” she said , “ who ’s going to go to the bathroom for me ?
I ’m screwed on a day without gays .
I ’ve made a huge error in judgment .
Me , Cher and Bette Midler are going to be the three most screwed Americans .
We all might actually die that day .
And what if Ryan Seacrest does n’t go to work ?
The state will collapse .
This will wake up California . ”

But Griffin decided No Gays for a Day is a cause worthy of her suffering .
Now the rest of the world will find out what Griffin has known all along :
We need our gays .
If it turns out I ’m wrong , and we do n’t miss them , then as a married man , I can tell you this :
The best way to keep them at home is to let them get married .

Feingold hopes , expects new AG to say president is not above the law Nick Juliano

In exclusive interview , Democratic Senator outlines hopes for next administration President - elect Barack Obama prepares to enter the White House with his plate full of domestic and international crises -- financial markets in free - fall , auto companies nearing collapse , millions of Americans struggling to keep their homes , wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Along with those pressing , front - page issues Obama also will have to swiftly redefine President Bush 's attempts to institutionalize expansive executive power and work to reverse many of the president 's most egregious policies , say lawmakers and civil libertarians .
Sen . Russ Feingold has been among Bush 's most vocal critics .
The Wisconsin Democrat says Obama needs to indicate a clean break with the view advanced by the Bush White House that the president 's Commander in Chief powers , laid out in Article II of the constitution , allow the president to ignore the whims of Congress .
Bush used this interpretation to justify his warrantless wiretapping program that was conducted outside the boundaries of the law and to authorize a host of controversial policies regarding detainees rounded up in the war on terror .
" They just take the view they can do whatever they want , and they use it in many contexts , " Feingold told RAW STORY .
" So , in a variety of ways , that doctrine has to be rejected , by executive orders , by legislation , I think even , ideally , by the president making a brief statement with regard to it in his inaugural address . "
During a brief interview from his office in the Heart Senate Office Building Thursday morning , Feingold outlined his expectations for an Obama administration .
( A full transcript of the interview is available here . )
A member of the Intelligence , Judiciary and Foreign Relations Committees , Feingold sits at the nexus of many of Bush 's most controversial policies .
He also will play a key role in confirming many of President - elect Obama 's appointees .
When Attorney General nominee Eric Holder comes before the committee , Feingold promises to press him for his views on the limits of executive power .
" There 's no question that one of the things that will be important to me and many other senators will be ... Mr. Holder 's view of the role of the powers of the president , particularly under Article II of the Constitution , and whether they trump Congressional acts , " Feingold said .
" Mr. Gonzales was unable to give me a satisfactory answer to that question , as a result , I voted against him .
Because if the attorney general cannot say that the president is n't above the law , basically , I 'm not voting for him .
" And so I 'm very confident Holder 's answer will be excellent , " he continued .
" But that will be one of many areas that I will be taking up . "
While Feingold acknowledges that issues like civil liberties , government transparency and privacy may not be at the front of voters minds amid all the other troubles facing the country , Feingold says he will continue to work quietly to improve conditions that have worsened over the last eight years .
" It 's on the front page when really awful things are being done .
When we fix 'em , maybe it wo n't get any press at all .
That 's OK , " he said .
" I 'm not looking for big headlines , I 'm just looking to fix it . "
Earlier this year , he led the charge to attach protections for Americans ' privacy to an update of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and to prevent the FISA Amendments
Act from granting legal immunity to telecommunications companies .
While his attempts to modify the bill were largely unsuccessful , Feingold is optimistic about writing extra privacy protections into surveillance law now that Bush is leaving office .
When FISA was being debated , Bush vowed to veto any bill that was not completely in line with his own proposal .
That ultimatum -- combined with the administration 's penchant for questioning opponents patriotism -- made it difficult for Feingold to garner enough support for his privacy fixes .
" The problem that we had under President Bush is that what he would do is present unacceptable packages of legislation that involved anti-terror and other measures that we all supported , but he refused to put in the protections that were needed .
And they would say , well ... then you 're voting against the whole bill , " Feingold said , predicting an Obama administration would be more accommodating .
" Even if they oppose some of the fixes , they 're not going to use the same tactics that the Bush administration did , which was basically calling into question people 's patriotism , or desire to stop terrorism , " he continued .
" I do n't think we 're going to get that kind of monkey business from this administration . "
Feingold also has sharply criticized the practice of holding prisoners indefinitely without charge at Guantanamo Bay and was an early critic of Bush 's decision to invade Iraq .
Obama " has said all the right things , " regarding those issues , Feingold said .
As an Illinois senator , Obama voted for a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq .
He also voted in favor of Feingold 's amendments to FISA , although the two split on the final bill .
Soon after his election , Obama reiterated his pledge to close Guantanamo .
" This is going to be , I think , a wonderful cooperative effort , where we 're going to get action right away , " Feingold said .
" Some of the things are going to get taken care of right away , some of the things are going to take longer .
But I 'm committed to working on this over the next few years , and I can't imagine a better person than President Obama . "
Independent civil liberties advocates are cautiously optimistic about the prospects of an Obama presidency .
" There have been expressed commitments , and we expect people to follow through with them , " Caroline Fredrickson , the American Civil Liberties Union 's top Washington lobbyist , told RAW STORY recently .
Congressional inquiries into President Bush 's alleged abuses and executive power grabs did n't really get off the ground until after 2006 , when Democrats regained control of Congress , ending a period of unified party control .
Now that the same party is back in charge on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue , there are fears that Democrats may be more sympathetic to claims of executive power from President Obama .
" We 're going to be just as critical of President Obama and Democrats in Congress as we were of Republicans if they do n't do the right thing , " Fredrickson promises .
" Everyone has such high expectations , and I tell them , ' You have to understand , it 's going to be hard . "
Feingold likewise hopes his colleagues would be critical of Obama if he snubs Congress like Bush has had a habit of doing .
" But I do n't think that 's going to happen , " he says .
" My sense is that the people that President Obama will have around him will want to accommodate Congress . "
A big question facing Bush administration critics looking forward to an Obama presidency revolves around how much time and attention should be given to continuing to flesh out the details of the outgoing president 's transgressions .
The ACLU wants an independent commission , akin to the Church Committee of the mid-1970s , established to fully examine President Bush 's time in office , and the idea has gained a bit of support in Congress .
Feingold said he 's not opposed to such an idea but seemed more concerned with moving forward .
" My focus is on what I can do working with the new administration to repair these things apart from any commission , " he said .
The senator chairs the Senate Judiciary 's Subcommittee on the Constitution ; earlier this summer he presided over a hearing on proposals to restore the rule of law after Bush leaves office .
Obama 's transition chief John Podesta , a former Clinton administration official who runs the liberal Center for American Progress , was a witness at the hearing .
There also is a question of how to bring accountability for officials who may be guilty of crimes .
Feingold called on Bush not to issue blanket pardons before leaving office , which would essentially " let folks off the hook in advance . "
Inquiry into Bush administration actions can't supersede issues like the financial crisis or wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , Feingold said , but it should be a priority .
" Whether it be through prosecutions , investigations , oversight , legislation ... there 's a wide range of things we can do in the context of accountability without getting carried away , " he said .
The public should pressure Bush not to issue pardons to government officials " so that we can consider whether criminal [ charges ] or other accountability would be appropriate , " he continued .
" I 'm not ready to say that it is , but I do n't want it taken off the table by presidential , by abuse of the presidential pardon power . "
To date 14,000 police man hours , thousands of knocked doors , hundreds of thousands of phone calls and $ 18 million in costs have failed to find the phantom killer who moves through Europe like a wraith and leaves dead innocents in her wake .
Since that first murder she has killed twice and her DNA has been found at the site of a triple - execution that she may or may not have been involved in .
Her genetic calling - card has also been found at the sites of numerous break - ins and petty robberies , upon a drug - filled syringe on a leafy pathway and in garden sheds in Austria .
Conventional thinking brands the woman without a face as a drug addict who kills and robs to feed her habit .
But if that is so , police say she exercises an extraordinary restraint not usually found in junkies , whose craving normally causes them to implode , to make mistakes that throw them off their selfish , lethal quest .
Last week German police resolved to step up the efforts of " Special Commission Parkplatz " - parking place , after the spot where a female police officer became one of her victims - in a bid to close the file on one of the new millennium 's most baffling cases and to redeploy the 50 detectives now working on the case to other crimes .
But good intentions cannot mask the fact that the phantom killer remains a mystery , and unless she is shopped by an accomplice or slips up , the chances are that she may well become the Jack the Ripper of her age : unknown and unaccountable for her terrible crimes .
One reason for the intensity of the hunt is that police want to avenge one of their own .
She is the only suspect in the cold - blooded murder of Michele Kiesewetter , 22 , a German policewoman who was killed in a car park at Heilbronn in April last year .
Police believe the officer approached the woman and she panicked , killing her with a bullet in the face .
Inside the BMW squad car : a DNA calling - card of " Frau Ohne Gesicht " ( " woman without a face " ) .
The DNA , smudged on the centre console and the armrest in the rear of the car , was fed into the Interpol database : it matched the 1993 tea cup killing and one in 2001 in the south - western German university city of Freiburg .
Joseph Walzenbach , 61 , was a respected antiques dealer .
He was found strangled with a length of garden twine , and a small amount of cash was taken from him - not more than the equivalent of $ 230 .
The DNA of his killer was found on him , on items in his small shop and smeared on the door handle .
It was even smudged on the back of the " closed " sign which the killer placed in the window of the premises before fleeing .
" After 2001 we had two murders - not enough to classify the perpetrator as a serial killer but with similarities : small amounts of cash stolen , the same modus operandi in the way the victims died , both killings committed indoors with no signs of a break - in .
This in itself suggests the killer builds up a non-threatening rapport before being let in , " Juergen Brauer , a state prosecutor who works closely with Special Commission Parkplatz , says .
Juergen Bueller was seven as he walked along a leafy lane in Gerolstein , a spa town not far from the Belgian border , towards a playground .
He felt something crunch under his foot and looked down to see glass , a needle and what looked like flecks of blood .
Now 15 , he recalls : " I ran back home clutching this thing in my hand .
I had no idea what it was ; I had never seen a syringe before .
The jabs they gave us at school were done with something that looked like a silver pocket torch .
" I was quite excited and showed it to my mum , who went nuts .
She took it off me and said : ' Now are you cut ?
Have you put it anywhere near your mouth ?
Did it go through your shoe into your foot ? '
Of course I did n't know anything about AIDS then , but I do now .
I suppose I was lucky not to have cut myself .
I just remember having a battery of tests in local hospitals that seemed to stretch on forever . "
The syringe was found to contain traces of heroin and the DNA of the double killer .
The German state computers and Interpol began cross-checking the DNA for other crimes .
What appeared over the next few years was low - key in criminal terms but helped compile the portrait of a nomadic , wandering criminal moving at will across Germany and other countries .
A fortnight after the discovery of the syringe a caravan was burgled on the outskirts of Mainz ; the remains of a nibbled biscuit turned up the woman 's DNA once more .
On New Year 's Day in 2003 at Dietzenbach near Frankfurt - am - Main an office was broken into and nothing but a coffee tin of loose change stolen .
" It was a professional job , " Guenter Horn , a high - profile prosecutor liaising with police , says .
" She left no fingerprints .
But she did leave a scraping of skin , and that was enough to pin the job on the strangler . "
So it went on .
December 2003 , a car stolen in Heilbronn with her genetic fingerprints on the petrol cap .
In autumn 2004 the woman went to the Austrian Tyrol .
She broke into garden sheds along the road towards Innsbruck , discarding a pair of tracksuit bottoms , a hooded cardigan and other items .
The killer 's DNA also turned up at burglary scenes in France .
September 2005 : a bar robbery in Karlsruehe and the DNA found on beer bottles and a wine glass .
August 2006 in Besancon , France : DNA on a toy pistol used in a hold - up for $ 170 from the till of a dry- cleaners .
In all , there have been about 30 break - ins and hold - ups as well as the murders that have yielded her DNA identity .
In May 2005 , in the city of Worms , a Gypsy turned a gun on his brother .
Police found the phantom 's DNA on one of the bullets .
Knowing her dress style , drug use and cold - bloodedness , police went on television in April 2005 with an appeal to the public for tips , but to no avail .
Then came the event in April last year that sent shock waves through German society .
Michele Kiesewetter , 22 , and her colleague were eating rolls and drinking coffee during a lunch break in their patrol car .
They had been assigned to an undercover drugs squad in Heilbronn .
At least two people climbed into the back of the car and shot both in the head .
Kiesewetter died instantly ; her partner lingered in a coma for months before the bullet lodged behind his right eye was removed .
He remembered nothing from the incident .
Nothing was taken from them except their handcuffs .
" It was brutal , apparently random and with no apparent motive , " Chief Superintendent Horst Haug of Special Commission Parkplatz says .
" What are we dealing with here ?
And who is the accomplice ? "
Who indeed .
Police revealed that other DNA traces were found at crime scenes indicating she sometimes operated in tandem .
But no two crime scenes yielded the same DNA , indicating she picks up and discards helpers with the same casual abandon with which she kills .
In May this year , at Saarhlzbach in western Germany , near the Luxembourg border , a woman at a fishing lodge was knocked unconscious and $ 600 was stolen .
Left behind , again , was the same DNA and that of an unknown sidekick .
Kurt Kletzer , a noted Viennese psychiatrist who recently drew up a profile of the Austrian incest father Josef Fritzl for a book I wrote called Monster about his life and crimes , says the woman without a face was " intriguing and disturbing " in equal measure .
" Judging by the facts alone , we are dealing with an ordered personality that maintains composure even though the crimes and the evidence , such as the syringe , indicates drug dependence .
Stealing small amounts of cash is an indicator that she has needs which must be served , but she does n't go for the ' big score ' which might trap her .
The fact that she sometimes uses an accomplice suggests she is a manipulator and an adept one at that .
" Like Fritzl , she is able to project an aura of normalcy while being anything but .
She is compelled to murder to feed her own habit , thus reducing the victim to the status of a worthless object .
These psychopathic traits would have been formed at a very early age and I would venture that the police are looking for someone from a damaged home life , perhaps a foster child or orphan , a child who was abused or whose carers were addicts themselves .
" What does n't fit at all is the murder of the policewoman and the attempted killing of her partner .
Unless they thought that they would have drugs , the act may be seen as the ultimate lashing out at authority . "
As Special Commission Parkplatz cranks up its probe , an intriguing court case is under way .
This year police found cells of the suspect 's skin after they stripped and analysed all the upholstery , carpets and lint from the car of the man now on trial for a triple murder .
The man , a former paid police informant , is suspected with another of killing three Georgian dealers who had come to Germany to buy second - hand cars .
Their bodies were dumped in the River Rhine at the end of January .
The mysterious murder was " an act of religious hatred " , one of the two accused claimed on Monday at the start of the trial .
Testifying in Arabic , the Iraqi - born defendant , 40 , declared his innocence and accused the other defendant , a 26 - year - old Somali , of murdering the three as an expression of " a special form of fundamentalism " .
Police said they had employed the Arabic - speaker as a spy .
He told the court his job was to observe the Somali , who had found the victims ' Christianity objectionable .
Prosecutors in the town of Frankenthal reject that claim and say the two accused killed the Georgians simply to seize their wads of cash .
The dealers had come to Germany to obtain second - hand cars to take home .
The Somali , speaking fluent German , also insisted on his innocence , saying he had been present but was surprised by the brutal murders and dared not object for fear that he too would be killed .
But both deny knowledge of the woman without a face , whose DNA was found in the car where the men were executed .
Could she be the killer ?
Or a participant in it ?
Both men say they are at a loss to explain how her double helix came to be in the car .
Police are compiling a thorough history of the car : who owned it and where it has been seen .
" We are as baffled as everyone else about how her DNA came to be there , " said Haug .
" But it is one more piece in the mosaic .
All criminals , no matter how deadly or how clever , all slip up eventually .
We just hope we catch her before she kills again . "

Estima la firma que el crecimiento global caerá a su menor nivel desde 1982 , antes de recuperarse nuevamente en 2010
Merrill Lynch estimó que las economías en desarrollo como México , serán menos vulnerables a la desaceleración que las desarrolladas .
Los países menos apalancados , o endeudados , como México , Nigeria y Filipinas , son los menos vulnerables , expuso Alex Patelis , director de economía internacional de Merrill Lynch .
En contraste , dijo , los países apalancados como Australia , Suiza , Corea , Hungría y la zona euro están dentro del grupo de las economías más vulnerables .
" Estamos siendo testigos del final del desequilibrio económico conforme los consumidores estadounidenses ajustan sus hábitos y las economías emergentes se volcán al interior , " comentó .
" Japón , América Latina y los mercados emergentes de Asia serán los menos vulnerables a este cambio , mientras que Europa , Medio Oriente , África serán los más vulnerables . "
De acuerdo con la firma , los ahorros en los mercados emergentes serán insuficientes para financiar el excesivo consumismo de Estados Unidos .
En el reporte " 2009 : El Reporte Macro de Proyecciones para el Próximo Año " , Merril Lynch proyectó que el crecimiento global caerá a su menor nivel desde 1982 , antes de recuperarse nuevamente en 2010 .
Así , predijo un crecimiento global de 1.3 % en 2009 , abajo del 3.2 % que tuvo lugar 2008 , y que subirá a 3.1 % en 2010 .
La firma previó además que los gobiernos de los países del mundo intervendrán por medio de políticas monetarias y fiscales enfocadas a una mayor relajación .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A rock found mostly in Oman can be harnessed to soak up the main greenhouse gas carbon dioxide at a rate that could help slow global warming , scientists say .
When carbon dioxide comes in contact with the rock , peridotite , the gas is converted into solid minerals such as calcite .
Geologist Peter Kelemen and geochemist Juerg Matter said the naturally occurring process can be supercharged 1 million times to grow underground minerals that can permanently store 2 billion or more of the 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide emitted by human activity every year .
Their study will appear in the November 11 edition of the Proceedings of the Natural Academy of Sciences .
Peridotite is the most common rock found in the Earth ’s mantle , or the layer directly below the crust .
It also appears on the surface , particularly in Oman , which is conveniently close to a region that produces substantial amounts of carbon dioxide in the production of fossil fuels .
“ To be near all that oil and gas infrastructure is not a bad thing , ” Matter said in an interview .
They also calculated the costs of mining the rock and bringing it directly to greenhouse gas emitting power plants , but determined it was too expensive .
The scientists , who are both at Columbia University ’s Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory in New York , say they have kick - started peridotite ’s carbon storage process by boring down and injecting it with heated water containing pressurized carbon dioxide .
They have a preliminary patent filing for the technique .
They say 4 billion to 5 billion tons a year of the gas could be stored near Oman by using peridotite in parallel with another emerging technique developed by Columbia ’s Klaus Lackner that uses synthetic “ trees ” which suck carbon dioxide out of the air .
More research needs to be done before either technology could be used on a commercial scale .
Peridotite also occurs in the Pacific islands of Papua New Guinea and Caledonia , and along the coast of the Adriatic Sea and in smaller amounts in California .
Big greenhouse gas emitters like the United States , China and India , where abundant surface supplies of the rock are not found , would have to come up with other ways of storing or cutting emissions .
Rock storage would be safer and cheaper than other schemes , Matter said .
Many companies are hoping to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by siphoning off large amounts of carbon dioxide from coal - fired power plants and storing it underground .
That method could require thousands of miles of pipelines and nobody is sure whether the potentially dangerous gas would leak back out into the atmosphere in the future .
Mr Aziz served as foreign minister and deputy prime minister under Saddam
An Iraqi court has opened a new trial against two members of Saddam Hussein 's regime on charges of persecuting political opponents while in power .
The two defendants are Saddam 's foreign minister , Tariq Aziz and the dictator 's cousin , Ali Hassan al - Majid , also known as Chemical Ali .
Majid has already received two death sentences by Iraq 's courts .
Some of the alleged crimes were against members of current prime minister Nouri al - Maliki 's Dawa party .
The BBC's Caroline Wyatt in Baghdad says Aziz , Majid and more than 20 other defendants are charged with " crimes against humanity " over the alleged persecution of members of the Dawa party , founded in the 1950s .
Nouri al - Maliki , who became Iraq 's prime minister in 2006 , joined the Dawa party as a young man in 1970 .
But he fled Iraq in 1979 and lived as an opposition leader abroad until 2003 and was himself sentenced to death in absentia by Saddam 's Baath party government .
The other new charges put forward by the prosecutor in the Baghdad court centre on the arrest of up to 200,000 members of Iraq 's political parties - many of whom were sent to jail or executed between 1981 and the 2003 US - led invasion of Iraq .
Majid , considered by many to be Saddam Hussein 's right - hand during his years of power , is currently being tried on separate charges over a gas attack that killed some 5,000 Iraqi Kurds in 1988 .
Earlier , he was sentenced to death for his role in crushing a Shia uprising in 1991 .
And in February , the former defence minister was condemned to hang for genocide over the killing of 100,000 people during the 1988 Anfal campaign against Iraq 's Kurds .
This Is What the 2008 Electoral Map Would Look Like if the Election Were Decided by [ Fill In the Blank ]
Created : November 11 , 2008 17:36 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
A number of sites have featured a hypothetical electoral map entitled “ This Is What the 2008 Electoral Map Would Look Like if the Election Were Decided by 18 - 29 Year Olds . ”
Needless to say , it ’s a very blue map .
I spent the weekend poring over the CNN exit polls from last Tuesday ’s election and converting the state - by - state data for a number of demographics into my own hypothetical electoral maps .
The result is a set of maps that visualize the outcome of an election decided exclusively by the following age groups , genders , income groups , political affiliations , etc. :
Voters age 65 and older :
** White voters : **( A “ black voters ” map would be a sea of blue . )
Men :
Women :
Self - described political moderates :
Registered independents :
College graduates :
Voters earning under $ 50,000 per year :
Voters earning over $ 50,000 per year :
Voters who are “ worried about economic conditions ” :
Voters whose “ most important issue ” was the economy :
Voters whose “ most important issue ” was the war in Iraq :

Bridge to somewhere
The Alaska blogger and former Palin rival Andrew Halcro turns up a 2006 photo that ( further ) undermines the notion that Palin initially opposed the " bridge to nowhere . "
The American Jewish Committee , an ardent defender of Israel , is known for speaking out against anti-Semitism , but this advocacy group has recently stirred up a bitter and emotional debate with a new target : liberal Jews .
An essay the committee features on its Web site , ajc.org , titled “ ‘ Progressive ’ Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism , ” says a number of Jews , through their speaking and writing , are feeding a rise in virulent anti-Semitism by questioning whether Israel should even exist .
In an introduction to the essay , David A. Harris , the executive director of the committee , writes , “ Perhaps the most surprising — and distressing — feature of this new trend is the very public participation of some Jews in the verbal onslaught against Zionism and the Jewish State . ”
Those who oppose Israel ’s basic right to exist , he continues , “ whether Jew or gentile , must be confronted . ”
The essay comes at a time of high anxiety among many Jews , who are seeing not only a surge in attacks from familiar antagonists , but also gloves - off condemnations of Israel from onetime allies and respected figures , like former President Jimmy Carter , who titled his new book on the Mideast “ Palestine Peace Not Apartheid . ”
By spotlighting the touchy issue of whether Jews are contributing to anti-Semitism , both admirers and detractors of the essay agree that it aggravates an already heated dispute over where legitimate criticism of Israel and its defenders ends and anti-Semitic statements begin .
With another Proposition 8 protest expected to bring thousands to the Capitol in Sacramento today , both sides continue to accuse each other of a four - letter word in the same - sex marriage debate , and it is n’t “ love . ”
It ’s about the polar opposite — hate .
A pro-Proposition 8 group , the National Organization for Marriage , has a new Web site , AboveTheHate.com , that allows people to sign an electronic letter to “ say ‘ Enough ! ’ to the campaign of hate and intimidation ” against supporters of the marriage ban .
In the 18 days since California voters banned same - sex marriage by 52 - 48 percent , the heat on both sides of the issue , and the name - calling , has yet to dissipate .
One Silicon Valley government employee , a contributor to the Yes on 8 campaign , was listed on www.antigayblacklist.com.
She said someone contacted her employer and tried to have her fired because of her support for the same - sex marriage ban .
“ One of our children is gay , ” said the woman , who asked her name not be used for fear of further retribution .
“ This is a very painful issue for us , but we still have to follow our conscience .
What I find shocking is we are not allowed to exercise our rights , but other people are . ”
Even TV shrink Dr. Phil McGraw got into the act Friday .
In a show on Proposition 8 that featured San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom and Maggie Gallagher of the Organization for Marriage , the show asked viewers to send in an e-mail if they had been “ attacked for supporting Proposition 8 . ”
Call it a backlash to the backlash over Proposition 8 .
Since Election Day , some
No on 8 supporters have used the word “ hate ” to describe supporters of the marriage ban .
But increasingly , the Yes on 8 side is leveling the same charge .
Concerned about the increasingly rancorous tone of the clash , some Proposition 8 protests are trying a different tack .
Last week , Los Angeles stand - up comic Sean Hetherington was tired of being angry and sad about Proposition 8 , and did n’t like some of the protest ideas he ’d heard because they sounded divisive .
So he and his boyfriend , Aaron Hartzler , hatched the idea for a “ Day Without a Gay ” ( www.daywithoutagay.org), asking gay and straight people to “ call in gay ” to work on Dec. 10 — and use the time to do volunteer and charitable work , particularly in communities that supported Proposition 8 .
The result in Proposition 8 “ showed there some people who just do n’t feel comfortable with gays being perceived as normal , ” Hetherington said .
“ For that reason Day Without a Gay exists , because we can go back in those same communities , and say we are compassionate ; we are loving .
We just want to be treated fairly under the law . ”

ABORIGINAL elders from northern Australia are upset at a tourism campaign based around the movie Australia that they say suggests it is " OK to trample all over our culture " .
Ambrose Mungala Chalarimeri , a Kwini tribe elder from Oomarri country in the east Kimberley , made the comments after seeing a Tourism Australia advertisement showing people swimming above King George Falls .
Special tribal and spiritual significance : King George Falls in the east Kimberley .
" The waterfalls hold special tribal and spiritual significance , with a burial site located near the top of the falls which is protected by our ancestral spirits , " Mr Chalarimeri said .
He said that although tourist boats were permitted at the base of the waterfalls , people were forbidden from climbing to the top .
Mr. Himes was born in Lima , Peru , where his father worked for the Ford Foundation , and spent his early childhood there and in Bogotá , Colombia .
When his parents divorced , he and his two sisters moved to New Jersey with their mother , who worked as an administrator for nonprofit groups like the Aspen Institute and for the State Board of Higher Education .
Being engaged in the world was not a matter of choice for Mr. Himes , said David Earling , a childhood friend : “ That dinner table was where , as a 10 - year - old , you ’d better have a view of what ’s going on and what the headlines were . ”
Mr. Carlson , who wrote Mr. Himes ’s recommendation for the Rhodes Scholarship , called him “ a remarkably reflective guy . ”
When Mr. Himes proposed writing a college paper on homelessness , Mr. Carlson invited him to spend a night at a shelter where he worked .
“ But he went out and spent the night on the street with the homeless , and wrote a beautiful and poetic paper that shared their perspectives . ”
After his Rhodes scholar experience at Oxford , where he earned a degree in Latin American studies , Mr. Himes said he pursued jobs at the State Department and on Capitol Hill before Goldman lured him to join its new Latin America group .
He soon wound up crunching numbers and traveling the world selling investors on the landmark privatization of Telmex , the Mexican telephone company .
Goldman disbanded the group after the 1994 Mexican peso crisis .
Mr. Himes later worked in mergers and acquisitions and in a technology group .
But when the dot - com boom went bust , Mr. Himes , already rattled by 9/11 , did not like his options at the firm .
“ Between that , and a newborn and 3 - year - old I never saw , ” he said , “ I ’d had enough . ”
In Mexico , he had become interested in ways of fighting poverty with business - oriented solutions .
With that in mind , he found his way to the Enterprise Foundation , a nonprofit financer of low - income housing , which commissioned him to study personal finances and predatory financial services in the Bronx .
“ It was a real eye - opener to spend time with people you do n’t often meet at 85 Broad Street , ” he said , referring to Goldman ’s headquarters .
Editor 's note : Donna Brazile , a Democratic strategist , is a political contributor for CNN .
She also is the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee 's Voting Rights Institute , an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and founder of Brazile & Associates , a Washington - based political consulting firm .
Brazile , who was the campaign manager for the Al Gore - Joe Lieberman ticket in 2000 , wrote " Cooking With Grease : Stirring the Pots in American Politics , " a memoir about her life in politics .
Donna Brazile tells those in losing campaigns it will take weeks to readjust and for the world to appear normal .
( CNN ) --
As someone who knows from experience , I write this open letter to all staff members , volunteers and supporters of candidates who lost last Tuesday .
No matter how much it hurts to lose a campaign , know that this , too , shall pass .
The campaign is finally over , and you are exhausted and ready to transition to your new life or careers .
But before you clean off your desk and throw away everything in the back seat of your car and the apartment you rented during the campaign , take a moment .
Shake the hand of someone with whom you worked .
E - mail a thank - you note to a person who helped get you through this long political season .
In other words , exhale .
Campaigns are not for the fainthearted .
They are tough -- mentally , physically and spiritually .
Once a campaign ends , an emptiness comes over you .
You find yourself struggling to figure out how to become human again .
Suddenly , you 're going to the grocery store , reading the entire newspaper instead of the clips , and , yes , speaking in complete sentences , not sound bites or barked replies .
I know what it 's like to lose a presidential campaign or two or three .
No matter how close the results ( Gore - Lieberman ) or wide the blowout ( Walter Mondale - Geraldine Ferraro and Michael Dukakis - Lloyd Bentsen ) , you 're in a state of emotional disrepair and in need of a home - cooked meal .
Acknowledge your success .
Think about the nonstop pace that you thrived in but would crush less hardy individuals .
You lived for and met multiple deadlines .
You essentially lived with the people you work with and , God bless you , you did n't kill them , though you probably picked up a few bad habits and gained more than a few unwanted pounds .
Now you 're sitting at that desk and trying to figure out what to do with everything you 've accumulated throughout the quest to reach the city hall , the statehouse , Capitol Hill or the White House .
No matter how hard you try to contain it , you 're both angry and sad .
Try not to vent and point fingers .
It only creates wounds , mostly self - inflicted , and worse , the candidate you believed in and gave your all for does n't deserve it .
Just thinking back to 2000 still gets me upset .
Once the Supreme Court ruled and Al Gore made his concession speech , I remember feeling lost and disillusioned .
I was empty inside as if someone had used a vacuum cleaner and sucked out every bit of my passion for politics and public service .
I had no idea what to do with my life .
Nobody seemed interested in hiring me ; the taint from losing closed every door on which I knocked .
For a while , I was convinced I would never be accepted again as a political operative .
I had no life beyond politics and no idea how to spend my days or evenings .
I did n't have a dog back then .
I have one now .
It was hard listening to the opposition announce members of the transition team who had just spent months beating us over the head .
Worse , it was hard to go back to a house I had not lived in for almost a year .
In fact , I have not unpacked some boxes from my life in Tennessee .
It 's still too painful .
I had no energy to start looking for work .
I was obsessed with those chads : hanging , swinging and , my favorite , pregnant .
Above all else , I did not want to quit fighting .
I was angry over the election and the recount .
Soon , I realized the world was going to move on , and I would be stuck in the past .
The only people who understood my mood were former colleagues .
Grieve .
Mourn .
Let it out .
It 's like the death of someone close to you , except there 's no funeral to help bring closure , just more election analysis and pundits spewing out what you did wrong .
Be gentle on yourself .
It will take you weeks to readjust and for the world to appear normal .
Let it be a period of self - reflection and trying to answer the unanswerable " what ifs . "
But then let it go .
In a world of nonstop campaigning , the next season starts now .
Give yourself a gift .
Rent videos and catch up on the movies you missed .
Do n't read the front section of the newspaper -- they are full of the other campaign right now .
Pick up a copy of People or US Weekly instead .
Turn off cable and switch to the Sci Fi Channel -- snakes and flies are healthier than exit polls and demographic trend lines .
Above all , call your family .
Get back in touch with friends who do n't do politics for a living .
Remember why you made the decision to give up your life in the first place .
And remember this -- you 're one of the lucky few .
You were on a team that made the effort .
You fought the good fight .
And you had a front - row seat to history .
So forget wearing the loser label .
The next team will snatch you up .
Or you 'll decide to find some other adventure that fulfills your passion .
Either way , know your efforts were never in vain .
Congratulations to all the team players , the winners and nonwinners who fought gallantly until the end .
Take it from an old - timer who still loves politics :
You will rise again to fight the next battle .
So go get yourself some much needed rest and arise in a few weeks renewed with the spirit of making a difference by serving a cause greater than oneself .
Your country needs you .

Some of my favorite quotes ...
I will come to a time in my backwards trip when November eleventh , accidentally my birthday , was a sacred day called Armistice Day .
When I was a boy , and when Dwayne Hoover was a boy , all the people of all the nations which had fought in the First World War were silent during the eleventh minute of the eleventh hour of Armistice Day , which was the eleventh day of the eleventh month .
It was during that minute in nineteen hundred and eighteen , that millions upon millions of human beings stopped butchering one another .
I have talked to old men who were on battlefields during that minute .
They have told me in one way or another that the sudden silence was the Voice of God .
So we still have among us some men who can remember when God spoke clearly to mankind .
Armistice Day has become Veterans ' Day .
Armistice Day was sacred .
Veterans '
Day is not .
So I will throw Veterans '
Day over my shoulder .
Armistice Day I will keep .
I do n't want to throw away any sacred things .
What else is sacred ?
Oh , Romeo and Juliet , for instance .
And all music is .
Kurt Vonnegut
Breakfast of Champions ( 1973 )
Below are some of my favorite excerpts from Declarations of Independence : Cross - examining American Ideology ( 1990 ) , by Howard Zinn .
This is a sort of philosophical companion to his masterpiece A People 's History of the United States ( 1980 ) .
T here is still another kind of historical bias that can mislead us , and that is the tendency of the culture to emphasize historical trivia , to learn facts for their own sake .
The result of this is to encourage a flat , valueless interest in past facts that have no great significance in the betterment of the human condition , but that are simply “ interesting ” .
The interest served , however , is that of diverting us from the truly important uses of history , thus making history , literally , a diversion .
J apanese writer Oda Makoto describes that August 14 in Osaka , where he lived .
He was a boy .
He went out into the streets and found , in the midst of the corpses , American leaflets written in Japanese , which had been dropped with the bombs : “ Your government has surrendered ; the war is over . ” “ L aw and order ” ... is a phrase that has appeal for most citizens , who , unless they themselves have a powerful grievance against authority , are afraid of disorder .
In the 1960s , a student at Harvard Law School addressed parents and alumni with these words :
The streets of our country are in turmoil .
The universities are filled with students rebelling and rioting .
Communists are seeking to destroy our country .
Russia is threatening us with her might .
And the republic is in danger .
Yes !
danger from within and without .
We need law and order !
Without law and order our nation cannot survive .
There was prolonged applause .
When the applause died down , the student quietly told his listeners : “ These words were spoken in 1932 by Adolf Hitler . ”
H e , I know for the question had been discussed among us long before the Time Machine was made thought but cheerlessly of the Advancement of Mankind , and saw in the growing pile of civilization only a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end .
If that is so , it remains for us to live as though it were not so .

A Vatican bioethics document Friday condemned artificial fertilization and other techniques used by many couples and also said human cloning , embryonic stem - cell research and “ morning after ” drugs were immoral .
The long awaited document from the Vatican ’s doctrinal body marks a major step by the Vatican into biotechnology , an area in which many governments are struggling to formulate legislation .
The document also condemns new drugs that block pregnancy from taking hold , such as the morning - after pill and the drug RU - 486 , which blocks the action of hormones needed to keep a fertilized egg implanted in the uterus .
These drugs , as well as the IUD , or intrauterine device , which has been in use for decades , are deemed to fall “ within the sin of abortion . ”

“ Dignitas Personae [ dignity of a person ] , an Instruction of Certain Bioethical Questions , ” is an attempt to bring the Roman Catholic Church up to date with recent advances in science and medicine .
The document , the most authoritative of its kind from the Vatican in 20 years , says human life deserves respect “ from the very first stages of its existence [ and ] can never be reduced merely to a group of cells . ”
The 35 - page document says that only adult stem cell research is moral because embryonic stem cell research involves the destruction of embryos .
It also condemns freezing embryos , in - vitro fertilization and cloning .

Out of a class of 40 , this fourth - grade student was the only one who came to school on Dec. 16 . at Luis Urias Elementary in Ciudad Juarez , Mexico .
SCHOOLYARD BATTLEGROUND SCHOOLYARD BATTLEGROUND
Recent drug- related violence near schools in Mexico : • In Tijuana , Carlos Alfonso Ortiz Davila , 16 , was killed as he left Cecyte High School on Dec. 12 .
He was the nephew of Alfonso Duarte M jica , an outspoken army general who is leading the military 's anti-drug efforts in northwestern Mexico .
• On Sept. 29 , 11 bodies , their tongues cut out , were dumped across the street from Valentin Gomez Farias Elementary School in Tijuana .
• On Nov. 26 in Ju rez , seven bullet - riddled bodies were found outside Sierra Madre Elementary School .
•
In Mexico City , where much of the country 's wealth is concentrated , two students were snatched on their way to private schools .
On June 4 , gunmen kidnapped Fernando Mart , 14 , whose family owns a chain of sporting goods stores , while he was being driven to the British American School .
His body was found in a car trunk in August .
On Dec. 11 , the body of Silvia Vargas was recovered .
The 18 - year - old was kidnapped in September 2007 while driving to the exclusive Alexander Bain School .
Vargas ' father , the former head of Mexico 's National Commission on Sports and Physical Culture , waged an emotional campaign to find his daughter .
Thousands protested the kidnappings in August .
The federal government held a forum last month on ways to improve school security .
By Chris Hawley Enlarge By Chris Hawley , USA TODAY Parents crowd outside Luis Urias Elementary School to get homework assignments from teachers Dec. 16 .
Empty desks outnumber the students at Luis Urias Elementary School these days , a stark measure of the fear that hangs over the most violent city in Mexico .
In a classroom usually filled with 40 fourth - graders , a lone student was bent over a worksheet on a recent afternoon .
The class next door had only two students — 36 were absent .
" People feel like the schools are no longer safe , " Principal Berta Rodríguez says .
" They 're scared . "
About 90 % of the parents are keeping their children home from this school because of recent kidnapping threats , Rodríguez says , as the wave of drug - related violence in Mexico seeps into one of the last refuges : the schools .
The problem is particularly acute in Juárez , a city of 1.3 million across the Texas border from El Paso :
At least 1,530 people were killed this year .
The city 's body count is rising faster than Baghdad's , as the Juárez Cartel , the rival Gulf Cartel and the Mexican government fight a three - way war for control .
Beheadings , hangings and mass executions have become a nightly occurrence in this city known for its feminicidios — the unsolved murders of more than 300 women since 1993 .
Attacks are escalating
On a recent Sunday , 19 people were killed .
Sirens howled across the city that night , as gunmen launched simultaneous attacks on police at four locations , including outside a hospital emergency room .
Four police officers died , and fifth was wounded .
A few hours later , gunmen dumped a decapitated body by the curb , lined up three other men against a wall and shot them .
Then they hung banners listing 28 police officers they planned to kill .
" Let 's pray for Juárez City : we need it , " says a billboard over Triunfo de la Republica Avenue .
Down the block , a sign at a Burger King points out the restaurant 's security cameras and says , " Let 's look out for Juárez . "
The drug war began heating up here in December 2006 , when President Felipe Calderón dispatched the army to fight the cartels around the country .
The crackdown has turned border cities into battlegrounds , as the cartels fight back .
More than 5,300 people have died this year .
On Sunday , the decapitated bodies of nine men were found in the southern state of Guerrero , and some of the victims were soldiers , state Public Safety Secretary Juan Salinas
Altes says .
Until recently , schools had been mostly spared , says Sergio Belmonte , a spokesman for the Juárez city government .
He says authorities do n't think the cartels are specifically targeting schools .
But the drug war has tied up police and created a sense of panic , allowing petty criminals to take advantage of the situation .
" These are neighborhood delinquents , not traffickers , " he says .
" They know that if people think there is a general breakdown in law , they 're more willing to succumb to their demands . "
Since mid-November , the Juárez city government has posted guards and installed silent alarms at hundreds of schools after parents and teachers received extortion threats .
Other cities report similar cases .
Police in the border town of Matamoros said extortion attempts were directed at parents in three neighborhoods .
The Mexico City suburb of Cuautitlán Izcalli increased patrols around 420 schools this month after 11 schools had extortion threats .
Two Cuautitlán schools closed early for Christmas vacation because of threats .
" It 's more like terrorism than extortion , " Mayor David Ulises Guzmán says .
Education on hold The Luis Urias Elementary School sits in a subdivision of concrete houses built for thousands of factory workers at U.S. - owned maquiladoras , or assembly plants .
The pastel - colored paint on the houses has faded and cracked in the sun .
Streets are full of dusty used cars bought in the United States .
Three times a day , former U.S. school buses chug through the neighborhood , taking workers to the factories .
In mid-November , teachers and parents started getting telephone calls demanding protection money or the students would be kidnapped , Rodríguez , the principal , says .
The school closed for a few days .
Teachers chipped in to hire a security guard for about $ 120 a week .
On a recent Tuesday , the playground was empty .
Inside , teachers who normally handle 30 or 40 students per class chatted with the few who showed up .
Meanwhile , at the school 's front gate , teachers handed out homework assignments to a dozen parents who showed up while keeping their children home .
A few said they had not personally received threats but were playing it safe anyway .
" I 'm not taking my granddaughter there anymore , for fear something could happen to her , " Carlos Arellanes says .
At Juárez 's State High School No. 7 , Principal Edmundo Salazar points to the silent alarm button that police installed in his office this month , after two drug - related killings occurred within a block of the school .
The city is installing similar " panic buttons " in businesses and churches .
" I do n't know whether the button will do any good , " Salazar says .
" But if it makes people feel safer , that 's important .
There 's a lot of fear in the air right now . "

Have you ever wondered just how impatient people are ?
Well , 79 % of consumers who experience slow website speeds leave a website and avoid returning .
An additional 46 % say that slow loading websites are what they dislike most about browsing the internet on mobile devices .
A large percentage of consumers expect site page loading speeds of 2 seconds or less and abandon any website that takes more than 3 seconds to load .
This only means that if your website has slow loading pages , you are truly missing out .
Slow loading pages mean lower ranks on the search engines , decreased conversion rates , and in turn , reduced revenue .
A slow website impacts your ability to attract and retain customers in a significant way .
How Do You Know Your Page Load Speeds ?
Google PageSpeed Insights is one of the best online tools that will help you figure out your page loading speeds .
You ’ll not only get to know your website ’s current performance but get advanced tips about the latest top practices to help you enhance its performance .
There are more tools out there that can help , but Google PageSpeed Insights is free .
It ’ll also work for both desktop and mobile versions of your website .
The score runs from 1 to 100 , and anything over 80 is recommended .
How Do You Improve Slow Loading Pages ?
In a world where second makes the difference , it ’s clear that you need to make a few changes to your website to improve loading speeds .
Your customers expect nothing less than fast loading pages , so we ’ll show you how to speed up website pages .
Optimize Your Images
One of the most significant ways to increase your site speed is by optimizing your website images .
Loading images are one of the most taxing activities that affect your website performance .
A major part of it has to do with the image resolutions while the rest has to do with the level of compressions you use .
Use a Content Delivery Network
It ’s vital for your website that you consider where your servers are located and the users visiting the website .
The internet may be virtual , but not completely , because you need to consider the geographical scope as well .
To make it easier to understand , a person living in Los Angeles would have an easier time accessing your servers in San Francisco .
However , the same person would have a hard time accessing a server located in Chicago or as far as London .
A CDN improves site speed by choosing the server that closes to a user .
A professional Content Delivery Network will offer you page speed optimization tools , dynamic caching , security features , and high - speed storage to further improve your website performance .
Given that the world has become a global village and businesses are offering products and services worldwide , it ’s advisable to have a CDN that has incredible global network coverage .
Reduce Your HTTP Requests
Simple websites load the fastest .
If your websites are simple with a plain HTML and minimal compressed images , your page speed is bound to be fast .
If , on the other hand , your website has dynamic pages that have different content types and several HTTP requests , it ’ll certainly be bogged down .
To improve your slow loading pages , you must reduce the number of HTTP requests you have .
Clean up your code as much as you can , and watch your conversion rate rise .
Shrink Your CSS and JavaScript
One of the easiest ways to improve your site speed is by shrinking your JavaScript and CSS .
You only need to address any inefficient code to reduce the white space and all the redundant code .
The less code your website or website page needs to go through , the faster it ’ll load .
Use Dedicated Hosting
Shared hosting is essentially a cost - effective option , which is why most people choose to use it .
However , when you use shared hosting , you are not only sharing servers but bandwidth as well with others .
This means you get nor control over anyone using those resources and how they do it .
The problem with shared hosting is the fact that it is one of the customers sharing with you experienced an influx of traffic , you ’ll suffer as well .
To improve your site loading speeds , one of the best things you can do is get an advanced dedicated server from a professional hosting company for your website .
Get a Caching Plugin
If you do n’t have one yet , a caching plugin can significantly improve your page speed .
When users visit your website , the elements of the pages they visit are usually stored on a hard drive known as a cache .
Once the user revisits those pages , the browser loads the page much faster using the stored data instead of sending another HTTP request to the server .
With a caching plugin , you ’ll speed up loading time for your repeat users , and it ’s imperative to accommodate loyal customers .
Change Your Website Theme
You may not know this , but your website theme may be affecting your page loading speeds .
Themes with complex codes tend to be sluggish , despite a proper server configuration .
Consider changing your theme and make performance your priority and not aesthetics .
Run a demo and test your website speed using different themes to gauge which one works best .
Broken links affect user experience , and if they are on your JavaScripts , URLs , and CSS , they will undoubtedly affect your site speed .
Most of the time , you ’ll find broken links on image source files , and they are very easy to overlook .
When you have a broken link , a 404 error message appears , creating a wasted HTTP response and slowing down your website in the process .
Ready to Make Improvements ?
Having a fast website cannot be emphasized enough in today ’s world if you want your business to succeed .
Consumers want lightning - fast loading speeds , and with slow loading pages , all you ’ll get is low traffic , low conversion rates , low sales , and in the end , low revenue .
This is something you can’t afford , so strive to offer your customers a seamless experience by optimizing your page loading speeds .

SCO has filed a notice of appeal in the SCO v. Novell litigation , as they said they would : 567 - Filed & Entered : 11/25/2008
Notice of Appeal
Docket Text : NOTICE OF APPEAL as to [ 377 ]
Order on Motion for Partial Summary Judgment , , Order on Motion for Summary Judgment , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , [ 565 ] Judgment filed by SCO Group .
Appeals to the USCA for the 10th Circuit .
Filing fee $ 455 , receipt number 10880000000000796676 .
( Hatch , Brent )
Here 's the website for the US Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit , which is where we are headed .
You 'll see at the bottom of the page a link to download some of the initial paperwork that SCO 's attorneys are filling in these days , along with instructions .
If you read the instructions , you 'll get a taste of what appeals are like .
It 's below the notices about the resignation of one of the judges after allegations of judicial misconduct .
There is also a link for a PDF of instructions for filing a petition for review .
Here are the Rules and Forms and 2008 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and Tenth Circuit Rules ( F.R.A.P. effective Dec. 1 , 2007 ; 10th Cir. Rules effective Jan. 1 , 2008 ) .
The answers to many of your questions about process and what happens in an appeal are in there .
Also on the docket is the Report on the Filing or Determination of an Action or Appeal [ PDF ] , in this case a notice of final judgment , sent to the Register of Copyrights .
Attached is the Final Judgment being appealed .
But you 'll notice that the appeal will be of the Final Judgment but also specifically the decision by the Hon .
Dale Kimball dated August 10 , 2007 : Plaintiff , The SCO Group , Inc. , hereby appeals to the United States Court of Appeals from the Final Judgment entered in this action on November 20 , 2008 , including the underlying Order dated August 10 , 2007 .
This is likely pointing to SCO 's main issue , judging from media statements and court filings , that it wanted a jury trial and felt the court made an error hearing the case in Utah before a judge only .
Here 's the judge 's Order when he decided to hear the matter himself without a jury .
The August order was the one where the court ruled that Novell did not transfer copyrights to SCO under the 1995 APA .
To get an idea of some of the issues SCO had with the August 10th order , you can read SCO 's Reply Memorandum in Further Support of Its Motion for Reconsideration or Clarification of the Court 's August 10 , 2007 Order , as well as Novell 's Opposition Memorandum .
SCO 's motion was denied .
But we can probably expect some of the same arguments to show up in the appeal .
Update :
We 've reached the conclusion some years ago that you can discern what SCO is planning by reading what Maureen O'Gara writes , and indeed we have many clues in her latest : http://linux.sys-con.com/node/760745
As usual , it 's hilarious .
It reads like the lawyers or executives explained it to her , but she did n't quite catch all the balls in the air : SCO of course contends that Kimball utterly ignored the basic rules of civil procedure in issuing that summary judgment against it - and truth to tell Judge Kimball has an impressive string of overturned summary judgments to his name .
A summary judgment 's not supposed to weight evidence , champion one side 's interpretation of facts over the other 's , or decide that one set of witnesses is more credible than another .
As any first - year law student ought to know , when there are two sides to a story , as in SCO v Novell , a judge is n't supposed to pick one and issue a summary judgment .
That 's the business of juries .
As you see , she declares herself smarter about the law than the judge , who must be tired of such disrespectful and inaccurate media silliness , misspellings and all .
I 'll just point out that summary judgment is for questions of law , which is what juries are * not* supposed to decide .
Just read the Hon.
Dale Kimball 's Order , linked above , because it addresses her regurgitated " talking points " , which is why she ought to know better .
The reason he decided no jury was necessary was because the issues to be decided at trial had been narrowed by the August 10th summary judgment order to only equitable relief : " [ N ] ot all money claims are triable to a jury .
A historic equitable remedy was the grant of restitution by which defendant is made to disgorge ill - gotten gains or to restore the status quo , or to accomplish both objectives .
And when restitution is sought in the form and in the situations allowed in equity prior to the rules or authorized by valid statutes there is no right to a jury trial . "
SEC v. Commonwealth Chem. Sec. , Inc. , 574 F.2d 90 , 95 ( 2d Cir. 1978 ) .
Many of the cases cited by SCO are also distinguishable on the grounds that the plaintiff sought traditional legal damages .
For example , in Robine v. Ryan , 310 F.2d 797 , 798 ( 2d Cir. 1962 ) , the plaintiffs sought damages caused by the defendant 's misappropriation of plaintiffs ' invention , not a return of a res unjustly held .
And , in Pereira v. Farace , 413 F.3d 330 , 341 ( 2d Cir. 2005 ) , the trustee sought funds attributable to the company 's loss , " not the director 's unjust gain . "
The court in In re Lands End Leasing , Inc. , 193 B.R. 426 , 429-30 ( D. N.J. 1996 ) , granted summary judgment on the equitable claims and allowed the claims for compensatory and punitive damages based on alleged fraudulent conduct to proceed .
Therefore , the court concludes that Novell 's breach of contract , breach of fiduciary duty , constructive trust / restitution / unjust enrichment , and conversion claims are equitable in nature given the nature of the relief sought under these claims and the limited issues remaining for trial .
Accordingly , none of these claims provide a right to a jury trial .
Next , read the August 10th Order which found SCO guilty of conversion , speaking of ill - gotten gains , where he explains he did n't need to consider SCO 's witnesses , because the contract wording itself was clear , making it unnecessary to step outside the wording of the document itself , but if he had considered them , he 'd discount what they said because they were not directly involved in the actual contract writing and they contradicted each other : SCO 's extrinsic evidence regarding Santa Cruz 's inability to proceed with a cash deal appears to conflict .
Many of SCO 's witnesses refer to the value of the stock Santa Cruz provided as consideration as evidence that such a sum would purchase Novell 's whole UNIX - related business .
Such testimony , however , is at odds with other witness testimony stating that the deal would not have proceeded without the creation of a future revenue stream for Novell ....
The correspondence between Novell and Santa Cruz prior to the date the APA was signed shows that significant revisions were made to the agreement .
A September 8 , 1995 draft of Schedule 1.1 ( a ) , which listed the assets to be transferred , included " all patents , patent applications , copyrights . . . and all other intellectual property . . . that pertain to Unix or UnixWare . "
Decl .
Tor Braham at ¶ 15 , Ex .
6 . Novell 's outside counsel drafted a new schedule of assets to be included in the asset transfer as well as a schedule of assets to be excluded from the transfer .
Id . ¶ 15 .
The new Schedule 1.1 ( a ) deleted copyrights , patents , and all other intellectual property from the assets to be transferred .
The revised Schedule 1.1 ( a ) included only the UNIX and UnixWare trademarks as the " Intellectual Property " included in the transaction .
The new Schedule 1.1 ( b ) , which listed the assets excluded from the transfer , listed all copyrights , all patents , and all trademarks except for the UNIX and UnixWare trademarks .
Novell submitted evidence demonstrating that during the negotiations , David Bradford , Tor Braham , Aaron Alter , and Burt Levine all reviewed and approved the language in the Excluded Assets Schedule 1.1 ( b ) .
Id . ¶ 16 .
SCO has not provided evidence from witnesses on the Santa Cruz side of the transaction with respect to their review of the asset schedules .
In fact , there is no evidence from any of Santa Cruz 's outside counsel and very little evidence from Santa Cruz 's in - house legal department regarding the drafting of the APA ....
Both parties have also submitted in support of their respective interpretations of the APA extrinsic evidence of the parties ' conduct in relation to the APA .
The day before the APA was signed , David Bradford , Novell 's Senior Vice President and General Counsel , presented the agreement to the Novell Board of Directors for approval and reviewed its terms with them .
The minutes from that board meeting state : " RESOLVED . . .
Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement . . .
Novell will retain all of its patents , copyrights , and trademarks ( except for the trademarks UNIX and UnixWare ) . . . . "
There is extrinsic evidence from several individuals who were involved at different stages of the negotiations of the APA and from business people involved in the transition of the business to Santa Cruz .
Interestingly , many of the witnesses who were on the Novell side of the APA transaction went to work for Santa Cruz as a result of the deal .
The relevance of much of the testimony is questionable because few have a recollection of actual discussions regarding the transfer or retention of copyrights .
Many witnesses give an opinion as to whether they think the copyrights should have transferred , but they fail to establish an adequate foundation to support their opinion .
Novell , in contrast , as you see presented not just eyewitness reports by the authors , but the original drafts and redrafts of the contract , saved by the attorneys all these years .
As for the reference she makes to California law , note this section of the judge 's August order :
Thus , the language of the APA and Amendment No. 1 at the time of the Bill of Sale is clear : all copyrights were excluded from the transfer .
Apart from the language of the agreements , SCO maintains that it has provided the court with extrinsic evidence that the parties intended the APA to transfer the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights to Santa Cruz .
Under California law , extrinsic evidence is admissible both to support interpretations of contracts to which the language at issue is reasonably susceptible and to demonstrate the parties ' intent under contractual provisions that the court deems to be ambiguous .
Universal Sales Corp. v. Call Press Mfg. Co. , 128 P.2d 665 , 671-72 ( Cal. 1942 ) .
Therefore , oral testimony and other extrinsic evidence are not admissible to support an interpretation of a contract that is contrary to the plain language .
The critical issue is " whether the offered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible . "
Dore v. Arnold Worldwide , Inc. , 39 Cal. 4th 384 , 391 ( 2006 ) .
If the contract is not reasonably susceptible to the proposed interpretation , extrinsic evidence is inadmissible and does not create a triable issue of fact that would defeat summary judgment .
Id. at 388 , 391-93 .
When a contract is integrated , " extrinsic evidence is admissible only to supplement or explain the terms of the agreement -- and even then , only where such evidence is consistent with the terms of the integrated document . "
EPA Real Estate Partnership v. Kang , 12 Cal. App. 4th 171 , 175-77 ( 1992 ) .
The APA includes an express integration clause stating that the " Agreement , and the Schedules and Exhibits " " constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter . . . and supersede all prior agreements and understanding , both written and oral . "
APA § 9.5 . Novell and Santa Cruz further agreed , in connection with the Bill of Sale , that the APA is an integrated agreement not to be altered by any other understandings :
" It is acknowledged and agreed . . . that the Agreement is the exclusive source of the agreement and understanding between the Seller and Buyer respecting the Assets . "
Bill of Sale ¶ 5 . The parol evidence rule precludes SCO from relying on extrinsic evidence to try to rewrite the exclusion of " all copyrights " from APA because the language is unambiguous and not reasonably susceptible to SCO 's interpretation .
Moreover , even if the court considered the extrinsic evidence , there is significant evidence that the exclusion " all copyrights " was deliberate and consistent with the basic objectives of the APA .
While there is no specific evidence that business executives negotiated the issue of copyrights , the changes to the drafts of the agreement show that a significant change occurred .
Novell has provided extrinsic evidence supporting the change in the language and the fact that it was relayed to SCO , whereas SCO has failed to present any evidence from witnesses on its side of the transaction who had any involvement with the actual drafting or negotiation of the language in the contract .
SCO 's argument was , essentially , that despite the obvious wording , the parties * meant * something else .
Under California law , cited by the judge , you can't offer evidence that contradicts plain wording in a contract .
So there you are .
I 've provided only a taste of all the details , which she does n't seem to fully grasp , but SCO 's lawyers likely do .
And yet the saga continues .
And it never gets any less smarmy , does it ?
Which reminds me .

November 24 , 1997 - Federal Judge in the United States District Court for the District of Utah Here 's his judicial profile as originally published in the May 2002 Edition of the Federal Bar Association 's Utah Chapter Newsletter .
Justia has a list of cases filed before Judge Kimball , if you wish to do the heavy lifting of tracking it all .
Speaking for myself , and I believe most of you here , he established his reputation by our watching his work .
And if you still have any lingering doubt , note this decision , written by Judge Kimball , sitting by designation on the case with two appellate judges on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals .
The two heard the case with him , and he was asked to write the decision .
What does that tell a reasonable person ?
That they think very highly of him .
Case closed .
I was trying to think of a single person involved in any way in this litigation , even peripherally , who has n't ended up with his or her reputation slimed by SCO or their supporters .
How glad I will be when there is nothing left of SCO but an old blues song !
Update 2 : If you will turn with me please to page 31 of the Practitioner 's Guide to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit [ PDF ] , you 'll find the percentage of cases that are successfully appealed to that particular appeals court : B. Chances of Success .
The reversal rate in this circuit for the 12 - month period ending June 30 , 2006 was 10.2 % overall , broken down as follows : Criminal - 6.3 %
U.S. Prisoner Petitions - 6.1 %
U.S. Civil - 20.2 %
Private Prisoner Petitions - 13.5 %
Other Private Civil - 11.9 %
Bankruptcy - 18.8 %
Administrative Appeals - 2.1 %
Even if we imagine that Judge Kimball was the judge overturned on each and every successful appeal on that list , which he obviously was not , the number of decisions overturned on appeal is statistically very , very low .
Therefore , when SCO and / or its minions claim that Judge Kimball is often overruled , I think it 's obvious that it is n't so .
It ca n't be , if the overall statistic is a mere 10.2 % .

EVERY morning Kiewa Valley farmer George Barel rolls out of bed as the sun kisses the picturesque valley outside , heads to the kitchen and starts the day with a healthy breakfast .
He downs a freshly brewed cup of green tea — which has been grown in the paddock outside the kitchen — and enjoys a serve of Weet - Bix and milk .
Well - tanned Australian farmers , cups of green tea and healthy diets are n't a particularly well - known combination , but Mr Barel is something of a trailblazer .
He is one of about 10 farmers in Victoria growing green tea , a drink believed to fight cancer .

He enjoys a cup himself , but most of the crop from his 168,000 bushes is sold to the Japanese market .

But there 's something else about the unassuming 45 - year - old that makes him even more unusual : he 's the only one of the 10 who used to grow tobacco , a product known for a different kind of association with cancer .
While a small amount of the green tea grown by Mr Barel and his wife , Antoinette , goes into his teapot ( not hers — she prefers coffee ) , the rest ends up thousands of kilometres away , on the retail shelves of Japan , a nation of fanatical green tea drinkers .
Mr Barel supplies his tea to the large Japanese company Ito En .

Smith :
Now that the election is over , Carl , tell us more about those reports of infighting between Palin and McCain staffers .
Cameron : I wish I could have told you more at the time but all of it was put off the record until after the election .
There was great concern in the McCain campaign that Sarah Palin lack the degree of knowledgeability necessary to be a running mate , a vice president , and a heartbeat away from the presidency .
We ’re told by folks that she did n’t know what countries that were in NAFTA , the North American Free Trade Agreement , that being the Canada , the US , and Mexico .
We ’re told she did n’t understand that Africa was a continent rather than a country just in itself … a whole host of questions that caused serious problems about her knowledgeability .
She got very angry at staff , thought that she was mishandled ….. was particularly angry about the way the Katie Couric interview went .
She did n’t accept preparation for that interview when the aides say that that was part of the problem .
And that there were times that she was hard to control emotionally there ’s talk of temper tantrums at bad news clippings … …
Notwithstanding that there is to be an avalanche that will continue for many days now we ’re told of story upon story of the foibles of Sarah Palin .
__1968 : __Karen Schroeder , a second - generation resident of the Love Canal neighborhood of Niagara Falls , New York , gives birth to an infant girl with multiple birth defects .
The enormity of the neighborhood 's affliction will take a few more years to come to light .
Love Canal was a never -used , late 19th - century hydroelectric channel that was sold to the Hooker Chemical company in 1942 .
Between then and 1953 , Hooker used the site to bury 22,000 tons of chemical wastes in barrels .
Hooker sold the site to the Niagara Falls School Board for $ 1 , and the board built an elementary school there in 1955 .
A blue - collar suburban neighborhood flourished around the disused industrial site .
Flourished is probably the wrong word .
Schroeder 's parents found black sludge seeping through the walls of their basement starting in the late 1950s .
A woman who ran a beauty parlor in her basement developed a debilitating weakness and had to give up working .
Trees and shrubs died .
Noxious chemical smells hung over the neighborhood .
Schoolchildren developed strange rashes and vague , unexplained allergies .
Sometimes , they played with phosphorus - laden dirt that exploded with a crackle when lumps of it were thrown to the ground .
Baby Sheri Schroeder was born with an irregular heart beat and a hole in the heart wall , nasal bone blockages , partial deafness , deformed ears and a cleft palate .
As she grew , her family realized she was mentally retarded .
Her teeth arrived in a double row on her lower jaw , and she suffered from an enlarged liver .
Heavy rains in the mid-1970s caused groundwater levels to rise .
Swimming pools lifted up out of the ground .
The buried waste rose closer to the surface .
The Niagara Gazette began reporting in October 1976 about chemicals seeping into basements in the Love Canal neighborhood , with stories of harm to humans , pets and plant life .
Chemical analyses showed 15 organic chemicals , including three toxic chlorinated hydrocarbons .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state and county health departments began to take notice , testing the neighborhood 's soil , water and air , as well as blood samples from residents .
Still , it was August 1978 before the state health commissioner declared a state of emergency , closed the school and ordered an evacuation ... but only of pregnant women and children under age 2 .
Soon it was learned that Hooker had buried 200 tons of dioxin at Love Canal , that residents suffered a high rate of miscarriages , birth defects and chromosomal damage , and that 10 percent could develop cancer .
U.S. Rep. Al Gore ( D - Tennessee ) charged in 1979 that the tragedy had been avoidable .
He publicized a 1958 internal Hooker Chemical memo , describing three or four kids burned by materials at the Love Canal waste site .
The first lawsuits were filed in 1979 .
Early amelioration work released noxious smells in the neighborhood , and the evacuation area was widened .
More schools were shut down .
Government programs bought condemned homes and tore them down .
Hundreds of families evacuated , but 60 families remained behind .
Cleanup costs have been estimated at $ 250 million .
A federal judge eventually found Hooker Chemical negligent but not reckless , and parent company Occidental Petroleum settled with the EPA for $ 129 million .
An EPA regional administrator called Love Canal " one of the most appalling environmental tragedies in American history . "
The core area around the dump is still off - limits , but new buildings have been built nearby .
The neighborhood is now called Black Creek Village .

From The Cafferty File Nov. 17 , 2008 .
David Sirota has more at Daily KOS .
Republican Senator Jim Inhofe from Oklahoma wants to put a “ freeze ” on the remaining cash in the big government bailout of the financial industry .
In this week ’s lame duck session , Inhofe plans to push for legislation that will require Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ’s plan for the remaining $ 350 billion in the bailout package to be voted on in Congress .
Despite promises from Congressional leaders that there would be both , there is absolutely no transparency or congressional oversight on where the first $ 290 billion has gone .
Senator Inhofe suggests Paulson “ may have given the money to his friends . ”
Inhofe , who voted against the bailout package when it was originally passed , said in a letter to fellow lawmakers this weekend , “ It is Congress ’s duty to have a say in what happens with the remaining authorized amount of $ 350 billion .
It is clear that it was a mistake to sign a blank check to one man for such a tremendous amount of money . ”
Here ’s my question to you : Should Congress freeze the remaining bailout money ?
Robert from Wayne , New Jersey writes :
The bailout money should be frozen .
The entire bailout plan was hastily concocted by Congress to help improve their public image and make Americans believe the government was trying to help them .
When Congress rushes to pass a bailout plan worth $ 700 billion in less than a month , no one should be surprised that the money is being misused and unregulated .
Cee from Kansas writes :
Yes , freeze the remainder until there is accountability for the monies distributed to date .
Transparency was supposed to be built in to the plan .
Show us who got the money , how much they got , what they intend to do with it , and what they did with it .
Ken from Seattle , Washington writes : Yes .
Paulson duped us all into thinking the world was going to come to an end unless taxpayers gave him 700 billion dollars to do with as he pleased .
He gave taxpayers a wink and a nod regarding actually doing something constructive by helping homeowners hang onto their homes in order to convince us his intentions were good .
All he has done is help out his crooked cronies on Wall Street and in the banking community .
Brian from Puerto Rico writes : A freeze would seem a good move .
If they are unwilling to say what they have done with the money so far , they must have something to hide .
Jaime writes : Yes .
It is clear that Paulson and the Bush administration and even our Congress have no clue what is going on at this time and they ’re simply throwing money at everything that burps .
It is time for a short pause to put some deliberate thought into what is it we ’re trying to accomplish .
The fossilised remains of an ancient reptile that lived 220 million years ago may have solved the puzzle of how the turtle got its shell and , in the process , cleared up one of the most enduring mysteries of animal evolution .
It is the oldest known turtle - like fossil and its shell appears to be only half - formed , covering its belly but leaving its back unprotected .
Scientists believe it shows the evolutionary transition from the shell - less state of the earliest turtle ancestor to the fully formed shell of all living turtles .
Turtle shells are among the most intriguing structures in the animal kingdom , and zoologists have long argued about how this protective device and unusual body plan could have evolved from previously existing anatomical structures .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The latest discovery , made by palaeontologists excavating in China 's fossil - rich province of Guizhou , shows that the shell of the turtle evolved from bony growths that expanded from the spine and ribs , rather than the merging of bony plates found in the skin of some reptiles .
" Since the 1800s , there have been many hypotheses about the origin of the turtle shell , " said Xiao - chun Wu , a palaeontologist with the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa , Ontario , who was part of the research team .
" Now we have these fossils of the earliest known turtle .
They support the theory that the shell would have formed from below as extensions of the backbone and ribs , rather than as bony plates from the skin as others have theorised . "
Turtles have a unique body plan that has barely changed since the demise of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago , and its distinctive shell characteristically defines its place in the animal kingdom .
The discovery of the earliest turtle fossils was made in 2005 but the creature 's full scientific description and name – Odontochelys semitestacea – appear for the first time in the latest issue of the journal Nature , by a team led by Chun Li of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing .
" This is the first turtle with an incomplete shell , " said Olivier Rieppel of the Field Museum in Chicago , who was also on the team .
" The shell is an evolutionary innovation .
It 's difficult to explain how it evolved without an intermediate example . "
Turtle shells are divided into two parts .
The lower plastron covers the underside and protects the swimming turtle from predators attacking from below , and the upper carapace protects it from above .
The 220 - million - year - old fossil found in China has a fully - formed plastron indicating that the creature was free - swimming and needed to be protected from below , but lacks the back carapace .
" Reptiles living on the land have their bellies close to the ground with little exposure to danger , " said Dr Rieppel , explaining why the presence of the plastron shows that the ancient turtle must have been a

water dweller .
Instead of a fully formed upper shell , the fossil has flattened ribs and a broadened backbone which would have given it partial protection .
Its skull also contains teeth , which in later descendants are replaced by the horny beak possessed by modern - day turtles .
Some reptiles , such as crocodiles , have bony plates in their skin called osteoderms , also found in extinct relatives such as the dinosaurs .
This characteristic was seen as a possible explanation for the turtle shell if they fused into a single structure .
But studies showed that during embryonic development the turtle backbone expands outward and the ribs broaden to meet and form the shell .
This suggested an alternative evolutionary pathway which is now supported by the fossil found in China .
" This animal tells people to forget about turtle ancestors covered with osteoderms , " Dr Rieppel said .
A much more likely explanation is that the shell evolved from outgrowths of the rib and spine which eventually fused to form a single shell , as they do during embryonic development .
Animal magic Darwin 's theory
Scientists call them major transitions in evolution , but Rudyard Kipling made them into Just So stories to explain how , for instance , the elephant got its trunk .
Some changes are explained with the help of fossil intermediates that describe how one pre-existing anatomical structure can evolve into another , such as a front leg into a feathered wing .
Others have left no fossil traces .
How the frog got its legs
Amphibians such as frogs were the first terrestrial creatures with backbones .
Their legs evolved from the fins of fish and this vertebrate transition from a fully aquatic life to a terrestrial existence is seen in the fossil record with the " fishibians " , extinct creatures that are intermediate between fish and amphibians .
This transition from water to land occurred about 400 million years ago .
How the wasp got his stripes
Certain visible features are signs to warn off potential predators .
One of the best examples is the yellow and black stripes of wasps and stinging bees .
The sting protects it from being eaten by birds , but it is better to advertise clearly to stop something from even trying you for breakfast .
Many animals use bright stripes and zigzags as warnings .
How the elephant got his trunk
According to Kipling , the Elephant Child got its trunk on the banks of the Limpopo river by getting too near a crocodile , which caught the youngster by the nose , stretching it .
The reality is that the trunk is not just a long nose , but an extra limb .
It could have evolved in response to the increasing size of the ancestral elephants , making grazing by mouth difficult .
Another theory is that ancestral elephants lived an aquatic existence , and used their trunk as a snorkel .
How birds got feathers
Another major transition in evolution is the appearance of birds with feathered wings capable of powered flight .
Archaeopteryx , a fossil discovered in the mid-19th century , clearly shows the transition from reptile to feathered bird .
It lived about 150 million years ago and its feathered wings and breastbone are avian .
Experts believe feathers evolved to keep the dinosaurs warm , and later became useful for gliding and powered flight .
How the peacock got his tail
A special kind of natural selection has been at work on the peacock 's magnificent tail .
It is called sexual selection , a result of females choosing males with the biggest tails as mates .
How the giraffe got his long neck
In the 19th century , Jean - Baptiste Lamarck , a French scholar , suggested that the giraffe stretched to reach the highest leaves , and this caused changes passed to subsequent generations .
Charles Darwin's theory of evolution exposed the fallacy of this , showing that a trait such as this would come about as a result of natural selection .
Laurent Nkunda : War Nerd Hero
If you ever want to find a real hero , here ’s one way to recognize him : the TV news will be making him into a monster 24/ 7 .
Today ’s monster hero is the Tutsi general Laurent Nkunda , the leader of the “ rebel ” forces that are supposedly “ closing in ” on Goma in Eastern Congo .
The BBC , the only news agency that even pretends to take Africa seriously , has its number - one ghoul reporter , Orla Guerin , on Nkunda ’s case every day .
You may not know Guerin ’s name but if you like war news you ’ll recognize her , because you ’ve probably seen her reporting from some African death zone .
She fits right in in those places , really comes into her own .
She ’s got the face of a skull , except skulls smile , and some creepy accent that makes you think of cold porridge and leftover damnation .
Wherever she ’s from , they must have had a party when she left .
In this BBC video you ’ll see Orla talking about what a shame it is that the “ refugees ” at Kibati Refugee Camp have to stampede for food , worried as they are about being overrun by Nkunda ’s “ rebels . ”
The way Orla and the other networks are telling it , everything was just fine in Eastern Congo until the bad “ rebel ” leader Nkunda ordered his troops to advance .
When the innocent “ refugees ” heard Nkunda was coming , they started running , creating a “ human rights crisis . ”
The print media is getting in on it too , with the Brit rag The Guardian saying that Nkunda ’s troops may have actually “ killed civilians , ” as if that was anything unusual in Central Africa .
The Guardian ’s account barely mentions that the “ civilians ” killed were in a “ stronghold of Hutu militias ” — the same militias that killed most of the Tutsi population in Rwanda back in ’ 94 .
It ’s like if the Jews had formed an army to push back the Nazis , and when the poor Nazis fled next door , the Jews did an occasional incursion to discourage the Nazi “ refugees ” from returning to their genocidal ways .
And that ’s an atrocity .
Except the Nazis , give them their due , were brave as Hell and fought to the last man ; the Hutu “ militias ” were only good a hacking babies and raping little girls , and fled at the first rumor that the enemy was approaching .
That ’s why they ’re still around .
Every word , every disgusting damn word , of these BBC and Guardian stories is bullshit .
actually makes me sick , listening to these stupid lies over and over .
The reason Nkunda ’s little army ( estimates range from 5000 to 10000 men ) advanced into Eastern Congo this week is that the Hutu gangs were getting a little too aggressive about jumping ethnic - Tutsi villages in eastern Congo , killing the men and kidnapping women and girls as sex slaves .
Nkunda knows very well nobody else will protect the Tutsi , for the simple reason nobody ever has .
So he went in to do it himself .
Nkunda is a great man , a brilliant man , a hero , a military genius who speaks four languages and has beaten the biggest armies around with a force of less than 10,000 men .
He ’s the only decent leader that part of Africa ’s ever seen .
It ’s worth looking at the way they ’ve been slandering him , because you ’ll see the same techniques used to slam any real hero .
Let ’s start with the oldest trick in the book , calling somebody you do n’t like a “ rebel . ”
How did the BBC decide that Nkunda is a “ rebel ” ?
Does n’t there have to be a government , law and order , before you can rebel against it ?
Who is Nkunda supposed to be rebelling against ?
There ’s no law in the forests of Eastern Congo .
The UN has a pitiful token force of blue helmets wandering around slapping mosquitoes and bargaining for blow jobs with the local girls , but the real power there before Nkunda ’s forces marched in was held by the leaders of the Hutu “ refugees . ”
“ Refugee ” ; now there ’s another wonderful word , a good match for “ rebel . ”
It makes the Hutu the innocent victims , shivering in fright at the approach of the bad ol ’ Tutsi .
Well , of course that ’s another do - gooder lie .
These “ refugees ” are gangs run by the worst people in the world : the leaders of the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambe , the Hutu “ militias ” who massacred 800,000 Tutsi men , women , children and babies in Rwanda in 1994 .
In fact , “ militia ” is way too good a name for these overgrown death squads .
You ’ll find the BBC and the other networks have a whole range of names for kill groups : “ terrorist ” if they hate you , “ paramilitary ” if they ’re not sure but would n’t invite you to their kids ’ birthday parties , and “ militia ” if they like you .
Calling the Hutu genocide squads a “ militia ” is like calling Columbine a kids ’ prank .
The reason these Hutu are out in the jungle is simple : they massacred almost a million fellow Rwandans in less than four months , back in those happy Clinton years , and then ran when the Tutsi , who ’ve always been braver than the Hutu , formed a small army , the RPF , and chased the much bigger “ militias ” out .
The truth is that the Tutsi behaved so well through the whole thing that the world ought to be cheering them .
I tell you , if I ’d been in command of the RPF when it marched back into Rwanda stepping over piles of stinking corpses chopped up with machetes , I would have taken my cue from Foday Sankoh ’s name for his nutcase army ’s advance on Freetown up in Sierra Leone : “ Operation Kill Every Living Thing . ”
But the Tutsi did n’t do that .
They took no revenge , let the Hutu live and even tried to set up a decent government from both tribes .
They ’re fucking saints , and they ’re supposed to be the bad guys here ?
Let me remind you again , since nobody seems to want to remember : eight hundred thousand Tutsi civilians chopped to death with machetes in less than four months .
It was a real community effort by the Hutu , like one of the Amish barn raisings , only bloodier .
If you want a good look at how they did it , I recommend a book called Machete Season .
It ’s very simple , totally straightforward , just interviews with a gang of Hutu farmers who spent three months making daily expeditions into the local swamp , where surviving Tutsi civilians were trying to hide .
They all tell the same story : “ Every morning we got up , took our machetes and looked for Tutsis to hack to death .
Sometimes we gang - raped the pretty girls , because those Tutsi girls have such soft skin from all the milk they drink .
But we ’d kill them too when we were done .
After weeks of killing the Tutsi did n’t even resist any more .
They just stood there and waited for us to finish them off .
We had the time of our lives . ”
If you have friends or relatives who believe people are basically good or any such nonsense , give them this book for Christmas .
It ’ll straighten them right out .
People talk about “ the banality of evil ” but this is so much gnarlier than that .
These guys would n’t even get that notion .
The only people they feel sorry for are themselves , because they have to sit in prison for a while before the UN lets them go .
They talk about their “ misfortune ” meaning the fact that they got arrested .
In a way they ’re right , because they ’re just about the only Hutu murderers who got caught and punished at all .
The rest fled into the forests of Eastern Congo .
They ’re the “ refugees ” that Orla Guerin feels so sorry for : the frickin’ monsters who did their best to kill the whole Tutsi population of Rwanda in ninety days , like they were on one of those timed shopping sprees .
They did n’t change their ways in Congo , either .
The Hutu militias kept their machetes ( “ pangas ” ) , kept tight control of their people , and kept in practice by raiding local villages for women and girls .
They ’re famous for branding the women they capture like cattle , marking them as sex slaves forever .
Sometimes they let them go , when they ’re pregnant , so they can go back to their villages with a Hutu rapist ’s baby in their belly .
That must be a fun homecoming .
But most of the time , when they get tired of the woman they drag her into the forest , hack her to death , and leave her there for the animals .
You might be wondering where these fine specimens of humanity get their food and water .
Well , the UN , always ready to take the wrong side in any conflict , was right there to help them with food and water as soon as they fled from Rwanda when the Tutsi RPF advanced and retook the country in a few weeks .
It ’s a funny thing , the way the UN was there so fast to help these miserable pigs , because nobody did a thing while almost a million Tutsi were being killed .
It takes a while to kill that many people by hand .
It ’s downright aerobic .
And nobody , absolutely nobody , did a thing while machete season was in progress .
Oh , but the second the defeated Hutus , still dripping babies ’ blood , fled across the border , the blue helmets and white trucks were there with sacks of rice and consolation .
Until recently there was no real explanation for this .
Me , I did n’t think we even needed one : that ’s how it is , especially in Africa .
The bad guys always win , and the virtuous BBC reporters always take their side .
Well , I still think that ’s generally how it is , but one piece of the puzzle has gotten a lot clearer lately .
I ’m sad to say that the French were knee - deep in blood themselves , all through machete season , according to an independent report that came out in August 2008 .
Even I was shocked by how bad it was .
According to this report ,
“ France was responsible for killing some of the 800,000 people slaughtered in Rwanda between April and July 1994 , most of them minority Tutsis or moderate Hutus killed by Hutu militias .
“ French soldiers themselves directly were involved in assassinations of Tutsis and Hutus accused of hiding Tutsis , ” the report said .
“ French soldiers committed many rapes , specifically of Tutsi women . ”
France ’s late president , Francois Mitterrand , and former prime minister Dominique de Villepin were among a dozen French officials fingered in the report for providing support of ‘ a political , military , diplomatic and logistic nature . ’ ”
I wish now I ’d never defended the French ’s military rep the way I did back when all the NeoCons were bashing them .
Got a ton of abuse for that , and for what ?
So they could help wipe out the Tutsi , “ the tall people , ” one of the bravest , smartest , most soldierly tribes in the world .
And all because the French liked the way the Hutu spoke French .
That has got to be the most fucked - up reason for backing a genocide I ’ve ever heard : “ Ah , M’sieu , eez true zey killed babeez , but zey are so fluent !
Zee Hutu would nev-air use zee wrong pronoun ; when zey said , “ We have come to Keel you , leetul child , ” it was al - vays ‘ tu ’ and when zey said ‘ Now we will keel you , old man , ’ or ‘ old woman , ’ eet was zee respectful ‘ vous ’ !
And zeir accent , so Parisian ! ”
Yeah , a little revenge for the French I had to take in high school .
The pious Europeans love to talk about how Central Africa is the heart of darkness , how deep and dark and existential it all is , but they never want to mention how much they help keep it that way by always , always , always backing the most evil fuckers in the whole forest .
I knew that about the Brits ; they ’ve done things so awful in Africa that there ’s a whole publishing industry in London with the job of making sure the truth never comes out .
Which is why you get stories like Orla Guerin ’s or that crap in the Guardian .
And the funny thing is that the “ progressive ” newspapers and networks over there are the biggest liars , the best genocide - enablers around .
Well , now I see better that the French are just as bad .
I kind of thought they might not be ; there ’s always been this joke among military buffs that the French lose wars because they actually believe in fighting by the rules .
I remember reading this furious letter Queen Elizabeth sent to Henri IV — a really great man , greatest man of his time — cursing him for not wiping out the whole population of this Catholic town during the wars of religion .
But nah , this current crop of French , they ’re just as bad .
Nkunda will be dead soon .
You can count on it , when all the “ good ” people are lined up against him .
And those poor , poor “ refugees ” will be free to kidnap Tutsi girls and rape them and hack them up with their beloved pangas , and Orla can report that peace has returned to Congo now that the “ rebel ” is gone .

This page is no longer being maintained .
Please see the 2010 version .
I ’ve decided to take a cue from MLB Trade Rumors and make this free agent list a permanent page .
Here you ’ll find a list of all the Japanese - league players who are eligible after the 2008 season .
Read on , or jump to the list of impending international or domestic free agents .
NPB Free Agency Explained
NPB free agency is a little different from MLB free agency .
Starting this year , there are two categories of free agency : domestic and international .
NPB players qualifying for domestic free agency can only move to other NPB teams , while players qualifying for international free agency are free to try their luck abroad as well .
Players drafted prior to 2007 must reach 8 years of service time to qualify for domestic free agency , while players drafted from 2007 onward only require 7 years of service .
International free agency requires 9 years of service time for all players .
One year of service time is defined as 145 days on the team ’s top roster .
Time spent on the farm time or injured list does not count as service time toward free agency .
This is why guys like Kenshin Kawakami and Koji Uehara wo n’t be free agents until after this year despite having started their careers in the late 90’s .
NPB teams signing NPB free agents are required to compensate the player ’s former team with either money or players .
The system is changing considerably for the 2008 /9 off season .
I ’ve written about this in a little more detail in an earlier post .
MLB teams do not pay compensation to NPB teams when signing NPB free agents .
Unlike MLB , it is not uncommon for NPB players to forgo their right to declare free agency and remain with their previous team .
In fact , exercising free agency rights seems to be more the exception than the norm in NPB .
This makes the common MLB practice of trading impending free agents as rentals non-existent in Japan .
One tactic Japanese teams will employ is posting obviously MLB - bound players a year before they hit free agency .
International Free Agents
Koji Uehara ( P , Yomiuri Giants ) :
Of the current crop of upcoming free agents , Uehara is the most outspoken about his desire to play in MLB .
I ’ve profiled him and ranked him against Kawakami and Iwase .
Final Update : signed with Baltimore .
Kenshin Kawakami ( SP , Chunichi Dragons ) : Chunichi’s top starter is also likely to bolt for MLB .
Get a closer look at him here .
Final Update : signed with Atlanta .
Hitoki Iwase ( RP , Chunichi Dragons ) : The Dragons ’ veteran lefty closer is a free agent again this year .
We ’ll see if he hangs around or decides to try his hand at MLB .
I ’ve profiled him here .
Update Nov 1 : Iwase will decline free agency and remain with Chunichi .
Tomohiro Nioka ( SS , Yomiuri Giants ) : I ’m not sure if Nioka will rack up the service time he needs to move internationally by the end of the season .
He ’s gotten some negative publicity over his extra-marital flirtation with a TV newscaster this season , so the Giants may be ready to move on from him .
Update Nov 1 : My gut feeling is that the Giants are done with Nioka .
Nippon Ham is interested .
Update Nov 23 : Traded to Nippon Ham , will play in Hokkaido next season .
Masahiro Araki ( 2B , Chunichi Dragons ) : Araki has hinted at trying the free agent market , but I would be surprised if he signed elsewhere .
Update Sept 9 : Staying put .
Hirokazu Ibata ( SS , Chunichi Dragons ) : Nikkei Sports reports that Ibata will remain with Chunichi and “ has no interest in filing for free agency . ”
Update Nov 1 : Staying put .
Ryoji Aikawa ( C , Yokohama BayStars ) : I do n’t see him leaving Yokohama .
Aikawa comments on his free agency : “ when I joined the team I did n’t think I could do this .
I ’ll consider what to do after the season . ”
Update Oct 25 : Aikawa has already announced his intent to declare free agency , with a move to MLB a possibility .
He ’s taken in some MLB playoff action and intends to participate in tryouts as a winter league invitee , but I do n’t see him getting more than a minor league contract .
Back in NPB , Yakult is interested in acquiring Aikawa to fill starting catcher role that no one has claimed since the retirement of the great Atsuya Furuta .
Update Nov 23 : Definitely leaving Yokohama , Yakult remains the most interested .
Final Update : signed with Yakult .
Tatsuhiko Kinjoh ( CF , Yokohama BayStars ) : According to Sponichi , Kinjoh is not planning on declaring free agency and will stay with the BayStars , at least for another year .
Naoyuki Ohmura ( CF , Softbank Hawks ) : Ohmura has stated publicly that he wants to try his hand at MLB .
“ I want to go , ” says Ohmura , “ life is short and you only get one chance at it . ”
Ohmura is a contact hitter with zero power .
He can probably start for an NPB team that gets power from other positions , or be possibly be a 4th outfielder type in MLB .
Think So Taguchi .
Update Nov 1 : Traded to Orix , missed qualifying for free agency by 13 days .
Norihiro Nakamura ( 3B , Chunichi Dragons ) : “ Not interested in other teams ” were his exact words .
Has had two MLB flirtations and drama at Kintetsu / Orix before finally settling into a groove with Chunichi .
I ca n’t see him anywhere else .
Update Nov 23 : did a 180 and filed for free agency because Chunichi wanted to move him off third and give him a one - year contract .
Looks set to join Rakuten .
Dec 14 : Did indeed move to Rakuten .
Masafumi Hirai ( RP , Chunichi Dragons ) : Qualified for free agency last year , but elected to sign a one year contract with Chunichi .
Having a bad season .
Kind of an MLB sleeper type .
Update , Oct 21 : not filing for free agency ; will attempt to regain his form with Chunichi .
“ If I had put up really great results this year I probably would have thought about it , ” said Hirai .
Atsunori Inaba ( OF , Nippon Ham Fighters ) : Inaba ’s contract is up , but he ’s unlikely to move .
Inaba had looked to play in America when he originally qualified for free agency , but was only offered minor league contracts .
Update Nov 1 : As expected , will remain with Nippon Ham .
Daisuke Miura ( SP , Yokohama BayStars ) : Miura is finishing up a six - year contract with Yokohama .
Hanshin is already gearing up to make a play for him .
Update Nov 1 : Hanshin is preparing to offer Miura a 4 - year / 12 - oku yen ( $ 12 M ) contract .
Miura says he wants another shot at a title .
Final Update : re-signed with Yokohama .
Kim Dong - Ju ( 3B , Doosan ( Korea ) ) : Orix is looking at Kim as their third baseman for next year .
EastWindup Chronicle has his numbers and some analysis .
Final Update : staying in Korea .
Tasuku Hashimoto ( C , Chiba Lotte Marines ) : Hashimoto feels like he can start , but is stuck behind all - star Tomoya Satozaki , so I think he ’ll be likely to try his fortunes somewhere else .
A number of teams are rumored to be interested after his strong 2008 season ( .311 , 11 hr off the bench ) , but Hanshin is expected to make the biggest play to sign him .
Current Tigers catcher Akihiro
Yano wo n’t last forever , and there ’s no internal heir apparent .
Update , Nov 23 : Staying with Lotte .
Saburo ( OF , Chiba Lotte Marines ) : Saburo ’s two - year contract is coming to an end , and he ’s considering his options , which includemoving to MLB .
Saburo is quoted as saying , “ I ’ve compared myself to the major league rightfielders that I see on TV , and if I ’m going to go now is my only chance . ”
Saburo is coming off a solid offensive season ( .289/.359/.416 ) and has won Gold Gloves in 2005 and 2007 , but he still profiles as a 4th outfielder on most teams .
Update , Nov 23 : Staying with Lotte , after initially saying he ’d try MLB .
Tyrone Woods ( 1B , Chunichi Dragons ) : Yahoo ( via Daily Sports ) reported that Tyrone Woods is going toleave Chunichi after the season ends .
Woods put up another strong season in the Central League despite turning 39 in August , and should attract plenty of interest around NPB if he chooses to stay .
I could see him moving to MLB too — if Darryl Ward can stick for the whole year on the 97 - game winning Cubs , I have to think there ’s a place for Woods somewhere .
Final Update : does n’t have a contract going in to the 2009 NPB season .
Retired ?
Hiram Bocachica ( OF , Saitama Seibu Lions ) : Like most foreign players in Japan , Bocachica is playing for Seibu on a one - year contract .
Though he played only 78 games , Bocachica hit a surprising 20 home runs this season .
This blogger wants his Marines to go after him this offseason , but Hiram told Deanna that he was n’t sure about staying in NPB .
Update , Nov 23 : Staying with Seibu .
Ken Takahashi ( SP , Hiroshima Carp ) : Takahashi is coming off a resurgent season with Carp , and there ’s a chance he ’ll opt for free agency .
It looks like teammate Hiroki Kuroda inspired this : “ I ’m interested in seeing what American baseball is like .
The image of Kuroda has had a big impact .
I ’m struggling ( with the decision ) ” .
Takahashi is a lifelong Carp and 40 at the beginning of next season .
I think it ’s either Hiroshima or America for him .
Update , Nov 23 : wants to try MLB , will draw some limited interest .
Final Update : signed minor league deal with Toronto .
Colby Lewis ( SP , Hiroshima Carp ) : Lewis put up a great year for the Carp , and has already re-signed and should be Hiroshima ’s opening day starter next year .
Hiroshi Shibahara ( CF , Softbank Hawks ) : Sponichi reports that Rakuten is targetting Shibahara as the first free agent acquisition in the team ’s four year history .
Shibahara is still a useful player and would fill a veteran role for the team .
Update , Nov 23 : Nothing in the news on this guy , but apparently did n’t file for free agency .
NPB -only Free Agents
Ryota Igarashi ( RP , Yakult Swallows ) :
The hard - throwing reliever will carefully think over his options in the off - season .
He ’s eligible for domestic free agency , and he ’s in his first year back from Tommy John surgery .
Update Nov 1 : Staying with Yakult for now , with an eventual eye to the majors .
Akihiro Higashide ( 2B , Hiroshima Carp ) : Higashide made some comments that you do n’t typically hear from Japanese players : “ I ’ve worked hard to reach free agency .
This is the result of year after year of fighting to be my best .
I have to put good results in this kind of year . ”
True to his words , Higashide is in the midst of a break - out season , third in the Central League with a .334 BA ( career BA : .255 ) .
It looks like he ’s qualified for domestic free agency ; there is speculation that he could draw interest from Hanshin , Yomiuri , and Chunichi .
I would hate to see Hiroshima lose yet another star .
Update , Oct 25 : Yokohama is showing interest .
Update Nov 23 : signed a four - year deal to stay with Hiroshima .
Hisanori Takahashi ( SP , Yomiuri Giants ) : Takahashi just recently qualified .
“ I ’ve got this season on my mind and right now I do n’t have the luxury of thinking about it , ” said Takahashi , adding “ it ’s a milestone , and a personal reward .
I want to think about what to do as an individual baseball player . ”
Update Nov 23 : signed a one - year deal to stay with the Giants .
Naoyuki Shimizu ( SP , Chiba Lotte Marines ) : Shimizu was set to be a hot commodity among NPB teams this winter , drawing rumored interested from Hanshin , Rakuten , Yakult , Yokohama and the Giants , but has recently revealed that he intends to pass on free agency this year with an eye toward the majors later on .
Shingo Ono ( SP , Chiba Lotte Marines ) :
After a little indecision , Ono appears to be leaning towards free agency .
“ I feel like would like to remain with Lotte , but they ’re developing good young pitchers and I have to think about moving .
I have confidence that I can play for another team . ”
Yokohama is rumored to be interested in his services .
Update , Nov 23 : staying with Lotte .
Hidetaka Kawagoe ( RP , Orix Buffaloes ) : Reportedly ready to move after being offered a pay cut by Orix .
( Thanks to reader Jeff B for the tip ) .
Update Nov 23 : re-signed with Orix after all .
Wednesday 24 December 2008 We 're From the Government , and We'll Protect You Share This :
Stratfor 's podcast on the seizure of that Saudi oil tanker contained a fascinating tidbit : merchant ships are no longer allowed to carry arms at all , which , of course , makes piracy far easier .
This is a dramatic transformation of the rights of merchant ships .
Historically , private ships carried weapons when sailing far out of their own waters , and such weapons were an important deterrent to piracy .
As the nation state has claimed primacy over other entities , and exclusivity on the use of force , it has also worked an inter-national system based on the idea that only the state may employ violence .
Entities which are n't governments , say shipping conglomerates , do n't get a vote .
I did n't realize that extended as far as officers of ships being unable to carry sidearms .
I had wondered why ships sailing the Gulf of Eden did n't convoy for mutual protection , and apparently the answer is that they can't offer each other any .
A few small machine guns would dramatically alter the payoff choices that pirates make .
As is , they 're restricted to non-lethal means like water cannon .
Of course , to maintain it 's monopoly on the legitimate use of force , the state cannot allow even sidearms on ships .
The State 's attitude toward piracy is the same as their attitude toward domestic crime : Only WE can be trusted to use force .
You can not be trusted to defend yourself .
Your only recourse is to call US , no matter how bad a job we do .
Or as Richard Stevens aptly put it ,
The solution , of course , is to allow merchant ships to defend themselves .
But you wo n't see that option " on the table " in D.C. Printer Friendly Brad - Wednesday 24 December 2008 - 14:26:13 - Permalink
We 're hearing talk now about the U.S. Government invading Somalia because of all the Somali pirates .
Which is rather like bombing New York because of the activities of the Mafia .
But what the government would like you not to notice is that their policies have caused this problem .
From Emergent Chaos
The State 's attitude toward piracy is the same as their attitude toward domestic crime : Only WE can be trusted to use force .
You can not be trusted to defend yourself .
Your only recourse is to call US , no matter how bad a job we do .
Or as Richard Stevens aptly put it , " Dial 911 and Die . "
The solution , of course , is to allow merchant ships to defend themselves .
But you wo n't see that option " on the table " in D.C .
Living in the Netherlands , ca. 1998 , meant increasingly being confronted , not just with that ubiquitous icon of wannabe rebel teenager identity , the drearily mass produced Che tee , but training jackets and the like saying DDR , or CCCP .
Not because there was any suddenly resurging affinity for the former Eastern Bloc regimes , but because those were the thing to have for any self - respecting ironic hipster .
It went with , say , nodding your head to the latest abstract beats , or dancing to the soundtrack of a soft lesbo porn movie from the seventies with a knowing smile .
Are n’t we being cool !
I never got it .
Stunned at the baffling lack of … awareness , I suppose .
Even if I knew that no disrespect was intended toward , say , the victims of communism — all was tongue - in - cheek , after all !
The postmodern game being played out transformed me , instantly , into an old crank .
It did so right at the moment that I refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of that irony ; the moment I failed to think , “ oh that ’s OK then ” .
I mean , these guys were my age !
Were they not in high school nine years earlier , when the Velvet Revolution succeeded , the wall was torn down ?
Or when the tanks rolled into Moscow in August 1991 ?
I was twenty , and on holiday in Slovakia – and the sense of impending doom that day was real enough to dent any consciousness , I ’d have thought .
In December 1989 I walked through Prague , days before Havel was elected President , and everywhere were the flags , the posters , the handpainted signs and banners from the month before , full of a heady mix of bravery and witticism .
Even if some of these kids were only 14 at the time , did they not feel it ?
Did none of them read the chilling newspaper reports about the Lithuanians who , thanks to Perestroika , found the Siberian graves of their compatriots , the peers of their parents ?
How can you wear a CCCP shirt now , just twenty years after these regimes came down ?
My humorless baffledness , I suppose , effectively marked my place on the wrong side of the generation divide .
It was right there , on my left , a line of mocking chalk .
I was suddenly the bimillennial equivalent of those stern old men who , in the 1960s , shook their heads disapprovingly at the revolting students waving the hammer and sickle flag , and lectured them about the red menace , quoting Radio Free Europe .
And me a leftie in heart and soul .
But you know what ?
I ’m unrepentant .
Living in Hungary in 2008 , I find it even more distasteful to see one of those guys strolling down Andrassy Boulevard , every once in a while , a tourist from France or England or Spain .
They must be producing those CCCP sweatshirts in some factory now , in postmortal births .
Maybe even in Romania , where workers are cheap – there ’s your irony .
Seriously , what are these guys ( somehow always guys ) thinking ?
I ’m going on holidays to Budapest , let ’s see if my Soviet Union shirt gets all the Hungarian girls ?
Did they really never stop to remember , just for a second , that the Soviet Union was an occupying force here , lived through by the parents of said same girls ?
Looming in the background , is that a failure of the education system , or of public discourse , which never approached the Stalinist horrors quite like the Nazi ones ?
The fact that communism limped on in totalitarian , but less genocidal fashion for three decades after Stalin blurs the comparison of course , but come on – even if Hitler had been succeeded by fascist dictators of a more pedestrian Pinochet - type calibre for 35 years , would that have made the swastika any less a taboo ?
I admit to a double standard of my own , though .
Maybe it ’s the “ only Jews can make Jewish jokes ” rule .
Only black people can say “ nigger ” .
Some ten years ago , the Hungarian house act From -> did a techno remix of an old communist song , Polyushka .
It stormed the charts .
So did the album of old communist songs it accompanied , “ Best of Communism “ , produced by the manager of the Statue Park , Ákos Réthly .
I can easily see why .
Same with the rampant Ostalgie that swept the former East - Germany over this past decade .
People ’s relationships with their pasts are complicated .
We all have memories of childhood , of our coming of age – fun games , loving parents , first loves , first jobs .
And their backdrops .
Hell , when I was ten , fifteen , inner cities were pockmarked with empty plots and boarded up buildings – after all , unemployment was high , the metropolitan building boom that would devour cities in the nineties was still to come .
Now , when I see an empty plot in the middle of downtown , some overgrown debris in a corner , I feel nostalgic and sigh about how everything ’s changed – damn all that shiny new glass and steel .
No different here , and more so .
Nostalgia appears like it would anywhere – except it ’s reinforced by just how much the world has changed , how much more drastically still here than in the West .
Not to mention the complicated mechanisms of rejection and defence , accounting and justifying , at work in the memories of jobs and positions past .
Of choices and relationships .
Who was what , and to what extent responsible for which ?
People were robbed of their past , if you will , or at least of their understanding of the past and past self - understandings , as competing discourses tumbled over each other .
Most of all in the GDR , where much of the finger - pointing was unidirectional , from West to East , and the reckoning with the criminal past bled over into an attempted eradication of all artifacts of the past , traffic light figures and all .
Add in the dynamics of how the confrontation with the cruelties and betrayals of the totalitarian past uneasily matched up with the sudden struggle for survival in the rubbled economies of the 1990s .
The chasm in experience between the bright new , European , free market future celebrated by the elites , and the massive drop in living standards that regular people suffered , compared to the last decade of communism .
No wonder a more innocent version of the past , as offered in bittersweet retro-musicals like Sonnenallee or Csinibaba , was gratefully embraced .
But no , that does n’t excuse the West - European brats who blithely don their retro- gear , least of all those who bring it here .
While you find some native nostalgia in recycling past symbologies here too ( there ’s a long - standing communist - themed cafe in Buda called Marxim , for example ) , it ’s by necessity shot through with ambiguity .
Cycling through Western Hungary , a colleague last year off - handedly noted that the prison camp her grandfather had been held in by the communists had been nearby – and recounted how he ’d never been the same on return .
History is recent .
So those lads from the West bringing their red starred t- shirts are just insensitive buffoons far as I ’m concerned – even if they mean it , but especially if they do n’t .
I just ca n’t bolster the patience to analyse the sociological why and how come of it .
Which is why it ’s good to come across a paragraph like this .
It ’s from a TNR review of – or should that be : broadside against – Slavoj Zizek ’s new book .
I have n’t read Zizek , and have no opinion on him .
But the review happens to include this one paragraph , which has more deep thought on the phenomenon than I had the patience to summon in any of the above :
Zizek is a believer in the Revolution at a time when almost nobody , not even on the left , thinks that such a cataclysm is any longer possible or even desirable .
This is his big problem , and also his big opportunity .
While “ socialism ” remains a favorite hate - word for the Republican right , the prospect of communism overthrowing capitalism is now so remote , so fantastic , that nobody feels strongly moved to oppose it , as conservatives and liberal anticommunists opposed it in the 1930s , the 1950s , and even the 1980s .
When Zizek turns up speaking the classical language of Marxism - Leninism , he profits from the assumption that the return of ideas that were once the cause of tragedy can now occur only in the form of farce .
In the visual arts , the denaturing of what were once passionate and dangerous icons has become commonplace , so that emblems of evil are transformed into perverse fun , harmless but very profitable statements of post - ideological camp ; and there is a kind of intellectual equivalent of this development in Zizek ’s work .
The cover of his book The Parallax View reproduces a Socialist Realist portrait of “ Lenin at the Smolny Institute , ” in the ironically unironic fashion made familiar by the pseudo - iconoclastic work of Komar and Melamid , Cai Guo-Jiang , and other post - Soviet , post - Mao artists .
He , too , expects you to be in on the joke .
But there is a difference between Zizek and the other jokesters .
It is that he is not really joking .
Cooking Bread - making
The Easiest Way to Make the Best Bread !
A note about Scottish Batch Loaves and Tins
This century , breadmaking has become a mechanised process in Scotland .
Most people are used to loaves with a rectangular shape caused by the tins in which bread is formed and baked .
In fact the distinctive Scottish loaf is called a " Batch Loaf "
At the last moment the dough is formed by square sided tins , then put all together into the oven so that each side merges with the next , and only after baking are they pulled apart into individual loaves .
Breadmaking is unexpectedly easy !
Here we have a way of making bread which is more like the bread of old , before the factories took over .
We 've illustrated one loaf ... but you could make several , put them in the oven together , and they 'll join up just like the Batch Loaves of 200 years ago .
All you need is a flat baking tray , a mixing bowl , a spoon , some flour , water , salt , and a bit of yeast .
You do n't even have to measure the ingredients exactly .
Make it once and follow your instincts , and you will get a feeling about how to make it just right .
You dont even need to spend much time either ....
Only 15 minutes actual work for you , the dough itself ( and oven ) does the rest .
Ingredients :
White flour , Salt , Yeast , Water
The Flour Unbleached organic flour is creamy white and has the best taste and appearance , but any flour is OK .
The best " strong " breadmaking flours are a blend of " hard " North American wheat and other softer wheats .
This combination gives a good rise and a springy texture .
About a pound and a half makes a good sized loaf .
You can add a handful of wholewheat flour for a more rustic loaf .
If you 're using dried yeast , mix it in now .
Water , yeast and salt : Dissolve a teaspoon of salt in a jug of room - temperature water .
Pour some into the middle of the flour and stir it with a spoon .
Keep pouring until the dough sticks onto the spoon making it difficult to stir any more .
Experience tells exactly how much water to add , and it's impossible to measure a quantity that will always work because different flours have different absorbtion rates .
The less yeast you use the better the bread ...
I usually halve the packet recommendations .
Any kind of yeast is fine .
Salt is important not only for the taste , but also because it slows down the action of the yeast giving more time for flavour to develop ... ( see below ) Kneading :
When the dough is too stiff to stir , knead it with your hands .
If it 's too wet add some more flour , if it 's too dry add more water .
About 2 to 5 minutes is fine , though more kneading makes the bread dough even happier .
You can knead in the bowl or on the table .
Traditional French cook 's saying : " Il faut mettre le main à la pâte " - " You have to put your hands into the paste ! "
Kneading is as simple as turning and squeezing and folding .
Rising : Clean the bowl , neaten up the dough by forming it into a self - contained shape , then cover it with something to keep it moist and keep out the dust .
Leave it in a cool place to rise .
So far all your work has only taken 10 minutes !
Most people think you have to leave it in a warm place .
This is not true !
By leaving it in a cool place the yeast takes longer to rise the dough , but it has more time to develope all the subtleties of taste which take time to be developed .
12 to 24 hours rising is best .
I sometimes even raise the dough in the cool compartment of the refridgerator .
Shaping :
When the dough has grown , bring it into the warmth for an hour before you squash it down and knead it a bit more .
At this point kneading means just folding it over a few times and shaping it into its final form on a flour - sprinkled table top .
Making holes with your finger tips encourages air - pockets which will expand and leave holes in the bread when it 's baked ... one of the signs of good bread .
Proving :
Here 's the dough shaped and ready to " prove " and lying on top of a generous sprinkling of flour ( to stop it sticking ) on a baking tray .
Proving is leaving the shaped dough in a warm place , covered with an inverted bowl so the draughts do n't get to it .
Now you want the yeast to get a second go at rising the dough ... quickly this time .
Proving bread dough hates draughts and loves moisture and warmth .
A plastic shopping bag as a cover works too , but try not to let it touch the expanding dough in case it sticks to it .
After about 1 / 2 hour check to see that it 's rising well , then put the oven on to its highest temperature
Wet your hand with a little water and dampen the top ( careful not to let drips go down the side onto the dry flour on the tin .
A damp top helps encourage a good crispy crust .
Cutting : With a very sharp knife make quick cuts .....
There are three varieties of cut ; chequer - board , parallel cuts , or a cross cut .
Then straight away into the hot oven ...
If you do n't cut the top , the bread will make its own cuts , usually around the base so that the top rises up like a separate dome .
Baking :
The best bread is baked in a wood fired oven ...
Wood guarantees a critical amount of moisture surrounding the bread for the first few minutes of baking .
Not many of us have wood fired ovens , but a similar effect can be got by boiling a kettle , placing a flat oven - proof dish in the bottom of the oven , and as soon as you 've put the bread into a shelf half - way up the oven , carefully and quickly pour 1 / 2 inch of boiling water into the oven - proof dish , then close the door immediately .
The resulting steam will let the bread dough make a final extra rise during the first 5 minutes of baking .
Leave the oven at high for about 10 minutes then turn it down to medium and continue baking for another 40 minutes ; 50 minutes in total .
Check it once or twice near the end to make sure it's not getting too burnt , and adjust the temperature if it is Click on the oven for the result ... ( and the next page ... )

' War criminal Bush ' blamed for worldwide crises Agence France - Presse
Published : Saturday November 22 , 2008
Print This Email This PROTESTERS have demanded that US President George W Bush get out of Peru where he is attending an Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) summit , blaming him for the world economic crisis .
" Bush out , " about 1000 demonstrators chanted in the center of the capital Lima , watched by scores of police in riot gear who made sure they did not move towards the APEC summit venue several kilometers away .
" This crisis did n't come from the Peruvian people .
We should n't have to pay for it , " a union leader told the crowd , which demonstrated peacefully .
Mr Bush , one of 21 leaders of Asia - Pacific economies converging on Lima for the weekend summit , arrived shortly after the protest .
He was escorted under tight US Secret Service and Peruvian police security from Lima airport to the army headquarters building housing the APEC meetings .
Friday 's anti-Bush protest , organized by Peru 's biggest labor union , charged that Mr Bush 's decision to wage a costly war in Iraq contributed to the financial and economic crises .
" The International Criminal Court should try him for crimes against humanity , war crimes and crimes of aggression , " a big banner next to the main stage for the rally proclaimed .
" Bush - genocide .
The Peruvians repudiate your crimes , " said another .
" We believe that Bush is responsible for the fall of the financial system , " explained Aldo Gil Cristostomo , a 54 - year - old mechanic standing near other protesters carrying portraits of Che Guevara .
" The war in Iraq is partly responsible for the fall , " he said .
Mr Cristostomo added that , while he had more sympathy for Mr Bush 's successor , Barack Obama , he believed the Democrat " is going to maintain the neo- liberal system " championed by the current US president .
Lima was filled with 39,000 police officers ensuring that none of the heads of state and government would be able to see any demonstrations .
At least five people who were among 20 protesters holding a separate against corruption close to the summit venue were arrested late Thursday .
The participants had tried to release a number of live rats in a gesture decrying graft in Peruvian public life , the organizer , Fidel Supo , said in a video published on the website of El Comercio newspaper .
Ford first bought a stake in Mazda in 1979
Troubled US carmaker Ford Motor is selling a 20 % stake in Japan 's carmaker Mazda Motor , the Japanese company has said .
Ford owns a 33.4 % stake in Mazda .
The move will reduce it to just over 13 % .
Ford has been hit hard by falling sales around the world and is seeking to raise cash along with its Detroit competitors .
Shares in Mazda jumped 6.4 % on Tuesday on reports about the possibility of the stake sale .
General Motors has sold its 3 % stake in Japanese carmaker Suzuki for $ 230 m ( £ 156 m ) .
Declining value
The possible sale of a 20 % stake in Mazda was first reported more than a month ago .
At that moment , the stake was valued at $ 850 m .
However , based on Mazda 's share price on Tuesday , the value of the holding has fallen to $ 543m .
Ford first bought a stake in Mazda in 1979 .
It took control of the Japanese carmaker in 1996 , saving it from potential bankruptcy .
According to media reports , Ford 's stake in Mazda may be bought by trading houses Sumitomo and Itochu , Japanese insurance companies , car parts maker Denso , as well as by Mazda itself .
The " Big Three " US car firms Chrysler , Ford and GM are seeking a total $ 25bn in emergency US government loan .

Verdict ' ends 17 - year nightmare '
How forensic science caught Tobin Timeline : Vicky Hamilton murder Convicted killer and sex offender Peter Tobin has been found guilty of the murder of Falkirk schoolgirl Vicky Hamilton , who disappeared 17 years ago .

Her remains were found buried in bin bags at his former home in Margate , Kent , in November last year .
Tobin was given a life sentence and ordered to serve at least 30 years .
The jury of 12 women and three men took less than two - and - a - half hours to reach their verdict .
As it was read out , there were cries of " Yes " from members of Vicky 's family and friends .

" Furthermore , I want to thank Lothian and Borders Police and CID for their hard work in finding my daughter , Vicky . "
Vicky 's sister Lindsay Brown said that following the verdict , her family 's thoughts had turned to their mother Janette , who died in 1993 not knowing what had happened to Vicky .
' Cruelly taken '
She said : " We are glad this 17 - year nightmare has finally come to an end .
There were many times when we thought this day would n't come .
" We are hoping we can now move on as a family and start to remember Vicky as the loving sister she was before she was so tragically and cruelly taken from us .
DNA from Vicky was found on a knife hidden in Tobin 's loft " Vicky 's abduction also robbed us of our mum , Janette , who never came to terms with the fact Vicky never came home that night and who died of a broken heart two years later , never knowing what happened to her daughter .
" We take comfort in the knowledge that mum and Vicky have been looking over us and giving us the strength needed to cope during these difficult times . "
Ms Brown also said her family 's thoughts were with relatives of Angelika Kluk .
She added : " They are in our thoughts today , as it was only after her death that we eventually found out what happened to our sister .
We know only too well the hurt and grief they will have suffered . "

UK to import 5,000 Pakistani butchers
Is this really the time to be talking about bringing large numbers ofÂ Pakistani butchersÂ into the West ?
“ 5,000 Pak butchers to get jobs in UK , ” by Asif Mehmood for Pakistan ’sÂ The Nation , November 30 ( JW ) :
You would n’t know it unless you looked under a few rocks , but cash from liberal billionaire George Soros is very much involved in the “ defund the police ” movement .
Just do n’t expect Politico to be too forthcoming about it in its skewed reporting .
Two almost simultaneous earthquakes were detected in northern Grand Prairie and northern Irving just before 7 a.m. Saturday .
E -mails from viewers have said they felt tremors around 6:55 am .
The Grand Prairie quake measured 2.5 magnitude , while the Irving quake came in at 2.7 , according to the U.S. Geological Survey Web site .
The ground shook in the same general areas as on Friday , when tremors of 2.5 magnitude set off car alarms .
Most of the Dallas area did n't feel the shocks , but they caused 911 switchboards to light up with calls from the quakes ' immediate vicinity .
Euless
Police dispatchers say they 've recieved over 50 calls so far from people in that city that felt the latest quake .
The 911 operators said no damage was reported .
Geophysicist John Bellini of the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden , Colo. , said the quakes are too small to be attributed to a specific geological fault or formation .
He said the quakes could continue for days or up to three weeks .

On the night of Aug. 21 , 2001 , my husband and I checked into a motel in Miles City , Mont .
Once settled , we poured ourselves a glass of wine and turned on the TV in order to relax after a long day ’s drive .
I ’ve never forgotten that night .
It ’s haunted me ever since .
An economist on the evening news was discussing the economy , then in the midst of a serious slump .
The economist looked into the camera and said , “ If the American consumer packs it in , the entire global economy is in jeopardy .
The American consumer better hang tough or we ’re in real trouble . ”
I do n’t think I had ever before quite understood in such stark terms just what beasts of burden we ’d become .
What the economist said made me realize something I ’d never considered -- that the entire global economy , as he put it , depended on Americans continuing to consume .
Over the years , that phrase -- “ the American consumer better hang tough ” -- has passed through my mind many times .
And , each time , what those words conjure is a great herd of donkeys so loaded down with goods that they ’re staggering beneath the weight .
Three weeks later , three planes piloted by terrorists flew into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , leaving almost 3,000 Americans dead and the rest of us in shock .
The reaction of our president to these events was to advise us to go out and keep shopping -- to continue our “ participation ... in the American economy ” were his exact words .
Not even the worst terrorist nightmare could deter the beasts from being asked to carry more -- hanging tough , in the words of that economist .
Not even in the midst of national mourning were we allowed to give our frantic consumption a rest .
I had been in Miles City as part of a trip with my husband through Wyoming , Montana and North and South Dakota .
He ’s a photographer and was taking pictures of thrift stores throughout the West .
Thrift stores are where the poorest of the poor do their shopping .
Many people rely on the inexpensive , recycled goods just to get by .
Over time , on that trip and others , I ’ve witnessed events in thrift stores that surprised and moved me .
The frail , elderly woman , for instance , whom we observed stealing a $ 2 blouse from a thrift store in Reno by shoving it into her purse .
Or the young couple in Jerome , Idaho , who had just gotten married and were carefully picking out plates and silverware , trying to find items that matched .
There was the young man in Butte , Mont. , who put $ 1 down in order to take advantage of a layaway plan and purchase $ 10 worth of clothes , with a month to pay off his bill .
And the father in Winnemucca , Nev. , who bought oversized shoes for his boy , even though the dejected kid could hardly walk in them .
“ They ’ll last you two years instead of one , ” the father said encouragingly .
“ Do n’t worry , you ’ll grow into them . ”
But perhaps one of the most poignant moments occurred in a Salvation Army thrift shop in Billings , Mont. , during that August 2001 trip .
A woman and her children were discussing some items they wanted to buy , and the woman was explaining to her kids that they had to wait because she did n’t have the money right then .
The mother said , “ Well , if we can make it till September , we ’ll come back and get some things . ”
Her son , a boy of about 8 , frowned , obviously disappointed , then looked up and said , “ When is September , Mom ? ”
Thrift stores are places where not only the poorest of the poor shop but where one can also see the incredible turnover in the products Americans have consumed and then discarded , often perfectly good items that simply do n’t get used any more .
In thrift stores , you see the evidence of our gluttony .
Now , of course , we ’re all thinking differently .
It ’s time to pull back .
The beast of burden simply can’t carry any more .
Few Americans have much in the way of savings .
Many of us have lived beyond our means .
The typical American carries credit card debt of more than $ 8,000 , and credit is tightening .
The party is over , and for many Americans it was n’t even that much fun .
It seems to me there might be a good side to this .
It ’s as if the consuming fever has broken , if only temporarily .
We ’re disinclined to carry more debt or keep shopping , even if we could , even knowing that the entire global economy might depend on us getting and spending .
We ’re all wondering where this economic meltdown is headed , and how long it might last -- how long till September ?
And will there be a time when we can hope to be relieved of our burden of hanging tough ?
Can there be some different kind of engine to drive the world economy other than the endless , often mindless consumption by ordinary Americans ?
These are the questions I ’d like answered .
But I ’m not holding my breath .
Judith Freeman is the author , most recently , of “ The Long Embrace : Raymond Chandler and the Woman He Loved , ” published in paperback later this month .
Her husband , Anthony Hernandez , is a photographer whose most recent book is “ Waiting , Sitting , Fishing , and Some Automobiles . ”
Spare a thought for the mum - to - be : no booze ; no fags ; no pâté ; no fancy cheese ; no eggs ; and , probably , a wild craving for coal .
Now pregnant woman have been told they have to make do without beauty products .
Growing concerns over the exposure of pregnant women to chemicals that may lead to birth defects have prompted calls for a new EU - wide cosmetics labelling system which would mark out some products as off - limits to mothers - to - be .
The move follows the publication of a study which found that women exposed to high levels of hairspray during pregnancy were twice as likely to have babies born with hypospadias , a condition in which the urinary tract grows on the underside of the penis .
The Imperial College London study suggested that the birth defects were linked to chemicals in hairspray shown to disrupt the hormonal systems in the body and affect reproductive development .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Fears over the effects of chemicals such as parabens , commonly used in cosmetics as a preservative , and phthalates , used in hairspray , have led to calls for closer monitoring of cosmetics .
High levels of phthalates , also used to soften plastics such as PVC , have been found to affect hormone levels , while parabens have been the subject of concern since 2004 , when a study claimed to have detected parabens from deodorants in cancerous breast tissue .
The French health minister Roselyne Bachelot sparked debate last week by announcing that the French health authorities were considering a labelling system for cosmetics that would indicate whether or not products were safe for pregnant women .
But the UK government said that the EU should address the issue as a whole , adding it to a range of changes currently being made to the European Cosmetics Directive .
A spokesperson for the Department for Business , Enterprise & Regulatory Reform ( BERR ) said : " BERR does not think this is something which is suitable for individual countries to take forward unilaterally and hope that the French raise this during the current negotiations on the revision of the cosmetics directive , where a discussion can take place among experts on cosmetic products " .
A 2007 study claimed British women absorb an average of 5lb of cosmetics a year through their skin and mouths .
Scientists last night backed a labelling scheme .
" Labels enable people to make informed choices .
In the vulnerable period of pregnancy , it makes sense for people to reduce their exposure to harmful chemicals , " said Professor Paul Elliott , who led the Imperial College study .
" It is part of a broader discussion about minimising chemical exposure in early pregnancy . "
The Royal College of General Practitioners is advising women to consider which products they use .
" Women who are planning to conceive or who are in the first three months of pregnancy should look at what they are using , " said Professor Steve Field , chairman of the RCGP .
" The cosmetics industry needs to look at this and clearly label their products .
Anything like this raises concerns , " he added , " but I do n't think people should panic . "

Naomi spent her adolescence in her room writing poetry or experimenting in the bathroom with makeup .
Bonnie was appalled .
She worried that Naomi was turning into a brat , thinking about clothes , spending time in front of the mirror .
“ I think we were overly concerned about the kind of typical teen - age stuff she was into , ” Bonnie says .
“ She read Judy Blume !
I was beside myself .
I was a feminist — I wanted my daughter to be good at math . ”
“ They had imagined themselves to be breeding a new kind of post - revolutionary child , ” Naomi wrote in her twenties .
“ Had n’t they diligently mushed their own baby food ?
Read Parent Effectiveness Training ?
Banned war toys and other ‘ gendered ’ play ? ”
Bonnie says now , “ I think she thought , ‘ What ’s wrong with having a good time ? ’
And there was something in us — although I do n’t like to admit it — something of the overearnest , you know ?
We were always fighting something .
There were always people who were the bad guy . ”
In fact , it was worse than that .
Naomi suffered from a kind of spiritual claustrophobia : she had glumly concluded that any path she chose in life — conformist or rebellious , lawyer or itinerant poet — would be equally hackneyed and ridiculous .
And so even her parents ’ idea of a good time , which usually involved getting out into nature and attending to one ’s bodily needs under artificially primitive conditions ( “ another ponchoed picnic ” ) , was to her just more proof of their irredeemable cheesiness and the vast gulf between them and herself .
“ All my parents wanted was the open road and a VW camper , ” she wrote .
“ That was enough escape for them .
The ocean , the night sky , some acoustic guitar .
. . . ”
Soon after she graduated from high school , two catastrophic events erased her animus toward her parents and their politics .
First , her mother had a severe stroke that initially left her quadriplegic .
Naomi quit her job and spent most of the six months that Bonnie was in the hospital at her side .
Then , during her first semester at the University of Toronto , a gunman killed fourteen women at the École Polytechnique in Montreal , declaring , “ I hate feminists . ”
She decided to call herself a feminist from then on .
Klein sat on a table , inside the MTV studios , in Manhattan .
She swung her legs back and forth .
She was wearing a long necklace and black high - heeled mini-boots .
She may have made up with her parents , but in matters of style she stands firm against activism of the old school .
She wears jeans , but she is groomed as flawlessly as an anchorwoman .
She giggles , she makes jokes .
She smiles a lot , especially onstage , though it is never clear whether she is smiling in amusement , politeness , irritation , or for some other reason .
Her demeanor is friendly but guarded .
While they were waiting for the interview to start , the interviewer , a young man in a black T - shirt , asked her what she ’d been doing lately .
She told him that she ’d been working on the movie version of “ The Shock Doctrine , ” which was being made by the director of “ Road to Guantánamo . ”
“ Did you see ‘ Road to Guantánamo ’ ? ” she asked .
“ No .
I heard about it , though . ”
“ It ’s excellent — it ’s intercut between interviews with the Tipton Three ” — three young British men who were held in Guantánamo for two years — “ and they ’re just , like , blokes , you know ?
The best moment in the film was when one of them suggests going to Afghanistan because they ’ve got massive naans there .
That was the reason . ”
The producer , a young man in jeans and an acid - lime polo shirt , appeared .
“ We ’ll be talking about China and the Olympics , about Darfur and intervention , ” the interviewer said .
“ But also about you personally — how you became who you are — because it ’s a young audience that looks up to each and every person on the program .
The goal is to have them want to be like that person . ”
“ Are you going to ask me my favorite band ? ” she asked .
“ We will , yes , I ’m afraid . ”
“ I ’m going to say M.I.A. , just so you know . ”
“ That will definitely ingratiate you with the demographic , ” the producer said .
“ I ’m sucking up , that ’s why I ’m here .
D’you think I could get some tea ? ”
Klein has been a person whom young people look up to since she found herself in charge of emotional teach - ins right after the Montreal massacre .
She spent most of her time in college on politics and journalism ; she was the editor - in - chief of the university paper , the Varsity .
Then , after her third year , the Globe and Mail offered her a job , and she dropped out of school to take it .
At the age of twenty - three , she took over as the editor of This Magazine , the Canadian equivalent of The Nation .
But after a little more than a year she started to get discouraged about the state of the left — she felt that it had run out of things to say , apart from being outraged by people it disagreed with — and she decided to go back to school .
When she arrived back at university in 1996 , she discovered that everything had changed .
During her previous stint as an undergraduate , she had spent all her time protesting the underrepresentation of women and minorities in the curriculum and the media ; campus politics in 1989 had mostly meant identity politics .
But students in 1996 were n’t interested in identity ; what they talked about was economics .
At the time , corporations were starting to make inroads into schools : soft - drink companies were negotiating exclusive deals ; advertisements were appearing in bathrooms .
There was a feeling in the air that corporations were getting too powerful — more powerful than governments , but not accountable to anyone except their shareholders .
And , at the same time that big corporations were withdrawing physically from the United States and opening factories overseas , visually , even spiritually , they were everywhere , insinuating their logos into what had once been public space .
Young activists found this especially objectionable , perhaps because one of the places into which corporations insinuated themselves most effectively was youth and activism , folding mutiny into advertising so deftly that resistance seemed futile .
Klein dropped out of college again and started writing a book about the insidious new branding culture .
She thought about how much she had loved shiny , plastic brand - name stuff when she was a kid — everyone had — and she concluded that a movement was doomed to hippies - only irrelevance if it condemned the longing and the pleasure that brands could create .
“ Soft drink and computer brands play the roles of deities in our culture , ” she wrote later .
“ They are creating our most powerful iconography , they are the ones building our most utopian monuments . ”
She discovered that an anti-corporatist movement was brewing all over the world , in response to sweatshops abroad and brand encroachment at home .
By 1999 , she had finished “ No Logo , ” a book about brands and the new movement they had inspired .
Then , in an extraordinary stroke of publishing luck , while “ No Logo ” was at the printer ’s , enormous crowds of protesters suddenly materialized outside a meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle .
The protest seemed to come out of nowhere — or , at least , that was how it appeared to the bewildered old left — and there was “ No Logo ” and Klein herself to explain it .
Klein lives with her husband , Avi Lewis , in a small house in Toronto , on a quiet street .
Lewis is a host of political talk shows and a maker of documentaries ; this year he is covering the U.S. elections for Al Jazeera English .
Their house is very tidy , free of any sort of clutter .
It is furnished simply , as though on one quick trip to Crate & Barrel .
It does not look lived in , and , indeed , most of the time it is not : both Lewis and Klein are on the road so much that they estimate they have spent no more than two months in Toronto since they moved in , a year ago .
Nonetheless , the house is important to her .
“ I come from such a line of wanderers that I wanted to stop wandering , ” Klein says .
“ In Montreal , the city I grew up in , there ’s no trace of us . ” ( Klein ’s parents moved to British Columbia after Bonnie ’s stroke , because the weather made it easier to get around in a wheelchair ; Bonnie has become a disability - rights activist .
Seth also lives in British Columbia , working on poverty issues for a think tank . )
“ I do n’t like to go to the city I grew up in and feel like a stranger , ” Klein says .
“ This is Avi ’s city , he goes back generations here , and that ’s as close to roots as I ’m going to get . ”
Although Klein and Lewis spend a lot of time apart , they make a point of preserving their dependence upon each other .
Avi tries not to work when Naomi needs him .
“ He feeds her and takes care of her while she ’s writing , ” Bonnie says .
“ He edits things first . ”
He accompanies her on her book tours whenever he can .
In 2002 , Klein and Lewis concluded that their only hope of spending a long stretch together was to do a joint project , and they decided to make a film .
They were tired of being against things all the time , and they were always being asked what they would suggest as an alternative , so they started travelling , looking for something that they could feel good about .
They settled on Argentina , and ended up making “ The Take , ” a moving documentary about a group of laid - off workers who broke into their shuttered factory and started it up again as a collective .
At the time , Buenos Aires was in turmoil , and every now and again a protest they were documenting would turn violent and the police would start shooting , and there was an ongoing discussion about what to do .
Lewis wanted to run ; Klein wanted to stay .
“ I was trying to dissuade the cowboys in our crew from putting themselves in danger , ” Lewis says .
“ I was , like , ‘ Just be safe , guys , it ’s not our country , we ’re here at best in a capacity of solidarity , it ’s not the time to die . ’
But Naomi said , ‘ Here ’s the principle : if something is happening and we ’re the only ones witnessing it , we have a responsibility to posterity . ’ ”
Klein and Lewis agree on most political issues , but Klein seems more ready to break things ; more cynical ; angrier .
“ I think Avi is too quick to reject revolutionary movements , ” she says .
“ I think that incremental change makes sense in the Canadian context , but it does n’t necessarily make sense in the mountains of Chiapas .
I do n’t fetishize guerrilla violence , but I think there are situations where people are justified in taking up arms .
We ’ve had fights about that . ”
Unlike Klein , the descendant of embittered ex-Communists , Lewis comes from a distinguished political family that has always been Socialist rather than Communist , and so has kept its political faith .
“ My earliest memories are of conventions and election nights , seeing grownups crying or celebrating , ” Lewis says .
“ We understood in my family that we were part of a cause , a movement , and the Party , capitalized , was a big part of that . ”
The politics of the Lewis family have changed very little in the past hundred years .
Avi Lewis ’s great - grandfather Maishe Losz was the leader of the Jewish Labor Bund , a secular Socialist party , in his small town just east of Bialystok .
The Bund was anti-Bolshevik ; it believed that revolution should be achieved through democratic processes , even if that meant compromise .
Thus , the Bundist maxim : “ It is better to go along with the masses in a not totally correct direction than to separate oneself from them and remain a purist . ”
In 1921 , fearing that he would be killed by the Red Army , Losz fled to Canada .
Losz ’s son David Lewis became the national leader of the Canadian democratic socialist party , the New Democratic Party .
The N.D.P. never formed a national government , but it came to power in the provinces : in Canada , socialism was mainstream .
David Lewis persuaded the Party to delete the eradication of capitalism from its manifesto , and he crushed movement dogmatism and indiscipline .
( “ When in heaven ’s name are we going to learn that working - class politics and the struggle for power are not a Sunday - school class ? ” he asked . )
David ’s son Stephen , Avi ’s father , also followed in the family tradition , and was elected the leader of the N.D.P. in Ontario at the age of thirty - two .
( Avi ’s mother , Michele Landsberg , is a journalist , who is well known in Canada for her feminism and her pugnacious left - wing politics — in her columns , conservatives are always “ jack - booted ” or “ henchmen . ” )
When , in the late sixties , a faction called “ the Waffle ” threatened to splinter the Party , Stephen Lewis crushed it , just as his father had crushed factions before .
For Stephen and for David , loyalty to the Party was paramount .
They would not permit the left to destroy itself .
Stephen Lewis left office thirty years ago , and David Lewis died in 1981 , but the Lewises are still well known and beloved in Canada .
“ I live in that fantasy world in which you should say what you believe in and should n’t retreat because the electorate may not be receptive , ” Stephen Lewis says .
“ That may explain why my own leadership was one of remarkable futility , almost legendary futility . ”
Recently , Lewis spent five years as the United Nations special envoy for H.I.V. / AIDS in Africa , but his respite from campaigning has not made him quieter .
“ I ’m more fundamentalist now , ” he says .
“ I have no patience for capitalism at all .
I see now that there is almost nothing that is positive in this ugly international system , and that ’s why I embrace Naomi ’s view of the way the world works .
I ’m actually tired of my rhetorical outbursts — I ’d like to engage in physical aggression . ”
“ If we ’re going to be friends with benefits , I want health and dental . ”

“ I think there is , for my parents ’ generation , a sense of defeat , ” Avi Lewis says .
“ They grew up in a postwar period when it seemed like the world was changeable — a welfare state had been built and had to be protected and extended .
But their adult lives have encompassed a long deterioration of the standard of living for the majority of people on this continent , and as they ’ve seen the gains of the sixties and seventies largely erased , they ’ve started to feel more and more hopeless .
Whereas Naomi and I grew up in a time when the backlash was already well under way , so we may be just as pessimistic , but we do n’t feel defeated , because we never had the luxury of hope . ”
These days , Avi Lewis looks very much like the product of his family , but this was not always so .
“ I rebelled furiously , but without rebelling in the most hurtful way , which would have been to rebel politically , ” he says .
“ I was a host on MuchMusic , which is our MTV .
I knew that I was n’t doing politics the way I was brought up to , and I was conflicted about that .
My parents would ask me , ‘ Are you sure you know what you ’re doing ?
I know you love music , and it ’s cool for you to hang out with Bowie , and you sometimes get to do a one - hour special on music and politics in South Africa , which is sort of political , but are you sure you ’re doing the most you can ? ’
I was alienated from my own political inheritance .
I had a tradition to fit into .
I had a platform from the time I was four or five years old . ”
It was at this point that Lewis met Klein .
They were both covering the Canadian elections in 1993 — he for MuchMusic , she for CBC .
When Lewis met Klein , he felt that she was freer of her family than he was of his , and this somehow relieved him of the urge to run away .
“ I always got the feeling that Naomi was the author of her own politics , ” Lewis says .
“ And when I got close to her I started seizing the reins of my own political development . ”
" I returned , and saw under the sun , that the race is not to the swift , nor the battle to the strong , neither yet bread to the wise , nor yet riches to men of understanding , nor yet favour to men of skill ; but time and chance happeneth to them all . "
Ecclesiastes 9:11
Introduction
Luck plays a significant part in many games .
Indeed , some games , such as snakes and ladders , are entirely a matter of chance yet still manage to captivate their players .
One of the many decisions , therefore , that the designer of any game must make is whether or not to add an element of luck in the form of probability - based randomness .
Chance outcomes clearly do not always improve gameplay , but nor do they always necessarily hinder it .
In some circumstances , luck enriches the very forces that motivate players , whilst in other circumstances it does the exact opposite .
The nature of luck , however , is not always self - evident as the following well - known and enigmatic aphorism of Stanislaw Jerzy Lec illustrates .
" If a man who can not count finds a four - leaf clover , is he lucky ? "
Unkempt thoughts ( 1962 )
Game developers are sometimes faced with similarly challenging decisions when contemplating whether to include some kind of deliberate randomness .
For example , in the video game Unreal Tournament , when a player shoots at a target with the " enforcer " weapon , the projectile does not necessarily hit the point that is aimed at ; a random deviation is added that scatters shots .
This introduces a degree of realism from an observer 's perspective and no doubt gives beginners a fair chance against more experienced players , but it can also potentially frustrate skilled players .
Is it overall a good idea and , if not , could realism have been introduced in a better way ?
Here in this article , with particular reference to computer games , we present a formalism through which designers across all genres and platforms may better understand not only the nature of luck , but also the effect that it has on gameplay and player motivation .
We show that luck is easily broken down into individual categories and that in doing so , a positive or negative effect on particular aspects of gameplay is observed .
First we investigate and classify the various types of luck that occur .
Next we enumerate various qualities of gameplay such as motivation and learnability .
We then relate the types of luck to their effects , good or bad , on these qualities .
The designer of a new game examines each proposed probabilistic feature and determines which types of luck it produces within the taxonomy .
The influence of the proposed feature on each of the various qualities of gameplay is then readily calculated .
Miley Cyrus ' Got Wheels ' ....
It 's A Porsche !
Teen phenomturned 16 on November 23 and like every kid her age , she got her learner 's permit .
Her mom
Tish surprised her daughter by handing over the keys to her used Porsche Cayenne .
Miley is reportedly thrilled with the hand - me - down .
The sacrifice was n't a big one on mom 's part .
She recently took delivery on a new set of wheels , and lets face it , Miley 's fortune probably financed both rides .
The teen celeb can now drive if she is accompanied by someone who is at least 21 years old and is a licensed driver .
Cyrus is having a great week .
She also found out she has been nominated for her first Golden Globe in the category of ' Best Original Song ' for I Thought I Lost You from the movie Bolt .
The awards show will air on January 11 , 2009 .
Kristen Hirsch Montag took her time finding Mr. Right , so she did n’t want to wait long to start a family .
Yet at 39 , Montag says the economy has left her little choice but to let her biological clock keep ticking .
While the couple were planning their October wedding , Montag ’s husband , Paul , lost the job he had held for seven years selling ads for a magazine because it folded .
His unemployment benefits will run out soon , leaving the newlyweds with two mortgages and heavy hearts .
“ I definitely cannot think about getting pregnant now , ” said Montag , a marketing communications manager for a nonprofit organization in St. Paul , Minn .
“ I hope that a new job and a house sale will change things for us .
But I am not too confident about the future right now . ”
As the financial crisis reverberates through Wall Street , Washington and beyond , it is taking a personal toll on couples who are making the painful decision to postpone starting -- or growing -- their families .
Once hopeful about their ability to provide for children , prospective parents are now filled with gnawing doubts as jobs vanish , retirement savings dwindle and housing prices fall -- even as the cost of having and raising a child rises .

Many economists fear that the current recession will become one of the worst since the Great Depression .
When that hit in the 1930s , the birthrate dropped precipitously , and the effects of having fewer people in the workforce rippled through the economy two decades later .
“ If you ca n’t pay your mortgage , the last thing on your mind is to have another child , ” said Dr. Khalil Tabsh , chief of obstetrics at UCLA , who expects to start seeing a drop in pregnancies .
Baby booms and busts are reliable , if lagging , economic indicators , intertwined with the rise and fall of the nation ’s fortunes .
For three - quarters of a century , economic downturns have triggered declines in the U.S. fertility rate , which , at about two children per woman , is the highest among rich nations .
The fertility rate hit its post - World War II low of 1.7 in 1976 , after the oil shortage and a severe recession .
With the country in a recession since December 2007 , accompanied by a stock market plunge and growing numbers of people losing their jobs and homes , 8 in 10 Americans say they are anxious about the economy , a recent survey by the American Psychological Assn. showed .

Demographers say it ’s too early to tell what effect that anxiety will have on the U.S. birthrate , which is already difficult to forecast with so many factors in play , including immigration and birth control .
They do n’t expect the current recession to lower the rate below the so - called replacement level , at which each couple reproduces itself .
But they do say that the rate could drop if the economic slump is deep and protracted .
“ We ’ll know in about nine months , ” said Carl Haub , a demographer for the Population Research Bureau , a private company in Washington .
“ It depends on how low it goes . ”
For now at least , childbearing is a family issue , not a national one .
Melanie and Phil Sheridan , both 35 , were high school sweethearts who recently celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary .
They have a 6 - year - old son , Tyler , and Melanie has yearned for a second child for some time .
The Sheridans took a step in that direction in March 2007 , when they bought a three - bedroom house in Carlsbad , Calif .

But eight months later , Melanie was laid off from her job as a marketing assistant for a home builder .
The economic outlook is gloomy and their household budget is strained , relying on a single income from Phil ’s job as a project planner with San Diego Gas & Electric Co .
So they have decided to hold off on having another child .
“ People tell me not to let money stop us from having a baby , that everything works itself out in the end , ” Melanie said .
“ That may be true , but right now having another baby feels more like a strain than the blessing it ’s supposed to be . ”
Childbearing is taking a back seat to financial discipline for Brandon and Amanda Mendelson , an Albany , N.Y. , couple who wed in June planning to soon start a family .
But Brandon , a 25 - year - old graduate student , and Amanda , a 24 - year - old certified math instructor , are barely scraping by as substitute teachers .
Saddled with mounting bills but having no steady source of income , they are giving up their apartment to move in with Amanda ’s parents 40 minutes away in Glen Falls , N.Y .
It ’s a tight squeeze .
Amanda ’s brother and his wife have already moved back in to the three - bedroom , single - story house where Amanda grew up .

The Mendelsons are keeping their two cats , but they had to give away their two guinea pigs and put their family plans on hold .
“ We ca n’t even take care of ourselves , ” Brandon said .
“ We ’re both disappointed and upset about this , as we want to have children while we ’re young and able to play with them . ”
As confidence in the economy wanes , the effect on the national birthrate will take time to show up in maternity wards and government data .
Obstetricians have not seen a drop in pregnancies but expect to in the coming months , especially among middle - class families with shrinking incomes .
“ From now on , people will think twice before they have kids , ” UCLA ’s Tabsh said .
“ Especially , parents who already have one or two or three kids will probably defer pregnancy until things get better . ”

Fertility specialists , who charge $ 12,000 on average for in - vitro fertilization , have already seen their practices decline .
Pacific Reproductive Center , which runs five clinics in Southern California , is offering discounts .
“ An economic slowdown should n’t force you to turn down conception , ” one of its fliers says .
“ Even though you may still have your job and the same amount of money coming in , you keep getting those envelopes in the mail that your retirement plan has 20 % less money in it , ” said Richard Paulson , head of the fertility program at USC .
“ When you lost $ 20,000 last week , it ’s very hard to say , ‘ Let ’s take another $ 10,000 out to get some fertility treatments . ’ ”
Some couples looking to adopt are putting their plans on hold .
Marieke and Rutger Hensel , who emigrated to Buena Park from the Netherlands two years ago , have three young boys but want two more children .
A year ago , Marieke , 29 , who runs her own Internet marketing firm , and Rutger , 33 , who runs his own software business , completed a training course for foster care adoption .
But with corporations pulling back on spending , pinching the bottom line at both of their businesses , the Hensels have decided to wait for their profits to rebound before taking on the expense of more children .

“ We know our kids are waiting for us somewhere , ” Marieke said .
Starting or growing a family often becomes more of a financial decision than an emotional one as parents calculate the sometimes overwhelming costs of healthcare , child care , education and other necessities , said Kathleen Gerson , a sociologist at New York University .
Though birthrates usually decline in a recession , there is a countervailing theory popular with some economists : Births may swell .
Some women who lose their jobs may decide it ’s an opportune time to raise a child , said Gary Becker , a University of Chicago economist and sociologist .
Some working moms are making the same decision .

Jennifer Gniadecki , 33 , a freelance writer in Homewood , Ill. , and her husband , Randy , who works in online advertising , are the parents of two young girls and have always been careful with money .
So they do n’t plan to defer their dream of having more children .
“ Making a judgment about having a child based on the economy today is like selling all of your stocks when they are low , ” Gniadecki said .
“ It ’s very shortsighted . ”

NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) -- A TV - size probe adorned with a painting of the Indian flag successfully rammed into the moon Friday evening as part of the country 's first unmanned lunar mission , Indian space officials said .
The spacecraft carrying India 's first lunar probe , Chandrayaan - 1 , lifts off from Sriharikota .
The Moon Impact Probe detached from the unmanned lunar orbiter Chandrayaan - 1 and made a hard landing on the lunar surface around 8:31 p.m. New Delhi time ( 10:01 a.m. ET ) , said the official , Srinivasa Murthy Satish .
Space official Shiv Kumar said the 34 - kilogram probe hit the moon surface traveling at 1.6 kilometers per second , which is a speed of 5,760 kilometers per hour ( 3,579 mph ) .
Kumar said the probe transmitted sufficient signals to the mother craft before landing , but no more were expected after the impact .
A news release from the Indian Space Research Organization said , " The probe had a hard landing on the lunar surface that terminated its functioning . "

Ramachandra Rao Guruprasad , a spokesman for the Indian Space Research Organization , said the probe was not meant to be retrieved .

" One of the objectives of this probe is to understand the moon for future soft landings , " he said .
He added that the Chandrayaan - 1 was to transmit the data it recorded from the probe to the ISRO .
The Chandrayaan - 1 -- Chandrayaan means " moon craft " in Sanskrit -- was successfully launched from southern India on October 22 and is now orbiting the moon .
iReport.com : Feeling spacy ?
Its two - year mission is to take high - resolution , three - dimensional images of the moon 's surface , especially the permanently shadowed polar regions .
It also will search for evidence of water or ice and attempt to identify the chemical composition of certain lunar rocks , the group said .
The craft is carrying payloads from the United States , the European Union and Bulgaria .
India plans to share the data from the mission with other programs , including NASA .
The Indian space agency noted that the landing came on a historically significant day -- the birthday of late Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , who started the modern Indian space program in 1962 .
Two years ago , the European Space Agency sent the Smart - 1 probe smashing into the lunar surface .

Social services conceded yesterday that there were systematic shortcomings in the handling of the case of two women repeatedly raped and made pregnant 19 times by their tyrannical father over 27 years .
And the Prime Minister , Gordon Brown said everyone in the UK would be " utterly appalled " by the " unspeakable " plight of the sisters who now have seven children between them as a result of the incestuous attacks .
The 56 - year - old father , who can not be named for legal reasons , was given 25 life sentences at Sheffield Crown court this week after admitting rapes and assault .
A serious - case review is now under way to discover how social services , police and health workers in South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire failed to pick up on the abuse despite having contact with the family .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Peter Duxbury , director of children 's services and chairman of the Lincolnshire Safeguarding Children Board , admitted yesterday that the quality of the information shared between Sheffield and his authority was " not to the standard we would expect nowadays " .
He said there had been a wholesale review of children 's services in the county since Lord Laming 's 2003 report into the Victoria Climbié tragedy .
Mr Brown , responding to a question from Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrat leader and MP for Sheffield Hallam , told the Commons : " People will want to know how such abuse could go on for so long without the authorities and the wider public services discovering it and taking action .
If there is a change to be made in the system and the system has failed we will change the system . "
The 56 - year - old man 's sister - in - law has also accused him of forcing his daughters to father his children so he could claim their benefit support .
She said : " He obviously thought the bundles of benefits he was getting for the children was worth the risk and was not bothered about any pain it caused them . "
During the trial , the court heard that several concerns were raised with the authorities over the daughters .
The family left South Yorkshire in the early 1990s , moving from village to village in Lincolnshire .
They eventually returned to the Sheffield area in 2004 .
But suspicions were raised over the parentage of the nine children , two of whom died and some of whom suffer from genetic abnormalities .
As late as 1997 , when the abuse had been going on for 16 years , the women 's brother reported what was described in court as " hearsay evidence " of incest .
Although police investigated , no further action was taken .
One of the daughters eventually came forward in June to reveal the shocking details .
Hilary Barrett , assistant director of children 's services in Lincolnshire , declined to say when the case review would be completed or whether it would be made public .
School and medical records would be automatically transferred when families moved .
Where a child was a suspected victim of abuse , professionals had a responsibility to raise concerns .
" If a family moved to another area consideration would be given to sharing information to ensure the allegations were followed up , " she said .
Colin Green , director of children services in Coventry , said plans to hold secure records on all 11 million children in England on a national database , to be piloted next year , would " improve sharing of information " , adding : " This is exactly the kind of case in which it could help . "
But the scheme has been challenged on civil liberty and data security grounds .

On a drizzly December morning , Lee Min-bok kneels on the cold ground near the North Korean border and consults his laptop .
He ’s scanning satellite weather photos to pick just the right spot for his launch .
Satisfied , he and a helper grunt as they load 20 large orange helium tanks into a ramshackle van and then head west .
The vehicle is so laden with gas containers , the chassis bounces with a sick thud atop its struts at each bump in the road .
Lee and his partner , Kim Sung - soo , say little , apparently lost in their own thoughts .
They have brought a baggie of peeled , browning apples to eat .
Less than a mile from the border , they back the van into the cemetery of a small chapel .
One by one , they fill plastic balloons with the hissing helium , creating 36 - foot - tall cylinders that snap in the wind and tug hard on the ropes , as if eager to be set free .
Advertisement
Lee , a compact man with thick black eyebrows and a baseball cap pulled low on his head , consults a compass for the precise launch direction , then double - checks his calculations on a map .
He attaches a plastic satchel packed with thousands of vinyl fliers .
He sets the timer , and waits for the right wind gust .
The first balloon floats up silently , joining the plodding gray clouds on their easy drift toward North Korea .
Lee takes pictures and says a few prayers aloud .
“ No one can stop this , ” he says .
“ These balloons fly under the radar .
No one sees them .
They ’re perfect messengers . ”

Lee is equal parts meteorologist , tinkering inventor and political dissident , a man obsessed by a singular goal : to spirit messages to those left behind in his native North Korea -- 23 million countrymen living under the ironfisted rule of Kim Jong Il .
To reach the isolated society devoid of outside newspapers , radio and television , the 52 - year - old defector uses a simple yet elegant method to fly under the radar of North Korean intelligence watchdogs :
He sends millions of leaflets northward by way of his towering helium balloons .
In this high - tech age , the balloons have struck a nerve with Pyongyang and landed Lee and other launchers center - stage in the Korean peninsula ’s high - wire political standoff .
Last week , North Korea cited Seoul ’s inability to control the launches -- by defectors and a handful of civic groups -- as a major reason to again close its border , banning tourists and reducing trade .

Tensions between the two Koreas have risen in the last year , especially after the February election of conservative Lee Myung - bak as South Korean president .
The administration of Lee , who is a hard - liner on Pyongyang , says it is helpless to stop the launches .
Analysts say the leaflets are written in simple language by former North Koreans who intimately know the North ’s culture and which political buttons to press .
The vinyl leaflets from Lee , founder of the North Korean Christian Defectors Assn. , are often religious .
But they also strike at a ruler referred to as his nation ’s paternal “ Dear Leader . ”
“ Dear North Koreans , ” one begins , taking aim at Kim .
“ So he ’s a General who eats rice gruel together with the people ?
But how could he get love handles and a double chin if he eats rice gruel ?
People are starving to death , but why does the country spend so much for Kim ’s [ extravagances ] ? ”

South Korean officials are seeking ways to ban the launches , which they say jeopardize the fragile truce between the Koreas .
Many academics agree .
“ Should n’t they stop sending fliers , to prevent inter-Korea relations from being destroyed ? ” asks Paik Hak - soon , director of the Center for North Korean studies at Sejong Institute in South Korea .
This week , several civic groups said they would hold off on the launches for now , but Lee focuses on the long view .

“ People in North Korea are dying every day , with their eyes and ears covered by Kim ’s regime , ” he says .
“ Do we just sit here and watch them die ?
No matter what they say , we have to do this . ”

Lee ’s reverence for his Dear Leader began to unravel in the 1990s , during a horrific famine that killed tens of thousands of North Koreans .
Lee , then an agricultural scientist in Pyongyang , sent numerous letters to the regime , advocating that officials follow China and open the society to outside trade and commerce to stem the starvation .

His letters were ignored , he said .
So he quietly planned to defect , divorcing his wife so she would n’t be persecuted after he was gone .
He also left behind a young son .
He first went to China , but was caught and sent back to North Korea and prison .
Later , in 1995 , he stole across the world ’s most heavily armed border into South Korea .
Lee spent years adjusting to life in a free society .
He remarried and had another child .
Then , in 2004 , the two Koreas agreed to halt decades of propaganda warfare , which had involved floating leaflets and blasting loudspeakers across the border .

The truce angered Lee .
He decided to continue the launches on his own .
He immediately began studying the science of wind .
His first efforts were failures .
He bought small party balloons and attached a flier to each .
They traveled a short distance before drifting back to earth .
He bought bigger balloons and affixed bundles of fliers .
He developed a simple timer that opened the bundles on schedule .
He worked covertly to avoid police .
One of his first big launches landed in the Han River in South Korea .
Another settled on the lawn of the Blue House , the home of the South Korean president , according to press reports .
Advertisement
But he improved with time .
Now Lee and others release tens of millions of leaflets each year into North Korea .
Lee says his messages are not aimed at Kim , but his subjects .
“ There is no reasoning with Kim , ” he says .
“ He ’s a god in his own mind .
He does n’t make mistakes .
But these are n’t bombs .
This is a peaceful war against Kim Jong Il . ”
The messages are reaching common North Koreans .

Park Kwon -ha , a defector and former North Korean soldier , escaped in 2005 .
He says the leaflets were like gold from the sky : “ It can not be overemphasized how effective the fliers are .
Because the more you learn from one flier , the more you want to know . ”
It ’s not surprising North Korean officials are infuriated by the leaflets .
“ Pyongyang is apoplectic , ” says Marcus Noland , a North Korea scholar for the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington .
“ These defectors are from within the system .
They know exactly what to say and how to say it .
And they hit a nerve .
For Pyongyang , they stick the knife in and twist it . ”
Advertisement
Lee knows that he ’s viewed by many South Koreans as a fringe element who will never achieve his goal of toppling Kim .
He prefers to see himself as a North Korean David , slinging leaflets at a mighty , but vulnerable , Goliath .
Lee gets visibly upset as he discusses Kim .
He begins many sentences with , “ You do n’t know what it ’s like in North Korea . ”
He acknowledges the personal cost of his mission .
He thinks of the wife and boy he left behind and he becomes rueful , and then angry .
That ’s when he starts planning another balloon launch .
Advertisement
--
Preparing his balloons on the recent rainy morning , Lee pauses to consider an ominous sky the color of spilled ink .
He likes what he sees .
“ The wind is right , ” he says softly .
“ It ’s blowing toward Pyongyang . ”
Being so close to the border is an emotional experience for Lee and Kim , his helper and fellow defector .
They ’re so near they can almost smell their homeland .
But they focus on their task .
Some balloons are attached in pairs , drifting off in the shape of a large V .
Advertisement
The last pair start low , clipping the top of a tree , spilling leaflets before rising into the airstream .
Lee sighs .
“ When one fails , ” he says , “ it feels as though I ’ve lost a child . ”
Done at last , Lee and Kim watch the sky , spellbound and laughing like schoolboys as they munch on the brown apple slices .
Like the balloons , their spirits have lifted .
Lee says the falling leaflets are a beautiful thing to behold .
It ’s like a sprinkling cloud , he says -- a gentle snowfall of fliers falling into the hands of his fellow North Koreans .
Minutes later , Lee is still searching the horizon .
Then he sees the last balloons , two tiny pricks in the vast distance .

“ Aha ! ” he shouts .
“ There they are !
They ’re over North Korea !
Go !
Go bring the word ! ”

No incoming president has set a more ambitious work - family agenda than Barack Obama .
The president - elect has said he wants a federal sick - day mandate and expansion of family leave .
With Democrats also in control now of legislatures in 27 states , up from 23 before the election , change on this front is likely .
But such proposals face historic obstacles , in the form of a cratering economy and paralyzing state deficits .
Thus new entitlements are likely to move ahead unevenly , if at all .

Splinter Cell Voice Actor Shot By Terrorists
Canadian actor and videogame voice specialist Michael Rudder was among the casualties in the terrorist attacks in Mumbai yesterday .
The actor was dining at the Oberoi Hotel in Mumbai when militants opened fire .
Rudder was hit by three bullets and rushed to hospital where he successfully underwent surgery and is expected to make a full recovery .
You may recognise Rudder ’s voice from such games as Far Cry Instincts , Prince Of Persia : The Warrior Within ( he played the Dark Prince ) , Jagged Alliance and – somewhat ironically – terrorist - slaying black ops game Splinter Cell .

( CNN ) -- Vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin likes to portray herself as an average American working mother .
Independent voters have turned against Sarah Palin in recent polls .
But how many typical moms get $ 150,000 worth of merchandise from stylish stores and have strangers pay for it ?
This week 's revelation about the purchases was just one more surprise in the fast rise and apparent fall of the Republican Party 's sudden superstar .
Remember , it was only two months ago that Palin was just the popular governor of Alaska , still an obscure figure in American politics .
That changed in late August when John McCain chose her as his running mate .
Within days , she was generating the biggest excitement the McCain campaign had ever enjoyed , captivating the Republican Party , swelling the crowds at its rallies and drawing media coverage that overshadowed the Democrats .
One McCain advisor told me then that one of the practical problems she discovered as she criss - crossed the country was that she did n't bring enough clothes .
It seems her family did n't have enough clothes either , because suddenly there was some serious shopping .
A single visit to the fashionable department store Neiman Marcus cost more than $ 75,000 , but that was only half of the total .
The bills ultimately went to the Republican Party , which means that although they probably did n't know it , party donors paid for them .
Palin 's problems go beyond clothes , though , to her very candidacy .
In recent days , prominent Republicans , from former Secretary of State Colin Powell to Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan , have publicly criticized her lack of experience .
Ordinary Americans agree .
An NBC / Wall Street Journal poll found that in early September , when Palin was just starting out as a candidate , 47 percent of voters had a positive opinion of her , compared to 27 percent who felt negatively .
Now 47 percent have negative feelings , compared with 38 percent who feel positively .
And the new poll found that concern about Palin 's qualifications is voters ' top concern about McCain , ahead of every other issue in the election .
Voting day is less than two weeks away and most polls suggest that Barack Obama is headed for victory .
The surprise is that Palin went from being McCain 's best asset to his biggest problem .
And the Republicans do n't have much time , or an obvious way , to fix it .

Tsewang Rigzin , president of the radical Tibetan Youth Congress , believes it is time for a change in tactics .
" We have nothing to lose , " he said .
" We are fighting for the dignity and freedom of the Tibetan people and we have truth and history on our side . "
The Dalai Lama , along with thousands of other refugees , fled Tibet in 1959 following a failed uprising against Chinese rule .

Mr Morales is a former coca farmer
President Evo Morales has announced he is suspending " indefinitely " the operations of the US Drug Enforcement Administration in Bolivia .
Mr Morales accused the agency of having encouraged anti-government protests in the country in September .
He did not say whether its staff would be asked to leave the country , as coca - growers have been pressing him to do .
Bolivia 's first indigenous president first came to national prominence as a leader of the country 's coca farmers .
Relations between Bolivia and the US have been strained since Evo Morales won presidential elections in January 2006 .
Coca is the raw material used in the production of cocaine and is widely grown in Bolivia .
The country is a major producer of cocaine , but millions of Bolivians poorest people also chew coca leaves as part of their daily routine .
Many believe the leaf offers health benefits .
' Defending Bolivia '
" From today all the activities of the US DEA are suspended indefinitely , " the Bolivian leader said in the coca - growing region of Chimore , in the central province of Chapare .
Coca is widely used by Bolivian Indians
" Personnel from the DEA supported activities of the unsuccessful coup d'etat in Bolivia , " he added , referring to the unrest in September which left 19 people dead .
" We have the obligation to defend the dignity and sovereignty of the Bolivian people . "
US officials have denied any wrongdoing .
In recent months , a string of tit - for - tat expulsions of diplomats and agencies increased tensions between both countries , the BBC's Andres Schipani reports from Bolivia .
Bolivia 's government expelled the US ambassador .
Washington retaliated by expelling its Bolivian counterpart , while last month President George W Bush himself put the Andean country on an anti-narcotics blacklist that cuts trade preferences .
Making his announcement , Mr Morales also declared that his government had eradicated more than 5,000 hectares ( 12,300 acres ) of illegally planted coca .
As we say each year at this time , television has its Emmys , music has its Grammys and sports has its dummies .
There were the obvious ones this year : John Daly , O.J. Simpson , Pacman Jones , Terrell Owens , Sean Avery , Roger Clemens , Marion Jones , Plaxico Burress , Isiah Thomas .
In some cases , too obvious .
In other cases , too pathetic .
These are our dummies for 2008 :
This item is NOT brought to you by Ben - Gay

The American Family Assn. is a Christian organization with a website called onenewsnow.com .
It filters out the word “ gay ” in online reports and replaces it with “ homosexual . ”
That sort of editing does n’t usually get much attention .
Those who might be offended are n’t likely to frequent the site .
But it did create a stir when U.S. sprinter Tyson Gay won the 100 meters at the U.S. Olympic trials .
The Associated Press story , as reported on onenewsnow.com , read : “ Tyson Homosexual was a blur in blue , sprinting 100 meters faster than anyone ever has .
“ His time of 9.68 seconds at the U.S. Olympic trials Sunday does n’t count as a world record , because it was run with the help of a too - strong tailwind .
Here ’s what does matter : Homosexual qualified for his first Summer Games and served notice he ’s certainly someone to watch in Beijing .
“ It means a lot to me , ” the 25 - year - old Homosexual said .

Now they call him Tatum Bellhop
Denver ’s Tatum Bell is a good running back .
But beware .
He comes with baggage , not necessarily his own .
A day after he was released by the Detroit Lions and replaced by Rudi Johnson , Bell was caught on a hidden camera removing two Gucci bags from the team ’s training facility .
They belonged to -- who else ? -- Rudi Johnson .
After initially denying he touched the bags , which were filled with Johnson ’s clothes , Bell said it was an honest mistake .
Johnson was reportedly “ miffed . ”
A really cheesy promotion
Someone at a Papa John ’s pizza restaurant in the Washington area had a bright idea : Hand out T - shirts before a Washington Wizards - Cleveland Cavaliers playoff game at the Verizon Center with a photo on the front of LeBron James , a caption that read “ Crybaby ” and a Papa John ’s corporate logo .
It was soon pointed out to Papa John ’s executives that they also have restaurants in Ohio -- more than a dozen , in fact , within 12 miles of the Cavaliers ’ arena .
They responded by offering 23 - cent pizzas to Ohio residents , with proceeds going to charity .

What do you mean Brits do n’t have pools ?
One of the more unexpected feuds to emerge at the Beijing Olympics was the one between Commonwealth allies Australia and Britain .
When Rebecca Addington of Britain won the 400 - meter freestyle in swimming , Australia ’s Olympic Committee president , John Coates , said , “ It ’s not bad for a country that has no swimming pools and very little soap . ”
Soap ?
The war of words started before the Games .
Andy Burnham , Britain ’s secretary of State for Culture , Media and Sport said , “ Old rivals like Australia . . . are saying they are in danger of falling behind Team GB in the medal table . ”
That provoked this response from Kate Ellis , Australia ’s minister for sport : “ British sportsmen and women in the past have been known to choke under the pressure when up against the Aussies . ”

Remember when everyone just hated the French ?
When the alma mater asks for a contribution , it does n’t mean this
Miami Dolphins linebacker Joey Porter is so prone to collecting penalties , he even picked up a 15 - yarder for his alma mater this season .
The former Colorado State star was in the end zone watching the Rams play Brigham Young .
When Colorado State running back Gartrell Johnson scored the go - ahead touchdown midway through the fourth quarter , Porter charged into the end zone and gave him a flying chest bump .
The Rams drew a 15 - yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty .
Although that flag did n’t factor in the outcome , Colorado State lost .

Say what ?
Who ’s more deserving of the booby prize than Sean Avery ?
He was suspended indefinitely by the NHL for crude remarks he made about a rival player who was dating one of Avery ’s ex-girlfriends -- this after promising his coach he would n’t talk to the media .
Avery wo n’t be taken back by the Dallas Stars , who gave him a four - year , $ 15.5 - million contract last summer .
Knocked out on the sidelines
Floyd Mayweather Jr. invoked that old boxing ploy in June by announcing his “ retirement ” and canceling a scheduled rematch with Oscar De La Hoya .
Their first meeting was the most lucrative boxing event in history .
So , while on the sidelines , resting at his Las Vegas home and getting victimized by a jewelry heist , Mayweather stood out as the biggest loser when Manny Pacquiao battered the “ Golden Boy ” on Dec.
6 . Mayweather could n’t have been bothered to accept those millions ?
Against a fading star ?
Better than the pay - per-view of De La Hoya - Pacquiao would ’ve been to be a fly on the wall watching Mayweather ’s response to that one - sided outcome .

Satire of what ?
In Texas , Nacogdoches High School cheerleaders split into two groups for a football pep rally skit .
One half of them dressed in their regular Nacogdoches Dragons costumes , while the other half dressed as rival cheerleaders .
The regular cheerleaders then forced the “ rivals ” to kneel and executed them with toy guns .
It was all in good fun , the school principal said .
He described it as “ simple , innocent satire . ”
They did n’t have a ‘ Clue ’

UCLA ’s athletic marketing department started the football season with an advertisement claiming “ the college football monopoly in Los Angeles is over . ”
It included a photo of new Coach Rick Neuheisel pointing his finger threateningly , as if calling out USC’s Pete Carroll .
A few weeks later , the same marketing department ran newspaper and radio spots in Fresno appealing to Fresno State fans to come to the Bulldogs ’ game at the Rose Bowl against UCLA “ so you can say , ‘ I was there . ’ ” Presumably for a Fresno State victory over the Bruins .
After that , UCLA Athletic Director Dan Guerrero said the marketing department would take a different approach .
“ I ’m not throwing anyone under the bus . . . but some things work and some things do n’t , ” he said .

Is this another Sarah Palin joke ?
No .
It ’s not her fault that the Philadelphia Flyers invited her to drop the puck and proceeded to lose six games in a row .
It ’s not her fault , either , that the St. Louis Blues invited her to drop the puck at one of their games , rolled out a red carpet for her and then watched helplessly as their goalie , Manny Legace , tripped over it , injuring his hip .
The Blues lost six of their next seven .
Legace did n’t blame Palin .
“ She ’s been pretty good for our game , ” he said .
“ I ’m starting to like her more and more .
No grudge . ”

The Golf Channel ’s Kelly Tilghman seemed like a slam - dunk winner when she suggested on the air that other PGA players could contain Tiger Woods if they would just “ lynch him in a back alley . ”
But she was quickly trumped by Golfweek magazine , which reacted to her comments by putting a photo of a noose on its cover .
“ Caught in a Noose , Tilghman slips up , and Golf Channel ca n’t wriggle free , ” the headline read .
The magazine lost advertising .
The editor lost his job .
Tilghman is still talking on the air , though with somewhat more caution .
Drum roll . . .
Ultimate Dummies of the Year : Us
Not all of us , or , specifically , you , but a lot of people , including some smart ones at CBS , bought big - time into the Kimbo Slice hype .
( If you do n’t know Kimbo Slice , you are spared the humiliation of this award and even possibly have a life . )
In his second prime - time , main - event mixed martial arts fight , Slice was beaten in a mere 14 seconds by a last - minute replacement named Seth Petruzelli .

Petruzelli later said that the promoters from Elite XC told him to take it easy on Slice , whose real name is Kevin Ferguson .
He said they “ gave me money to stand and trade with him , ” figuring that Slice fights better upright than when on his back .
Petruzelli retracted that statement a day later .
The Florida State Boxing Commission investigated and found no wrongdoing .
Elite XC went out of business .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
As familiar and reassuring as the map of the world is , there is only so much that physical geography can tell us about the state of the planet .

A new book , The Atlas of the Real World , has redrawn the map giving vivid new insights and bringing economic , social and environmental data to life .
Not since the German meteorologist , Alfred Wegener , sketched out the first detailed theories of continental drift has the world appeared so misshapen , so otherworldly .
The 366 cartograms ( statistical maps ) which make up the book twist , shrink and distend countries and continents into all sorts of shapes and sizes .
The book and the accompanying Web site were devised by Daniel Dorling , professor of human geography at the UK's University of Sheffield , Anna Barford , a research associate at Sheffield and Mark Newman , a professor of physics at the University of Michigan .
Work on the project began in earnest in 2006 when Dorling teamed up with Newman , who had co-created a new software technique for creating equal area cartograms the year before .
With the software in place , the painstaking task of assembling the data began .
The information was drawn from a variety of organizations including the United Nations , the World Health Organization and the World Bank .
For ease of visual comparison , territories are split into 12 geographical regions -- e.g. blue for North America , brown for Northern Africa -- and shading marks out specific countries .
The range of subjects is impressive , from greenhouse gas emissions , wealth and disease to more obscure data about numbers of dentists and working tractors .
John Pritchard , research assistant at University of Sheffield and part of the team working on the project , told CNN : " I think the maps of disease are particularly shocking and bring home the scale of the problem in Africa better than a table of statistics does . "
Indeed , the map of malaria deaths is striking : 94 percent of deaths from malaria occur in Africa , making the continent appear like a vast bloated blob .
The rest of the world is reduced to a disparate series of veiny streaks .
There are other sobering statistics to consider .
In June 2008 , Principal Voices spoke to Head of Research at Oxfam GB Duncan Green about strategies to eradicate poverty .
Green talked about the education being crucial to breaking the cycle of poverty , particularly for girls .
The new atlas 's Girls not at Primary School cartogram graphically illustrates the lack of female education in many parts of the developing world .
Team members are currently working on a map of languages and soon hope to be producing animated maps .
" We have a series of maps that show deaths at various stages , which would be particularly suited to an animation , and we now have a PhD student looking at extending the Web site , including ways of mapping flow . "
Pritchard said .

But US president - elect Barack Obama will order a surge of US troops next year to coincide with a major reduction of the force in Iraq .
There has also been pressure on the British government to similarly reinforce southern Afghanistan when the 4,000 troops pull out of Basra early next year .
If you 're here reading Gizmodo , there 's a good chance you have a hard drive full of video somewhere .
And you also probably have a PS3 , Xbox 360 or Wii .
If those two things are n't working together for you in beautiful symbiosis , allowing you to watch all of your downloaded or ripped video on your TV instead of hunched over a laptop screen , well , this is the guide for you .

Now there are two general strategies you can take : physically copying your files to a USB drive , memory card or CD / DVD , which is pretty straightforward , or streaming your video over the network , which is where things get more fun and interesting .
So let 's dive in .
First things first , codecs .
Now that you 're all learn-ed on the ways of video encoding thanks to Matt 's Giz Explains from this week , the issue of codecs will make a lot more sense .
Thankfully , it 's not something you have to worry too much about here , because all three consoles can handle a large number of the codecs you will find commonly : AVI , MPEG ( 1 , 2 and 4 ) , H.264 , DivX / XviD , and WMV — and if a particular format you want to play is n't supported , it 's often possible to convert it to work on the fly .
The PS3 also supports AVCHD , a format used by many HD camcorders .
Not all formats are supported with every streaming method though , especially in the 360's case , which we 'll get to in a second .
Now , for getting all those files on the TV .

Note : if you need to re-encode a video in a different format because it wo n't play , nothing beats VLC 's transcoding wizard .
Here 's a guide .

Xbox 360 : Streaming ( PC )
Advertisement
In typical Microsoft fashion , there are tons of different ways to pull of streaming your video to the Xbox 360 — and the only one that 's truly comprehensive , in our opinion , comes from a third party .
TVersity is a free UPnP media server that can manage your video and music files anywhere on your PC and stream them out to your 360 over the network .
It will also kindly transcode just about any video you can throw at it into a codec your console can definitely read .
You might have to install some additional codec packs here and there for Windows but for the most part , you can forget about worrying about codecs with TVersity .
This also allows TVersity to handle files not officially supported by the 360 , like MKV containers .
1. Grab TVersity here and install it .
2 . Click the giant plus sign in the top left corner to " Add Your Media Source " - namely , the folder on your PC with all of your videos .
3 . Under advanced options , set your transcoding preferences : " When Needed " will make sure most all of your files play .
4 . In the main TVersity menu , select " Start Sharing "
5 . On the Xbox 360 , TVersity will now appear as a source in the Media blade or under My Xbox -> Video Library in NXE .
Advertisement
The other three options via Microsoft 's own various software solutions all have their own drawbacks , which we 'll cover here briefly .
Our advice ?
Use them only if you already use the Zune software , Windows Media Player or Windows Media Center to manage all of your video .
Advertisement
Windows Media Player 11 : WMP 11 can stream out to the Xbox 360 pretty easily .
Here is an in - depth guide .
Drawbacks ?
Somewhat clunky format support .
In our tests we could not stream Quicktime video at all , and had inconsistent experiences with MP4 files .
MPEG - 4 and H.264 support are technically supported via third - party WMP codec add - ons , but even with those , we still had trouble — MP4 files tended to play fine on the WMP 11 end , but not show up as browsable on the 360 .
Somewhat unbelievably , the Xbox 360 team actually recommends you manually rename your unsupported MPEG - 4 and H.264 files , adding the " .avi " container extension to fool WMP into playing them .
This worked occasionally , but not for every file and was generally inconsistent .
Advertisement
Zune Software 3.0 : Zune offers a much nicer interface than WMP ( Settings -> Sharing ->
Add is the extent of the setup ) , and thankfully supports MPEG4 and H.264 much more consistently .
Drawbacks ?
No DivX or Xvid support , which means a huge chunk of your Torrented video probably wo n't work .
Advertisement
Windows Media Center Extender :
If you already have a Media Center setup honking on your network , there 's a good chance you wo n't need this guide , but the Xbox 360 can of course stream your MCE content to your TV seamlessly ( a complete guide is here ) .
The interface is really fantastic .
Drawbacks ?
The gimpiest codec support of the bunch : only MPEG - 1 , MPEG - 2 and WMV are supported .
So unless you 're converting everything you have into those formats , you 'll still need something like TVersity to play most files you 'll find up for download .
So , in the end , TVersity wins hands down as the easiest and most elegant streaming setup for the 360 .
But do keep in mind — if you 're playing a format that your Xbox can't handle ( MKV being the most common of these you 'll find ) , TVersity will have to transcode , which means you will lose a bit of quality .

Xbox 360 : Streaming ( Mac ) : UPnP support — the networking standard used by both the Xbox 360 and the PS3 in various flavors to play network - streamed video , music and photos — is not natively supported by OS X yet .
And unfortunately , there is n't a stellar all - in - one free package like Windows ' TVersity .

Nullriver , however , makes an incredibly slick piece of software called Connect360 , which easily streams all of your iLife libraries or any folder full of video on your Mac to the 360 .
Unfortunately , it 'll cost you $ 20 .
There is a free trial version that supposedly shuts off after 30 minutes of sharing , but sometimes it seems to forget and lets you play longer .
But even so , $ 20 is n't bad for the convenience factor here .
No transcoding , but it will handle every codec the console itself can play back .
1. Download and install the Connect360 preference pane .
2. In System Preferences , start up Connect360 sharing .
Here you can also add folders for more sharing .
3. Access the Connect360 source on your Xbox in the usual way .
Done .

1 . If streaming is n't for you , and you do n't mind hauling a storage device back and forth between your computer and Xbox , then this is super easy : Insert Flash disk / USB / CD / DVD and browse it with the Media blade or the Video Library section of NXE ( under " My Xbox " ) .
Enjoy .

1. Easy as pie .
If you 're using a USB flash or hard disc or an SD or CF card , just dump all of your videos into a folder named VIDEO on the root of the drive and they 'll show up automatically in the XMB .
2 . You can also browse the entire drive or disc by pressing triangle and choosing " Display All " to find videos that are n't in the VIDEO folder .
Wii : Physical Media

For playing video on your Wii , physical media is the way to go , which is easy to pull off with some homebrew hacking .
There are lots of services that will transcode your video and ouput it in a Flash player that you can view through the Wii's Opera browser ( like Orb ) , but you 'll take a hit quality - wise and it's not as easy as just playing the source files directly with Mplayer .

1. Install the Homebrew Channel and Mplayer on your Wii .
We 've got you covered here with our complete Wii homebrew guide — but hopefully you have n't installed the latest System Menu update .
In that case , you 'll have to wait for a workaround , but it probably wo n't be long .
2. Install Mplayer via the Homebrew Browser ( also covered in our guide ) .
3 . Now , you can use Mplayer to play files off or even an attached USB drive ( as long as its formatted in FAT16 or FAT32 , which most are ) .
The interface is not nearly as nice , but it gets the job done .

4. Mplayer for the Wii covers a ton of codecs , but sadly , the Wii's processor chokes on HD content .
If you 've got HD files , you 'll need to transcode them into a lower resolution with VLC .
And that 's about it .
Now , no more huddling around your laptop screen or fiddling with TV and audio - out cables .
Welcome to the good life .

Meet your increasingly distant cousins in this clickable illustration of the past seven million years .
After years of secrecy , the Broadmoor authorities have released the medical records of a Victorian madman who was suspected of being the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper .
Thomas Hayne Cutbush was a strange , disturbed and violent youth who was diagnosed as insane in 1891 and remained in Broadmoor until his death in 1903 .
During the period when the Ripper was on the rampage in Whitechapel , east London , Cutbush was wandering the area 's streets .
And the Ripper , whoever he was , did not kill again after Cutbush was locked up .
Visitors to the Berkshire Records Office in Reading can inspect the 26 documents that make up the records Broadmoor kept about Cutbush , as well as the letters from Ripper investigators pleading to see the documents .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Disappointingly , the documents do not prove that Cutbush and Jack the Ripper were the same man .
There is not even evidence that the Broadmoor attendants or medical staff believed he was a murderer .
But there is enough to keep Cutbush on the suspect list .
He was – to quote an entry on his medical records – " very insane " , a danger to the staff , other patients and even to his adoring mother .
He was convinced that others were plotting to harm him and fantasised aloud about getting his hands on a knife so that he could " rip " the staff and patients .
Until he was arrested and diagnosed , Cutbush had lived his whole life in Kennington , south London , within walking distance of the scene of the Ripper murders .
He was born on 29 June 1864 , which would mean that he was 24 when Jack the Ripper started killing .
His father died when he was young and he was brought up by his mother , Kate , and her sister , who evidently adored him .
He worked as a clerk but in 1888 , about the time the Ripper killings began , he went insane .
It has been assumed that he contracted syphilis .
His death certificate says that he died from " cronic [ sic ] kidney disease " – although the document attributes his insanity to " heredity and overstudy " .
There was certainly madness in the family .
His uncle , a superintendent in the Metropolitan Police , shot himself in 1896 in front of his daughter .
The reference to " overstudy " refers to the evenings young Thomas spent poring over medical textbooks after he came home from work , until madness took hold .
He took to wandering the streets at night , returning sometimes covered in mud or – according to one report – in blood .
He also became convinced that his doctor , Dr Brooks , or Brookes , was trying to poison him .
He wrote to Lord Grimthorpe , one of London 's leading lawyers , demanding action , but then concluded that Grimthorpe was in on the conspiracy .
He was taken to a Lambeth clinic but escaped .
While on the loose , a girl was stabbed nearby and another threatened .
A memo in his medical notes says : " Through the carelessness of the attendant he escaped .
Smeared his face with mud so as to avoid detection .
Came home at midnight .
Man at Cottons
Wharf says he was there when assault alledged [ sic ] was committed . "
Cutbush was never convicted of a crime because the jury at his trial in April 1891 concluded that he was insane .
His mother protested that he had done nothing .
But the medical notes accompanying his arrival in Broadmoor suggest that he was dangerous : " Is dazed and at times incoherent , strange and shifty in appearance .
Has ideas of persecution , specially against Lord Grimthorpe " .

" His aunt , Clara Hayne , says at times he has been violent or destructive , breaking glass and chandeliers .
He has at times said he is poisoned and has refused all food except what she would prepare for him . "
In May 1891 , an attendant wrote : " At 8.20 , I was talking to Gilbert Cooper in the gallery .
Cutbush came up and without a word struck Cooper a violent blow in the face . "
Another report warned : " Thomas Cutbush told Att. [ attendant ]
Slater at dinner twice that he would stick a knife into any of us if he had one . "
A few days later , Mr Bailey , the night attendant , reported : " [ Cutbush ] was using some very disgusting and threatening language : said that if he had a knife suitable for the job he would rip up the Atts or anyone else that upset him as soon as look at them . "
He also threatened his mother , who visited him in April 1903 , two months before he died .
As they left , " Mrs Cutbush tried to kiss her son .
He tried to bite her face and then commenced to swear at them " .
The finger of suspicion was first pointed at Cutbush in 1894 , by a tabloid newspaper , The Sun , which was no relation to its modern - day successor .
The report claimed that despite the popular supposition that the Ripper was dead , he was in fact a mental patient .
The Sun 's detailed description was clearly that of Cutbush .
The suspicion was that the Met covered up his guilt to avoid the embarrassing outcry that might have followed the revelation that the country 's most feared serial killer was Superintendent Henry Cutbush 's nephew .
One book has named Cutbush as the No 1 Ripper suspect but others have poured cold water on this theory .
Its main weakness is that the last known Ripper victim died in November 1888 , at the end of a killing spree that lasted 11 weeks .
If Cutbush was the killer , it seems odd that he should commit five murders over so short a period and then stop for more than two years before committing one more assault , which his victim survived .
But there is almost no chance that the case can ever be solved and so for as long as the 120 - year - old myths persist , Thomas Hayne Cutbush remains on the suspect list .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Paul Nawrocki says he 's beyond the point where he cares about humiliation .
Paul Nawrocki , jobless since February , stands on New York corners with a sign announcing his job search .
That 's why he weekly takes a 90 - minute train ride to New York , where he walks the streets wearing a sandwich board that advertises his plight :
The former toy - industry executive needs a job .
" Almost homeless , " reads the sign .
" Looking for employment .
Very experienced operations and administration manager . "
Wearing a suit and tie under the sign , Nawrocki -- who was in the toy industry 36 years before being laid off in February -- stands on Manhattan corners for hours , hoping to pass resumes to interested passers - by .
" When you 're out of work and you face having nothing -- I mean , having no income -- pride does n't mean anything , " Nawrocki said .
" You need to find work .
I have to take care of my family . "
iReport.com : Have you lost your job ?
Tell us your story .
People look but do n't often stop .
A woman in the jewelry business paused as Nawrocki stood with his sign outside Grand Central Station recently .
" I feel sorry for him .
I wish I could help him , " she said .
" I 'll pray for him .
I 'll give him a prayer card . "
Nawrocki will take the prayers .
His wife is partially disabled and on 15 medications , his daughter has student loans , and he 's running out of money , he says .
He tried more traditional approaches at looking for work , but nothing came through .
His daughter eventually suggested handing out résumés on the street .
" We started talking , and she actually came up with the suggestion of putting on the sign board .
I thought , ' That 's not a bad idea . '
So , here I am , " he said .
Watch Nawrocki explain why he 's using the sign »
Getting the right person 's attention is tough .
Competing with him for the eyes of passers - by are charity groups and homeless people seeking donations .
But there was one hopeful moment as CNN was interviewing him .
A man identifying himself as the head of a New York executive recruiting firm took one of Nawrocki's résumés .
The man , Steve Warren , was asked whether employers are looking for people with Nawrocki's expertise .
" It 's very difficult , " Warren said .
" The operations pieces are all exported to overseas , and the problem that we face is , guys like Mr. Nawrocki have a problem finding work here . "
Warren was asked whether someone could find a job using Nawrocki's walking - the - streets tactic .
" Well , I found his résumé here , so I 'm going to try to find him [ something ] , " he said .
Nawrocki has plenty of competition .
The U.S. government said 533,000 jobs in the country were lost in November , and more than 1.9 million jobs have been lost in 2008 .
But he retains hope that he and his sign will attract the right opportunity .
" There has got to be a job out there , and hopefully there 's one for me , " he said .

Anyone in the advertising industry will tell you that it ’s more fun to create ads for some products as opposed to others .
Dusting polish and toilet cleaners , for example , are n’t exactly clients that most creative types are jumping up and down to work with .
Condoms , on the other hand , are .
But because there ’s so much potential to make easy , tasteless jokes , condom advertising requires a more delicate touch ; great ads should make us think a little bit harder before rewarding us with the punch line .
These twenty - one ads from around the world do just that — some in more subtle ways than others .by : http://www.divinecaroline.com
Der Bundestag hat die umkämpfte Novelle des Gesetzes für das Bundeskriminalamt ( BKA ) mit der Mehrheit der großen Koalition in seiner Plenarsitzung am heutigen Mittwoch verabschiedet .
Die Wiesbadener Polizeibehörde erhält damit trotz massiver Kritik selbst aus Ermittlerkreisen und entgegen der Stimmen der Opposition umfangreiche präventive Kompetenzen zur Bekämpfung des internationalen Terrorismus .
Bis zuletzt besonders kontrovers war die Lizenz für heimliche Online - Durchsuchungen informationstechnischer Systeme .
Sie wird gemäß dem Kompromiss von Union und SPD sowie den darauf basierenden Änderungen des Innenausschusses zunächst bis 2020 erteilt .
Bei Gefahr im Verzug kann der BKA - Präsident die Maßnahme ohne richterliche Genehmigung anordnen .
Das künftige Arsenal für das BKA umfasst Befugnisse für bundesweite Rasterfahndungen unter Einschluss von Datensammlungen " nicht- öffentlicher Stellen " , die präventive Telekommunikationsüberwachung einschließlich Abhören der Internet - Telefonie sowie zum großen Späh - und Lauschangriff auf Wohnräume mit winzigen Kameras und Wanzen .
Die Ermittler dürfen zudem Verbindungs - und Standortdaten abfragen , Mobiltelefone mit dem IMSI - Catcher orten und Platzverweise erteilen .
Dies ging dem medienpolitischen Sprecher der SPD - Bundestagsfraktion , Jörg Tauss zu weit .
Er scherte aus der Fraktionsdisziplin aus und votierte gemäß einer Erklärung ( PDF - Datei ) gegen das Gesetz wegen der Online - Durchsuchung , der Vermengung geheimdienstlicher und polizeilicher Aufgaben und des mangelnden Schutzes von Journalisten .
14 SPD - Abgeordnete gaben in einer gemeinsamen Deklaration ihre Bedenken gegen das Gesetz zu Protokoll .
Oppositionspolitiker kritisierten bei der über einstündigen abschließenden Debatte das Vorhaben scharf .
Die Innenexpertin der FDP - Fraktion sprach von einem rechtsgeschichtlichen Novum , " auf das der Rechtsstaat besser verzichten sollte " .
Es handle sich um die " nicht zu verniedlichende " Bündelung aller Dinge , die irgendwo in einem Polizeilandesgesetz aufgeführt seien .
Konkret hob die Liberale die Aushöhlung des Schutzes von Berufsgeheimnisträgern , die Einführung der Quellen - Telekommunikationsüberwachung ohne Hürden für das Ausspähen des gesamten Systems und die weiten Bestimmungen zur Überwachung von Kontakt - und Begleitpersonen , die " jeden treffen kann " .
" Wir werden ein deutsches FBI bekommen und eine Polizei , die zugleich ihr eigener Geheimdienst ist " , warnte der grüne Innenpolitiker Wolfgang Wieland .
Durch Überzentralisierung entstehe eine Monsterbehörde ohne parlamentarische Kontrolle .
Hauptproblem sei , dass die Arbeit des BKA immer weiter in den Geheimbereich verlegt werde , was zu einer " entfesselten " Polizei führe .
Dem Vorhaben liege eine falsche Sicherheitsphilosophie zugrunde .
Von ihm gehe das " verheerende Signal an die Länder " aus , " der Bund macht das jetzt " .
Ulla Jelpke bemängelte für die Linken , dass die " oberflächlichen Änderungen " der Koalition nicht darüber hinwegtäuschen können , dass dem Gesetz der Atem eines Obrigkeitsstaates anhänge .
Der ganze Komplex heimlicher Bespitzelungsmaßnahmen werde dem BKA weit im Vorfeld eines konkreten Verdachts ausgehändigt .
Dies sei ein " gefährlicher Schritt in den Überwachungsstaat " .
Der innenpolitische Sprecher der CDU / CSU - Fraktion , Hans - Peter
Uhl wähnt die Koalition dagegen auf der sicheren Seite : " Dieses Gesetz wird vor dem Bundesverfassungsgericht Bestand haben . "
An die FDP appellierte der CSU - Politiker , ihren " Kreuzzug gegen die heimliche Online - Durchsuchung in Berlin nicht auf die Spitze treiben " und gleichzeitig in Bayern das Instrument zuzulassen .
Weiter bezeichnete er es als " reine Panikmache " , wenn Gegner den Bundestrojaner als " Mittel des totalen Überwachungsstaates diffamieren " .
Auch Bundesinnenminister Wolfgang Schäuble mahnte ein Ende von Kampagnen an , " unseren freiheitlichen Verfassungsstaat in einer Weise zu diffamieren , dass es bei jungen Leuten so ankommt , als sei es die Stasi " .
Die Polizei habe die Aufgabe , falls möglich , Straftaten zu verhindern .
Dafür müsse sie versuchen , die Kommunikation , die Verbrechen vorhergeht , heimlich abzufangen .
Insofern " schaffen wir nicht neue Befugnisse , sondern reagieren auf technische Entwicklungen . "
Zugleich ging der CDU - Politiker davon aus , dass " alle Länder " Kompetenzen wie für Online - Razzien bräuchten und diese nun nach und nach bekämen .
Dies führte Schäuble zu dem Schluss zurück , dass sie dem BKA nicht zu verwehren seien .
Der Minister hatte vorab bereits versichert , dass das Projekt " zu hundert Prozent " dem Grundgesetz entspreche .
Politiker der Grünen wollen neben dem früheren Bundesinnenminister Gerhart Baum ( FDP ) und der Journalistin Bettina Winsemann alias Twister , die beide parallel bereits erfolgreich wegen der Regelung zu verdeckten Online - Durchsuchungen in Nordrhein - Westfalen nach Karlsruhe gezogen waren , Verfassungsbeschwerde gegen das Gesetz einreichen .
Die Humanistische Union kündigte an , das Vorhaben zu unterstützen und die Klageschrift für Winsemann auszuarbeiten .
Die Bürgerrechtsvereinigung beklagte , dass es in Zukunft immer wieder vorkommen werde , " dass in die Computer völlig unverdächtiger Bürger eingebrochen wird " .
Das Bundesverfassungsgericht hatte der Ausforschung von Computern und Festplatten im Februar enge Grenzen gesetzt .
An die Vorgaben hat sich die große Koalition teils gehalten .
So dürfen die Beamten den Bundestrojaner nur bei Gefahren für Leib , Leben und Freiheit sowie Bedrohungen , die den Bestand des Staates oder die Grundlagen der menschlichen Existenz berühren , einsetzen .
Laxer gingen Union und SPD mit den Richtlinien aus Karlsruhe zum Schutz des Kernbereichs privater Lebensgestaltung und dem neuen Grundrecht auf Vertraulichkeit und Integrität informationstechnischer Systeme um , was bereits frühzeitig Warnungen etwa des früheren Verfassungsrichters Wolfgang Hoffmann - Riem auslöste .
So soll eine Online - Razzia nur bei der kaum vorstellbaren Konstellation von vornherein unterbleiben , wenn " allein " Erkenntnisse aus der Intimsphäre erfasst werden könnten .
Für eine Prüfung abgezogener Materialien auf die Berührung des Kernbereichs hält die Koalition zudem zwei BKA - Beamte und den Datenschutzbeauftragten der Behörde für ausreichend .
Vertreter der Grünen hatten am Mittag gemeinsam mit der Ortsgruppe Berlin des Arbeitskreises Vorratsdatenspeicherung in der Nähe des Reichstags gegen die Verabschiedung des Gesetzesentwurfs demonstriert .
Drei Aktivisten , die während der Lesung im Bundestag auf der Besuchertribüne Plakate mit der Aufschrift " BKA - Gesetz gefährdet die Demokratie " hoch hielten , wurden vorübergehend in Sicherheitsgewahrsam genommen .
Zu den Auseinandersetzungen um die Terrorismus - Bekämpfung , die erweiterte Anti-Terror - Gesetzgebung , die Anti-Terror - Datei sowie die Online - Durchsuchung siehe auch :

More profoundly , while many people think that President - elect Obama is a gift to the Democratic Party , he could actually hasten its demise .
Political parties supply brand , ground troops , money and relationships , all things that Mr. Obama already owns .
And his relationships are not the just traditional ties of Democrats  teachers ’ unions , party faithful and Hollywood moneybags  but a network of supporters who used a distributed model of phone banking to organize and get out the vote , helped raise a record - breaking $ 600 million , and created all manner of media clips that were viewed millions of times .
It was an online movement that begot offline behavior , including producing youth voter turnout that may have supplied the margin of victory .
“ Thomas Jefferson used newspapers to win the presidency , F.D.R. used radio to change the way he governed , J.F.K. was the first president to understand television , and Howard Dean saw the value of the Web for raising money , ” said Ranjit Mathoda , a lawyer and money manager who blogs at Mathoda.com .
“ But Senator Barack Obama understood that you could use the Web to lower the cost of building a political brand , create a sense of connection and engagement , and dispense with the command and control method of governing to allow people to self - organize to do the work . ”
All of the Obama supporters who traded their personal information for a ticket to a rally or an e-mail alert about the vice presidential choice , or opted in on Facebook or MyBarackObama can now be mass e-mailed at a cost of close to zero .
And instead of the constant polling that has been a motor of presidential governance , an Obama White House can use the Web to measure voter attitudes .
“ When you think about it , a campaign is a start - up business , ” Mr. Mathoda said .
“ Other than his speech in 2004 at the convention and his two books , Mr. Obama had very little in terms of brand to begin with , and he was up against Senator Clinton , who had all the traditional sources of power , and then Senator McCain .
But he had the right people and the right idea to take them on .
When you think about it , it was like he was going up against Google and Yahoo .
And he won . ”
There is tremendous power in opening citizen access to government  think of how much good will and support Mayor Michael Bloomberg garnered by coming up with 311 , a one - stop phone number for New Yorkers who had a problem .
But now Senator Obama ’s 20 - month conversation with the electorate enters a new phase .
There is sense of ownership , a kind of possessive entitlement , on the part of the people who worked to elect him .
The shorthand for his organizing Web site , “ MyBO , ” says it all .
U.S. satirist takes on Danish cartoons Art Spiegelman criticizes all sides in the controversy over depictions of Islam 's Prophet
NEW YORK - Controversial Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad have been reprinted in a U.S. magazine with commentary by leading American cartoonist Art Spiegelman , who offers what he calls a " fatwa bomb meter " to rate their offensiveness .
Harper 's Magazine published the article by Spiegelman in its June edition , available on newsstands Tuesday .
It joins only a handful of U.S. outlets that have printed the cartoons , which provoked furious protests that killed 50 people .
Denmark 's Jyllands - Posten newspaper published the 12 cartoons last year .
Other papers , mainly in Europe , later reprinted the cartoons .
A number of Muslim clerics have condemned the cartoons and a small minority have called for a violent response .
A fatwa is a religious edict in Islam , sometimes equated with a death threat .
Spiegelman , an elder statesman of political satire famous for his New Yorker cartoons , said the cartoons needed to be seen to be understood .
" As a secular Jewish cartoonist living in New York City , I start out with four strikes against me , but I really do n't want any irate Muslims declaring holy war on me , " Spiegelman wrote in his commentary .
" It 's not intended to add fuel to any fire , " Spiegelman told Reuters , describing himself as " a devout coward . "
" I wanted to show ... what could n't be described , " he said , adding that he was surprised that most of his friends had not seen the cartoons .
In his article , Spiegelman criticized all sides in the controversy .
" The Jyllands - Posten — a newspaper with a history of anti-immigrant bias — seemed somewhat disingenuous when it wrapped itself in the mantle of free speech to invite cartoonists to throw pies at the face of Muhammad , " Spiegelman wrote .
But he also criticized U.S. news outlets for not showing the cartoons .
