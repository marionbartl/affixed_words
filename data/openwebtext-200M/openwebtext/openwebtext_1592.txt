A senior cabinet minister today sent the clearest signal yet that Labour supporters should vote Liberal Democrat in seats where Nick Clegg 's party has a better chance of stopping the Tories .
The comments by the children 's secretary , Ed Balls , are an indication that Labour is now resigned to a collapse in its vote on Thursday , and the best it can hope for is a strong performance by the Lib Dems to prevent David Cameron getting enough seats to form a government .
Senior Labour figures have hitherto been reluctant to endorse a vote for the Lib Dems , for fear of looking weak .
But all the latest polls show that a hung parliament is still the likeliest outcome of the election on Thursday , with Labour trailing second or third in share of the vote .
Asked in an interview in tomorrow 's New Statesman what Labour voters should do in Tory - Lib Dem marginals , Balls – normally seen as a tribal Labour loyalist – says : " I always want the Labour candidate to win , but I recognise there 's an issue in places like North Norfolk , where my family live , where Norman Lamb [ the Lib Dem candidate and sitting MP ] is fighting the Tories , who are in second place .
And I want to keep the Tories out . "
The comments could be read as an indication that senior Labour figures are trying to boost the anti-Tory vote in the hope of forming a Labour - Lib Dem coalition in the event of a hung parliament after the election on Thursday .
Balls also told the magazine : " It will be very tough for us to get a majority .
But it will be very tough for the Tories to get a majority .
Who turns out to be the largest party [ in a hung parliament ] remains to be seen . "
Balls 's overture to the Lib Dems does not extend to an embrace of proportional representation , which Clegg is expected to make a key demand of any potential coalition partner .
Balls told the Statesman that " PR leads to a politics of behind - closed - doors deals after elections .
It makes it harder to make long - term decisions and it gives more power to small parties ... and I do n't believe as a matter of principle that coalition governments are better . "
He added : " That does n't make me hostile to the Lib Dems or unable to work with them .
On education , I could work with the Lib Dems very easily .
On most things , we agree ... but I also recognise that the Lib Dem coalition with the Conservatives in Leeds , for example , has done a terrible job . "
Asked if he would be opposed to making a deal with the Lib Dems and sitting around the cabinet table with Clegg and other members of his party , he said : " Of course not .
You deal with the election result as it comes . "
He matched his call for some Labour voters to vote Lib Dem with advice for Lib Dems in Tory - Labour marginals : " I urge Lib Dem voters to bite their lip and back us . "
The children 's secretary also hit out at Sky News for alleged bias .
" The BBC has fought valiantly to be fair and balanced , but Sky News and most of the newspapers are deeply partisan , " Balls said .
" This election is much more open than the newspapers and Sky News suggest .
The polls are very tight . "
Meanwhile the business secretary , Lord Mandelson , told the magazine that the marketing of the Tory party under David Cameron " says a lot about the strength of New Labour " .
Mandelson said : " The point about the Conservatives is that they believe they cannot win an election by running against New Labour .
They are for the political landscape that we have created .
" The whole point of Cameron 's Conservatives is to market his party in a way that leads people to believe they 've put their past behind them , that they 're a continuum of New Labour .
They are not , as it happens .
But the fact that they feel they can only win power by marketing themselves in that way says a lot about the strength of New Labour . "
Sen. Jon Kyl explained Sunday why Sen. Jim Bunning was justified in blocking an extension of unemployment benefits .
" All Senator Bunning was saying quite correctly it ought to be paid for , " Kyl told Fox News ' Chris Wallace .
" Congress passed the so - called pay - go legislation which is supposed to require we find offset or other savings if we are going to spend money .
So the first thing we do , we exempt this bill from it , " he complained .
But Kyl does believe the extension of benefits will eventually pass because they are temporary .
" It will be pass , though , because it 's temporary extension .
The question for the longer term extension is a different issue because that 's well over $ 100 billion , " said Kyl .
CANBERRA ( Reuters ) - Australia ’s government said on Monday it had ordered the expulsion of an Israeli diplomat over the use of fake passports in the assassination of a top Hamas militant in Dubai in January .
Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said a police investigation had left no doubt Israeli intelligence services had been behind the forgery of four Australian passports used by suspects in the killing of Mahmoud al - Mabhouh in a Dubai hotel room .
“ These investigations and advice have left the government in no doubt that Israel was responsible for the abuse and counterfeiting of these passports , ” Smith told Australia ’s parliament .
“ These are not the actions of a friend . ”
The Australian government ordered an inquiry into the fake passports by police and intelligence services , who visited Israel and found the four citizens involved had been innocent of any involvement .
“ No government can tolerate the abuse of its passports , especially by a foreign government , ” Smith said .
“ This is not what we expect from a nation with whom we have had such a close , friendly and supportive relationship . ”
The government , he said , had asked that a member of Israel ’s Australian embassy in Canberra be withdrawn within a week .
Australia and Israel are traditionally close allies and Smith said he expected relations to cool somewhat .
Dubai authorities have given names of alleged members of the team that tracked and killed the Palestinian , and said they used fraudulent British , Irish , French , German and Australian passports to enter and leave Dubai .
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said in February there was no evidence to link his country to the killing , which also prompted Britain to expel an Israeli in March .
But Britain ’s then - government said an investigation by the country ’s Serious Organised Crime Agency had found 12 forged British passports were used in the hit , copied from genuine passports .
Four Australians -- Nicole McCabe , Joshua Bruce , Adam Korman and Joshua Krycer -- had their identities stolen and used in fake passports held by suspects believed to be involved in the assassination , Smith said .
Mabhouh , born in the Gaza Strip , had lived in Syria since 1989 and Israeli and Palestinian sources have said he played a key role in smuggling Iranian - funded arms to militants in Gaza .
Smith said the passport cloning operation used in his killing was of high quality and had obviously been state - backed .
“ The decision was made much more in sorrow than in anger , ” he said .
“ The decision was made in our national security interests , made in support of the integrity of our passport system , made in efforts to protect Australians who travel overseas . ”
Authorities in Dubai had already been briefed on Australia ’s findings , he said , along with the other countries involved and close Australian and Israeli ally the United States .
I have reached the conclusion that a positive future both for humanity , and our planet 's biosphere is utterly dependent upon the success of the current global push for expanded nuclear power .
The purpose of this blog is to lend what support I can to that end .

The airports operator BAA today formally dropped plans for new runways at Heathrow and Stansted airports , bringing to a close one of the most controversial parts of the last Labour government 's transport policy .
Local campaigners , who spent eight years arguing that the expansion would not only result in the demolition of hundreds of homes but wreck the peace of thousands more with extra aircraft noise and pollution , said they were overjoyed at the news .
" My first reaction is – hooray !
I can hardly believe it .
I can't believe that we 've finally won .
My first thought is that we need to plan a party , " said Geraldine Nicholson from the No Third Runway Action Group , based in villages to the north of Heathrow 's perimeter .
Since the expansion proposals were outlined in a government paper in 2002 BAA , which operates both airports , has pressed ahead with plans for both sites , buying up a number of properties in preparation .
However , both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats came out against the schemes , and with Labour looking set to leave office , BAA said late last year it was shelving its programme at Heathrow until after the election .
The new government 's formal coalition agreement last week promised to cancel Heathrow 's third runway and rule out a new runway at Stansted , as well as at London 's third main airport , Gatwick .
Following this announcement , BAA today said it would stop all work on a planning application for the third Heathrow runway .
In a separate statement , it said it was also withdrawing its plans for a second Stansted runway .
Schemes to buy houses in both affected areas would also end , it added , although some purchases already underway would continue .
The company 's chief executive , Colin Matthews , said : " We recognise the importance of government policy in a matter as significant and controversial as runway capacity .
" The policy intentions of the new government are clear and it is no longer appropriate for us to purchase properties .
Equally important is our intention to stand behind our commitment made to provide time for those local residents who wish to sell their properties to us , to do so . "
Speaking of Heathrow , he added : " We continue to believe that new capacity would strengthen the UK's trading links with the global markets on which our economy and our competitiveness depend . "
The Heathrow expansion would have resulted in the demolition of more than 700 homes in the village of Sipson , along with its school , church , pubs and restaurants to make way for the runway .
Nicholson said the village , and surrounding areas , had been badly affected by its potential fate : " The uncertainty has been the hardest part .
For the whole area it 's been like living under a black cloud .
Now that black cloud has finally been lifted .
It 's fantastic . "
Carol Barbone , from the Stop Stansted Expansion group , said : " We are absolutely delighted .
We are rejoicing , thrilled .
It 's been eight long years .
We are nonetheless mindful that things can change and we will be looking for a longer term commitment on this .
" It 's not something we expected .
BAA have been trying religiously to build this runway .
If they are able to roll over so easily now , why could n't they have done it before ? "
If , like us , you thought Janet Porter ’s May Day 2010 prayer rally at the Lincoln Memorial was an unmitigated disaster because the event only attracted a crowd of a few hundred when they were expecting 8,000 , no members of Congress showed up , Porter was left covering tens of thousands of dollars in costs while having a distributor drop her radio program due to her involvement in dominion theology , you would be mistaken .
As it turns out , the event was a massive success because , according to an email from Cindy Jacobs and Generals International , it was their May Day prayers that caused the bomb in Times Square to fail to detonate :
I suspect that it was this exceedingly emphatic prayer from Jacobs , with some assistance from Dutch Sheets , that saved Times Square :
In " Over There " , an Observer leaves a drawing for Olivia which depicts Peter as some sort of Alternate Universe weapon .
Olivia later shows this drawing to Peter .
The drawing shows that Peter is the key to Secretary Walternate 's plans to destroy the other side .
The bottom of the drawing is encoded with a genetic sequence , presumable matching Peters .
Here is a high - res version of that drawing :
In the case of “ City of Thieves , ” it seemed to me that a survivor of the heroic siege of Leningrad — an underdog par excellence — would have a moral obligation to become a Dodgers fan , and then perhaps to transform into a Mets fan once the Bums desert Flatbush .
The man ’s arrival in New York would have come not long before the opening scene of Don DeLillo ’s “ Underworld , ” which has the Dodgers facing off against the Giants at the Polo Grounds in the 1951 pennant playoff .
Even though I grew up hating both these teams , neither of them is in any way revolting .
Nor are the Mets , who are merely cheesy .
But it is simply unconscionable that a survivor of the siege would become a Yankees fan .
Stalin would have been a Yankees fan .
There ’s a guy who loved to gang up on the weak and defenseless .
There ’s a front - runner if there ever was one .
My refusal to read books about the Yankees or their fans also extends to books written by supporters of the team .
Thus , when I learned that Salman Rushdie had adopted the Yankees , who beat my Phillies in the World Series last year , it eliminated any chance that I would ever read “ The Satanic Verses , ” no matter how good it is .
This attitude is rooted partly in principle and partly in pathology : I , like most Americans , resent the Yankees ’ success while secretly wishing that my cheapskate teams would imitate them and go out and purchase championship after championship .
But I further ridicule the notion that Yankees fans experience the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat the way the rest of us do .
Rooting for the Yankees , as a friend of mine said , is like rooting for the air .
It ’s about as daring as rooting for a pack of ravenous pit bulls in a showdown with a blind , one - legged bunny rabbit .

My revulsion does not end with the Yankees .
I also refuse to read books whose characters or authors have any affiliation with the Dallas Cowboys , the Los Angeles Lakers , the Duke University men ’s basket­ball team , the University of Southern California football team or Manchester United , the Yankees ’ European football evil twin .
All of these entities are promiscuously vile .
So implacable is my hatred of Man United ( glamour - boy David Beckham ’s old team ) that when I met the gifted mystery writer Val McDermid at the Dublin Writers Festival last year , and found out she was a Manchester United fan — even though she is not from Manchester — I immediately unloaded all my Val McDermid mysteries and started bad - mouthing her work to my friends .
I ’m dead serious about this stuff .
Happily , precious few novels mention the Yankees , the Lakers , Duke , U.S.C. or Manchester United , much less the Cowboys .
This is no accident .
Editors have long understood that allowing an author to link his characters with a widely execrated sports franchise would turn off millions of potential readers , so they have gently urged these authors to excise such references , particularly if they occur early in the book , when the reader is still making up his mind whether it is worth plowing ahead .
Here are a few examples of passages that were wisely deleted from famous writers ’ manuscripts before they went to press :
“ It was the best of times , it was the worst of times .
Charles Darnay was rooting for the ripping side fielded by the Jacobins , while Sydney Carton was all agog about those first - rate chaps from Manchester United . ”

The battle over the 2020 census :
Why it matters and what you can do right now
Sweden has had the free school system that the UK Conservative party are advocating for some 15 years now .
And during this time a number of serious problems have become evident that mean urgent reform is now necessary .
In fact , it is exactly those parts of the system the Tories want to implement in Britain that we are proposing to put an end to in Sweden .
The reforms will not work without extra investment .
The Labour party and the Swedish Social Democrats propose rising schools spending when the Conservatives in the UK and Sweden propose less .
Spending alone wo n't always improve standards , but creating surplus places like this without providing the funding to allow for the surplus capacity you need could seriously harm standards .
A country 's future lies in how well we educate and take care of our children .
Every parent knows that special blend of excitement , pride and worry that you feel when your child goes to school for the first time .
How will it go ?
Will they make friends ?
Will there be a teacher who sees the potential within every child ?
Yet the Swedish authorities ' own research has concluded that over the last fifteen years since the free schools were introduced , the number of low performing pupils has increased in Sweden , while the high performing pupils have neither increased in numbers nor have they become more successful .
That is why it is worrisome when the Tories want to copy our system by picking out the bad apples of the basket .
The free school system , implemented without imposing clear standards , has seen schools opening with sub - standard facilities , often without libraries , and with a far greater number of unqualified teachers .
What 's more , the introduction of free schools has led to increased segregation where pupils from the same social background increasingly concentrate in certain attractive free schools .
This matters because segregation and poorer facilities serve no - one but the Conservatives seem to specifically think that these " freedoms " are positive aspects of the policy .
This is a serious mistake .
To some extent , there is an irony in the fact that the British Tories are looking towards Sweden as an example for educational policies , when at the same time Swedish politicians – progressives as well as liberals and conservatives – are finding answers to some of our challenges in Britain .
I am not only thinking about the British universities , but also the primary school system .
We are deeply impressed by the one - to - one tuition and catch - up support , but also how you have been able to raise attraction to society 's most important profession : the teacher , by the Teach first - program , which now is investigated and advocated both by us in the red - green opposition and by the conservative government .
These and other Labour - initiated programs serves as examples for us .
If we win the Swedish general election in September , we wo n't prevent parents from choosing free schools for their children .
But we will reform the system in order to reverse the serious problems that have become evident over in this system , increasing spending on schools .
Spending alone wo n't always improve standards , but creating a free market as the Conservative proposals do without providing the funding to allow for the surplus capacity you need will certainly harm standards .
I sincerely hope there are aspects of the Swedish school system – especially how a system aiming at cohesion and equality in the system raises the performing results – that you can learn from us .
But implement our successes – do not repeat our mistakes .

If you read about videogames on the internet then you 've probably heard of Michael Pachter .
That 's because when something happens in the games industry , people ring him up or send him an email .
He 's one of our pre-eminent talking heads .
In his role as analyst for investment banking company Wedbush Morgan Securities , he also writes numerous reports on companies like Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard , advising investors on whether it 's worth taking a punt on them .
As part of his research he also gets to sit in meeting rooms ( probably not the windowless variety ) with executives like John Riccitiello and listen to them outline why their company is worth investing in , which means he gets to find out about what 's actually going on way earlier than most of us do , too .
But who is Michael Pachter ?
What does he do every day ?
Who cares ?
Eurogamer decided to find out .
Eurogamer :
What is it you actually do ?
Michael Pachter :
My job is primarily to advise investors , and by investors I mean big mutual funds and hedge funds .
Our smaller accounts maybe have $ 100 m under management and then all the way up obviously to several hundred billion .
The average average is easily $ 1bn .
I talk to guys who manage billions of dollars , and my job is to help them make better investment decisions .
" I'm everybody 's first call . "
Eurogamer :
When do you go home ?
Michael Pachter : I left at 4 pm yesterday , maybe slightly after .
I got home at around 5 , and after dinner and helping my kids with homework I went upstairs from 6.30 and finished my Dreamworks note and hit the send button to my boss to approve .
And then I watched American Idol and went to bed .
I typically work two out of three weekends .
And I probably work about three hours on a weekend .
All my NPD previews are done on the weekend .
I write an industry report every year a couple of hundred pages long and takes me the equivalent of about 200 hours to write .
So I stay busy .
And I travel .
Probably 60 nights a year I 'm gone from home .
I probably see an average of about seven clients a day on the 60 days I 'm gone .
I probably have 400 client visits a year .
And out of that , 100 I 'll see more than once .
So I see 300 different people a year and I have about 500 people who call me .
I talk to a lot of people and we have a lot of people pay us .
And obviously I 've got to go to conferences and things , but fortunately in the videogame world there really are n't that many meaningful ones .
I have to go to E3 , but I live in LA .
Really I do n't have to go to gamescom in Germany .
I went to the Tokyo Games Show once and realised it was a complete waste of my time .
I 've never been to a PAX .
I 'm sure it 's fun , but it 's a fan thing .
I do go to GDC and San Francisco is an hour flight and very easy for me to do .
And I do like that show , but I do n't go to GDC Austin or GDC Europe because you go once and how many geeks can you deal with ?
I go to the Consumer Electronics Show .
Five or six of my 60 nights are going to games shows and the rest are seeing clients .
And then I write a lot ; I write a lot of notes and I 'm certain that my notes have more content than anybody else that covers this space , which is again how I stay visible to the press .
It 's crazy to me ; there 's an old saying , and I 'm not sure who said this , that " emulation is the sincerest form of flattery " .
And it shocks me that nobody emulates me .
It blows me away that there are no analysts that say , " Oh that guy 's in the press all the time , oh he writes a whole lot . "
The last industry report I 've seen from my competitors was 2004 .
" And I said , ' Yeah , yeah , they 're ripping off the consumer . ' "
Eurogamer : Maybe nobody can keep up .
Michael Pachter : I do n't know why !
I mean it 's not that hard .
But they 're just too lazy .
They do n't try hard enough .
That 's when I get particularly perturbed when people say I 'm talking out of my ass .
I do n't mind if someone says I disagree with you , that 's totally fair , but to say , " Oh , he does n't know anything about this . "
Yeah , like you 're a f*** ing expert on DRM .
First of all I do n't care about DRM , but it cracks me up that these guys think I 'm paid handsomely because I 'm such a pretty face .
Work - wise it's a great job other than the fact there 's a lot of hours .
Eurogamer :
Do you personally tip off investors ?
Michael Pachter : Well I do , but it's a better distribution to have sales people ; 30 sales people can each call 30 clients faster than I can call 900 people .
But I do talk to the clients that want follow - up .
This Infinity Ward thing has been such a crack - up .
People are so needy ; there are so many guys who are like , " Oh what does it mean ?
What is the next Call of Duty going to do ? "
I 've been pretty clear that I think the brand has a lot of equity and there are a lot of consumers who have no fricking clue who Infinity Ward is .
Yes there are also a sizeable minority of gamers who do know who they are .
But even then , are they all going to stop buying Modern Warfare forever just because Jason and Vince are n't there any more ?
I doubt it .
And I do n't think it makes much difference if the whole team turns over , because look what happened to World at War made by Treyarch - people bought that game .
So if Activision puts Treyarch in charge of Infinity Ward 's studio and makes sure they 're supervised correctly , are they really going to screw it up that badly ?
In my obviously - knowing - nothing - about - games opinion : the plot of Modern Warfare 2 was the dumbest thing I 've ever seen ; my jaw was dropping while I was playing .
I felt worse shooting American troops than I did Russian civilians .
What cracks me up is that I read all the " No Russian " criticism about being put in the role of a terrorist , but being in the role of a guy gunning down American troops is worse .
Not to say killing civilians is a good thing .
I did n't get [ the ending ] at all .
I actually talked to Jason and Vince about it and said , " I have to say guys , that was the dumbest plot ever ! "
They said , " We had it all planned out but now we do n't know what 's going to happen because it ain't going to be us ! "
I do n't get why that game was so popular .
So to say that you lost these two guys who made the dumbest story of all time - maybe that 's a good thing !
It 's pretty funny .
Teenage boys are the most dangerous drivers on the road .
Right ?
Well , they still have higher accident rates than teenage girls .
But in a new survey , the girls say they speed more often , and text while driving at higher rates than the boys .
The youth - research firm TRU Research conducted the study a year ago among more than 1,000 teens who drive on behalf of insurer Allstate .
The girls were more likely to drive 10 mph or more over the speed limit ( 48 percent versus 36 percent of the boys ) .
Having been passed at 80 - plus mph by numerous teen girls in Honda Civics , we believe that .
And 16 percent of the girls described their driving as " aggressive " ( up from 9 percent in 2006 ) against 13 percent of boys ( down from 20 percent ) .
Not surprisingly , 65 percent of teens are confident in their own driving skills -- but just 23 percent say that " most teens " are good drivers , and 77 percent have felt unsafe while being driven by others .
And in a troubling note for parents , teens report they wear their seat belts ( 92 versus 88 percent ) and signal while changing lanes ( 84 versus 76 percent ) more often than their parents .
The changes in behavior among teen girls have led insurers to reduce the difference in rates between male and female teens .
But insurers say teen boys still have higher accident rates than do the girls .
U.S. lawmakers to get tougher on teen drivers
That fact could lead to one of two conclusions :
Either girls are safer drivers ( meaning they get into fewer accidents ) despite their higher rates of unsafe behavior ... or some survey respondents ( the boys , perhaps ? ) were n't entirely truthful .
The data show that teens who drive die in accidents at much higher rates than do drivers between 25 and 70 .
After 70 , the death rate among older drivers rises steeply .
Teens get all the blame , though .
What can you do if you 're a worried parent ?
The best solution : Do n't give your teen a car at all .
Get him or her to share with friends .
Turns out it 's statistically much safer -- despite the complaining .
Teens who had their own cars or were primary drivers — 25 percent , according to a study by the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) — were involved in accidents while driving .
For teens who had to share a vehicle , the figure was just 10 percent .

And the brain , scientists have learned in recent decades , is loaded with these receptors .
Knowing this makes it easier to understand how perimenopause could start inside aging ovaries and set off such a wild cascade of effects .
If you ’re a typical woman moving through your 40s or 50s , your lifetime egg supply is running out ; as that happens , the intricate , multihormone reproductive - signaling loop grows confounded , its triggers altered by the biology of change .
The brain and ovaries , the primary stops along this loop , start misreading each other ’s demands for action .
This can make estrogen production crank up frantically , crash and then crank up again .
Something also goes awry with most women ’s thermoregulatory systems , producing hot flashes in around three - quarters of us — nobody yet knows why , exactly , nor why certain women go on flashing for many years while some escape the whole must - remove - outer - garments - now phenomenon entirely .
There ’s an admirably clear explanation of the complete process in a recent book called “ Hot Flashes , Hormones and Your Health , ” by JoAnn Manson , a Harvard medical professor who worked with both W.H.I. and Keeps .
My favorite illustration in Manson ’s book shows an actual woman ’s hormone fluctuations as measured before , during and after peri­menopause ; the “ before ” graph is a row of calm , evenly spaced ups and downs , various hormones rising and falling in counterpoint and on cue .
The lines in the “ after ” graph are virtually flat .
The “ during ” graph looks as if somebody dynamited a mountain range .
Not all women , Manson notes , experience disruptions as robust as this unidentified patient’s .
But consider the mess of internal rearrangement we ’re looking at : the body ’s overall estrogen production is waning as the ovaries start atrophying into full retirement ; and here simultaneously , at least for some of us , is this great Upheaval of During .
The combination of the two can be — how could it not , I thought , the first time I studied the three graphs — a hellacious strain on the brain .
Tracing the exact mechanics is still a work in progress , but they surely include some disruption of signaling to the neurotransmitters that make us remember things , experience emotions and generally choreograph the whole thinking operation of the human self .
“ There are all these fundamental cognitive functions that many perimenopausal women complain about , and one of those fundamentals is attention , ” Roberta Brinton , the U.S.C. scientist , told me .
“ When you ca n’t hold your attention to a thought .
Where you ’re in constant start mode , and you never reach the finish mode .
That is devastating . ”
This was Brinton , as it happens , describing herself .
It ’s why she first went on estrogen ( estradiol , accompanied by natural progesterone ) when her own perimenopause kicked in a few years ago .
We were sitting in a campus garage in her Prius one day , and I asked her what made her so sure her own midlife difficulties — she had the hot flashes , which were obvious , but also the sleep disruption and the infuriating distractibility — were the product of hormonal events , not some womanly existential crisis .
We get a lot of that , societally .
It ’s meant to be empathetic .
Your role in life is changing , Mrs. Brain Seized by Aliens !
Your children are growing up , you ’re buying expensive wrinkle cream , ice cream makes you gain weight now , of course you ’re distraught !
“ Because with estrogen — ” Brinton looked at me sharply , and then smiled — “ I do n’t have attention - deficit disorder . ”
We walked back up to her laboratories , which are spread along a many - roomed warren full of cell incubators , centrifuges and computers .
Brinton has thick black hair and a demeanor of lively , good - humored authority ; it ’s easy to envision her as the passionate science professor in crowded lecture halls .
But in her labs the work is all rats and mice , many of them surgically or genetically altered to serve as surrogates for adult humans in various stages of maturation or disease .
Removing the ovaries from female rats , for example , sends them into low - estrogen mode .
Mice can be ordered bred with Alzheimer ’s .
The plaque that clogs the brains of Alzheimer ’s sufferers , a noxious memory - disrupting substance called beta amyloid , is available as a chemical distillate , which means Brinton ’s team can experiment with that too — beta amyloid dropped into the brain cells of healthy low - estrogen rodents ; or estrogen dropped into cells already damaged by beta amyloid .
That ’s why Brinton says that the timing hypothesis — the proposition that estrogen could bring great benefit to a woman who starts it in her 50s while having the reverse effect on a woman 10 years older — makes sense even though it is still experimental .
She and other scientists know there are ways estrogen improves and protects the brain when it is added to healthy tissue .
It makes new cells grow .
It increases what ’s called “ plasticity , ” the brain ’s ability to change and respond to stimulation .
It builds up the density and number of dendritic spines , the barbs that stick out along the long tails of brain cells , like thorns on a blackberry stem , and hook up with other neurons to transmit information back and forth .
( The thinning of those spines is a classic sign of Alzheimer ’s . )
But when estrogen hits cells that are already sick — because they ’re dying off as part of the natural aging process or because they ’ve been damaged by beta amyloid — something else seems to happen .
Dropped in as a new agent , like the wrong kind of chemical solvent sloshed onto rusting metal , estrogen does n’t strengthen or repair .
It appears useless .
Sometimes it sets off discernible harm .
You may recall additional W.H.I. news a few years ago about hormones increasing the risk for aging - related dementia ; those stories emerged from a subgroup of W.H.I. participants who were all at least 65 when they started the hormones .
There are arguments about that data , like nearly everything else connected to the W.H.I. , but the age factor alone reinforces what Brinton and other timing - hypothesis researchers observe in the labs when they give estrogen to ailing cells .
“ It ’s like the estrogen is egging on the negative now , rather than the positive , ” she said .
“ We know that if you give neurons estrogen , and then expose them to beta amyloid , many more will survive .
But when we expose them to amyloid and then give them estrogen — now you do n’t have survival of the neurons .
In some instances , you can actually exacerbate their death . ”
Human computer interfaces just got a lot more colorful .
Graduate student Robert Wang at MIT ’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab ( CSAIL ) has developed a simple but effective system for tracking hand motion that only requires a webcam and a glove .
That lycra glove is covered in colorful blotches designed to help the hand tracking software determine how the user is posed .
The color based technique allows for cheap and speedy motion capture at an interactive rate , giving you the ability to move virtual objects on the screen .
Wang has a great overview of the system in the video below – it ’s the most powerful and awesome eye - sore I ’ve ever seen .
There is a vast array of motion caption hardware systems in development .
Gesture based control technology , which will be coming to your TV , video game console , and computer this year , relies on these systems to identify and understand hand positions and motion .
Wang , and his advisor Jovan Popovic , have accomplished most of the feats I ’ve seen in other hand - tracking systems , but with much simpler ( and cheaper ) hardware .
The trick is in the colors , which gives the video sampling software reference points to determine hand orientation .
Pranav Mistry ( from MIT ’s Media Lab ) uses an even simpler version of the color enhanced tracking for his Sixth Sense personal augmented reality device – with just bits of colored tape or marker caps on his fingertips .
Though both of these MIT solutions seem silly in appearance , you ca n’t argue with their accuracy and speed :
You can find even more videos of the colorful glove tracking system on Wang ’s YouTube channel or the project website .
Wang and Popovic have experimented with several different applications for their simplified hand tracking system .
According to the related paper , they ’ve had success with using gesture recognition to read sign language ( ASL ) .
They ’ve also used the motion capture to allow a user to control animated figures .
A virtual hand can be moved around to explore diagrams or a walking motion with the fingers can control a bipedal virtual puppet .
In physics based simulated worlds , the glove can be used to pick up virtual objects and move them around .
There ’s many possibilities for applying the glove to various augmented reality tasks .
Wang also created the following video to highlight some of the more humorous possible applications :
The biggest possible application , however , has to be a general human - computer interface .
The next generation of HCI ’s are starting to move from the lab to the market , and gesture controls are as likely to succeed as kinetic computing blocks , touchscreens , and all the other possibilities out there .
Will Wang ’s system be competitive with the likes of Project Natal , gesture controlled TV , and the amazing Minority Report interface ?
No , probably not .
But it should n’t have to be .
By relying only on innovative software , a webcam , and a colorful glove , Wang has carved out another kind of market – the low - end user - empowered side of things .
Wang will be releasing a ( free ? )
API soon via the project website , allowing others to presumably make their own gloves and try out the interface for themselves .
It would be nice for Wang to make the software open source so that these users could also help innovate and improve the system .
For example , the current setup has some limitations when it comes to depth perception and glove placement due to the mono-vision of the webcam .
Yet we know that there are ( relatively ) cheap stereoscopic webcams available .
A user of the API ( or Wang himself ) could overcome the limitations by updating the software to take advantage of a 3D webcam .
I ’ve seen a lot of different human computer interfaces but I still have n’t found one that clearly stands out as the one that will become a new standard .
Chances are that , in the short term , there will be a plurality of systems replacing our use of keyboards and mice .
I like Wang ’s colorful glove approach to the problem because it is cheap , easy to employ , and primarily reliant upon improvements in software , not hardware .
All gesture controls , however , are going to need to find a way to incorporate haptics to give users some sense of feedback from the computers they interact with .
Maybe
Wang will find a way to include some simple electronics in the glove ( heater , vibrator , electric pulse ) to make the experience more tactile .
In any case , I applaud Wang and all the other HCI innovators out there .
Every new system is a step closer to finding the next great interface that will enhance and help define our growing dependence on computers .

Obama wants higher oil company taxes , pledges $ 58 million for cleanup efforts
Update ( below ) : Democrats align to ban offshore drilling along west coast
So this is why BP ’s release of video showing the Gulf oil gusher was mysteriously delayed .
According to a scientific analysis of footage from the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico , National Public Radio is claiming the growing ecological disaster is actually ten times worse than previously estimated , saying the rushing torrent of oil pouring into the ocean is equivalent to one Exxon - Valdez spill every four days .
ADVERTISEMENT
That ’s more than 70,000 barrels a day — when the U.S. Coast Guard had placed the figure at a seemingly modest 5,000 barrels a day .
Until this point in human history , the Exxon - Valdez disaster was just one of the worst oil spills ever , with nearly 11 million gallons of crude lost to the murky depths .
The Deepwater Horizon well has been jetting oil unabated for just short of one month at time of this writing .
Already , the pollution exceeds a scale which most individual humans can fully grasp .
While government agencies continue to examine what led to the oil rig explosion that killed 11 people , environmental legal experts are already predicting that there will be criminal charges ahead for at least one of the companies involved in the oil spill .
A House energy panel looking into what might have caused the oil rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico found yesterday that a vital piece of equipment intended to prevent such disasters had significant problems .
ADVERTISEMENT
Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - MI ) , chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations on Wednesday outlined issues with the blowout preventer , a tool that BP claimed was ‘ fail safe , ’ that may have prevented it from engaging .
The blowout preventer , Ã‚Â reports the Washington Post , “ Had a dead battery in its control pod , leaks in its hydraulic system , a “ useless ” test version of a key component and a cutting tool that was n’t strong enough to shear through steel joints in the well pipe and stop the flow of oil . ”
It was also revealed during the hearing that BP knew “ hours ” ahead of the deadly explosion that there were problems with the oil well .
Meanwhile , rig owner Transocean , widely seen as one of three responsible parties including BP and Halliburton , is trying to limit its overall financial liability for the disaster , filing a court request on Thursday asking that it be held responsible for just under $ 27 million in damages , according to The Wall Street Journal .

“ Vessel owners routinely seek such protection following accidents at sea , lawyers say , ” the paper added .
“ Still , the petition , filed in U.S. District Court in Houston , was likely to rile workers who escaped the burning rig and have filed suit or any of the estates of the 11 workers who died in the April 20 fire . ”
Ultimately , costs associated to lawsuits stemming from the still - growing disaster are expected to far exceed even the costs of Hurricane Katrina .
BP , already under siege by lawsuits , may even be facing a shareholder revolt .
Teams of lawyers are already pooling their resources to serve affected parties in gulf states .

But that still has n’t shut off the oil gusher .
BP ’s prior attempt at capping it with a dome failed , but the oil company said it would try its “ top hat ” idea in the coming days .
If that fails , they plan to fire garbage at the well in hopes that it gets clogged .
In response to the crisis , President Obama has raised an initiative that will provide more than $ 50 million for oil cleanup and called for higher taxes on oil companies .
Since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded and sank , the U.S. government has allowed 27 different waivers for offshore drilling firms to avoid conducting environmental impact studies .
UPDATE : Democrats align to ban offshore drilling along west coast

Senators Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) , Maria Cantwell ( D - WA ) , Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) , Patty Murray ( D - WA ) , Ron Wyden ( D - OR ) and Jeff Merkley ( D - OR ) issued a press release late Thursday insisting that their colleagues aid them in banning offshore drilling along much of America ’s west coast .
“ We simply cannot afford the risk posed by oil drilling off our magnificent coast , ” Sen .
Boxer said in a media advisory .
“ Nearly 570,000 jobs and our vital coastal economy would not survive an environmental disaster like the one weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re seeing now along the Gulf Coast . ”
“ Offshore oil drilling carries with it real risk , ” Sen. Feinstein added .
“ The voters of California have voted that they do n’t want offshore oil drilling , and I do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t want offshore drilling .
Now we know what the potential is for catastrophe and we have to see that it never , ever happens again .
Therefore , IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m very happy to join with Senator Boxer and others on this legislation to permanently ban all new offshore oil and natural gas along the West Coast . ”
Senate Democrats failed Thursday in a bid to quickly pass legislation that would dramatically increase oil firms ’ economic liability after massive spills like the one soiling the Gulf of Mexico .

The measure , pushed by lawmakers from New Jersey and Florida , would raise the ceiling on damages an oil company could have to pay for things like lost tourism or fishing revenue from 75 million dollars to 10 billion .
This video is from YouTube , broadcast May 12 , 2010 , showing oil spewing 5,000 feet down into the Gulf of Mexico .
CORRECTION : A prior version of this article characterized the Exxon - Valdez disaster as the ‘ worst ’ in history .
That dishonor goes to the Gulf War oil spill , according to MSNBC .

Al - Qa’ida on al - Qa’ida
Al - Qa’ida is neither irrational nor unable to intelligently articulate their objectives .
The American government is able to disseminate propaganda globally while suppressing al - Qa’ida ’s response .
Thus , the English speaking world is forced to trust the analysis of al - Qa’ida provided by those who have shown themselves willing to lie in their pursuit of an unjust war .
If the American public had been able to read al - Qa'ida documents they would have known that al - Qa’ida was explicit about their joy in America ’s overthrow of Saddam Husayn . [ more ]

Kant , Hegel and Deleuze on War
In my own view , war is the result of philosophies that attempt to impose a rational , uniform order on the world .
I agree with Hegel ’s assessment that the state will always create an enemy .
However , I think that Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari draw attention to a way to exist outside of the state .
I think that this " nomadic thought " exists in opposition to colonization and that what is remarkable about nomadic thought is that it is able to devise new tactics of resisting the State . [ more ]

Moths of the Hawaiian genus Hyposmocoma are an oddball crowd :
One of the species ’ caterpillars attacks and eats tree snails .
Now researchers have described at least a dozen different species that live underwater for several weeks at a time .
“ I could n’t believe it , ” said study coauthor Daniel Rubinoff , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Hawaii at Honolulu , of the first time he spotted a submerged caterpillar .
“ I assumed initially they were terrestrial caterpillars . . . how were they holding their breath ? ”
Each of the 12 species lives in and along streams running down the mountains on several different islands of Hawaii , said Rubinoff , who has studied Hyposmocoma , a group of more than 350 moth species , for more than seven years .
They usually eat algae or lichen , and build silk cases -- which one species even adorns with bird feathers -- for shelter and camouflage .
They spin silk drag lines to withstand the high pressure of fast floodwaters .

Unlike other amphibious creatures that can survive underwater on stored oxygen but must come back up for air , these caterpillars can spend several weeks without ever breaking the surface , according to the paper , which was published online on Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
It is n’t yet clear how the insects do it .
Rubinoff and co-worker Patrick Schmitz of the University of Hawaii did not find any water - blocking stopper over the caterpillars ’ tracheae or evidence of gills .
The animals drowned quickly when kept in standing water , so they seem to need the higher levels of oxygen present in running water , and probably absorb it directly through pores in their body , the scientists said .
The trait appears to have evolved more than once , Rubinoff said .
After analyzing the DNA of the 12 amphibious species , the scientists found that three separate lineages of moth had developed the ability to breathe underwater at different points in the past .
Why they evolved this trick is n’t clear , but animals and plants are known to often evolve in surprising directions after arriving at new , sparsely populated habitats such as islands , said Felix A.H. Sperling , an entomologist with the University of Alberta in Edmonton .

In a new environment , released of the pressure of having to fight for food sources or evade predators , they are freer to expand into new niches .
“ When the pressures on an environment are released , what crazy things are animals capable of doing ? ” said John W. Brown , a research entomologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
“ You just wonder . . . do all animals have that potential ? ”

JOHN GRISHAM , a prolific author of legal thrillers , long refused to allow his books to be sold in electronic form .
In a television interview last year , he lamented that e-books and heavy discounting of printed books by big retailers were “ a disaster in the long term ” for the publishing industry .
But last month Mr Grisham 's publisher announced that the author had had a change of heart : henceforth all of his books will be available in virtual form .
His timing was impeccable .
On April 3rd Apple is due to start shipping the first of its iPad tablet computers , which are expected to give a big boost to e-book sales .
The iPad 's impending arrival has created commercial intrigue worthy of a Grisham yarn .
A group of big publishers , including Macmillan and HarperCollins , have been using Apple 's interest in e-books to persuade Amazon , which currently dominates sales of digital books , to renegotiate its pricing model .
At one point in January an angry Amazon briefly removed many of Macmillan 's books from its own virtual shelves before reinstating them after some authors kicked up a fuss .
Like many other parts of the media industry , publishing is being radically reshaped by the growth of the internet .
Online retailers are already among the biggest distributors of books .
Now e-books threaten to undermine sales of the old - fashioned kind .
In response , publishers are trying to shore up their conventional business while preparing for a future in which e-books will represent a much bigger chunk of sales .
Quite how big is the subject of much debate .
PricewaterhouseCoopers , a consultancy , reckons e-books will represent about 6 % of consumer book sales in North America by 2013 , up from 1.5 % last year ( see chart ) .
Carolyn Reidy , the boss of Simon & Schuster , another big publisher , thinks they could account for 25 % of the industry 's sales in America within three to five years .
She may well be right if the iPad and other tablet computers take off , the prices of dedicated e-readers such as Amazon 's Kindle keep falling and more consumers start reading books on smart - phones .
Mobclix , an advertising outfit , reckons the number of programmes , or apps , for books on Apple 's iPhone recently surpassed that for games , previously the largest category .
Alert to such shifts , publishers are trying to undo a mess that is largely of their own making .
For some time they have operated a “ wholesale ” pricing model with Amazon under which the online retailer pays publishers for books and then decides what it charges the public for them .
This has enabled it to set the price of many new e-book titles and bestsellers at $ 9.99 , which is often less than it has paid for them .
Amazon has kept prices low in order to boost demand for its Kindle , which dominates the e-reader market but faces stiff competition from Sony and others .
Publishers fret that this has conditioned consumers to expect lower prices for all kinds of books .
And they worry that the downward spiral will further erode their already thin margins — some have had to close imprints and lay off staff in recent years — as well as bring further dismay to struggling bricks - and - mortar booksellers ( see article ) .
Unless things change , some in the industry predict that publishers will suffer a similar fate to that of music companies , whose fortunes faded when Apple turned the industry upside down by selling individual songs cheaply online .
Ironically , publishers have turned to Apple to help them twist Amazon 's arm .
Keen to line up lots of titles for new iPad owners , the company has agreed to an “ agency model ” under which publishers get to set the price at which their e-books are sold , with Apple taking 30 % of the revenue generated .
Faced with these deals , Amazon has reportedly agreed similar terms with several big publishers .
As a result , the price of some popular e-books is expected to rise to $ 12.99 or $ 14.99 .
Once Apple and Amazon have taken their cut , publishers are likely to make less money on e-books under this new arrangement than under the wholesale one — a price they seem willing to pay in order to limit Amazon 's influence and bolster print sales .
Yet there are good reasons to doubt whether this and other strategies , such as delaying the release of electronic versions of new books for several months after the print launch , will halt the creeping commoditisation of books .
Apple , for instance , is rumoured to have kept the option of charging much less for popular e-books if they are being heavily discounted elsewhere .
Other firms , including the mighty Google , are likely to enter the fray soon , which will only increase the competitive pressure .
This is particularly alarming for publishers because digital margins are almost as slender as print ones .
True , e-books do not need to be printed and shipped to retailers .
But these costs typically represent only a tenth of a printed book 's retail price , estimates Credit Suisse , an investment bank .
Meanwhile , as David Young , the boss of Hachette Book Group , points out , publishers are incurring new costs in the form of investment in systems to store and distribute digital texts , as well as to protect them from piracy .
Publishers are investing in the internet in other ways too .
A few are starting to build their own online groups of readers .
For instance Tor.com , a publisher - run website for science - fiction and fantasy enthusiasts , highlights content relevant to its members , even if some of it comes from rival publishers .
“ This is a rare sign that the light 's finally gone on in publishing , ” says Mike Shatzkin of Idea Logical , a consultancy .
Sourcebooks , a medium - sized publisher that has developed an online group focused on poetry , found that sales of its books rose by more than 50 % in the six weeks after poems from them had featured on the site .
Publishers are also pumping plenty of money into what Hachette 's Mr Young calls “ enriched e- books ” , which combine the printed word with audio , video and other media to create content that can command a premium price .
The launch of the iPad will speed up this experimentation , but it is not the only device to catch publishers ' attention .
HarperCollins , for instance , has sold hundreds of thousands of cartridges in Britain that let users read electronic versions of classic texts on Nintendo DS portable game consoles .
Charlie Redmayne , the “ chief digital officer ” of one of its units , reckons many of the buyers would not have splashed out on print editions , so the move to a new platform has created fresh demand for books .
Indeed , many publishing executives like to argue that the digital revolution could usher in a golden age of reading in which many more people will be exposed to digital texts .
They also point out that new technologies such as print on demand , which makes printing short runs of physical books more economical , should help them squeeze more money out of the old - fashioned format .
And they insist that the shift away from printed books will be slow , giving them more time to adapt to the brave new digital world .
Perhaps .
But there are still plenty of inefficiencies in the supply chain for conventional books that firms such as Amazon and Apple can exploit .
Many publishers , for example , still take far too long to get books to market in print or electronic form , missing valuable opportunities .
Ms Reidy at Simon & Schuster says she has brought functions such as typesetting in - house to boost efficiency .
At Sourcebooks responsibility for making books has even been shifted from the editorial team to the firm 's head of technology , underlining the need to think digitally right from the start of the commissioning process .
The publishing firms that survive what promises to be a wrenching transition will be those whose bosses and employees can learn quickly to think like multimedia impresarios rather than purveyors of perfect prose .
Not all of them will be able to turn that particular page successfully .
Plans to add renewable power sources to the electric grid have a common problem : weak , expensive and small batteries that can't guarantee there will be juice when the wind is n't blowing or the sun is n't shining .
Donald Sadoway , professor of materials chemistry at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , thinks the solution lies in novel batteries that use liquid metals .
The battery designed by Sadoway and his team works on the same principle as any other :
Two electrodes exchange electrons through an electrolyte to complete a circuit .
But by using liquid metals for electrodes and molten salt as an electrolyte , their battery can absorb electrical currents that are 10 times higher than present - day high - end batteries .
Only the different densities of the liquids keep them separated inside the battery , which means it would be a poor choice for most mobile applications -- but smart for a fixed location , such as an electrical installation .
Sadoway 's team first made shot - glass - size prototypes to experiment with costly ingredients such as pure magnesium and pure antimony , but is now seeking the right mix of alloys for optimal performance and cheap manufacture .
The Department of Energy 's idea factory , the Advanced Research Projects Agency -- Energy ( ARPA-E ) , is putting $ 6.9 million behind Sadoway 's project .
His award is one of the biggest of the agency 's first round of funding , released in late 2009 .
The batteries need external heaters to keep their innards molten at operating temperature .
" One of the goals of the ARPA - E - funded project is to determine the smallest size of cell that would not need booster heaters , " Sadoway says .
The U.S. Department of Energy is funding research into the following breakthrough technologies :
Cellulosic Biofuels From Genetically Modified Plants
Conventional biofuels , like corn - based ethanol , divert food crops to generate energy .
Massachusetts startup Agrivida is genetically engineering fuel crops to contain cellulose - processing enzymes , potentially making cellulosic biofuels commercially viable for the first time .
Federal funding : $ 4.5 million .
Bacteria That Produce Biofuels
Researchers from the University of Minnesota are using two species of bacteria to make it easier and cheaper to turn plants into fuel : one to photosynthesize sugar from sunlight and carbon dioxide , and another to convert it into biofuel .
Federal funding : $ 2.2 million .
A More Perfect Metal -- Air Battery
Fluidic Energy , founded by Arizona State University materials scientist Cody Friesen , is creating a portable metal -- air battery that uses ionic liquids ( low - temperature liquid salt ) instead of water - based electrolytes .
The design could pack 11 times the energy density of today 's best lithium - ion batteries without the limited voltage and evaporation problems typical of metal - - air designs .
Federal funding : $ 5.1 million .

and
( An earlier version of the second paper was prepared for the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Electronic Vehicle Controls and Unintended Acceleration , March 2011 . )
Update ( August 2011 ) : Many portions of this FAQ were updated to reflect the new materials in the USENIX Security 2011 paper .
Who are you and what is your research about ?
Our group is a collaboration between researchers at the University of California San Diego and the University of Washington .
Our efforts are supported by grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation .
Modern automobiles are becoming increasingly computerized — with many components controlled partially or entirely by computers and networked both internally and externally .
This architecture is the basis for significant advances in safety ( e.g. , anti-lock brakes ) , fuel efficiency , and convenience .
However , increasing computerization also creates new risks that must be addressed .
Our research mission is to help ensure that these future automotive systems can enjoy the benefits of a computerized architecture while providing strong assurances of safety , security , and privacy .
Our research consists of three complementary strands : conceptual , experimental , and developmental .
We conceptually evaluate the computer security landscape for potential future automobiles in order to guide our experimental and developmental research .
We experimentally evaluate real examples of today 's technologies to create informed understandings of potential computer security risks with future automobiles , as well as understandings of the challenges for overcoming those risks .
We then develop new security technologies to overcome those challenges and mitigate the associated risks .
What are these papers about ?
Experimental Security Analysis of a Modern Automobile , IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy , May 2010 : The paper " Experimental Security Analysis of a Modern Automobile " is an example of our experimental research theme .
Our research was aimed at comprehensively assessing — and learning from — how much resilience a conventional automobile has against a digital attack mounted against its internal components by an attacker with access to the car 's internal network .
To help answer this question , we experimentally analyzed and evaluated the computers coordinated within the internal networks of a modern car and described the range of security issues we discovered in the process .
All these analyses generally assume that unauthorized parties have ( at least temporary ) physical access the the automobile 's computer networks , e.g. , that they are able to plug their own hardware into a port underneath the car 's dash .
This paper appears at the 2010 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy , a peer - reviewed academic conference in the computer security research field .
Comprehensive Experimental Analyses of Automotive Attack Surfaces , USENIX Security Symposium , August 2011 :
In the paper " Comprehensive Experimental Analyses of Automotive Attack Surfaces , " we step back and evaluate the external vulnerability surfaces of a modern automobile .
We conceptually evaluate different potential vectors through which an attacker might be able to compromise computers within a car and , by transitivity , communicate over the car 's internal computer network .
Our conceptual analysis yields three key classes of remote attack vectors , or vectors that someone can leverage without ever being in physical contact with the vehicle .
These three classes are : indirect physical , short - range wireless , and long - range wireless .
We then experimentally evaluate representative examples of each of these classes of remote attack vectors and find that it is indeed possible to exploit these vectors .
Additionally , we experimentally study how an adversary might be able leverage the wireless capabilities of our vehicle for post - compromise control .
Finally , we draw lessons from our experimental vantage and reflect on the structural characteristics of the automotive ecosystem that give rise to security problems that we identify and that create challenges for mitigating them .
This paper appears at the 2011 USENIX Security Symposium , a peer - reviewed academic conference in the computer security research field .
An earlier non-reviewed version of this paper was prepared as a report for the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Electronic Vehicle Controls and Unintended Acceleration and was presented at their March 2011 meeting .
Should car owners be concerned ?
We believe that car owners today should not be overly concerned at this time .
It requires significant sophistication to develop the capabilities described in our papers and we are unaware of any attackers who are even targeting automobiles at this time .
However , we do believe that our work should be read as a wake - up call .
While today 's car owners should not be alarmed , we believe that it is time to focus squarely on addressing potential automotive security issues to ensure that future cars — with ever more sophisticated computer control and broader wireless connectivity — will be able to offer commensurately strong security guarantees as well .
We are pleased to say that , following the publication of our first paper , industry is now taking automotive security more seriously .
For example , both the Society for Automotive Engineers ( SAE ) and United States Council for Automotive Research ( USCAR ) now have efforts focused on automotive computer security .
We have also had positive discussions with multiple car manufacturers and various U.S. government agencies .
All the parties we have talked with are taking computer security for automobiles very seriously .
How much of a modern automobile is computerized ?
There are over 250 million registered passenger automobiles in the United States .
The vast majority of these are computer controlled to a significant degree and virtually all new cars are now pervasively computerized .
Computers ( in the form of self - contained embedded systems ) have been integrated into virtually every aspect of a car 's functioning and diagnostics , including the throttle , transmission , brakes , speedometer , climate and lighting controls , external lights , and entertainment .
How can the computers in a car be accessed ?
The primary direct interface to the computers in a U.S. automobile is the federally - mandated On - Board Diagnostics ( OBD - II ) port .
It is under the dash in virtually all modern vehicles and provides direct and standard access to internal automotive networks .
In many cars a range of wireless devices are also attached to these networks , as can be some after - market products ( e.g. , entertainment units ) .
In the experiments described in our May 2010 paper " Experimental Security Analysis of a Modern Automobile , " we connected our equipment to the OBD - II port .
We explore a number of other communications channels in our August 2011 paper " Comprehensive Experimental Analyses of Automotive Attack Surfaces " , including long - and short - range wireless communications , the networked diagnostic tools used by automobile mechanics and the car 's CD player .
Where do you see automotive technologies heading the future ?
Future cars will likely have even more core functions implemented by computers and with more sophisticated capabilities .
For example , some cars already use computers to park themselves , adjust the headlight brightness if another vehicle is approaching , or automatically engage the brakes to prevent an impending collision .
We believe the trend of using computers in this manner will continue .
Cars are also becoming increasingly connected to the outside world and will likely become even more so .
Many modern navigation systems inform the driver of impending traffic , wireless pressure sensors transmit digital signals to inform the driver of under - inflated tires , and many automobiles now offers Bluetooth interfaces to support hands - free calling .
Even more advanced communications capabilities are offered by telematics systems which can support integrated wide - area features such as remote diagnostics , automated emergency response to a crash , or convenience features such as navigation and location - based services ( and potentially even third - party applications ) .
Finally , there is also considerable attention focused on developing new vehicle - to - vehicle communication capabilities to help cars anticipate traffic and avoid accidents .
We believe this trend of more connectivity will likely continue as well .
Why is it important to study the security and privacy properties of existing , modern automobiles ?
The computer security community is largely unfamiliar with automotive computer systems , the functionality they provide , and the networks they use internally .
This was perhaps a reasonable situation when automotive systems were simple and had limited connectivity .
However , the trends above — that modern automobiles are becoming increasingly computerized and networked — suggest that in the future , there may be increasing opportunities for unauthorized individuals ( attackers ) to access and tamper with a car 's internal computers .
We believe there is a potential analogy with desktop personal computers , whose security concerns were not as widely appreciated until pervasive broadband connectivity exposed those latent flaws to Internet - based attackers .
Our hope is that we can sidestep this same painful learning process with automobiles and think about their security well before significant risks manifest .
To be clear , we believe that the risk of computer security incidents to automobiles is very low today .
At the same time , we also believe that these risks are slated to increase in the future .
Thus , we argue that now is the right time for the full range of stakeholders — including not only car manufacturers , parts suppliers and technology providers , but also government regulatory bodies , the insurance industry , computer security and privacy researchers , and public interest groups — to focus on these issues together and ensure that our automobiles remain secure in spite of their technological transformation .
To help advance this discussion , our research paper provides extensive experimental analyses of computer security issues in real automobiles .
Such a detailed understanding of the issues with today 's vehicles is critical if we seek to develop more robust technologies in the future .
Can you summarize your findings with respect to the computer security of modern automobiles ?
Experimental Security Analysis of a Modern Automobile , IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy , May 2010 : We conducted our computer security analyses on two modern cars .
These cars were introduced into the U.S. market in 2009 and are of the same make and model .
We determined that someone with access to the internal network in the car could use his or her own computer equipment to take over a broad array of safety - critical computer systems .
For example , in live road tests , were able to forcibly and completely disengage the brakes while driving , making it difficult for the driver to stop .
Conversely , we were able to forcibly activate the brakes , lurching the driver forward and causing the car to stop suddenly .
We were also able to control the lighting within the cabin , the external lighting , the vehicle 's dash , and so on .
A full description of the road tests is described beginning on page 11 of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy paper ( PDF ) .
For these experiments we focused on what an unauthorized party could do if they had the ability to access the car 's internal network ( e.g. , via physical access to the car ) .
For example , that unauthorized party might plug in a computer to the standard OBD - II diagnostic port under the dash .
Clearly the risk in this scenario is low — it implies that someone already has physical access to the car — which is one reason we think consumers should not be alarmed by our results .
But our concern when writing this paper is that the increasing use of externally facing wireless interfaces may increase the exposure for future vehicles and provide a way for someone to remotely access the car 's wired network .
Hence , even though it may be challenging — and unlikely — for an unauthorized individual to perform the actions we describe in this paper , it is still important to understand them so that we can develop solutions that will continue to be robust even as our cars become increasingly connected .
Comprehensive Experimental Analyses of Automotive Attack Surfaces , USENIX Security Symposium , August 2011 : For this work we also obtained and conducted our research on two modern cars of the same make and model .
The car includes roughly 30 computers comprising both critical drivetrain components as well as less critical components such as windshield wipers , door locks and entertainment functions .
These computers are interconnected via multiple CAN buses , bridged where necessary .
The car exposes a number of external vectors including the OBD - II port , a media / CD player , Bluetooth , wireless tire pressure sensors , keyless entry , satellite radio , RDS , and a telematics unit .
The last provides voice and data access via cellular networks , connects to all CAN buses , and has access to Bluetooth , GPS and independent hands - free audio functionality ( via an embedded microphone in the passenger cabin ) .
We also obtained the manufacturer 's standard diagnostic tool .
Dealerships and service stations can plug the diagnostic tool into the car 's OBD - II port and then wirelessly ( with a laptop ) connect to the tool in order to diagnose and reprogram ECUs .
Whereas our previous work was focused on understanding the capabilities of an attacker who has gained access to the cars internal networks , this work studies how an attacker might gain such access .
We studied three classes of attack vectors : indirect physical , short - range wireless , and long - range wireless .
We examined each attack vector either as a means of compromising the car 's computers or as a means of controlling a car that has already been compromised .
The indirect physical vectors included the CD player and the mechanic 's diagnostic tool .
Specially crafted CDs or a compromised mechanic 's tool can install software on the car 's computers which can perform any of the malicious behaviors we studied previously .
The two wireless classes of vectors include Bluetooth , wireless tire pressure sensors , FM radio , and cellular .
The Bluetooth and cellular vectors allow total car compromise by exploiting flaws in the telematics unit .
All of the wireless vectors enable controlling a previously compromised car by listening to their wireless channels and then sending a “ trigger ” message on the internal network .
Did you take apart the cars , or study them " as is " ?
Experimental Security Analysis of a Modern Automobile , IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy , May 2010 : We performed three classes of experiments .
First , we tested car components individually in the lab .
Second , we tested the components as a complete system with the car elevated on jacks .
Third , we tested one of the two cars in live tests on a closed road course .
See page 4 , second column of the paper ( PDF ) for more details on the three stages of the experiments .
Comprehensive Experimental Analyses of Automotive Attack Surfaces , USENIX Security Symposium , August 2011 : As with our earlier paper , we conducted all our final experiments with complete automobiles .
In some cases we first developed and evaluated our attack capabilities with car components , such as media players , in the lab .
As with our earlier paper , we conducted all our final experiments with complete automobiles .
In some cases we first developed and evaluated our attack capabilities with car components , such as media players , in the lab .
Do your results apply to other cars ?
While our experiments are focused only on a limited set of cars ( the cars for our May 2010 paper and the cars for our August 2011 paper ) , the automotive sector has many common suppliers and common development processes .
We have no reason to believe that the types of issues we identified are not industry - wide .
What is new about this research ?
In general , very little is publicly known about the practical security issues in automobiles on the road today .
There are certainly a range of other research groups who have described the potential for such vulnerabilities ( e.g. , see references 19 , 24 , 26 and 27 in the paper ( PDF ) ) but most of these efforts address car security threats abstractly or in isolation .
Part of our papers ' contributions are in taking this work to a more concrete , experimental context .
We assessed the behavior of complete automobiles operating in the field as well as automotive components in response to specific attacks .
We also studied the security implications of remote communications capabilities on automobiles ( Bluetooth , cellular , and so on ) .
Are computer security and safety for automobiles synonymous ?
Based on our experimental results , we observed automotive components that safely tolerate failures and disruptions in communications , but that were far more fragile with respect to tolerating attacks .
Stepping back , it 's important to realize that there is a critical difference between traditional safety issues and security issues .
Safety issues happen " randomly , " whereas computer security incidents happen due to malice .
This makes computer security fundamentally different from safety .
This difference manifests in all stages of the lifecycle of a vehicle : from design , to test , to deployment .
For example , manufacturers can ( and do ) develop procedures to test the safety of vehicles , but those procedures will seldom catch security vulnerabilities .
By publishing these papers , are n't you enabling the " bad guys " ?
This is a common question concerning experimental security research , especially research that is forward - looking .
In general we believe the answer is " no . "
First , motivated " bad guys " have historically demonstrated significant creativity and as cars become more computerized , more connected , and more accessible , we have little doubt that adversaries will be able to identify these security issues on their own .
Second , while we believe our papers are the first to experimentally explore the security properties in complete automobiles , we are by no means the first to write about the potential security risks in vehicular systems ; we are not identifying a new problem per se , but highlighting one that has already been discussed publicly .
Third , we have purposely omitted crucial details from our papers that would be required to replicate our work .
Finally , we have provided significant advance disclosure to the appropriate stakeholders such that fixes and mitigations could be developed and deployed .
However , against any small risk of " putting ideas " in the heads of future " bad guys , " we believe there is a far greater benefit in putting these same ideas into the heads of " good guys " today .
We do not want society to be taken by surprise for not having considered what new risks our future automotive designs may bring .
If or when automotive attackers arrive on the scene , we believe defenses should already be in place .
Research such as ours helps industry and government to stay a step ahead .
What should be done to help protect the security of future automobiles ?
While our own research will continue to focus on the issues we have described and on developing new security technologies for future automobiles , we do not believe in a " silver bullet " solution .
The automotive environment presents a new challenge for computer security and one that is unlikely to be solved any one group alone .
We believe that addressing these challenges will require a concerted effort from all relevant stakeholders , including not only researchers , but those in the automotive industry ( manufacturers , parts suppliers and technology vendors ) , government , insurance companies , public interest groups , the public , and others .

The FIA is hoping to push through greener new engine rules before a much - awaited new powerplant is introduced in 2013 .
Formula 1 teams are currently trying to reach agreement on a new set of engine regulations to come into force from 2013 - with current thinking edging towards a 1.5 litre turbocharged engine that will feature KERS .
But although such a move to smaller capacity and more fuel - efficient engines will be welcome as the sport tries to become more environmentally friendly , the FIA is hoping that changes can be made before then - perhaps by forcing teams to improve their fuel economy .
Gilles Simon , the FIA 's director of powertrain and electronics , said : " We have to try and push forward with fuel efficiency .
If , as an engine engineer , I am given a maximum fuel load , I will try to give the driver the maximum horsepower possible , building the most efficient engine I can .
" It is a technical competition and as efficiency is obviously good for road cars , that could be good for them as well .
So we want to try to adapt the rules we have in the run-up to the new engine formula . "
Simon , who was speaking in the in - house FIA In Motion magazine , thinks it vital that any move to change F1's regulations fits in with where the road car industry is heading .
" Ideally , we would like to understand where road cars will be in five to ten years .
We would then create regulations for three years from now to anticipate this .
This is the most difficult route because we do n't want to impose our own views .
We need to have a proper view of where the manufacturers will be .
" After that , we will do what is logical for the different championships .
I think that could actually add to the show because with reduced displacement engines and lower torque , you could use additional electrical torque to differentiate between the cars , while at the same time developing and showcasing hybrid technology and performance that will be used in passenger cars . "
Simon also thinks the public need better educating about how little carbon is produced from F1 cars when they are actually on track .
" Less than one per cent of an F1 team 's carbon footprint comes from running its cars .
All the rest is from running the team , and above all , more than 60 per cent of the carbon footprint comes from the electricity they use in their factories and wind tunnels . "

How to watch in the UK
I first heard about Wu Xing Sha ( Invisible Killer ) on an episode of Search Engine last summer , and finally found a copy to watch over the weekend .
Given that this is a state - produced film made behind the Great Firewall of China it contains , as you ’d expect , generous helpings of anti-Internet propaganda .
If we are to take what the film tells us as fact , then the following must be true :
The Internet is a repository of all kinds of information ;
Online gaming is an addiction that will destroy your relationships and ruin your life ; Bloggers are nothing more than petty gossip - mongers and digital paparazzi .
That first point is bang - on — we ’re off to a good start , but … from there things go a bit awry .
Online addictions are a legitimate concern but I can think of at least a few offline habits that are equally dangerous .
And bloggers ?
I ’m obviously biased here , but again Search Engine comes to the rescue , with a special podcast devoted to the Internet in China proving this to be a flat - out lie .
With the Digital Economy Bill now a reality in the UK and the possibly copycat Digital Economy Strategy looming over Canada , Invisible Killer is worth watching if only to see the Internet through the eyes of people who are afraid of it .

The MPAA , which is the Hollywood studios ’ lobbying organization , just made this announcement about the FCC ’s very bad decision .
I ’ve said it before , and I ’ll say it again : once again , Big Media shows that it does n’t want to share its profits with anyone else .
Today ’s action allows the major movie studios to undercut the entire process of theatrical release .
It would put the struggling cinema chains virtually out of business .
( Updates MPAA Asks FCC To Let Studios Transmit First - Run Films Directly To Consumers ) :
Washington , D.C. —
The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , saying it was “ in the public interest ” today approved a request by the Motion Picture Association of America , Inc. ( MPAA ) to permit recent movies to be sent directly to American households over secure high definition transmission lines from their cable or satellite providers prior to their release on DVD or Blu-ray .
“ This action is an important victory for consumers who will now have far greater access to see recent high definition movies in their homes .
And it is a major step forward in the development of new business models by the motion picture industry to respond to growing consumer demand . ” said Bob Pisano , President and Interim CEO of the MPAA .
“ We deeply appreciate the recognition by the FCC that recently released movies need special protection against content theft when they are distributed to home televisions . ”
Specifically , the issue before the FCC was a request by the MPAA for permission to use selectable output control ( SOC ) , which would allow televisions with digitally secure interfaces to receive high - definition content from a cable , satellite or IPTV provider , before its release on DVD or Blue-ray .
Using SOC protects content because during the broadcast it essentially disables non-secure , analog outputs to avoid illegal circumvention and distribution of copyrighted material .
In its order , the FCC said : “ On balance , this limited waiver will provide public interest benefits – making movies widely available for home viewing far earlier than ever before – without imposing harm on any consumers . ”
“ The first , and best way to view movies will always be in movie theaters – and nothing can replace the pleasure this brings to millions and millions of people all across our country and the globe , ” Pisano said .
“ But for those people unable to make it to the theater and interested in viewing a recently released movie , thanks to the FCC , they will now have a new option .
For other consumers who prefer standard , linear , on - demand or DVD or Blu-ray options , these services will be unchanged . ”

( Newser ) – Five female students at a Maine university pounced on a slasher who stabbed a woman and held him for police .
Howard Wolk , 45 , has been charged with attempted murder after police said he stabbed a nursing student who had an order of protection against him .
Nearby Husson University students rushed to the woman 's aid in time to save her life .
" It was really scary , but I 'm glad we got involved , " student Heather Mann , 18 , told the Bangor Daily News .
" I think he would have killed her . "
One of the 5 had just completed a self - defense class .
A local cop said police would " never recommend getting involved " to that extent .
" But am I proud of what they did ?
Of course I am , " said the Bangor sergeant .

I struggled somewhat to piece together information from the Arch Linux Wiki on setting up my wireless network to connect automatically with my home network , so I thought I 'd document some of the interesting tidbits I learned along the way .
To start from the beginning , I recently installed Arch Linux from scratch on my home desktop as an exercise to help me learn more about linux system administration and configuration .
There 's a great Beginners ' Guide on Arch's wiki that was pretty darn good in getting me up and running .
One of the only things I struggled with was getting my Netgear wg111v3 USB 802.11b/ g wireless adapter to automatically connect to my home network using WPA encryption .
I read through their wireless setup page and decided a good way to accomplish this was via a combination of net - profiles , netcfg and wpa_supplicant .
Luckily I did n't have to worry about drivers for my network adapter since the wg111v3 is apparently supported in - kernel already ( hurray ! ) .
My first step was to connect to my network manually , so I followed the steps in the Beginners ' Guide Wireless LAN section .
No problems , I was pinging google in no time at all .
Since I had a fresh install I needed to snag a few packages that I found on the Network Profiles wiki page .
Technically for what I ended up doing , I think only netcfg is required , but the other two packages seem like they 'll come in handy down the line and they are tiny packages , so I went nuts and included them .
# pacman -S netcfg wpa_actiond ifplugd As instructed by the Network Profiles page , I copied the example file that used an external wpa_supplicant .
conf since I already had one generated from when I had manually connected to my network and edited it contain INTERFACE=' wlan0 ' and WPA_CONF='/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf '
# cp /etc/network.d/examples/wireless-wpa-config
/etc/network.d/mynetwork
This is where it got tricky .
I tested my configuration with netcfg and discovered things were broken .
# netcfg mynetwork
:: mynetwork up Failed to connect to wpa_supplicant - wpa_ctrl_open :
No such file or directory
Failed to connect to wpa_supplicant - wpa_ctrl_open :
No such file or directory
Failed to connect to wpa_supplicant - wpa_ctrl_open :
No such file or directory I found a forum post which confused me , but I took their advice and added the following arcane lines to my /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf and they seemed to quash this problem :
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface_group=0
Well , things seemed to work !
Now all I had to do was edit / etc/rc.conf and add @net - profiles to my DAEMONS list and mynetwork to my NETWORKS list .
The @ is so that it will load asynchronously , since I did n't want to slow down my startup just to wait for my connection to kick in .
So my /etc /rc.conf edits looked something like this : File : /etc/rc.conf NETWORKS=( mynetwork )
...
DAEMONS =(... @net - profiles )
I reboot the machine to see if all those steps had worked , and sure enough the network connected !
Success !
I had a few other missteps along the way ... inside my rc.conf
I had wlan0 inside my INTERFACES list , which slowed down my reboots significantly since ( IINM ) it tried to get a DHCP lease before loading up my WPA key , resulting in a hang until it decided it was a failed operation .
Removing wlan0 from INTERFACES fixed that hang and net - profiles loads up everything necessary , so good riddance !
I have a feeling that this is n't quite the end of my network setup story , but it was enough to my network up and running automatically at startup .
I 'm sure there are probably easier ways to accomplish this also , but I learned a fair amount about wpa_supplicant and netcfg to get to this point , so while it felt masochistic at times I think it was worth the experimentation and docs - reading .
Quick list of all the documentation I used to figure this out :
Hope you enjoyed the saga , and maybe some of it was even useful :)
Peace out !
George Broussard , main man at the house the Duke Nukem built — and eventually demolished — 3DRealms , is giving his dedicated followers and detractors an open forum in which to ask him almost anything , like " Will Duke Nukem Forever ever see the light of day ? "

Unfortunately and predictably , Broussard 's answer to that question on Formspring is is n't really an answer : " Magic 8 - Ball says ' Concentrate and ask again . ' "
It 's doubtful that anyone looking forward to Duke Nukem Forever over the course of its 13 - year - long development cycle expected anything more substantial .
But Broussard has plenty to say on other topics .
For one , he'd love to make a sequel to Shadow Warrior , given the interest from the right parties .
And , you know , ample development time .
On another , his favorite Duke game not created in - house at 3D Realms ?

George is also somewhat of an RPG fan it turns out , favoring the Diablo and Oblivion brand of role - playing game .
His greatest RPG wish ?
" I would LOVE to see EA pull its head out of its ass and resurrect the Ultima ip ( which is one of the best known brands in gaming ) and tackle a next - gen , full - sized , epic , Ultima game . "
Broussard is taking your questions at Formspring , but who knows for how long .

‘ Pink Viagra ’ To Help Women With Low Sex Drive
Does “ pink Viagra ” offer much - needed relief to women suffering from low sex drive or is it just a money - making scheme cooked up by the pharmaceutical industry ?
That ’s the question the FDA will face next month when it considers whether or not to approve flibanserin , a new drug that — despite its not - so - sexy name — promises to boost women ’s sexual desire by altering their brain chemicals , the Washington Post reports .
Flibanserin would be the first medication to tap into a US market estimated at $ 2 billion .
The drug ’s backers say it offers hope to the 10 % of women who suffer from “ hypoactive sexual desire disorder , ” an inexplicable loss of interest in sex .
Some critics counter that the pharmaceutical industry funded research about HSDD and was key in defining it as a psychiatric disorder , while others worry that the drug could encourage women to stay with abusive partners .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Americans are being “ bombarded ” with cancer - causing chemicals and radiation and the federal government must do far more to protect them , presidential cancer advisers said on Thursday .
Century City and downtown Los Angeles are seen through the smog December 31 , 2007 .

Although most experts agree that as many as two - thirds of cancer cases are caused by lifestyle choices like smoking , poor diet and lack of exercise , the two - member panel said many avoidable cancers were also caused by pollution , radon gas from the soil and medical imaging scans .
“ The incidence of some cancers , including some most common among children , is increasing for unexplained reasons , ” wrote the two panel members , Dr. LaSalle Leffall , professor of surgery at Howard University College of Medicine in Washington and Margaret Kripke , an emeritus professor at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center .
Cancer is the No. 2 killer of Americans , after heart disease .
Kripke and Leffall , both appointed by President George W. Bush , decided in 2008 to focus a report on potential environmental links to cancer .
“ The American people -- even before they are born -- are bombarded continually with myriad combinations of these dangerous exposures , ” they wrote in a letter to President Barack Obama at top of the report .
“ The panel urges you most strongly to use the power of your office to remove the carcinogens and other toxins from our food , water , and air that needlessly increase healthcare costs , cripple our nation ’s productivity , and devastate American lives . ”
A White House spokesman indicated he had not yet seen the report and the National Cancer Institute declined comment .

KNOWN RISKS
The American Cancer Society said the report downplayed known risks that cause most cases of cancer including tobacco , obesity , alcohol , infections , hormones and sunlight .
“ The report is most provocative when it restates hypotheses as if they were established facts , ” the society ’s Dr. Michael Thun said in a statement .
“ For example , its conclusion that ‘ the true burden of environmentally ( pollution ) induced cancer has been grossly underestimated ’ does not represent scientific consensus . ”
The American Chemistry Council , an industry group , agreed and said the report underemphasized prevention efforts .
The report , available at pcp.cancer.gov , offered some of its own advice to consumers .
For instance , the report said that although large studies have found no links between cell phone use and cancer , people would be prudent to wear headsets and make calls quickly .
The report delighted environmental groups that have been pressing for more regulation of chemicals .
“ It is very gratifying to see this remarkable report that addresses those concerns , ” said Julia Brody , executive director of the Silent Spring Institute .
“ The 40 - year war on cancer has been called for what it is ... a failure , ” Jeanne Rizzo , president and chief executive of the Breast Cancer Fund , which advocates about links between chemicals and breast cancer , told reporters in a telephone briefing .
New Jersey Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg said he hoped the report would help boost support for a bill requiring closer regulation of chemicals .
“ My Safe Chemicals Act will require testing of all chemicals , and take substances off the market if the manufacturer cannot prove they are safe , ” he said .
Depending on where you get your numbers , roughly 1/3 of all patients will not benefit from psychotherapy .
Why this is so is n’t entirely clear and could be due to multiple factors : intractable diagnoses , poor compliance / follow - through , an inadequate match between client and therapist , negative changes in the patient ’s life circumstances , etc .
Any and all of these can easily make therapy a failed endeavor .
When clients leave an unsuccessful therapeutic experience , shrinks often provide explanations couched in jargon , usually pointing to the patient ’s “ pathology ” as a reason for the lack of follow - through :
“ Clearly , the transference issues were far too intense for the patient to tolerate . ”
“ The Jungian archetype that emerged in session created a too startling response in the client ’s collective subconscious . ”
“ Without question the patient ’s defense mechanisms would n’t allow for the necessary vulnerability to facilitate the required psychological mindedness that makes the analysis flourish in its decided glory kostenpflichtige apps gratisen android .
How do I know this , you ask ?
I ’m the expert , that ’s how . ”
However , what you will rarely hear , if ever , is a therapist assume actual responsibility for the failed treatment .
Although it ’s important that clients feel confident in their providers ’ abilities , to see your therapist as without fault is naive .
Most readers of this site do n’t spend a lot of personal time with shrinks , but if they did they would hardly ever hear the professionals lament their mistakes or short - comings :
“ I was n’t empathic enough and left him feeling misunderstood . ”
“ I should have challenged the patient more , gotten her to think more about one particular issue . ”
“ I jumped in too quickly , I should have given him more space to get comfortable . ”
“ I was too cocksure and that made me appear cold and uncaring . ”
“ I just was n’t good enough to help him . ”
In short , it ’s never the therapist ’s fault lieder von soundcloud downloaden online .
We always do our jobs correctly , so if therapy does n’t work , it ’s either due to the psychological problem or the patient .
Why would we think this way ?
Part of it is our required role as promoting confidence in the therapeutic process .
Patients need to believe that we know what we ’re doing in order to invest the time , energy and finances into treatment vox sendungenen .
We are also greatly rewarded for our successes ; the rush of pleasure and pride we feel when clients say “ Oh , Dr. So and So , you ’ve changed my life ! ” is like a drug .
To think that your words and actions altered the landscape of a person ’s life is something you hold onto forever .
Add in a human being ’s natural urge and ability to avoid blame and suddenly you ’ve got a recipe for an overly confident shrink spirit wild und frei kostenlos download .
But there ’s another piece as well .
Consider a shrink ’s training .
During my graduate studies , I had a supervisor tell me that because therapy is an inexact science , one can never say that what you ’ve done was wrong .
“ Anything you say might actually be correct , accurate and helpful , so do n’t let anyone tell you that you might have erred . ”
He actually extended this line of thinking to never apologize for “ mistakes , ” such as being late for a session or forgetting an important piece of information about the patient ’s history dj software free full version german .
But ineptitude is , in fact , a viable factor for consideration .
While gaining acceptance into a doctoral program for practicing Psychology is quite difficult , once you ’re there , it ’s not all that hard to navigate through the program * .
Others will tell you differently , but as long as you are capable of reasonably structuring your time to read the textbooks and attend class , graduating is very easy ( read about the real difficulties of being a Psychologist here ) mms herunterladen telekom .
Those who do not finish their program rarely leave due to academic demands ; rather , they realize that this line of work is not for them or they simply do n’t complete their dissertations and thus ca n’t have their degree conferred upon them .
That said , graduation does not translate to success in real world psychology .
While a licensing exam is required , there is simply no adequate way to predict what students will excel as practicing psychologists die sims deutsch kostenlos downloaden .
And while many programs will point to intensive supervision and feedback about a student ’s clinical work throughout graduate training , the reality is that unless you engage in some grave ethical violation or consistently drool on yourself in session , your odds of passing are quite high .
But even the well - qualified practitioners are going to make their share of mistakes .
This site is constantly dissecting the “ human ” element of shrinks , which includes our foibles , idiosyncrasies and professional limitations spiele für pc herunterladen .
Shrinks need to work on what I ’m calling Humble Skills ( HS ) and recognize our errors and failures ( just peruse the archives to see the countless blunders I ’ve made and , make no mistake , my clients have often correctly pointed out when I ’ve fumbled the ball ) .
Psychology is often an inexact science and thus mistakes will be made .
We need to own up to that , acknowledging that we have said things to our patients that have not been beneficial or perhaps even hurtful settings for internet and mms .
In graduate school I worked with a severely mentally ill man who told me that a former doctor of his admonished him about his lack of progress .
“ If you do n’t get your act together you ’ll be walking the floors of an insane asylum for the rest of your life . ”
Of course selective memory could easily have been in play here , and perhaps the doctor was using warning as a possible motivator , but the reality is that the patient ’s interpretation of what was said created a deep psychological scar .
Let ’s end with this : if you ’re a shrink , sit back and really reflect on your own “ psychological mindedness , ” wonder if you ’ve simply dropped the ball at times in the therapy room mediathek direkt herunterladen .
Really consider viable mistakes you ’ve made and instances where you were simply not equipped to do the best work possible , especially those times when it was easy to point the finger at the client or the disorder .
I mean this not for the purposes of punishing yourself , but to be more humble , open and simply better at the job .
And if you are a client , do n’t use this post as a mechanism to abdicate all responsibility for your treatment .
Rather , view it as an invitation to consider your shrink as someone who might have said or done things that did n’t benefit you and , therefore , what might have been more helpful .
* An exception to this would be a small number of “ diploma mills , ” or programs that accept a colossal number of students ( in exchange for very high tuition rates ) .
A small number of these programs alone actually produce more than 50 % of the United States ’ Psychologists each year .

Is Wall Street Investment Bankers Inc. just a " straw man " real estate investment fraud ?
Yesterday , we noticed their ads on CNBC promising between $ 20,000 and $ 200,000 a month from real estate investments with " no upfront or investment cost . "
That sounded too good to be true .
A quick examination of the company 's website , address and contact phone only raised more questions , especially the lack of detail provided about how the business worked , which we noted in a post this morning .
We spoke with Vice President Rob Doucett today , but he declined to describe the nature of the business , referring us to another officer who deals with the press , Kate Arney ( We have n't yet heard back to our multiple requests for comment ) .
( Doucett did deny a connection to Concord Trading Group , a company banned from the futures industry for deceptive practices , which arose because Wall Street Investment Bankers had the same group address listed , and its voicemail was for Concord .
" I 've never even heard of Concord Trading Group to tell you the truth , " said Doucett in response to our questions .
" There are many companies in that building . " )
Regardless , the ad continued to run on CNBC today , and a source tells us FOX News is airing it in the New York area too ( Note : FOX tells us the company is not one of its advertisers , so we 're checking with Time Warner Cable about it being a locally - available ad )
While there is no evidence that Wall Street Investment Bankers is doing anything wrong , some of the claims made in the television commercial resemble a long line of fraudulent " straw man " real estate schemes .
An IRS round - up of recently shut - down scams have a common story line :
The fraudster recruits a " straw buyer " with good credit , often just looking to make an investment in real estate
The fraudster uses the name of the straw buyer to apply for a loan on a property they claim is undervalued , often exaggerating the straw man 's income level , work information and other financial details to get the biggest loan possible
The fraudster also exaggerates the value of the property , either through false appraisals or cosmetic improvements , again helping increase the amount obtained from the bank
The home seller gets paid the market price , while the fraudster gets to keep the additional money borrowed from the bank
The straw buyer is often paid an up - front fee simply for providing their name and signing the documents ( hence the Wall Street Investment Bankers promise of " at least , but not limited to $ 20,000 a month " )
The straw buyer is also promised a percentage of the property when it 's resold at a higher price ( hence the Wall Street Investment Bankers ' promise to " get you cash at closing " and the potential of a $ 200,000 a month payout )
In reality , the fraudster gets most of the loan money -- they may even pay the mortgage for a few months , just to be safe -- while the straw buyer is stuck with a huge loan for a property that 's worth far less than the jacked - up mortgage .
We asked a real estate law expert to evaluate the ad in light of recent " straw man " schemes .
Shari Olefson , a real estate foreclosure attorney with Fowler White Boggs , had not heard of Wall Street Investment Bankers , but said the language in the television ad was consistent with other fraudulent schemes .
" The obvious conclusion from the reference to using someones credit would be in connection with a mortgage or banking fraud , " says Olefson , author of Foreclosure Nation : Mortgaging the American Dream .
" I 'd need more info to draw a conclusion but based on what 's here this could fall squarely in the box of [ similar ] mortgage fraud cases . "
Olefson notes that either the " good credit " investor or the lending bank or both would likely not enter into the transaction " if a lender is induced into loaning money in based on someone 's credit score who is not actually a party to the transaction . "
She adds that the language in the ad could technically be true and legal -- " no upfront costs ; " " assumes all financial obligations for projects ; " and " no down - payment " -- but it 's suspicious .
Olefson says she 's seen similar cases in Florida .
" Basically they found under educated folks who wanted in on the real estate gig , convinced them they were legit , had them sign documents they did n't understand , " she says .
" Eventually these ' borrowers ' were on the hook for the loans they signed for when the people who were supposed to be making payments did not . "

The bomb attack on a mosque in Mogadishu ’s thriving Bakara market on Saturday marks a radical departure in the rules of war in Somalia .
While there have been targeted killings in Somali mosques before , this marks the first time a bomb has been used , killing at least 32 , including both members of the radical Al Shabab militia group as well as ordinary worshipers .
The target of the attack appears to have been Fuad Shongole , one of the top three Somali leaders of Al Shabab , but Mr. Shongole appears to have survived with injuries .
In a radio interview after the blast , Shongole blamed unnamed foreign security firms working for the African Union for the bomb attack , and encouraged Islamist fighters to take revenge .
" The Muslim people of Somalia must fight the African Union troops of the occupying force using the means at their disposal , including suicide attacks , " said Shongole .
" Go to their compounds and make all the necessary sacrifices to fight these invaders . "
Another level
In a war where even the army of the Somali government frequently shells busy marketplaces full of civilians , the bombing of a mosque at prayer time seems to be the last remaining taboo of war .
Details of how the bomb blast was carried out – with a planted bomb set off by remote control , or by suicide bombers wearing bomb vests – are still unknown , and if investigated may never be divulged .
Experts say that the bomb blast could be a signal of an internal power struggle within Al Shabab , although no group has taken credit for the attack .
“ We do n’t know who is responsible for the attack , but the most likely answer would be factions within Al Shabab itself , ” says E.J. Hogendoorn , director of the Horn of Africa program for the International Crisis Group ’s office in Nairobi .
Whoever carried out the attack , Mr. Hogendoorn adds , it is certain that “ this does really take the tit - for - tat attacks up another level .
Mosques were considered out of bounds for bomb attacks . ”
A ' staggering blow ' to Al Shabab
No organization has claimed credit for the blast , but Ahlu Sunna Wal Jamaa , a moderate Islamist militia group that recently added its forces to the Somali transitional government , called the attack “ a staggering blow to Al Shabab . ”
“ Our sources did not know who is behind this blast , ” writes Abdul Kareem Hussein Abdi , an Ahlu Sunna spokesman based in Nairobi in an email to the Monitor .
“ Similar operations targeting extremist officers occurred recently at Dinsor district in Bay region . ”
Mr. Abdi says his sources inform him that Shongole was wounded in the arm and in the chest , and that he was taken to Mogadishu ’s Daynile Hospital for treatment .
Other senior Shabab commanders , including Mohamed Aden , were among 80 wounded in the blast , and top Shabab officers Abdikafi Ahmed Abu Maryan and Abdulbaasid were killed , he writes .
The bomb attack comes at a time when the United - Nations ’- supported transitional government has been receiving substantial military support and training from Uganda , Kenya , Ethiopia , and Djibouti in advance of an expected major offensive .
The UN ’s special representative to the Somali government , Ahmedullah Ould - Abdallah said last month , that in terms of increased security measures around Mogadishu and reinforcement of the Somali forces , the offensive has “ already begun . ”
Islamists take pirate port
But the threat of a government offensive does n’t seem to have stopped Islamist militias from expanding their own territory .
On Sunday , 200 fighters from the Al Shabab ally , Hizbul Islam , reportedly took control of the city of Haradhere , Somalia ’s largest port for piracy .
Dozens of captured ships and hundreds of merchant marines are being held in Haradhere , awaiting ransom payments , and it remains unclear what effect the Islamists will have on piracy in the city or on the lives of the sailors , some of whom are Westerners .
“ The one thing we know is that the ICU ( the Islamist Court Union ) ended piracy in South Central Somalia , ” says Mr. Hogendoorn .
Al Shabab and Hizbul Islam are offshoots of that Islamist government that took control of Somalia for six months , before being ousted by an Ethiopian military occupation force in December 2006 .
“ If Al Shabab wanted to stop piracy , it could .
Now the question is what they want to do .
It depends on how desperate they are for money . ”
Increased scrutiny of financial transfers from the Somali expatriate community living in Europe and the United States has sharply diminished Al Shabab ’s outside support .
Local news reports say that pirate leaders on land were seen fleeing Haradhere a few hours before the Hizbul Islam troops arrived .
Experts say that pirates out at sea may simply set up their operations somewhere else such as the port of Eyl in the semiautonomous Somali region of Puntland , where the government seems to have been unable or unwilling to shut down pirate operations .

Georges " Rush " St. Pierre
Welterweight
Other contenders :
For five rounds , St. Pierre beat on Dan Hardy and cranked on his arms .
However , the welterweight king was unable to get “ The Outlaw ” out of the Octagon .
With his third five - round decision win in his last four bouts , St. Pierre has become a target of criticism from many for his inability to polish off his challengers , however dubious those critiques may be .
The much - anticipated rematch between Fitch and fellow former title challenger Thiago Alves has now been targeted for June 12 , when UFC 115 heads to Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada .
Now , fans can only hope the bout does not fall apart for a third time .
With a successful angiogram completed and a clean MRI pending , Alves should get a chance to erase his June 2006 loss to Jon Fitch at UFC 115 in June .
The “ Pitbull ” now has to stay healthy , as last - minute medical issues have cancelled the meeting the last two times it was scheduled .
Hardy lost all five rounds of his March 27 title matchup against Georges St. Pierre .
Despite a nasty armbar and kimura from “ Rush , ” Hardy was bloody - but - unbowed in defeat and perhaps extracted a measure of respect from a previously skeptical public regarding his status in the welterweight division .
Thiago entered his UFC 109 bout with Mike Swick , once again , as an underdog .
Once again , he blew away an American Kickboxing Academy product , choking Swick out cold in the second round to prove definitively that his victory over Josh Koscheck was no fluke .
Next comes a UFC 115 matchup with Martin Kampmann .
Despite his evolution since appearing on the first season of “ The Ultimate Fighter , ” Koscheck has yet to challenge for the UFC welterweight crown .
In order to earn that right , he will need to take out fast - rising British star Paul Daley at UFC 113 on May 8 .
In his first two UFC appearances , Daley blew the doors off of quality fighters in Martin Kampmann and Dustin Hazelett .
Now , a UFC welterweight title shot may hang in the balance when he takes on Josh Koscheck at UFC 113 on May 8 in what amounts to a de facto title eliminator .
Coming off a disappointing decision loss to Dan Hardy in November , Swick ’s bout with Paulo Thiago at UFC 109 left him in even worse shape .
He was choked unconscious in the second round and pushed further back in the UFC welterweight title picture .
Diaz might be facing punishment of some kind due to his involvement with the Strikeforce melee on April 17 in Nashville .
The Strikeforce welterweight champ is nonetheless scheduled for international duty , as he 's slated to meet veteran Hayato " Mach " Sakurai at Dream 14 on May 29 in Saitama , Japan .
Kampmann was scheduled to get back in the saddle against rising contender Ben Saunders at UFC 111 on March 27 .
However , a nasty gash on his forehead nixed the Dane from the bout .
Kampmann will instead meet Paulo Thiago at UFC 115 .

Ordinary Greeks are angry at pay cuts and tax rises
Greek authorities have started naming and shaming doctors alleged to have avoided paying taxes .
The finance ministry has published the names of 57 doctors who are accused of failing to pay tax .
The ministry imposed fines of several hundred thousand euros on 11 of the worst offenders .
The crackdown is part of a campaign to stop the widespread corruption and tax evasion that have contributed to Greece 's debt crisis .
The finance ministry warned that it would confiscate the contents of bank accounts belonging to those who owed money to the state .
It estimates that by seizing such accounts , it can collect more than $ 40bn ( £ 27bn ) , which constitutes 10 % of Greece 's enormous national debt .
The government 's move is designed to satisfy widespread public demands for tax cheats to be punished .
It also aims to pacify ordinary people who are angry that they are having to suffer pay cuts and tax rises and believe that the rich are escaping scot - free .
Doctors , along with lawyers and other freelance , middle - class professionals , have been accused of fuelling Greece 's black economy by failing to give receipts and under - declaring income .
While the name - and - shame campaign will undoubtedly win approval in some quarters of Greek society , it will also increase pressure on the government to lift parliamentary immunity , which currently protects corrupt politicians from being prosecuted .
A lone thief broke into a Paris museum last night and stole five paintings possibly worth hundreds of millions of euros , including masterpieces by Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse , French police said today .
A police spokesman said works by Picasso , Matisse , Georges Braque , Amedeo Modigliani and Fernand Léger were reported missing early this morning from the Paris Museum of Modern Art .
The total value of the paintings was initially put at € 500 m ( £ 430 m ) by the Paris prosecutor 's office , but Christophe Girard , the deputy culture secretary at Paris City Hall later said it was " just under € 100 m " .
The pictures are : Le Pigeon aux Petits Pois ( Pigeon with Peas ) an ochre and brown Cubist oil painting by Picasso ; La Pastorale ( Pastoral ) , an oil painting of nudes on a hillside by Matisse ; L'Olivier Près de l'Estaque ( Olive Tree near Estaque ) by Braque ; La Femme a l'Eventail ( Woman with a Fan ) by Modigliani ; and Nature Morte aux Chandeliers ( Still Life with Chandeliers ) by Léger .
The burglary was discovered just before 7 am .
A single masked intruder was caught on a CCTV camera taking the paintings away , according to the prosecutor 's office .
A window had been broken and the padlock of a grille giving access to the museum was smashed .
The paintings appeared to have been carefully removed from their frames , rather than sliced out .
Police and investigators have sealed off the museum .
Today , visitors climbing the steps to the ornate bronze doors of the museum were informed by written notices that for " technical reasons " they would have to come back another time , while the world 's media swarmed around the five police officers on guard outside .
By early afternoon , the entrance had been cordoned off and security barriers erected .

Girard , who is deputy to the mayor of Paris , Bertrand Delanoë , said the theft was a " serious crime [ against artistic ] heritage " that had revealed failings in the museum 's security system .
" There are three [ security ] people in the museum at all times but those three people saw nothing , " he said , adding that all five paintings belonged to the museum 's permanent collection and were in good condition .
Those responsible for the theft , he went on , had clearly been very organised .
Delanoë said : " I want everything to be done to recover these masterpieces . "
Patricia Schneider , a New Yorker on holiday in Paris who had come to see the collection , said she was shocked by the news of the theft .
" It feels intrusive when any great artwork is stolen , " she said .
Her mother , Mimi , added : " That it can happen in this day and age , with all the security measures that are taken , is appalling . "
Le Monde reported that the paintings were so well - known that it would be difficult to sell them on the open market .
Previous thefts have involved paintings being stolen to order on behalf of private collectors .
The theft is being investigated by the Brigade de Répression du Banditisme , France 's elite police armed robbery unit .
Last December , thieves stole a pastel by Edgar Degas worth € 800,000 from an exhibition in Marseille .
The work , Les Choristes ( The Chorus ) , was found to be missing from the Musée Cantini by a security guard when he opened up .
The work , on loan from the Musée d'Orsay in Paris for the exhibition , had been stolen overnight .

One of the beauties of football is its capacity for reinvention , without great rewriting of the rules .
Unlike certain other sports – for instance Aussie Rules , which I pick on for no reason other than that the issue was brought to mind by this piece in the Sydney Morning Herald – football seems to have ( historically justified ) faith that coaches and players will be able to mediate their own way away from predictability or , worse , unwatchability .
Yes , there has been tinkering with the offside rule , and the backpass and the tackle from behind have been outlawed , but essentially a player from a century ago could be parachuted into a game today and would need no more than a two - minute tutorial to get him up to speed on the modern rules .
He'd be gasping for the Woodbines after 10 minutes , admittedly , but he would at least know what was going on .
When a rigid W - M seemed dominant , fluid 4 - 2 - 4 rose up to overcome it .
As catenaccio threatened to strangle the game , along came Total Football .
As Johan Cruyff was accusing 3 - 5 - 2 as being " the death of football " because it killed the winger , single - striker systems emerged to reintroduce them .
Football constantly evolves , and watching Internazionale frustrate Barcelona two weeks ago , it was hard not to wonder whether tactical historians of the future will look back on that game as a turning point as significant as , say , Hungary 's 6 - 3 win over England in 1953 , Celtic 's 2 - 1 win over Inter in the 1967 European Cup final or Italy 's 3 - 2 victory over Brazil at the 1982 World Cup .
It rather depends , of course , on what happens next as to whether this is confirmation of a trend or a blip , but what Inter 's victory has done is to challenge the assumption that the " best " way to play is to maintain possession and pass a side to death – as Barça have , as Spain do and as , in a slightly less aesthetically pleasing way , Brazil do .
In context
Now , some caveats .
Inter still lost at Camp Nou , and but for a handball decision against Yaya Touré that could have gone either way , would have gone out on the away goals rule .
Although they were themselves wronged in losing Thiago Motta to a red card ( the continuing unwillingness of the authorities retroactively to punish those , like Sergio Busquets , who have blatantly cheated is bewildering ) , they also had the benefit of two key decisions in the first leg , in that Diego Milito 's goal was offside and Dani Alves should have had a penalty ( although it 's hard to have sympathy with somebody who cries wolf so often ) .
And , of course , Barça were disadvantaged in having had to make the journey to Milan by bus , which perhaps left them leggy and not quite so sharp in their pressing as they had been , for instance , at the Emirates .
So their 3 - 1 lead was fortuitously obtained , and without it , Inter would not have had the platform on which to build their rearguard action , and even then it might have meant nothing had Bojan 's late strike been allowed to stand .
And yet , for all that , to make Barcelona look so toothless when they had 84 % – 84 % !
- of possession is remarkable , and shows what can be achieved with rigorous organisation allied to immense mental strength .
José Mourinho 's claim that his side deliberately gave the ball away so as not to lose focus may have been exaggeration for the sake of bravado but , whether purposeful or not , to prosper having had so little of the ball seems almost the definition of anti-football .
( Earlier this season , a frustrated Arsène Wenger asked how his side were supposed to play properly when other teams persisted in playing anti-football against him , and raised the thought of the former Estudiantes coach Osvaldo Zubeldía , an evangelist for " anti-fútbol " , storming into a press conference in La Plata demanding to know how his side were supposed to spoil and break the game up when the opposition persisted in playing " fútbol " against them , passing and dribbling , having shots and generally disrupting his team 's game plan . )
At the very least , Inter 's success must make football ask whether possession is really all that important .
The British debate
Nobody likes to talk about it , of course , what with the instinctive British distrust of anything resembling a theory , but English football in the 1970s and early 80s went through a philosophical battle every bit as keenly fought as the clash between Bilardisme and Menottisme .
Where the Argentinian debate was essentially a moral one – was football about beauty or about winning ?
– the English debated the importance of maintaining possession .
For them , the divide between winning and beauty seemed almost artificial : football was just played , and – to exaggerate slightly - it was assumed that everybody accepted that cheating was bad , kicking people was acceptable and that skill , rooted in the sort of powers of deception that seemed worryingly close to cheating , was largely to be distrusted .
On the side of possession was Allen Wade , the technical director of the FA , whose coaching course was such an influence on the likes of Roy Hodgson .
Arguing against that was Charles Reep , whose ideas would become FA policy under Charles Hughes , Wade 's successor as technical director .
Reep is a much - maligned figure , and to an extent that is understandable .
He was , as Howard Wilkinson said , " a zealot " , a fussy , rather pompous figure , unsubtle of thought , and intolerant of any criticism .
To dismiss him out of hand , though , would be wrong , for he was the British pioneer of match analysis – touchingly , he would record games from the stand at Plymouth 's Home Park wearing a miner 's helmet to illuminate his notebook – and , however questionable his conclusions may have been , they were at least honestly held and based on meticulous research , if not rigorous analysis .
When he fell out with Hughes , accusing him of plagiarising his ideas to write his hugely popular coaching manual , The Winning Formula ( something Hughes vehemently denied ) , his dismissal of the book was rather magnificent , pointing out that its conclusions were based on a study of 202 goals , while he had analysed 9,175 .
In 1973 , he wrote League Championship Winning Soccer and the Random Effect : The Anatomy of Soccer under the Microscope , a book outlining his theories that remains unpublished .
In it , he analysed England 's 3 - 1 home defeat to West Germany in the first leg of their 1972 European Championship quarter - final .
Most regarded the game , in which a Günter Netzer - inspired West Germany passed and passed and passed and made England look lumberingly Neanderthal by comparison , as England 's most crushing setback since the 6 - 3 defeat to Hungary .
But not Reep .
" Many managers , " Reep said , " still seem to believe that , if they scorn the long forward pass , and play ' cultured ' , ' smooth flowing ' football , they will not only please the crowd , and be praised by the Press , but also score enough goals to win promotion too …
The very meagre use of the long pass by West Germany recently , will doubtless cause much imitation in the Football League … several first division teams have been observed … to be apparently imitating West Germany 's extreme elaboration .
The Press call it ' playing total football ' . "
Long passes may not find their intended target , but for Reep that was irrelevant .
" While the intention should always be to find a team - mate with each long forward pass , " he wrote , " the long pass not received brings valuable gains , and is by no means wasted . "
His figures , he claimed , showed that in terms of effectiveness of chance creation five long passes not received are the equal of four long passes received .
" Passing has become such a fetish that when watching ' modern ' play one sometimes has the impression that goal - scoring has become the secondary objective , with ' stroking the ball about ' in cross - field moves , taking first place . "
Reep was largely protesting against what he saw as pointless sideways passing , and to an extent he had a point .
Mourinho has introduced English football to the notion of " resting with the ball " , and ball retention in itself can be a way of wearing down an opponent , even if there is not a lead to be protected , but there is a danger that possession becomes an end in itself , rather than a means to opening space or running down the clock .
There are times when sideways passing is simply a means of offloading responsibility , and there were spells last week when Barça 's passing , usually so incisive , seemed like passing for passing 's sake .
As Hughes adapted Reep 's ideas , and applied them at the FA 's Centre of Excellence at Lilleshall , direct football became the explicit tactical philosophy of the English game , and the emphasis came increasingly to focus on long diagonals and effort .
Position or possession ?
Egil Olsen , who had played 16 times for Norway , and was a lecturer at the Norwegian University of Sport and Physical Education , took Wade 's theory , dissected it and presented a revised model .
His statistical analysis suggested that the probability of scoring again before the ball goes dead is greater when the ball is with the opposing goalkeeper than with a side 's own , which led to his conclusion that the position of the ball is more important than who is in possession .
Accordingly , after becoming national coach in 1990 , he demanded that balls be played as often as possible into the " bakrom " – that is , the space behind the opposition 's defensive line .
Norway ended up being ranked second in the world .
There are reasons to be cautious with the work of Reep in that he pays no attention to the quality of the teams involved .
It seems , for instance , a reasonable assumption that the poorer a team is technically , the greater the risks when it attempts to play possession football and , equally , the better an opponent , the less likely they are to be undone by a simple long ball .
Hughes 's figures , insubstantial as they are , tend to support the theory that the higher the level , the less effective direct football is ( very briefly , if you separate goals scored in internationals in his sample , 63 % resulted from moves of five passes or fewer , as opposed to an overall figure of 87 % ) .
Where the analysis of Reep and Hughes seems deficient is that they seem to have assumed teams should constantly be trying to score .
Inter last week had little intention of doing so .
Other sides in a similar position – Brazil against England in the 2002 World Cup , for instance , or Liverpool in the away leg of their Champions League quarter final against Juventus in 2005 – may have defended their advantage by holding possession ;
Inter preferred to surrender possession and hold a position just outside their own box .
It worked , and while they may have had a touch of fortune , it is also the case that they frustrated Barça as well as anybody has done this season , so in that regard it must be regarded as having been a successful tactic .
General application
Perhaps , though , this was a special case .
Inter proved themselves a team with great tactical discipline – as they had in holding Fiorentina when down to nine men earlier in the season – and they were playing a side who pose a special set of problems in a game in which they knew narrow defeat would be enough .
Opta statistics , produced in conjunction with Castrol , show that over the past two seasons in the Premier League in only around a third of games did one side have 60 % of possession or more , and when they did they won 52 % of the time , and lost 25 % .
If a side had 70 % possession or over ( which happened in 4.7 % of games ) , they won 67 % of the time and lost 17 % .
Only once in the past two seasons did one side have over 80 per cent possession – Liverpool , in their 3 - 2 win at Bolton last August .
In the closer games , having 50 - 59.9 % possession meant a side won 43 % of the time and lost 31 % .
So there is a clear correlation between dominating possession and winning matches .
Intuitively , we know that there are sides who are successful at counter - attacking , which logically means accepting a lower percentage of possession .
What Inter showed last week , is that there are specific cases in which a radical disregard for possession can succeed .
At Milan , Arrigo Sacchi got fed up of players moaning about his obsession with team shape , and so proved its worth with a simple drill .
" I convinced [ Ruud ] Gullit and [ Marco ] Van Basten by telling them that five organised players would beat 10 disorganised ones , " he said .
" And I proved it to them .
I took five players : Giovanni Galli in goal , [ Mauro ] Tassotti , [ Paolo ] Maldini , [ Alesandro ] Costacurta and [ Franco ] Baresi .
They had 10 players : Gullit , Van Basten , [ Frank ] Rijkaard , [ Pietro Paolo ] Virdis , [ Alberigo ] Evani , [ Carlo ] Ancelotti , [ Angelo ] Colombo , [ Roberto ] Donadoni , [ Christian ] Lantignotti and [ Graziano ] Mannari .
They had 15 minutes to score against my five players , the only rule was that if we won possession or they lost the ball , they had to start over from 10 metres inside their own half .
I did this all the time and they never scored .
Not once . "
There are times when possession matters less than organisation .

A simple way to do the comparison is to look at something called the rent ratio : the purchase price of a house divided by the annual cost of renting a similar one .
The number 20 provides a useful rule of thumb .
When you do the math , you discover that a ratio above 20 means you should at least consider renting , especially if you may move again in the next five years or so .
When the ratio is well below 20 , the case for buying becomes a lot stronger .
In many large metropolitan areas , including New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , Houston , Dallas , Atlanta and South Florida , the average ratio is now 16 or lower .
It was more than 25 in several of these places at the peak of the bubble , about five years ago .
With a ratio as low as 16 and interest rates as low as they are , the costs of owning can be less than the costs of renting — and buyers will end up worse off only if prices fall considerably more .
A two - bedroom Spanish - style condominium in Beverly Hills , Calif. , for example , recently went on the market for $ 1.075 million , notes Don Heller of Prudential California Realty .
Including taxes , condo fees and the tax deduction for mortgage interest , a typical buyer making a 20 percent down payment would face an effective monthly payment of about $ 6,000 .
Compare that with the monthly rent on a similar two - bedroom condo nearby — $ 7,600 .
The math works out similarly in less costly areas , too , be it once booming cities like Phoenix and Orlando , Fla . ; Midwestern cities like Minneapolis and Cleveland ; or the outer - ring suburbs of most big cities .
Much of New York ’s outer boroughs appear to fall into this category .
The problem for potential buyers is that many real estate agents argue for buying even in places where the numbers do n’t add up .
In the Bay Area , the rent ratio remains around 30 .
In Seattle , it ’s about 28 .
In parts of Manhattan , it appears to be about 25 , according to current listings .
“ In most markets , you ’re better off buying , ” Thomas Lys , an accounting professor at Northwestern University , says .
“ But once the ratio gets to 25 or 30 , I ’d say , ‘ You know what ?
There may be a bubble . ’ ”
The rent ratio has long been higher in New York and San Francisco than most places , perhaps because of zoning rules or because the cities are home to large numbers of affluent households willing to pay extra to own .
So it ’s possible that prices will not fall .
But they are already high enough that the monthly costs of owning often exceed the cost of renting — even without taking into account the down payment or other one - time costs .
We get a lot of tips and leaks in our [ email protected ] email ( which I encourage you to use if you want to alert us of any unreleased news ) .
Some of these leaks are pure conjectures , some make sense but have no foundation or proof , and some … some sound pretty credible .
Today , we have one of those leaks , and even though there is no proof that this information is true , I have reasons to believe that what the source is saying is not a lie .
The Leak
In 2 days , on May 19th - 20th , the long - awaited Google I/ O conference is going to be commencing in San Francisco , with all kinds of announcements about the future of Android expected , such as the details of Android 2.2 FroYo , Flash 10.1 on Android , FroYo speed improvements , wireless tethering , and Android Market updates .
We 've already talked about and provided exclusive screenshots of the upcoming WiFi hotspot feature and broke the news about FroYo speed boosts , but we have n't yet spent any time talking about the Market .
Today 's leak , however , is not even about the next version of the Market that we 'll see in Froyo .
It is about the generation of the Market after that , the one Google has only started planning .
Next - Next Gen Android Market
We received a tip that Google conducted a meticulous multi-stage focus group study , for the final round of which it selected a small number of participants - around 16 - and flew them to the Googleplex or a similar Google - owned central location .
The participants were asked a series of Android Market related questions , some of which you will see below .
While a focus group is surely not proof of actual upcoming features , the bullet points below make quite a bit of sense and could serve as an indication of where Google * might * take the Market .
Again , take everything with a grain of salt .
Here we go :
7 day journal of app use habits including what we installed / uninstalled , how many times we went to the market , what categories we looked at , what apps we used and where we learned about apps ( market , websites , etc ) this was done every day for 7 days .
After 7 days , roughly 16 people were chosen for interviews at Google .
Asked about future features and how interested we would be in them .
Spent a lot of time on social integration such as twitter , facebook .
Asked / talked about Guru / expert ranks for some developers on the market
Asked about Following / favoriting developers on the market
Asked about developer bios on the market which would include links to their site , twitter , whatever
Asked about app recommending such as a feature to recommend apps you like to friends via the market
A whole lot about social networking / integration
Asked about filters for searching within the market including searching using variable like a certain rank or higher
Asked / talked about developer responding to comments
No time line mentioned .
Could be this market update could be after it .
Let 's Summarize
So there you have it , folks .
It looks like the big ticket items are , in the order I think is the most interesting :
an ability for developers to leave replies to comments
developer expert status , perhaps global ranking
better app filtering - we 've been asking for this for ages
following developers and getting notified of new applications created by them
recommending apps to friends - this is kind of reminiscent of the HTC Wildfire announced today
I have good reasons to believe we wo n't be seeing these features in the next Market release , so do n't get your hopes up too high if some of them stroke a cord with you .
Only time will tell how accurate the results of this focus group have been .
Which feature am I excited to see the most ?
Better commenting on apps .
The current situation with only being able to leave a single comment per app , without an ability to track responses to it , or even simply properly respond to someone else 's comment is simply unacceptable .
I hope there is some truth to what the rumor had to say regarding commenting , and then some .

What 's really happening with ENDA ?
Well , whatever 's happening , write your Representative again by clicking here .
Yes , again .
Do you brush your teeth every day ?
Into this battle comes Alison Green , who writes the " Ask a Manager " workplace advice column for U.S. News & World Report 's Web site .
This week on her personal blog , she addresses a reader question : is my transgendered coworker using the right bathroom ?
At the same time , it 's the second week in May , and questions about when this vote will take place are met with non-answers and sincere protestations about doing it right .
The Hill , a sister publication to Roll Call , also published an article this weekend .
That one suggests ENDA is in big trouble .
On the one hand , the Dems said they would conduct a whip count and proceed to a vote after the Easter recess on April 13 .
They say they 're working hard on that .
Roll Call , an important DC newspaper read by the pols and their staffs , says ENDA 's a pretty sure thing .
What 's going on with ENDA , the Employment Non-Discrimination Act , which would finally prohibit overt homophobia and transphobia for millions of LGBT US employees ?
Optimists would point to the fact that reports suggest the whip count is going very well .
They counsel patience and calling your members of Congress .
" We 're so close , " said Diego Sanchez , senior aide to Barney Frank on last night 's discussion on Ethan St. Pierre 's Sodium Pentathol Sunday TransFM Radio show .
" Keep calling Congress , " he urged .
The Roll Call article supports this view .
Pessimists would point to the portion of the Roll Call article that laid a huge bombshell from Representative Frank that could derail the whole thing .
In it , Rep .
Frank is quoted as saying that new language in ENDA regarding bathroom use would be based on one 's " set of genitals . "
This raises fears of transgender advocates that there will be surgical requirements engrafted onto the bill .
I sincerely hope that 's a misquote , as Diego Sanchez implied in his interview last night .
The pessimists would also point to another article , the one in The Hill this weekend , which suggests that ENDA is in big trouble .
The Hill Article
The article in The Hill is what I would call a transphobic " dog- whistle " article , meaning that only those attuned to the right frequencies can hear the " fear transgender people " message .
Entitled " Transgender anti-discrimination bill becomes tough sell for centrist Dems , " it characterizes ENDA as a narrow " transgender anti-discrimination bill , " rather than a broad workplace protection bill that would affect millions of gay , lesbian and bisexual employees , as well as transgender employees .
The article suggests that bringing the " transgender bill " to the floor would bring Speaker Nancy Pelosi into disrepute and cause the Democrats to lose Congress .
It sub rosa implies that " transgendered " people " scare " legislators , and that centrist Democrats wo n't vote for the bill .
It neglects to mention that ENDA has majority support in both House of Congress .
Although The Hill moderates comments , it also published dozens of mean - spirited transphobic comments , including the first comment : " The only cure for ' transgender ' freaks is a thorough lobotomy . "
Good job " moderating , " Hill staffers !
This is quite inconsistent with The Hill 's view of itself :
In an environment filled with political agendas , The Hill stands alone in delivering solid , non-partisan and objective reporting on the business of Washington , covering the inner-workings of Congress , as well as the nexus between politics and business .
The Hill serves to connect the players , define the issues and influence the way Washington 's decision makers view the debate .
Non-partisan and objective ?
The article tracks the meme from the article published by Andrea Lafferty of the Traditional Values Coalition , listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center .
In her article in The Hill 's sister publication , Roll Call , Lafferty suggested that ENDA will endanger the re-election of Democrats running ragged after spending all their political capital on health care reform and hoping for a softball legislative schedule .
The Roll Call Article
In " Backers Say Gay Rights Bills Will Win in House , " a dash of cold water is first thrown onto DADT repeal , questioning whether the votes are there for it .
The article sounds a more cautiously upbeat note for ENDA :
Meanwhile , the whip count on ENDA , which Obama also backs , is entering its fifth week .
The effort has most recently focused on rechecking support among Members thought to be more comfortable with the legislation than politically imperiled moderates who have raised most of the concerns , one source familiar with the effort said .
That , the source said , bodes well for its progress .
But many Members remain officially undecided and have quietly voiced frustrations about the prospect of taking a tough vote that they see as a distraction from an agenda focused on job creation .
" It seems to run contrary to what the Speaker said a few months back about focusing on jobs and moving away from these controversial items , " one senior Democratic aide said .
" Anything that 's not specifically tied to keeping the economy going raises red flags for folks . "
But Frank said that he is optimistic about the vote count and that transgender protections will remain in the bill .
.... [ Rep. Tammy ]
Baldwin said that the whip count on ENDA is very strong but that they are pushing hard to whip against a politically charged Republican motion to recommit .
Baldwin had little sympathy for the complaints of moderate lawmakers who question the political wisdom of pushing gay rights bills in a difficult election year .
" Name one issue where you do n't hear that ? " she said .
" They should choose another profession . "
It 's good that our leadership is signalling a positive outcome on the ENDA whip count , and not caving to the fear of Blue Dogs , who do n't give a whit for millions of LGBT employees facing unemployment , underemployment , harassment , and air - tight closets .
Rep .
Frank also gives comfort to transgender advocates of ENDA .
" There 's no chance of doing it without it , " [ Frank ] he said of the transgender protections .
Frank said he 's told wavering Democrats that " the principle is the same .
It 's discrimination . "
Fears of Trans Advocates
Despite the optimistic tone of the Roll Call article , there is still trouble in River City .
Frank was also quoted in a way that will raise the fears of transgender advocates .
He implies that new , as yet unseen language in ENDA will impose a surgical requirement .
Frank said concessions were made in the drafting of the language to address moderates ' concerns .
For instance , Frank said , transgender people with " one set of genitals " would not be able to go to a bathroom for people with another set of genitals .
And , Frank said , they also would have to have a " consistent gender presentation " in order to be able to sue for discrimination .
" They can't sit there with a full beard and a dress , " Frank said .
Most trans advocates are fine with the idea of consistent gender presentation , the " no beards and dresses " requirement , in Frank 's piquant language .
For example , the Boston anti-discrimination ordinance , which is widely considered very progressive by trans advocates , also has a specific requirement of consistent gender presentation with regard to bathroom use .
Frank 's statement , however , goes well beyond that when he says transgender people with " one set of genitals " would not be able to go to a bathroom for people with another set of genitals .
A surgical requirement is unsatisfactory not only from the point of view of trans workers , but also from the employer 's point of view as well .
As I point out in my book , Transgender Workplace Diversity : Policy Tools , Training Issues and Communication Strategies for HR and Legal Professionals , surgical requirements are very unsatisfactory for all concerned in the workplace :
First , there are numerous types of SRS , some of which alter the genitalia only slightly and others of which vary in their effectiveness and appearance .
An SRS requirement requires the Company to obtain and assess proof regarding specific details of the employee 's medical history and treatment .
This is problematic because such questions may impact medical privacy laws , which differ by jurisdiction .
Furthermore , the use of SRS as a factor may create the perception that the Company endorses , condones or regulates its employees ' decision to undergo gender transition .
This is undesirable for reasons including employee relations , public relations , insurance coverage and potential litigation .
It is best for the Company to stay out of the employee 's medical decision - making .
Most problematic is the fact that the standards of care of the primary medical organization in this area ( www.wpath.org) require successfully living as the opposite sex for a year or more prior to medical approval for surgery .
Therefore , it is likely that an employee in transition will not complete his / her medical treatment for a substantial period of time .
Requiring an employee who appears female to the general public to use a men's facility , or vice versa , will likely cause more workplace distraction than necessary .... Frankly , although the use of SRS as a factor is intended to avoid objections to facilities usage , it fails to accomplish this goal because SRS does not address all objections to facilities usage .
SRS affects only a small portion of the body not usually disrobed in a workplace restroom .
SRS does not remove visible androgyny , nor does it remove the knowledge of co-workers that a transgender employee was born in the opposite sex .
The source of the concern among co-workers , if any , lies here , and will not be removed by an SRS requirement .
Rather , the issue is the comfort level of reasonable co-workers with sharing that particular space with that employee .
The set of five Facilities Usage Criteria suggested here better achieves the company 's goals of maximizing workplace harmony and minimizing distractions .
It may well be that Rep. Frank was misquoted as to the " set of genitals " comment .
Alternatively , he could also be attempting to provide political cover for ENDA , Or he may simply be a bit confused about this issue , as many people are , and meant to refer to the " consistent presentation " requirement .
We do n't know what he meant .
It certainly sounds like a surgical requirement , but everything I 've been hearing from DC emphasizes that there is not and will never be a surgical requirement .
I 'm in no position to cover for Rep .
Frank , so all I can say is that we will have to see .
Alison Green 's " Ask A Manager " Column :
Is my transgendered coworker using the right bathroom ?
Alison Green writes the " Ask a Manager " workplace advice column for U.S. News & World Report 's Web site .
This week on her personal blog , she addresses a reader question :
Is my transgendered coworker using the right bathroom ?
Since this post is already long enough , I will note that you can read it at the link just above .
I helped her craft an answer .
As the question shows , there is a great misunderstanding of how gender transition usually occurs in the workplace , as well as how to handle bathroom access .
It 's never a situation where someone decides one day to dress as the opposite sex and demand opposite sex bathroom access .
In addition , the question of one 's " real " or " legal " gender is completely irrelevant to the issues faced by managers in addressing gender transition in the workplace .
There are some interesting comments on Green 's site .
They show the level of confusion that we are dealing with here .
You might even have some useful comments to share with the workplace managers who read Green 's column .
You might start with the fact that " transgender " is usually considered an adjective , and that " transgendered " is generally thought to be incorrect usage .
( I forgot to mention it in my email to Ms. Green . )
Of course , we differ on this even within the trans community .
Oy , let 's not get into that again .
Researchers from the University of Leeds , UK , the Charité University Medical School and the Max Delbrück Centre for Molecular Medicine ( MDC ) in Berlin , Germany , have discovered a new driving force behind cancer growth .
Their studies have identified how ' junk ' DNA promotes the growth of cancer cells in patients with Hodgkin 's lymphoma .
Professor Constanze Bonifer ( University of Leeds ) and Dr Stephan Mathas ( Charité , MDC ) who co-led the study suspect that these pieces of ' junk ' DNA , called ' long terminal repeats ' , can play a role in other forms of cancer as well .
The work is published in Nature Medicine .
The researchers uncovered the process by which this ' junk DNA ' is made active , promoting cancer growth .
" We have shown this is the case in Hodgkin 's lymphoma , but the exact same mechanism could be involved in the development of other forms of blood cancer , " said Prof.
Bonifer .
" This would have implications for diagnosis , prognosis , and therapy of these diseases . "
' Long terminal repeats ' ( LTRs ) are a form of ' junk DNA ' -- genetic material that has accumulated in the human genome over millions of years .
Although LTRs originate from viruses and are potentially harmful , they are usually made inactive when embryos are developing in the womb .
If this process of inactivation does n't work , then the LTRs could activate cancer genes , a possibility that was suggested in previous animal studies .
This latest research has now demonstrated for the first time that these ' rogue ' active LTRs can drive the growth of cancer in humans .
advertisement
The work focused on cancerous cells of Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( the Hodgkin - / Reed Sternberg cells ) that originate from white blood cells ( antibody - producing B cells ) .
Unusually , this type of lymphoma cell does not contain a so - called ' growth factor receptor ' that normally controls the growth of other B - cells .
They found that the lymphoma cells ' growth was dependent on a receptor that normally regulates the growth of other immune cells , but it is not usually found in B - cells .
However in this case , the Hodgkin - / Reed Sternberg cells ' hijacked ' this receptor for their own purposes by activating some of the ' junk DNA ' .
In fact the lymphoma cells activated hundreds , if not thousands , of LTRs all over the genome , not just one .
Hodgkin-/ Reed Sternberg cells may not be the only cells that use this method to subvert normal controls of cell growth .
The researchers found evidence of the same LTRs activating the same growth receptor in anaplastic large cell lymphoma , another blood cancer .
The consequences of such widespread LTR activation are currently still unclear , according to the study 's authors .
Such processes could potentially activate other genes involved in tumour development .
It could also affect the stability of chromosomes of lymphoma cells , a factor that may explain why Hodgkin - / Reed Sternberg cells gain many chromosomal abnormalities over time and become more and more malignant .
Background
1 . There are about 1,300 new cases of Hodgkin 's lymphoma each year in the UK , including 150 in children .
2. LTR fragments were originally formed by infection with retroviruses , a type of virus that can integrate their own genetic material into a host gene .
The human genome contains thousands of these LTR fragments .
3 . The receptor that was observed to control cell growth in Hodgkin -/ Reed Sternberg cells is known as CSF1R ( the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor ) .
Torrent sites that track audio books are not new to this blog – we ’ve already covered some leading names in this niche such as My Anonamouse , Bibliotik and CatTorrent .
Anyways here ’s a promising new specialized private tracker that caters for audiobooks and audiobooks only ; ABTorrents .
ABTorrents tracks a wide range of content including fiction , children ’s books , adult novels , science fiction and books relating to many other topics - mostly non educational content .
After entering the BitTorrent arena several months ago back in 2009 , ABTorrents has recorded some impressive growth .
The site has built both a strong enough community and a rich torrent index and shows signs of becoming another BitTorrent success story .
Signups are currently open and if you are a fan of audio books , you might want to check this tracker out .
As of 3/5/2010 , ABTorrents currently tracks 1200 + torrents and 4400 + active members .
You ca n’t yet compare these stats with long standing trackers such as My Anonamouse but ABTorrent ’s growth in the past couple of weeks has been quite impressive .
Not only has the site been adding a lot of new members but it has managed to quickly push the total torrent count past 1000 as well ( and this is no easy task either , especially when it comes to a niche tracker ) .
Speaking of the content found on ABTorrents , there is no need to retell the fact that it ’s full of audio books .
The most important fact is that while most trackers tend to focus on educational content , ABTorrents has some widely sought after titles in fiction , literature , fantasy , science fiction , horror , comedy and other ( non E - Learning ) related categories .
To get a better idea on what sort of content you can find on this tracker , have a look at the screenshot below :
As you can see above , most indexed audiobooks are encoded in MP3 format ( at various bitrates ) .
There are no specific rules governing the audio quality of an upload and even ACC , OGG , FLAC , M4A , etc files are also allowed .
Right now signups for ABTorrents are open .
Currently , the site does not appear to have a maximum user limit set so it can be assumed that registrations will remain open for some time .
If you are a fan of audiobooks and want to be a part of a growing tracker , do n’t forget to check this site out .

“ I can calculate the movements of the stars , but not the madness of men . ”
— Isaac Newton , after losing the equivalent of $ 3 million in the financial catastrophe of the South Sea Bubble in 1720 .
The word “ bubble ” just has an inescapably happy feel to it , conjuring up kids and parties and sudden iridescent poppings , screams of laughter , the giddy clapping of happy hands and an overall lack of consequence .
That was fun ; now where ’s the cake ?
Even more so when the word gets paired with “ tulip ” or “ South Sea . ”
Where could the harm possibly be in such blithe and fragrant things ?
Certainly not in the words themselves : exotic petals , swaying grass - skirted maidens , spheres of trembling insubstantiality .
Things get a bit more pedestrian with the more up - to - date dot - com and housing bubbles .
But still , seriously , where ’s the harm ?
Well , to paraphrase Christopher Wren ’s epitaph :
If you seek its monument , look around you .
The financial wreckage from the most recent housing bubble ( that outbreak of “ irrational exuberance ” ) is still being inventoried , and its consequences are considerably more serious than the wet smacking pop associated with the word itself .
And there was no cake ( unless it came in the form of those sweet bonuses handed out as party favors to the executive celebrants up and down Wall Street ) .
And yet , despite the economic damage of the last few years , we are repeatedly soothed by the innocence of the word “ bubble ” itself .
Lulled by language , we ’re invited to contemplate , with relative equanimity , simply getting to hear that fateful “ pop ” every so often , as the inevitable price to be paid for the market freedoms of the unregulated capitalistic system .
Ah well : Kids will be kids .
But what if we were to conjure another metaphor ?
Perhaps a more apt analogy .
Might it help rouse a more pertinent response ?
Take , for example , the constantly surging froth of pre-cancerous cells in each of us .
At any given moment , a rogue cell might somehow lose a sense of its place in the organism — that it is a liver cell , say — and instead believe itself to be alone in a hostile , plunderable environment .
This is not surprising when you consider that there are 50 times more cells in a human body than there are stars in the Milky Way : 10 trillion versus 200 billion .
Something ’s bound to go wrong somewhere .
Under such circumstances , the rogue cell ’s raison d’etre becomes : “ Defend .
Survive .
Dominate : Be fruitful and multiply . ”
And so it does , using the local environment — of the liver in this case — as a food resource to be exploited by whatever means necessary
For most of us , most of the time , this pre-cancerous froth never proves a problem because there is a regulatory agency — the immune system — that quickly identifies those rogue cells , reminds them who they really are and encourages them , as it were , to commit suicide , a process known as apoptosis .
This fatal encouragement can come spontaneously from within the cell itself ( suddenly recognizing its own roguishness ) or from the surrounding healthy cells ( a neighborhood group enforcing community standards ) or from immune - system “ police ” cells patrolling the body as a whole .
This process is happening constantly , is part of the normal functioning of the healthy organism and gets accomplished without any awareness on our part .
Trouble occurs when , for some reason , the normal functioning of apoptosis breaks down — the cell ’s own compunction fails to kick in , the surrounding cells prove too weak or are otherwise distracted , the local regulatory agency is asleep at the switch — and the cell in question cannot be persuaded to end its life .
Instead , it multiplies exponentially , becoming the seed of a cancerous tumor .
Only now , at a certain threshold , does the greater organism become aware of it , and an existential conflict ensues .
The tumor is now set against the interests of the greater organism of which it was once a part .
Its brief is to flourish at all costs , to thrive at the expense of the surrounding healthy tissue .
Followed to its inevitable conclusion , this means doom for both the host and the tumor .
Though , of course , until that dreadful “ pop , ” the tumor does n’t see it this way .
What would it be like to think of the travails of the wider economy , the coursing flow of capital through the body politic , in those terms ?
( It ’s worth remembering that when the sainted Adam Smith first began to ponder the circulation of capital in the seminal explorations that would lead to his monumental “ Wealth of Nations , ” he was quite consciously modeling his inquiry on William Harvey ’s explanation of the circulation of blood a few generations earlier . )
What if , instead of that playful word bubble , we tried something a bit more accurately descriptive when growth at any cost became the goal .
Say , “ tumor ” : “ the dot - com tumor , ” “ the subprime tumor , ” “ the derivatives tumor . ”
Would anyone seriously gainsay the highest possible vigilance over the proper functioning of their own body or doubt the need for strong regulation ?
Who , facing the prospect of a tumorous outbreak or living with a body demonstrably prone to such outbreaks , would entrust that body to a band of physicians blithely committed to laissez faire regarding these fatal bubbles of flesh ?
Words matter .
Metaphors frame thought .
Pay them heed and tend them well .

296 ' funked up ' stocks -- trades canceled
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
After one of the most wild days on Wall Street , Nasdaq canceled trades of 296 stocks whose prices fluctuated the most .
At around 2:45 p.m. ET on Thursday , trades of a number of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange were slowed for about a minute due to excessive volatility .
During that short time , those stocks were opened up to electronic markets like the Nasdaq .
That 's when at least 296 stock prices saw enormous price changes .
Nasdaq has said it will cancel all trades that were executed between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. ET , in which the stock price traded more than than 60 % off of the stock 's price at 2:40 p.m .
( See the 296 stocks for a list of the stocks with canceled trades . )
Nasdaq coordinated the cancellations with other U.S. stock exchanges , and said the decision could not be appealed .
Around the same time that many stocks began to trade at strange prices , nearly every stock on the market began to rapidly sell off .
The Dow Jones industrial average , which had been down about 400 points just before 2:45 p.m. , plunged nearly 1,000 points in a matter of minutes .
It is still unknown who -- or what -- exactly triggered the massive sell - off and why a number of stocks that were trading at $ 40 or $ 50 a share fell momentarily to just a penny .
Many believe that the glitch was triggered by a series of events that began when the NYSE slowed down trading of a number of stocks , including Procter & Gamble .
Shares of P&G fell 10 % at around 2:45 p.m.
Thursday , at which point the stock hit what 's known as a " circuit breaker . "
The stock stopped trading on the NYSE for 80 seconds , and trades opened up on a number of competitors ' electronic exchanges .
But the circuit breaker mechanism that was designed to cool traders ' heads had the opposite effect :
The slowed trading occurred at a time that investors were growing increasingly worried about Greece 's debt issues and other economic factors .
The Dow , which was already down about 200 points at the time , quickly dropped about another 200 points in the 15 minutes between 2:30 p.m. and 2:45 p.m .
" The problem is that when [ the NYSE ] slowed down , it effectively took their traders out of the market at a time when everyone else wanted to sell , " said James Angel , a professor of finance at Georgetown University .
In other words , when the NYSE paused its trading , the off - exchange computers found no bids , or offers to buy .
The computers , which were looking for the best bid , were tripped up to believe the best bid was $ 0 .
The high - speed trading computers are designed to add a penny to each trade to make a commission on every deal , so the computers placed bets at a penny higher , or 1 cent .
" Sell orders became desperate and went straight to their competitors ' exchanges , which were n't slowed down , " said Angel .
" Since there were no other buyers , some computers had entered orders at a penny , so some stocks traded all the way down . "
Duncan Niederauer , chief executive of NYSE Euronext similarly told CNNMoney on Thursday that stocks are very thinly traded in such situations , which can lead to wild volatility .
Even though many of the trades never actually went through , even an unclaimed buy or sell order could have brought the stocks ' prices down to a penny .
Seeing stocks at such a low level triggered a momentary panic .
Accenture ( ACN ) fell from $ 40.13 at 2:45 p.m. all the way to just 1 cent before quickly rising back to $ 39.57 .
Sam Adams maker Boston Beer Co. ( SAM ) also fell to a penny before recovering to $ 55.82 .
Oxford Industries ( OXM ) tanked to $ 1.34 before soaring back to $ 19.51 a minute later .
But some other wild trades were not canceled by Nasdaq .
For instance , Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) traded down 22 % to $ 199.25 before recovering , but those trades were upheld .
Most notably , Nasdaq did not cancel trades of Procter & Gamble ( PG , Fortune 500 ) or 3M ( MMM , Fortune 500 ) , which momentarily fell 37 % and 22 % , respectively .
Both are components of the Dow , and their combined drop in price at around 2:45 contributed a loss 315 points to the Dow index .
The Dow fell nearly 1,000 points before storming back to finish the day down 348 points .

Each horse is different in how it learns and how it reacts to outside stimuli .
Certain methods of horse training may apply to some horses , but it does not mean that it will be effective to all breeds of horse .
To start horse training you must develop a communication system with the horse .
This might take time .
In the same way as children may not fully grasp the idea of things at an instant , baby horses in training may not get every pressure , pat or way of holding the reins at once .
When you apply a certain pressure , you expect a certain response .
During horse training , you must make the horse understand that a certain pressure should elicit a corresponding response .
We dont expect full compliance in the beginning , but as time goes by , these actions will be part of the horses vocabulary .
Throughout the course of the horse training , one by one these actions will be added to his vocabulary .
But these actions should still be broken down into minute details that the horse can take in one at a time .
Learn how to pace with each individual horse .
Training is something that should be done slowly and surely .
You must also learn how to speak to your horse in a way that it will be able to comprehend .
This manner of speaking would mean fewer words and more body language .
Horses are herd animals .
They learn well by imitating the leaders of the herd .
You should be that leader your horse will follow .
Patience is a key in training your horses .
You must also take into consideration that no one , animal or human , learns well when under stress .
You should not force lessons into your horse during horse training .
They dont appreciate the yelling and whipping , especially if they do not know what all the harshness is for .
Unlike humans who can speak their minds , horses resort to more physical responses .
And you certainly wouldnt want your horse to whirl , kick , strike and do out of hand movements .
You must create an environment wherein the horse can learn on its own , aside from the horse training that you give it .
It is also important to see the difference between having been able to teach the horse something and it just accepting it .
If a horse is relaxed when you do something , this does not necessarily mean that it is trained .
This might just mean to it as another thing a human being normally does .
Resistance at first is needed in order to see that the horse recognizes that something new is being taught to him .
The horses daily training routine should not be based on a set of particular things you want to teach to the horse .
It should be based on how your horse reacts to your actions .
Dont teach something new to it without reviewing what it already knows .
Most importantly - dont force your horse to go on horse training if it doesnt feel well .
A good routine does not only maintain the horses attention level , but also its comfort level .

The job market is showing signs of life , though its slow recovery suggests unemployment will remain high for years to come .
Employers added 162,000 jobs in March , the biggest monthly gain in three years , with one - third of the growth coming from the government 's hiring of 48,000 temporary workers for the 2010 Census .
Despite those gains , the jobless rate held steady at 9.7 % as new workers entered the job market and people who had previously quit the labor force returned .
The average length of unemployment rose last month to the highest point since record keeping began in 1948 : more than 31 weeks .
The number of workers out of work for six months or more rose sharply .
The latest report , which marks the third month since November in which payrolls increased , indicates the labor market is pulling out of a deep downturn that slashed more than eight million jobs since the recession hit in late 2007 .
" It confirms that the economy has turned an important corner , " says J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. chief economist Bruce Kasman .
" It 's been growing for a while , but I think what we 're seeing is that this growth is now broadening out to include jobs . "
Once upon a time , the presidents , prime ministers and chancellors of this world were just like you .
They went to college , they worked , they played ; some of them were cool .
Yet as their college days ceased , and their pursuit of the top job began , they relinquished personal style for sartorial homogeny .
In pulling on a grey suit and a plain tie , or , if they ’re a woman , a knee length skirt and a court shoe , they deftly limit our ability to jump to conclusions about who they really are .
Seeing how they looked when they were young is more revealing .

In February 2010 , doctors told Barack Obama to quit smoking .
Yet , although he apparently uses nicotine replacement therapy to curb the cravings , he still has n’t kicked the habit .
We hope he gives up for the sake of his health , but somehow his addiction makes him seem human .
The charismatic way he holds the cigarette in this picture , while looking straight into the lens , straw hat plumb on his head , foretells his presidency - clinching ability to engage with the public .

Here ’s Gordon Brown looking goofy .
The windswept hair , heavy jacket , floral tie and squiffy shirt tell of a man with better things to think about than elegant apparel .
It may seem quirky now , but the floral tie was standard fare at the time ; his reluctance to stand out emphasised by his apparent discomfort at being photographed .
The nervous hands and sideways glance suggest his motivation for entering politics was something more substantial than mere glamour .
Nicholas Sarkozy , French President

No man wears a scarf like a French man .
Here ’s Nicholas Sarkozy pulling off the look with nonchalant aplomb .
The mane and open shirt did more for him then than his stacked shoes and upright hair do for him now .
Silvio Berlusconi , Italian Prime Minister
Image source
The Italian premier , who once joked that Barack Obama ‘ has a good tan ’ , is known more for his misjudged gaffes , love of women , and alleged bribery then he is for his political convictions .
We think this photo , in which he looks like a suave , joking Mafioso , has captured him well .
Angela Merkel , German Chancellor
Image source
A young , smiling Angela Merkel looks grounded in this shot , sitting , as she is , on a rock .
While the wives of the world ’s leaders spar for best - dressed accolades , the German chancellor is famously dowdy .
Here , in her long skirt and short crop , she looks motherly , pragmatic , without artifice – qualities which have assured her popularity in the political arena .
Robert Mugabe , President of Zimbabwe
Image source
Here ’s Robert Mugabe looking like butter would n’t melt .
We ’re not sure what portents this picture reveals , though the white gloves betray a love of pomp and ceremony .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iranian Prime Minister
Image source
The Iranian Prime Minister is a picture of self - possession in this photograph , looking at once serious and kind .
During his political career he has become known on the one hand for his vehement rhetoric and confrontational attacks on the West , while on the other for nurturing a reputation as the ‘ people ’s friend ’ , speaking often about empowering women in Iranian society .
Vladimir Putin , Russian Prime Minister
Image source
We could n’t find a picture of Vladimir Putin at College age , but here he is as a young boy .
Former British Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , once described Russia as ‘ a riddle wrapped inside an enigma ’ , a statement which applies equally well to the country ’s current leader .
While the one - time judo champion appears cool and elusive in adulthood , in his youth he looked more vulnerable – a slip of a thing .
Kevin Rudd , Australian Prime Minister
Image source
We think Kevin Rudd was probably born wearing glasses and a neatly knotted tie .
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , Spanish Prime Minister
Image source
Affable Zapatero looks on top of the world in trainers and ripped jeans .
With one hand on his hip , the other relaxed , he looks , more than any other on this list , like a regular guy .
Little surprise then that during his leadership term he has legalised gay marriage , brought in fast - track divorces , created laws to promote gender equality and tackle domestic violence , and introduced an amnesty for undocumented workers : in short , championed the everyman .
One tweet yesterday said it all : " How can the [ US ] government sue Goldman Sachs ?
I thought Goldman Sachs ran the government . "
That charge is just a tad harder to make today , now that the biggest investment bank on Wall Street is fighting a civil suit for fraud filed by a government watchdog .
For anyone who wants a reckoning for the economy - devastating episode that is the banking crisis , this bears the promising indications of war between Wall Street and Washington .
Even more satisfying , this case goes straight to the heart of the financial crisis : it is about the dodgy sub - prime mortgage vehicles that drove all the market madness .
According to the Securities and Exchange Commission , Goldman Sachs created a package of dodgy home loans and flogged it to investors – without disclosing that one of its hedge - fund clients had picked the loans that went into the package , and had bet that the investments would fall in value .
What this amounts to is an allegation that Goldman knocked up a stinky investment that it knew would tank and scammed investors into buying it .
Goldman Sachs made money , the hedge - fund billionaire John Paulson made money – and the suckers lost more than £ 650 m .
If any British taxpayer wants to know who these suckers were , look in a mirror : our own RBS was the ultimate insurer for the deal and had to pick up the tab .
Goldman calls the allegations " unfounded in law and fact " .
But without wishing to get into what is set to be a big , bloody battle , it is possible to make three observations .
First , Goldman Sachs is going to have a hard time warding off the damage to its reputation done by this case .
For a taster , look at page 7 of yesterday 's SEC filing , which quotes an email from Fabrice Tourre , the executive who helped make and sell this investment :
" The whole building is about to collapse anytime now … Only potential survivor , the fabulous Fab[rice Tourre ] … standing in the middle of all these … exotic trades he created without necessarily understanding all of the implications of those monstruosities !!! [ sic ] "
Coming from a bank that bangs on about its good name and fair dealing , this stinks .
Second , this case marks a distinct turn in Washington 's approach to Wall Street – and about time too .
With the healthcare battle settled , Barack Obama is again talking about reforming the banks .
Let us hope that his bark is accompanied by a decent bite .
Finally , months before any regulatory action , this story was reported in detail by the New York Times .
Whatever happens in the case , its very existence is testimony to the role that good journalism can play in uncovering difficult and complex stories that affect us all .

Great web design happens with sound user needs , solid business goals and focused metrics .
Learning how to deconstruct a website is an important step in building a plan that aligns the company vision with the needs of users .
A good review will put the focus on the profitability of the business .
We deconstructed a few popular web pages below to stimulate the discussion around specific interaction issues many companies face .
We were not part of any of the design decisions and did not have access to the business objectives ; our recommendations are based on experience and repeated patterns we observe in web design .
And with that , here are five content heavy homepages deconstructed .
Mashable
Mashable is a huge social media news website .
Mashable does a good job fronting up articles — they know their audience .
It ’s refreshing to see a single focus on the top of the page .
They also do a good job of presenting headlines and pumping out regular content to their news - thirsty readers .
Advertising , however , seems at odds with their content strategy in many places on the page ( this is a common trend in content sites ) .
It may be useful to consider changing the placement of advertisements to encourage more click - through .
Full interactive view | Summary view
Regular readers might understand this statement , but based on the content on the homepage , it ’s really hard to understand how these articles tie to social media .
Holy navigation !
People read body copy first , so this much navigation on the top probably does n’t create more clicks into the site .
This is great , but it gets lost and it ’s not clear that you can read more by clicking on the ‘+’ symbol .
Good use of the bandwagon technique to get people following Mashable .
Right now these might be good for encouraging participation with the content , but it should be watched closely because of burnout .
The homepage is heavily devoted to using these social media tools ( which it should eat it ’s own dogfood ) &mdash as long as the site stays focused on good content , the use of them should only help grow readership .
Butting the headline up against the image actually creates more interest in the summary .
It ’s a good technique to create a quickly “ scannable ” headline .
With all the good things the layout does to get you invested in the content , the buttons create a heavy distraction , though the numbers on the buttons are extremely useful to users .
The Google Buzz icon shouts for attention .
A Med Rec like this performs better near the top when it ’s tied to content .
In the stream of information , this type of add will be ignored .
Interesting approach to get people to view the sky scrapper ad .
Tying these headlines to the ad probably increases the click through on the ad .
$ Square ads this low on the page probably do n’t perform well - integrating them between content articles will increase activity .
$ $$ We called this out on TechCrunch — taking sponsored events like this and putting them into ad space defeats the purpose of a powerful publishing platform .
Where are the benefits ?
Please sell me on why I need this iPhone app .
If it is a money maker , or provides more compelling ways to connect to users , then it makes sense to promote it .
$ $$ According to usability studies , clouds like this do n’t help users very much .
We assume this is more for SEO than readers - it ’s a daunting list of topics to get through at the bottom of a page .
Users will click on a high percentage of links if they are focused at the bottom of a page .
This list , however , is too long to reap this benefit .
These probably provide a revenue stream or help paying for the services .
Not very useful for users .
Interesting placement : this probably does fine in the middle of the page .
Is it sponsored ?
Might be good to call this out .
MSN
MSN ’s current design is a radical departure from their old homepage and a welcome change in a crowded market of news aggregators .
MSN has struggled to separate itself from Yahoo and Google – this makeover helps differentiate the service .
Microsoft has struggled to drive profits with their web properties because of their lack of laser - like focus on users .
The airy , light feel of the page makes it very approachable and inviting .
Users will rejoice .
It may be useful to create stronger hierarchies below the fold to encourage more return clicks — the way it is designed now does n’t make the links look very valuable .
Full interactive view | Summary view
It ’s interesting how companies alert people to a new site .
Putting a beta or preview label allows a team to deal with failure upfront .
But why ?
The navigation is simple and easy to drill down to a topic ( large clicking area ) , but the drop down menus get in the way .
They ’re a bit slow to respond to the rollover .
Great use of a headline .
Big and bold .
A huge departure from the old MSN homepage .
Now , this is a bold move by one of the most traffic pages on the Web .
The white space alone seems like a huge risk for such an advertising dependent page .
This is a new trend by Yahoo as well : cycle more news stories onto a single page .
The problem is that these are too small to accurately control .
Incredible discipline to not jam the ad higher on the page .
If you compare this design with the old homepage , they ’re still able to get the ad higher on the page .
Bummer , unlike the top nav , the clickable area on this subnav is relegated to the words .
Interesting treatment on the search bar .
This is a huge departure from the previous Bing search box .
Associating the search clicking action with Bing is good , but it ’s going to be extremely difficult to get people to say , “ just bing it . ”
All other search filters have been removed : it seems like a smart move .
Very odd placement for a security update !
This has to be a business requirement that was thrown into the page .
Amazing amounts of effort and money have been thrown into being with the cool kids , Facebook and Twitter .
Microsoft put $ 250,000,000 into Facebook , so it ’s surprising that Twitter gets free advertising .
We are surprised again by the constraints of this redesign .
Local , movies , maps and jobs are probably the four most used links ( Yahoo on the other hand forces you to choose your links ) .
This was a sound choice by MSN .
Huge effort around local content .
Full headlines are important ( Yahoo truncates the headlines of local news ) .
This is a nice addition ; local content is going to start growing .
Useful settings , but it ’s unclear why this was included as a main nav item .
The functionality is different .
Instead of just showing popular searches , contextual information is provided next to the term .
Very cool .
Odd placement of “ advertisement , ” the top ad has this below the ad .
Very sparse .
A small call to action might increase use of the search form .
Interesting constraint on this footer nav for a huge business that has hundreds of business units .
It will be interesting to see this one playing out .
It ’s incredible to see a big white patch here .
It gets filled with your information from the social site , but it ’s an activity that most people will not do .
Anyone in advertising yelling ?
Big departure : links are not blue and not distinguished unless you rollover the text .
Smashing Magazine
True to its roots , Smashing Magazine has a strong focus on content .
Over the years it ’s added depth to the site through new content and features .
With most growing websites , it ’s balanced new opportunities with its bread and butter , web design articles .
The number of new visitors that come to the site is staggering ( based on referral traffic we seen ) .
This makes it extremely difficult to balance the needs of the new readers with their loyal followers .
Staying focused on good content makes this task easier .
From a business perspective , it is recommendable to better align revenue streams ( ads , jobs , books , etc ) with the content .
The risk of alienating readers is small ; most users will tolerate offers if Smashing Magazine reduces the overall clutter and redundancy on the site .
Full interactive view | Summary view
Good use of different images on each page load .
Returning users will find this subtle technique draw them into the graphic .
The competition with the top horizontal ad makes this a battle of attention : where do you want me to click ?
Integrating content from a network is a great way to encourage cross traffic and it should be balanced with the overall goals of the site .
Finding a middle ground between a tab and fully featured posts would help this effort .
The white space around the logo gives it some nice breathing room and focus .
To give return users a little more value , tighten up the spacing and bring a little more content above the fold .
Generous size ads for the advertisers , but the wall of ads probably lowers the overall click - through .
$ $$ The Twitter and RSS numbers provide strong validation of the site .
The graphics are nice , but the visual style is not used anywhere else on the page .
This is a great idea , but the value is unclear : why do I want to sign up for the newsletter ?
Great use of big images to sell the story .
However , a wide gap is created when the ad is placed at the top .
Excellent use of quick links under the header .
Too many sites try to hide these in drop downs .
Yes !
Simple , big headlines scream : Read our content .
There are some great articles that get lost in this list .
This duplicates the tab on the top of the page .
It ’s a balance between creating traffic and loosing traffic .
This is an odd place to introduce general site content .
This additional list of tweets does n’t help attract new followers .
The text is out of context with replies and the visual style seems out of place .
This is near the headline , so it ’s a great benefit to the advertiser … but it also pushes the width of the content much wider .
This is a revenue stream that is hidden down in the sidebar .
Integration of jobs into the site will make traffic to this section higher .
$ $$ Focusing on the headlines and lead - in is a good tactic .
The usability does n’t fall apart with a slower loading image down the page .
Placing this new property on the lower half of the page reduces the exposure this new effort requires .
It also suffers from ad blindness .
Popular posts are great , but more context might make the value of the links go up .
When sprinkled down the page the impact declines .
The footer has good links .
Improving the hierarchy of links will provide more clicks and revenue .
People tend to look for launch points after scrolling down a page .
This type of personality goes a long way in building a loyal following .
The addition of pagination does n’t provide much context for the vast majority of visitors .
Focusing on a single call to action will increase the number of clicks .
TechCrunch
TechCrunch has put a heavy emphasis on providing great , up - to - date content .
This is a strategy that will continue to fuel their growth .
They have a number of efforts on the page that are n’t presented well , but their focus on content will continue to drive traffic to those initiatives .
Full interactive view | Summary view
Boxing in the ad around a piece of content helps increase click - through .
The logo , however , does n’t offer much in terms of actions and is likely to reduce the click - through .
TechCrunch does a great job of getting feed sign - ups , but these actions get lost in the shuffle .
It is very likely that people who subscribe to a feed are more likely to engage in the site .
$ $$ Good choice : people want content , not navigation .
However , the calls to action for these destinations should be stronger within the page .
The downside of a “ modular , ” boxed in design is that intersecting lines fight for the user ’s eye .
The downside of this advertising model is repeated ads - it grabs the attention of a user , but this effort will provide limited value for the advertiser .
In a blog structure like this , content space is valuable : but why treat the event as an ad ?
Content that supports the event would drive more invested clicks .
Is this an ad ? Editorial ?
Clicking on this graphic takes you to a blog entry , but it appears to be advertising .
It ’s very misleading .
Good information .
It costs money , but why treat this as an ad ?
Interesting use of buttons to show popularity of a post .
For design consistency it would be nice to right align with the dotted line .
Great use of images and headlines to draw people into the site .
This feature is a huge win over most editorial sites .
An A / B test might reveal having one big rotating editorial image and headline would actually encourage more clicks down the page and increase advertising click - through rates .
This is great .
Showing activity encourages more activity .
Boxing in the ad increases the click - through .
Removing the dotted line to the right might increase it even more .
Bold headers are a good choice .
Users appreciate the simplicity of a clear call to action .
They can choose to read the article or not .
This is where a user would expect to see search , though it feels a tad crammed and the rounded form elements do n’t seem to gel with the heavy grid system .
Logos seem odd and out of place .
For a site that considers placement of content , these seem to be thrown onto the page .
Eventually the value of these placements will go down as users continue to return for content .
Reducing the number of ads and increasing payments might encourage more click - through .
These two ad placements probably do n’t get a high click - through rate .
Humor keeps things real .
Even if it is for stats .
Content , content , and content .
TechCrunch gives users what they want .
A long scrolling page of content keeps people coming back .
Considering a better footer might increase traffic and engagement . $ $ $
CNN
CNN made a bold move by restructuring the entire website and putting a huge emphasis on video .
It ’s a very stark contrast from their old website , and while we like the dynamic elements , the three column approach makes it difficult to understand the hierarchy of the information .
It could be helpful to reduce the heavy red banner , simplify the columns and use more of the design choices made on the article pages .
Full interactive view | Summary view
This red header competes with the content .
It ’s a branding effort that fights with the use of the site .
Over time people will be influenced more by the quality of the content .
This is a unique branding decision to center align the logo .
It certainly creates awareness of the logo , but over time it will get in the way of what users want : content .
84 pixels is a lot of vertical space to highlight a logo .
This is a nice feature .
It ’s great to know how current the content is .
As a large news organization is something that users will appreciate .
It ’s also a competitive advantage over smaller news outlets .
It ’s an interesting technique , but the headline gets lost as white text on black .
I ’m also conflicted - should I start reading on the left or center image .
Based on our experience , placement of the ad here probably reduces the click - through , especially considering that people are trying to figure out if they need to read the center feature block or left feature block .
This blocky navigation competes with the content .
It seems a bit out of place .
This video call to action is nifty , but it creates noise by centering it over the image .
Does the general population understand what beta means ?
If it ’s not ready for everyone , invite people to a private release of the feature .
Clicking on this sign - up link pops up a sign - up form , but it ’s unclear why I would want to sign - up .
The benefits are not highlighted .
Do n’t Miss ?
If CNN wants clicks it should be a directive , like ‘ click on these feature stories ’ .
This will increase the percentage of click - through .
This is surprisingly small text for a feature story .
Most older people will have difficulty reading this summary text .
Creating gutters like this only adds more noise .
Convergence of lines like this direct the eye in the wrong direction .
Scrolls like this are less neat .
Users do n’t like these features .
This must have been an organizational fight to put this at the bottom of the page .
Oh , just what I needed at the bottom of my national news page , weather ?
Wholly content blocks batman !
This seems like an odd choice to put this content in the middle of the page .
Why put this in the middle of the page ?
Should n’t this just be balanced near the top of the page with stories that people want to read ?
So the ‘ confused seal on the side of the road ’ is not a hot topic ?
Conclusion
A grounded , business - focused approach to redesigning a web page will go a long way helping companies understand the value of design .
Deconstructing a web page is a great tool to open up the conversation and start a productive dialog .
Balancing the needs of users with the business goals is critical to the success of a company .
So , what should you include ?
Historical examples bring context to the existing web page and provide insights that influence a redesign .
Referencing other pages also makes it easier to understand a broader perspective .
And let ’s not forget , revenue opportunities !
( NaturalNews ) Lymphoma patients with vitamin D deficiency are twice as likely to die from their cancer than patients with sufficient blood levels of the vitamin , according to a study conducted by researchers from the Mayo Clinic and presented at a meeting of the American Society of Hematology .
Researchers took blood samples from 374 patients between 2002 and 2008 who had been recently diagnosed with a cancer of the white blood cells known as diffuse large B - cell lymphoma .
The average participant age was 62 .
Approximately 40 percent of all lymphomas are of the diffuse large - B cell type .
The disease mainly affects people over the age of 50 .
The researchers found that roughly 50 percent of all participants suffered from vitamin D deficiency at the beginning of the study , defined as having blood levels below 25 nanograms per liter .
Over an average of three years of follow - up , patients with vitamin D deficiency were 50 percent more likely to have their cancer worsen and twice as likely to die as patients with vitamin levels above 25 nanograms per liter .
Researchers have known for a long time that vitamin D helps regulate calcium absorption and thus plays a crucial role in bone and dental health .
Recent research suggests that the vitamin may also help regulate the immune system , and that higher levels can help prevent against chronic diseases such as Alzheimer 's , cancer , diabetes and dementia .
Some researchers are making the case that for these benefits , vitamin D levels must be maintained at a level closer to 40 nanograms per liter .
The Mayo Clinic researchers used the 25 nanogram per liter cutoff because that is the level at which the body begins to leach calcium from its own bones , and is therefore a well - defined deficiency threshold .
Prior research has suggested that vitamin D deficiency may worsen the prognosis for patients with breast , colon and throat cancers .

The pair were arrested after holding an engagement ceremony last December
A judge in Malawi has imposed a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison with hard labour on a gay couple convicted of gross indecency and unnatural acts .
The judge said he wanted to protect the public from " people like you " .
Steven Monjeza , 26 , and Tiwonge Chimbalanga , 20 , have been in jail since they were arrested in December after holding an engagement ceremony .
The case has sparked international condemnation and a debate about homosexuality in the country .
The British government , Malawi 's largest donor , expressed its " dismay " at the sentences , but has not withdrawn aid .
' Horrendous example '
The US state department , meanwhile , said the case was " a step backwards in the protection of human rights in Malawi " .
Analysis Judge Nyakwawa Usiwa - Usiwa described the actions by Malawi's first openly gay couple as an affront on Malawi 's moral code .
The courtroom was packed and hundreds more people stood outside , peering through windows .
The case has ignited debate over homosexuality in Malawi , a conservative country where religious leaders equate same - sex liaisons with Satanism .
But the impoverished southern African nation has come under pressure from Western donor nations and agencies .
They have cautioned Malawi to tread carefully over rights of minority groups , such as homosexuals , or risk being black - listed on governance issues , which may have aid implications .
Some 40 % of the development budget in Malawi is from donors .
But despite the outcry , the authorities wo n't budge .
President Bingu wa Mutharika dismisses homosexuality as alien .
Handing down sentence in the commercial capital , Blantyre , Judge Nyakwawa Usiwa - Usiwa told the pair : " I will give you a scaring sentence so that the public be protected from people like you , so that we are not tempted to emulate this horrendous example . "
The judge said the pair - whom he convicted on Tuesday - had shown no remorse .
" We are sitting here to represent the Malawi society , which I do not believe is ready at this point in time to see its sons getting married to other sons or conducting engagement ceremonies , " said the judge .
The BBC's Raphael Tenthani in Blantyre says Monjeza , who is unemployed , broke down in tears while Chimbalanga remained calm .
" I am not worried , " Chimbalanga , a hotel janitor , told reporters as he was led away .
Defence lawyer Mauya Msuku told the BBC that they would appeal .
The courtroom was packed , and hundreds of people gathered outside the building .
Some shouted abuse as the couple were taken back to jail .
There were shouts of " You got what you deserve ! " and " Fourteen years is not enough , they should get 50 ! "
Mr Msuku had argued for a lighter sentence , pointing out that the pair 's actions had not victimised anyone .
" Here are two consenting adults doing their thing in private .
Nobody will be threatened or offended if they are released into society , " he said on Tuesday .
' Prisoners of conscience '
Gift Trapence , from the Centre for Development of People ( Cedep ) , a human rights group , described it as a sad day for Malawi .
" These laws are a foreign imposition .
They are not African Peter Tatchell , Human rights campaigner
" How can they get 14 years simply for loving one another ? " he asked .
" Even if they are jailed for 20 years you can't change their sexuality .
Michelle Kagari , deputy Africa director of Amnesty International , called the sentence " an outrage " , reports the AP news agency .
She described the pair as " prisoners of conscience " and said Amnesty would continue to campaign for them to be freed .
UK gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell pointed out that the laws under which the pair were convicted were introduced during British colonial rule .
" These laws are a foreign imposition .
They are not African , " he said .
He described the sentence as " brutal " and more severe than for rapists , armed robbers and killers .
The men had denied the charges and their lawyers said their constitutional rights had been violated .
Cedep and the Centre for Human Rights and Rehabilitation ( CHRR ) have been urging Malawi 's authorities to relax the country 's stance on homosexuals .
Our reporter says the government has come under pressure from Western donors over the issue .
A few amateur pictures from around our farm
I took a bunch of pictures I thought turned out great !
I made an account here to share them .
This is either an Onion or a Garlic flowering .
Were hoping to get some seeds out of it for next season before harvesting it .
After not mowing our 10 acre pasture for two years , guess what pops up everywhere ?
Blackberries !
( Notice the little bug waving in the picture ? )
We also discovered some wild passion flowers !
Every time I have the camera , the flowers are wilted though so I cant seem to get a nice looking one on film .
It 's an odd game that has the score close to the third period and yet has an emotionally anticlimactic final frame .
But that 's exactly the way it felt - at least through my computer - in Philadelphia .
The second period began with the score tied at one and immediately , the home team was charging forward .
Not yet four minutes in , the Flyers took the lead .
Ninety seconds later , the bulge was two and the party was on .
The building reverberated with shouts of joy , with cheers for their heroes and with the mocking - but mostly it 's just fun to do - Ole !
Ole !
taken from Montreal who took it themselves from the beautiful game .
And what could be more beautiful than two quick goals and an entire period in which the Canadiens never once looked dangerous ?
The third period was devoid of that extended joy .
The building was excited , but nervously so , especially after the Canadiens scored and especially when Chris Pronger headed to the penalty box for four minutes .
Even once that penalty was killed , no harm done , there was not so much joy as a very small helping of relief .
Twenty thousand fists remained clenched until Jeff Carter finally put the puck into the empty net with twenty seconds to go and everyone could release .
But there were only twenty seconds to celebrate before the final whistle blew and by the time everyone had finished breathing out , it was over .
Scoring chances and more after the jump .
Scoring Chances
For those who'd like a definition : a scoring chance is defined as a clear play directed toward the opposing net from a dangerous scoring area - loosely defined as the top of the circle in and inside the faceoff dots , though sometimes slightly more generous than that depending on the amount of immediately - preceding puck movement or screens in front of the net .
Blocked shots are generally not included but missed shots are .
A player is awarded a scoring chance anytime he is on the ice and someone from either team has a chance to score .
He is awarded a " chance for " if someone on his team has a chance to score and a " chance against " if the opposing team has a chance to score .
And , of course , a big thanks to Vic Ferrari for making the whole damn thing possible with his awesome script .
It seems that for the second game in a row , Olivier is too depressed to write about scoring chances .
Yesterday was also in the 20s all day in Montreal , so it 's quite possible Olivier gave up on this sad - sack crew and enjoyed the sunshine instead .
If he does end up putting up his rendition of the scoring chances for this game , I 'll update this section accordingly .
Update : Olivier Returns !
Olivier ( En Attendant Les Nordiques ) is back and this time the two of us have similar totals , though still several chances that were scored differently .
I had the Flyers winning on total chances 20 - 15 while Olivier had them winning 19 - 15 .
But , of the 35 chances I scored , we actually only had 30 chances with Philadelphia winning 17 - 13 in terms of our shared total .
The Cohen Kappa Test that Vic set up for us comes in with a correlation of 0.75 which is a slight recovery from Game Three .
In the end , each of the four games we both scored was between 0.70 and 0.79 .
My " unique " chances were as follows :
Mtl - 1st - 16:04 ( shot from the point is tipped just in front of the net )
Mtl - 1st - 3:43 ( rebound shot from a tough angle )
Phi - 2nd - 2:49 ( shot from scoring chance area , Olivier must have thought blocked )
Phi - 2nd - 0:37 ( shot off rush is tipped wide just in front of the net )
Phi - 3rd - 11:15 ( pass from corner tipped on goal by Flyer Fwd. in front )
And these were Olivier 's unique chances :
Phi - 1st - 9:37 ( jam play at side of net , I thought the Mtl Def. knocked it away )
Phi - 2nd - 4:09 ( shot from beside the net )
Mtl - 3rd - 19:38 ( shot from slot , I thought blocked )
Mtl - 3rd - 2:30 ( pass in front for shot , I did n't think the Mtl. Fwd.
got his shot off )
I 've already said it above but it bears repeating .
Montreal was really let down by their play in the second period and by the ineffectiveness of their power play .
The power play had been a problem for the Canadiens all series but this game took the depravity to a new low : three chances against , a short - handed goal and two minor penalties in just under ten minutes of power play time is truly pathetic .
But even with the horrendous power play , the Canadiens would have still probably had enough to win the game if they had n't fallen apart in the second frame .
Hockey is a mysterious game sometimes .
How do you explain one team being superior for the first and third but drowning in the second ?
I really do n't know .
Many of the Canadiens actually played quite well at even strength but I just can't bring myself to praise them too highly since all of those that did were also part of the putrid power play .
P.K. Subban , for instance , had a mammoth +15 Corsi at even strength ( the next best on either team was Mike Cammalleri 's + 9 ) but ended the night with only one chance on the power play in over six minutes of ice time .
Players like Scott Gomez and Brian Gionta who had struggled mightily in Game Four were much better at even strength in Game Five but were complete non-factors on the PP .
In fact , both were on the ice for Philadelphia 's short - handed goal and ended the night - 1 in PP goal differential .
As a team , the Canadiens ended the series having played 36:05 on the power play and a goal differential of " even " ( +1 - 1 ) .
Their only power play goal came on a 5v3 at the very end of Game 3 against the vaunted PK unit of Ryan Parent , Lukas Krajicek and Andreas Nodl and made the score 5 - 1 .
In other words , the Canadiens did n't score a meaningful power play goal in the series .
God 's Elect
3. Jeff Carter -
Two goals on the night , the first of which was on a great shot from the slot to beat Jaroslav Halak .
Carter is coming off an injury and is already playing in the deep end with linemates Simon Gagne and Mike Richards .
Carter 's top four forward opponents in this game were Brian Gionta , Scott Gomez , Mike Cammalleri and Tomas Plekanec .
I , for one , have been very impressed by the quality of play Carter has managed on what is surely a still - injured foot .
2. Claude Giroux - I really like this player .
In almost five minutes on the PK he ended up + 2 in terms of chances and +1 in terms of goal differential .
To set up the tying goal Giroux came all the way into the corner to pick up a loose puck and send it softly down the ice .
He probably did n't think that Richards would get there first , but the play was nonetheless emblematic of the Flyers ' PK overall : aggressive .
Whenever there was a loose puck , the Flyers went after it aggressively and worried less about maintaining a proper box .
1. Mike Richards -
He plays the game hard was physically dominant on a number of different occasions .
On the first goal Richards was everywhere .
He went out to the point and steamrolled over Marc - Andre Bergeron before skating up the ice on a three - on - two .
After the Flyers missed , he raced back and got a stick on two consecutive Montreal puck - carriers before moving high in the defensive zone , noticing that Giroux had moved low .
When Giroux put the puck out of the zone , Richards won the race to the puck by diving to push it forward .
He then got up and had enough time to put it into the net .
Wow .
A fantastic game from a fantastic player .
Objects of Wrath
3. Hal Gill -
This was not Hal Gill 's best game .
At about 1:50 of the first period Gill tried to keep the puck in at the blue - line , missed , and then was n't able to contain Arron Asham who ended up with breakaway .
That time , Halak bailed him out .
In the second period , Gill was n't so lucky .
This time , he simply forgot about Asham as the Canadiens tried to break out of the zone .
Matt Carle kept the puck in at the line and fed Asham all alone in front of the net .
This time , Asham put the puck away to give the Flyers the lead .
2. Glen Metropolit -
It 's obviously not his fault that he played over four minutes on the power play but , my oh my , what a bad choice that is .
I know he 's been doing it all season but that , frankly , does n't make the decision any better .
His shot rate on the PP was the worst of the regular Canadiens ' forwards and a quick look at his offensive resume ( his career high in points is 33 ) should let you know this is a bad idea .
Unsurprisingly , he was a non-factor on the PP ... well , except for losing the battle in the offensive zone corner that led to the puck being cleared for Mike Richards and for that offensive zone tripping penalty he took in the third period with Pronger in the box .
But other than that , non-factor .
1. Marc -Andre Bergeron -
That first goal is almost entirely on him .
He is either one of the slowest players in the league or that was one hell of a lazy shift .
After getting run over by Richards initially , he was too slow to get back and pick up the third high man , allowing Philadelphia to get a good scoring chance .
On the actual scoring play he basically stopped skating for a couple of seconds to watch the collision between Richards , Roman Hamrlik and Jaroslav Halak .
Once he saw Richards had the puck , it was too late .
Had he just skated back hard , he would have no doubt been able to get to the loose puck before Richards and prevent the goal .
Setting that play aside , Bergeron also killed Montreal 's second power play by taking a penalty of his own about half - way through .
A truly " special " game from the power play specialist .
VRT - journalist Siegfried Bracke ( 57 ) stapt over naar de politiek .
Hij gaat bij de komende federale verkiezingen voor N - VA de kamerlijst in Oost - Vlaanderen trekken .
' Dit is de moeilijkste beslissing uit mijn leven , maar ik doe dit met veel overtuiging ' , aldus Bracke op een persconferentie .
Voorzitter Bart De Wever trekt de senaatslijst .
Het gonsde al sinds gisterenavond van de geruchten dat Bracke , al jaren het boegbeeld van de politieke berichtgeving van de VRT , zou overstappen naar N - VA .
Onze redactie kreeg het bericht vanmorgen bevestigd en intussen maakten Bart De Wever en Siegfried Bracke het nieuws officieel bekend op een gezamenlijke persconferentie .
N -VA - voorzitter De Wever nam als eerste het woord en liet weten dat de partij pas zaterdag de lijsttrekkers bekend zal maken .
Hijzelf gaat als boegbeeld van de campagne de senaatslijst aanvoeren .
' Ik wil mijn verantwoordelijkheid opnemen en volop mee de strijd aangaan ' , klonk het .
' Ik doe een oproep aan alle Vlamingen in dit land : kies voor verandering .
Want zo kan het echt niet verder . '
Bracke wordt lijsttrekker in Oost - Vlaanderen .
Momenteel woont hij nog in Mol , maar hij gaat opnieuw in zijn geboortestad Gent wonen .
Het is de allerlaatste keer dat ik u hier aanspreek met ‘ goede collega's ’ , zei Bracke .
‘ De overstap naar de politiek is de moeilijkste beslissing uit mijn leven , maar ik ben nooit méér van iets overtuigd geweest .
Ik kón niet anders dan in de politiek te stappen .
Ik doe dit uit verontwaardiging , maar ook uit ergernis ' , aldus Bracke .
' Zélf naar N - VA gestapt '
Hij verklaarde dat hij de analyse en het gevoel van zanger Stijn Meuris deelt .
Meuris verklaarde eerder in een opiniestuk in deze krant dat hij de politieke inertie beu is .
' Ik doe vandaag wat Stijn Meuris niet doet ' , zei Bracke .
' Ik heb dat gevoel al veel langer .
Volgens mij is de enige oplossing dan ook om zelf in de politiek te stappen . '
Volgens Bracke zijn deze verkiezingen ' verschrikkelijk belangrijk ' .
' We staan met België op een kruispunt ' .
In het verleden is de journalist door bijna alle partijen gevraagd om over te stappen naar de politiek .
Hij is daar nooit op ingegaan .
' Deze keer ben ik zélf naar de N - VA en De Wever gestapt ' , klinkt het .
' Ik heb nagedacht en ben tot bepaalde conclusies gekomen ' .
Bracke somde vier redenen op waarom hij kiest voor de Vlaams - nationalisten .
' Ik ben er diep van overtuigd dat een verregaande staatshervorming de welvaart van dit land kan redden .
Een sterke N - VA is de enige garantie daartoe .
Bovendien is het een partij die nog de moed heeft om op te komen voor maatschappelijke waarden en die sociaal voelend is .
En tot slot , de politiek heeft een geloofwaardigheidsprobleem .
Als ik het rijtje afga , is de N - VA de meest geloofwaardige partij . '
Hij wil stappen in de traditie van Hugo Schiltz .
‘ En dat is een statement ’ .
Hij zei nog dat hij een Vlaams nationalist is als dat betekent dat hij voorstander is van het confederalisme .
30 jaar bij VRT
De keuze van Siegfried Bracke voor N - VA is zeer opvallend aangezien hij als overtuigd vrijzinnige bekend stond om zijn goede banden met SP .
A en Open VLD .
Siegfried Bracke studeerde Germaanse Filologie en begon zijn carrière in 1981 bij de openbare omroep .
' Jarenlang was Siegfried Bracke bij het radionieuws , tv-journaal , De zevende dag , Villa Politica , Terzake en tot slot bij Bracke op Vrijdag één van onze beste journalisten en een opvallende sterkhouder op alle vlakken ' , reageert VRT - hoofdredacteur Kris Hoflack op het nieuws .
' Dat journalisten op een gegeven moment de stap naar de overkant wagen , gebeurt wel vaker .
Dirk Sterckx en Ivo Belet zijn hem voorgegaan .
Dat ze alledrie voor andere partijen gekozen hebben , zegt veel over de pluriformiteit van de nieuwsdienst .
En dat is goed ' , aldus Hoflack .
De VRT heeft de samenwerking met Bracke nu stopgezet .
Developing Desertec European Dream of Desert Energy Takes Shape
Can the Sahara Desert really meet Europe 's voracious appetite for energy ?
The Desertec solar power project aims to do just that , but a host of obstacles remain .
Overly optimistic expectations are now being scaled down as the project starts to take shape .
One of the most fascinating sights I 've witnessed thus far during the coverage of the 2010 election campaign is Gordon Brown 's visit to a branch of Tesco in Hastings on 16 April , which was broadcast live and uninterrupted for about five minutes on Sky News .
" Hello , good to see you , " says Gordon , shaking someone 's hand .
" It 's great to be here , " he continues , waving at a well - wisher .
He looks around .
" This is a good store , is n't it ? " he enquires of no one in particular .
He spots a young boy .
" How old are you ? " he asks .
The boy is eight .
" That 's a good age , " Gordon concludes .
" Which football team do you support ? "
As he continues walking through the supermarket , the pictures carry on moving , but the sound appears to be stuck on a loop , because Gordon 's repeating the same words .
" Hello , good to see you . "
" It 's great to be here . "
" This is a good store , is n't it ? "
" How old are you ? "
" That 's a good age . "
" Which football team do you support ? "
The same handful of phrases , over and over again , for five minutes .
When you watch the footage repeatedly , as I have , distinct patterns start to emerge .
Throughout the visit , Brown looks marginally less comfortable than a horse crossing a rope bridge , and his internal dialogue tree is starkly visible .
Whenever he meets a boy of eight years old or older , for instance , Gordon briefly asks which football team they support , then chuckles , whatever the answer , before moving on to say " Hello , good to see you " to someone else .
That 's the way he 's been programmed .
( He occasionally breaks up his repetitive mantra with brief statements of the obvious : at one point , he glances at a shelf full of produce and says , " There 's a lot of produce here . "
It almost makes you wish he was being shown around an orgy instead .
Almost . )
The footage is funny , yet somehow heartbreaking .
Brown looks clumsy , ungainly and chronically unsure how to behave around everyday shoppers .
He reminds me of me .
I can scarcely look people in the eye in supermarkets either .
But I 've learned to survive in demanding public situations – such as standing in front of an audience of expectant strangers – by adopting a babbling , deliberately awkward , vaguely nihilistic persona that is 50 % me and 50 % comic construct .
It 's a shield of radioactive bullshit that hopefully provides just enough entertainment value to stop the crowd physically attacking me , and just enough psychological distance to stop me crumpling to the floor and ripping my own face off at the sheer uncomfortable weirdness of it all .
Thing is , this performance would n't withstand five minutes of serious scrutiny .
I could open a supermarket , no problem , but sit me opposite a combative Jeremy Paxman and I 'd have a massive nervous breakdown within five minutes .
With Brown , it 's the other way around .
In the supermarket , he looked so anxious I half - expected him to climb inside a freezer compartment and refuse to come out until everyone else had left .
In his interview with Paxman , held in the wake of the preposterous Bigotgate storm and a widely criticised final debate , he was frighteningly confident .
At times , he even seemed to be enjoying himself .
Technical in the social situation , sociable in the technical situation ?
That 's the hallmark of a nerd .
And most nerds are simply too gawky – gawky , not aloof – to connect with the general public .
So he 's not endearing .
The press held up Brown 's Bigotgate outburst as evidence that he 's two - faced and contemptuous of everyday people , especially those who mention immigration , a subject so taboo in modern Britain that even fearless defenders of free speech such as the Mail and the Express only dare mention it in hushed capitals tucked away on the front page of every edition .
Two - faced contempt is the basic mode of operation for many newspapers : mindwarping shitsheets filled with selective reporting and audacious bias .
The popular press is a shrill , idiotic , bullying echo chamber ; a hopelessly poisoned Petri dish in which our politicians seem resigned to grow .
Little wonder they develop glaringly artificial public guises .
Picking a modern leader boils down to a question of which false persona you prefer .
At least Brown 's is almost admirably crap .
It 's easy to see through it and catch hints of something awkwardly , weakly human beneath .
Clegg 's persona is roughly 50 % daytime soap , 40 % human , and 10 % statesman .
Cameron is 100 % something .
He is n't even a man ; more a texture - mapped character model .
There 's a different kind of software at work here , some advanced alien technology projecting a passable simulation of affability ; a straight - to - DVD retread of the Blair ascendancy re-enacted by androids .
Like an ostensibly realistic human character in a state - of - the - art CGI cartoon , he 's almost convincing – assuming you can ignore the shrieking , cavernous lack of anything approaching a soul .
Which you can't .
I see the sheen , the electronic calm , those tiny , expressionless eyes . . .
I glimpse the outlines of the cloaking device and I instinctively recoil , like a baby tasting mould .
Do n't get me wrong .
I do n't see a power - crazed despot either .
I almost wish I did .
Instead , I see an avatar .
A simulated man with a simulated face .
A humanoid .
A replicant .
An Auton .
A construct .
A Carlton PR man who 's arrived to run the country , and currently stands before us , blinking patiently , blank yet alert , quietly awaiting commencement of phase two .
At which point , presumably , his real face may finally become visible .
• More Guardian election comment from Cif at the polls
This week : Charlie wanted to draw your attention to the release of Chris Morris 's film Four Lions on Friday , which should cheer you up whatever the outcome of the election , unless you hate laughter or fun .
oshiro Mifune , the popular actor famed for his characterizations of quick - witted , taciturn samurai , never uttered a word about it .
Akira Kurosawa , the well - known movie director , kept inscrutably mum .
Not one of the many hundreds of samurai movies made in the past century even as much as hinted at it nanshoku , the love of the samurai * .
From its pivotal position in the education , code of honor , and erotic life of the samurai class , the love of youths has sunk below the level of the untouchable to the level of the unmentionable , truly  the love that dare not speak its name .
But the indelible fact remains that one of the fundamental aspects of samurai life was the emotional and sexual bond cultivated between an older warrior and a younger apprentice , a love for which the Japanese have many names , as many perhaps as the Eskimo have for snow .
The samurai often called it bi-do ,  the beautiful way , and guarded the tradition jealously .
Ijiri Chusuke , in 1482 argued :  In our empire of Japan this way flourished from the time of the great master Kobo .
In the abbeys of Kyoto and Kamakura , and in the world of the nobles and the warriors , lovers would swear perfect and eternal love relying on no more than their mutual good will .
Whether their partners were noble or common , rich or poor , was absolutely of no importance
In all these case they were greatly moved by the spirit of this way .
This way must be truly respected , and it must never be permitted to disappear . 
( 1 ) Known also as wakashudo ,  the way of the youth , it was a practice engaged in by all members of the samurai class , from lowliest warrior to highest lord .
Indeed it has been said that it would never have been asked of a daimyo , lord , why he took boys as lovers , but why he didnt .
This last is not a question that would have troubled , for example , the three great shoguns who unified Japan , Oda Nobunaga , Toyotomi Hideyoshi , or Tokugawa Ieyasu , nor for that matter Miyamoto Musashi , the author of  The Book of Five Rings .  ( 2 ) In its key aspects , wakashudo ( often abbreviated to shudo and synonymous with nanshoku , the current term for male love , written with the glyphs for male  and  color ) was an eerily accurate analog of the institution of pederasty which flourished two thousand years earlier in classical Greece .
Like pederasty it was a relationship between an adult man and an adolescent male .
Like it , it ended or transformed into platonic friendship as the youth came of age .
Like pederasty , it was a pedagogic relationship fired by the energy of mutual erotic attraction .
And in like fashion , it was not exclusive of the love of women .
Samurai married , though usually later in life , just as the Greek warriors did .
The Japanese as well as the Greeks equated the love between a man and a beardless youth with all that was best in human nature , seeing it at times as the path to such ideals , and at other times as the goal itself .
Simonides , in a famous drinking song from the fifth century BCE declares :
 Hear the four best things a man can ask of life :
Health unmarred lifelong , beauty of form and act ,
Honest gain of wealth , and while one is still a boy ,
To come to brightest bloom among heroic lovers .  ( 3 ) Those words were to be echoed two thousand years later , on a more Confucian if less exuberant note , by an anonymous writer in 1653 , the author of Inu Tsurezure ,  A Dogs Idle Hours :
 It is natural for a samurai to make every effort to excel with pen and sword .
Beyond that , what is important to us is not ever to forget , even to our last moment , the spirit of shudo .
If we should forget it , it will not be possible for us to maintain the decencies , nor gentleness of speech , nor the refinements of polite behavior .  ( 4 ) In some important aspects the traditions diverged : in Japan the youngster was expected to make the first advance , while the Greeks held that it was proper only for the man to court the youth .
Hagakure ,  Hidden by Leaves , Yamamoto Tsunetomos famous samurai manual from the early eighteenth century admonishes :  A young man should test an older man for at least five years , and if he is assured of that persons intentions , then he too should request the relationship
If the younger man can devote himself and get into the situation for five or six years then it will not be unsuitable . 
( 5 ) It would appear that this process would have had to start at an early age indeed , since such relationships formally ended at the time of the coming - of - age ceremony , usually around the age of eighteen or nineteen .
At that time the youth would receive the tonsure ( a cutting of the forelocks to simulate a receding hairline , a symbolic grasp for status in a society in which people to this day compare birth dates in an effort to establish pecking order ) and become available in turn for taking the role of the adult in other shudo relationships .
As in ancient times however , the partners would usually remain close friends even after the end of the pedagogic / erotic phase , and some of these relationships did not dissolve with the passing of time , becoming instead life - long love affairs .
Paradoxically , wakashudo was both integral to the tradition of unqualified devotion that a retainer had to have towards his lord , and at odds with it .
Yamamoto Tsunetomo had this to say about the quandary :  To lay down ones life for another is the basic principle of nanshoku .
If it is not so it becomes a matter of shame .
However , then you have nothing left to lay down for your master .
It is therefore understood to be both something pleasant and unpleasant . 
( 6 ) Samurai shudo had its early beginnings in the Kamakura period in the 1200s , reached its apogee at the beginning of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603 and subsequently declined as the country was unified and the importance of the warrior class diminished .
The history of male love in Japan however both predates and outlasts the samurai period .
Though its prehistoric origins are invisible to us , written records exist starting with the Heian ( Peace and Tranquility ) period ( 794-1185 ) .
A time of enlightened rule , this era , marked by the founding of the great imperial capital at Kyoto , saw a flowering of culture and civic life .
Genji Monogatari
 Tale of Genji dates from this time and contains one of the first known allusions to male love , in which a spurned suitor consoles himself with the younger brother of his beloved :  Well , you at least must not abandon me .
Genji pulled the boy down besides him .
The boy was delighted , such were Genjis youthful charms .
Genji for his part , or so one is informed , found the boy more attractive than his chilly sister . 
( 7 ) Likewise , Ise Monogatari  Tale of Ise , written in 951 , contains a poem from a man separated from his friend :  I can not believe that you
Are far away
For I can
Never forget you
And thus your face
Is always before me .
( 8 ) Afterwards mentions of male love become more and more common .
In the 1100s we see the first mentions of Kukai as the father of nanshoku .
Kukai , or as he was known after his death , Kobo Daishi  the great master from Kobo , was the founder of the Japanese branch of Vajrayana Buddhism , founding the esoteric Shingon school in the year 816 at Mount Koya after his return from China where he received the teachings and transmission from the sixth Patriarch .
Great as his religious and linguistic achievements were ( he also translated the sacred texts from Chinese into Japanese , and devised the first Japanese alphabet ) , we have no basis to credit him with the introduction of male love as well .
Nonetheless legend has it that he learned about the joys of nanshoku in China ( universally renowned from ancient times for its rich homoerotic tradition , ranging from imperial favorites at the court to sanctioned boy - marriages for the commoners ) and then implanted the practice in Japan upon his return .
Indeed , Mount Koya became synonymous with shudo in the poetry and prose of medieval Japan . ( 9 )
Though the tales ascribing the provenance of shudo to Mt. Koya may be doubtful , the prevalence of that love in Buddhist monasteries is not .
In fact , male love in the form of affairs between monks and chigo , their acolytes , predates by many years its incorporation into samurai practice ( and was to give rise in later years to a rich homoerotic literature known as chigo monogatari , acolyte stories  ) .
The Tendai priest Genshin inveighs against those  who have accosted anothers acolyte and wickedly violated him in a text printed as early as 985 .
( 10 )
Of course we may fairly ask whether he railed at the violation per se , or at the fact that the acolyte was not ones own .
Despite his fulminations , the practice continues unabated , supported by the logic that the monkish vows of chastity apply to the love of the opposite sex only , as expounded by the writer and poet Kitamura Kigin seven hundred years later :  The Buddha preached that Mount Imose ( a metaphor for the love of women ) was a place to be avoided , and thus priests of the dharma first entered this way as an outlet for their feelings , since their hearts were , after all , made of neither stone nor wood . 
( 11 ) In another parallel with Greek culture , the practice of male love spawned a voluminous body of prose , drama , and poetry .
Unfortunately , but not surprisingly , little has been translated to date , however recent scholarship in gay studies is beginning to make up for past neglect .
Besides the work of Kitamura Kigin , who compiled an anthology of male love poetry titled  Rock Azaleas  we also have Ihara Saikakus  The Great Mirror of Male Love , a collection of forty short stories on the subject of love between men and youths , published in 1687 .
These two titles will have to stand alone as examples of classical Japanese homoerotic literature rendered in English , but hundreds of works remain to be translated , including a great number of kabuki and noh plays .
While the history of Japan through the end of the sixteenth century is one of warring feudal lords , with the ascendance of Tokugawa Ieyasu to the shogunate in 1603 the strife came to an end , and the country entered a period of tranquility that was to last two hundred and fifty years .
One of the effects of this pacification was the decline in the power and influence of the warrior class .
Conversely , the bourgeoisie thrived under the new stability , and began adopting many of the customs and practices that had been the exclusive domain of the samurai .
The fighting techniques of the bushi , warriors , were adapted as sports or spiritual disciplines ( judo , kyudo , kendo , etc. ) , and the practice of shudo gave way to a culture of traveling boy actors whose favors were vied for ( or bought ) by hordes of admiring dandies .
The public displays of the fans caused such commotion that laws had to be passed restricting the haircuts and costumes of the actors , so as not to over - inflame the passions of the audience .
Boy brothels also came to be a common feature of the pleasure districts of the larger towns , and the currency of nanshoku was gradually converted from honor and giri , duty , into gold and silver coins .
This shift presaged the eventual decline and disappearance of socially sanctioned male love in Japan :  the decline of shudo had already begun in the eighteenth century when Japan was still in the middle of its long period of voluntary seclusion .
The spirit of shudo as a way began to retreat , whereas a sensualist homosexuality flourished more and more .
The fact that after the end of the eighteenth century the kagema ( boy actors ) mostly dressed themselves as girls , while during the Genroku period they had dressed themselves gracefully as beautiful young men , also indicates a serious degeneration of the homosexual tradition . 
( 12 ) This latest turn of events again precisely mirrors the Greek experience , and evokes in haunting fashion the dynamics of the decline and fall of pederasty in the Greco - Roman world .
There too male love lost its identification with the warrior ethic and pedagogic ideals , and with it its moral foundations .
It too became commercialized as it succumbed to the decadence and abuses of the late Roman empire .
The reaction to those excesses solidified as the anti-erotic utilitarian view of sexuality of the early Christian dogma , the same teachings which , fifteen hundred years later , were to administer the coup de grace to nanshoku as well .
Thus Western influence had a decisive role to play in this reversal of fortune .
From their very first contacts with the remote island empire , European explorers and merchants bristled at the loose morals  and depravity  of their hosts .
The Portuguese writer Luis Frois , in his Historia do Japao , documents an encounter in 1550 between the party of Jesuit friar Francis Xavier and the daimyo of Yamaguchi , Ouchi Yoshitaka :
 The lord welcomed them warmly and said that he would like to hear the new doctrine of the kirishitan ( Christians ) .
Brother Juan Fernandez read in a loud voice from a notebook in which were translated into Japanese the account of the Creation and the Ten Commandments .
Having touched on the sin of idolatry and on the other faults committed by the Japanese , he arrived at the sin of Sodom , which he described as something so abominable that it is more unclean than the pig and more low than the dog and other animals without reason .
Yoshitaka then seemed to be angered and made a sign for them to go out .
But the king made not a word of reply , and Fernandez believed that he would order them to be killed . 
( 13 ) Though the slowly increasing presence of Christian missionaries lent support to those who disapproved of male love practices , it was not until the Meiji restoration of 1867 , a direct result of the opening of Japan carried out under the threat of American guns in 1854 , that Western Christian morality began to dominate Japanese thought , and wakashudo went into its final eclipse .
Tahuro Inagaki , in The Aesthetics of Adolescent Love , writes :  Without our noticing it this cultural tradition has been lost to us
When we were schoolboys we often heard of an affair in which two students had quarreled on account of a beautiful young boy and had ended by drawing knives ...
But since the new era of Taisho ( 1912 1926 ) we no longer hear of this kind of thing .
The shudo which had clung on to life has now reached its end . 

Author 's note : I am thrilled to report that the new century has already made a decided break with the past one : as we were winding up the updating of the Androphile site , a new movie was being released at the Cannes Film Festival ( May 2000 ) .
Titled Gohatto , ( taboo or  forbidden ) , directed by the renowned director Nagisa Oshima ( of In the Realm of the Senses fame ) , and with Ryuhei Matsuda in the lead role , the movie depicts the turmoil caused in a samurai detachment when a young and flirtatious warrior joins the troop , and several of the older samurai compete for his favors .
The topic of male love is ( reportedly ) treated openly and depicted in a historically accurate way , up to and including the tragic ending .

Fast - food chain KFC has admitted breaching hygiene rules at one of its busiest branches in Britain .
The chain admitted having inadequate pest control at the branch in London 's Leicester Square during a hearing at Westminster Magistrates ' Court .
City of Westminster Council said cockroaches , mice and flies were found during an inspection of the premises in Coventry Street in August 2008 .
KFC also admitted failing to provide hand - washing facilities .
The company also admitted failing to keep the restaurant clean and in good order .
After the hearing , KFC spokeswoman Nina Arnott said : " These charges date back to August 2008 and , as soon as we were made aware of the results of the inspection , we took immediate action to bring the restaurant back up to our strict hygiene standards . "
Ms Arnott said a new manager had been installed and the restaurant had performed well in recent inspections .
The restaurant has also undergone a complete renovation , she said .
Eight other allegations against the fast - food chain were dropped .
They included an allegation that food was not protected against contamination because dirty cloths were used to wipe preparation surfaces and chicken racks were covered in congealed fat .
The case was adjourned for sentencing until 10 May .
Voltage Pictures and the US Copyright Group are teaming up to sue " tens of thousands " of P2P users who downloaded the film The Hurt Locker illegally .
A lawyer from the group confirmed the studio's plans to the Hollywood Reporter Wednesday , noting that the scope of this lawsuit is much more far - reaching than the copyright group 's past pursuits .
The Hurt Locker , like many other Hollywood films , was leaked onto BitTorrent months before its official release in theaters .
It was n't a particularly high - grossing film — it only made $ 16 million — but it did end up winning six Oscars .
Undoubtedly , the film 's early leak online combined with the relatively low earnings is part of the reason Voltage and the US Copyright Group decided to sue .
The lawsuit has not yet been filed , but the firm expects it to happen later today .
The US Copyright Group has made a name for itself by helping movie studios ( mostly independent ones ) sue thousands of P2P users in an attempt to " stop movie copyright infringement and make illegal downloaders pay damages for the content they have stolen . "
Last month , the group made headlines by helping German director Uwe Boll sue more than 2,000 P2P users for downloading his film Far Cry .
The firm uses tech from GuardaLey , which collects the IP addresses of users that are believed to be downloading the film from BitTorrent .
From the IP address , it figures out which ISP is responsible and e-mails it , asking the ISP to retain all logs for the IP address identified at the time in question .
Once the content of the download is verified , the lawyers take over and subpoena the ISPs for subscriber information in order to find out exactly who has been naughty .
Once the users are unmasked — and according to the group , nearly all ISPs cooperate — the firm sends settlement offers .
As we observed when we covered the Far Cry suit last month , this one is straight out of the RIAA 's playbook , and the US Copyright Group is hoping that it works this time around too .
" You can guess that relative to the films we 've pursued already , the order of magnitude [ with The Hurt Locker ] is much higher , " attorney Thomas Dunlap told the Reporter .
With the firm promising thousands more lawsuits on behalf of copyright owners , it certainly looks like it 's banking on this strategy bringing in the bucks .
They elected a Green MP at the general election .
So are the residents of the south coast resort just a bunch of hopeless hippies - or do they know something the rest of us do n't ?
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Tuesday 25 May 2010
A colour piece on Brighton in the wake of the city 's election of Britain 's first Green party MP , Caroline Lucas , referred to remarks made " in defeat " by the outgoing Labour MP .
That was David Lepper – but he had not been defeated : he had announced long before the election that he planned to stand down
There are a number of potential reactions to the recent news that the constituency of Brighton Pavilion has elected Britain 's first ever Green MP , in the shape of party leader Caroline Lucas .
If you voted for her , you 're entitled to feel a little smug about making political history .
For others , news of her election will underline the view of Brighton as a kind of British equivalent of San Francisco : a bohemian city with a massive gay population and a penchant for alternative free - thinking .
While for Londoners , the news was presumably greeted with little more than a shrug .
Brighton is , after all , the perennially irksome , unofficial British capital of what the late rock critic Steven Wells once memorably described as " crusty - wusty , hippy - dippy , twat - hatted , ning - nang - nongers " .
Of course it elected someone like Lucas – who was recently photographed at home , standing , alas , before a shelf laden with self - help books called things like Awaken the Giant Within .
In fairness , her victory was more complicated and hard - fought than that suggests .
Brighton Pavilion is a diverse constituency .
It includes Hanover , otherwise known as " muesli mountain " – home to a lot of students and commuters who junked London for something a little more Soil Association Certified – and the North Laines , the town 's bohemian hub , where The Body Shop opened its first branch and where today you can find a shop called Bell Book and Candle , which has the local market in rune and casting stones pretty much sewn up .
But it also includes Brighton 's biggest council estate , Hollingbury .
The seat was solid Tory until 1997 and a four - way marginal this time .
The campaign was not conducted in the atmosphere of zen - like calm one might expect to find in Bell Book and Candle 's " float space " .
Opponents attempted to depict Lucas not as a whimsical tree - hugger but a ruthless career politician .
There was a bit of smearing – persons unknown added Lucas 's name to the anti-gay , anti- abortion Westminster Declaration – while the outgoing Labour MP could have been no less gracious in defeat had he stood behind Lucas flicking V - signs and making faces .
But when people ask me why I love Brighton , why I think it 's a cool place to live , it 's not Lucas that springs to mind .
Nor is it the Brightonian nonconformist attitude or love of a theatrical gesture , deep - rooted though that is .
You could argue that attitude stretches back to the arrival of the Prince Regent , who moved to an obscure south - coast fishing village and built a deranged Indo - Saracenic palace there , largely to get away from his parents – who among us has n't entertained thoughts roughly along those lines , usually late afternoon on Boxing Day ?
– and which , you could argue , links the Brighton Pride carnival , the famously melodramatic headlines in local paper , the Argus ( WAGNER RUINED OUR LIVES , WINDOW CLEANER KILLED BY GIANT PENCIL ) , and the crowd of around 40 people a friend recently saw assembled outside the Churchill shopping centre , their desire to visit Debenhams overridden by their desire to watch two seagulls having a fight .
It 's not the beach , nor is it Brighton 's panoply of celebrity residents – Fatboy Slim , Julie Burchill and the bloke who played the drug dealer in Withnail and I among them .
It 's not even the dinner - party game of What 's Nick Cave Been Doing ? , a kind of Brighton , goth - specific variant of Where 's Wally ?
in which contestants compete to see who has spotted the Hove - based vizier of grand guignol rock in the most incongruous circumstances ( victor ludorum : the person who saw this man who used to write his lyrics using a hypodermic syringe full of his own blood , en famille at a panto in the Theatre Royal , wearing a large foam hand and singing along to It's Chico Time ) .
No , when I think of why I love Brighton , it 's The World 's Least Convincing Transvestite that springs to mind .
I walk past The World 's Least Convincing Transvestite every day , on the way to my office .
A man who has made the bold fashion decision to sport a jaw - dropping combination of earrings , eyeshadow , stubble and shaving rash on a daily basis , he has all the bewitching femininity of a rugby league prop forward in a pencil skirt ; by comparison , Grayson Perry is the absolute spit of Audrey Hepburn .
Judging by his clothes – demure court shoes , tights , pussy - bow blouse – he's en route to a clerical job in an office .
For all I know , he might be facing yet another day of bruising homophobia and derision from his colleagues , but it does n't look like it .
He just looks like an ordinary bloke on his way to an ordinary job , albeit dressed as a woman .
I 've got a sneaking suspicion his workmates just let him get on with it .
And if they do , that would be very Brighton .
In preparation for this article , I decided to canvass some opinions on the city from fellow residents , via Twitter .
There were a wide variety of responses as to what made Brighton great – popular choices included the brilliant vegetarian restaurant Terre A Terre ; Coffee@33 , the spartan Trafalgar Street cafe where the barristas pore over every mocha like men conducting an experiment of potentially world - changing importance ; the fact that " the pubs are open until 1 am and it feels safe for a woman to walk home alone afterwards " – but the word that came up most regularly , was tolerance .
That sounds a bit pious , and if there 's one thing Brighton residents are n't , it 's pious : a priest from an evangelical church who fetched up here last year declared it " the most godless city in Britain " , which , according to a poll in the local paper , 93 % of residents thought was a compliment .
But I know what they mean .
There 's definitely a sense that Brighton is a city in which it would take an almost superhuman effort to be a misfit : it seems capable of assimilating anybody , up to and including Heather Mills .
No one group appears to have the upper hand .
There 's been a lot of talk about the middle - class gentrification of Brighton over the last decade , but it does n't seem to have impacted much on the city 's famous air of slightly seedy licentiousness , on Keith Waterhouse 's famous judgment that it's a town that always looks as if it 's helping police with their inquiries .
It now looks like a town that 's helping police with its inquiries while enjoying an organic , locally sourced panini .
The arrival of the London - fleeing young families with their bugaboos and their Abel and Cole delivery boxes does n't seem to have impacted on the city 's mammoth appetite for taking drugs , apparently the largest in the UK , in the same way that the drag queens in Kemp Town seem to rub along OK with the defiantly non-fabulous dreadlocked hoards : 15 years after the rest of Britain gave up on crusty , Brighton remains thronged with people who think playing the didgeridoo in public is a good idea .
Actually , if you 're looking for a symbol of Brightonian tolerance , the fact that , as yet , no one seems to have been driven to rip the didgeridoo from their lips and beat them to death with it may well rival even our old friend , the World 's Least Convincing Transvestite .
Why we love our city , by five more residents
Peter James , crime writer
For a crime writer , Brighton has absolutely everything .
The city always had a dirty weekends sort of reputation , and then in the 1840s it became a haven for criminals from London .
And nowadays , several police officers have told me , it 's one of the favourite places for top criminals to live in the UK .
You 've got two seaports on either side , you 've got Shoreham airport with no customs post , you 've got masses of unguarded coastline and a quick train to London ; in other words - a fast exit .
Then you 've got the largest number of antique shops in the UK for fencing stuff , and you 've got a massive recreational - drug market with two universities , a big gay population and arty middle - class residents .
One of Brighton 's distinctions – although the local tourist office does n't talk about it - is that it 's the drug - injecting death capital of the UK , and has been for nine years ( we lost the title to Liverpool for a year or so , but we 've got it back now ) .
I do think that having a criminal undertow , a dark edge , makes a city exciting .
I was standing on the pier a couple of days ago , looking along the seafront , and I thought to myself : " That is one of the most stunning views on the planet . "
You 're not looking at a dead town , a washed - up , has - been seaside resort , you 're looking at sadness , great beauty , a really vibrant place .
One of the buzziest cities in the world .
Chris Eubank , former boxer
I love Brighton because there is a natural phenomenon that attracts artistic souls to its pebble beach shores .
Artistic souls are referred to as eccentrics , and they call me Lord of the Manor of Brighton !
Andy Sturgeon , gardener and TV presenter
I escaped from London like so many people here , and I love the pace of life .
You 're not surrounded by people chasing the buck ; people who live down here have more realistic priorities .
I love the fact that it 's small too .
I can finish work , get the children and go to the beach , or out into the countryside and it's all about five minutes away .
There 's a holiday feel to Brighton , something to do with the seagulls and the sea .
Every time I come in from London to the station , even though I 've lived here for nine years , I still think , " I 'm on holiday ! "
Chris Maltman , opera singer
When we lived in London we used to drive off to see friends who , theoretically , lived in the same town , but you'd be driving for an hour and a half .
In an hour and a half from Brighton , where can you be ?
You 've got this fantastically eclectic and energetic cultural life , with weird one - off events that you just do n't get anywhere else .
You 've got shops that you do n't get anywhere else in the country , and then you 've got the Downs 15 minutes in the other direction .
Simon Fanshawe , broadcaster and writer
People here feel they can be who they are .
But tolerance does n't necessarily breed tolerance .
There is very little homophobia here but , when it does erupt , it can be more vicious than elsewhere .
Brighton is full of people who came here to work for the season and then stayed .
I 'm chair of the University of Sussex , and the students just do n't leave , they come , they graduate and then they stay for years and years .

Sen. Bernie Sanders , the chief sponsor , struck a deal on the Senate floor to limit the scope of the audit to only the Fed ’s emergency lending activities .
| John Shinkle / POLITICO
Wall St. plan clears two hurdles
Senate Democratic leaders cleared two major obstacles Thursday to winning passage of a Wall Street reform bill , beating back a Republican effort to curb the reach of a new consumer agency and striking a compromise on a watered - down bill to shine a light on Federal Reserve activities .
Democrats dispensed with the GOP 's measure on a new consumer protection agency comfortably , bolstered by a statement from President Barack Obama that the Republican plan was " worse than the status quo . "

But it took an aggressive last - minute lobbying effort by White House , Treasury and Federal Reserve officials to win a compromise on the Fed amendment .
The original language called for a " comprehensive " audit of the Fed 's activities , most of which historically have been kept from public view .
Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I - Vt. ) , the chief sponsor , struck a deal on the Senate floor to limit the scope of the one - time audit to only the Fed 's emergency lending to banks , allaying concerns that a review would have interfered with interest rate decisions .
" At a time when our entire financial system almost collapsed , we cannot let the Fed operate in secrecy any longer .
The American people have a right to know , " Sanders said .
" This amendment is not a radical idea . "
The Senate had been set to vote on the Fed amendment late Thursday but Republicans requested a delay until at least Tuesday .
Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin ( D - Ill. ) said Republicans wanted to make sure Sen. Bob Bennett ( R - Utah ) , who has been campaigning in his state ahead of a nominating convention Saturday , would n't miss the vote .
But a Republican leadership aide disputed Durbin , saying Sen. David Vitter ( R - La. ) wanted time to draw up an alternative to the new Sanders amendment , which some in the GOP viewed as " gutted . "
The original Fed amendment had gained broad support in the Senate - and a version is included in the House legislation .
But if it had survived the Senate intact , Obama might have been forced to veto the entire bill .
Sanders told POLITICO
Thursday night that the compromise included " very minor modifications , which in some ways strengthen the bill . "
He pointed to provision requiring an audit of Fed bank governance , including whether the bank directors effectively represent the public and whether the election of bank directors presents a conflict of interest .
But Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) , who teamed up with Sanders on the issue , slammed the compromise on his Facebook page .
Paul wanted the audit to include the Federal Open Market Committee , which sets interest rates .
" Bernie Sanders has sold out , " Paul wrote .
" We need to take action and stop this ! "
Bernanke sent a letter to Dodd Thursday saying he had " deep concern " that expanding audit powers to the General Accounting Office would " seriously threaten monetary policy independence , increase inflation fears and market interest rates , and damage economic stability and job creation . "
Paul Volcker , an economic adviser to President Barack Obama , also weighed in with a letter of opposition to senators .
And Neal Wolin , a deputy Treasury Secretary , told reporters earlier Thursday that the administration opposed the original Sanders amendment , saying it would threaten the bank 's independence from Congress .
But after Sanders agreed to modify the amendment , Wolin released a statement praising the compromise .
" We are confident that the revised amendment proposed by Senator Sanders strikes the appropriate balance : providing full transparency of lending programs while protecting the bedrock principle of central bank independence on monetary policy that has served our nation so well , " Wolin said .
At a time when government is as unpopular as Wall Street , senators felt pressure to respond to suspicions among voters about the central bank 's role in major policy decisions during the financial crisis .
Even senators who voiced concern about Sanders ' original amendment expressed support from the goal behind it - increasing transparency at the Federal Reserve .
The amendment drew support from one of the broadest coalitions seen on a measure in this Congress .
Groups as disparate as labor unions and progressive advocacy organizations teamed up with the National Taxpayers Union and FreedomWorks , the conservative group that helped organize Tea Parties .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) signed onto the measure earlier Thursday .
And immediately after Sanders agreed to limit the scope of the audit , Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) agreed to cosponsor it - signaling that the compromise had passed muster with administration officials .
In another significant development , Democrats defeated a Republican plan to substitute its own version of a new consumer protection agency into the bill .
It was voted down 38 - 61 , with Republicans Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Olympia Snowe of Maine siding with the Democrats .
Democrats have proposed an independent consumer bureau within the Federal Reserve to write and enforce regulations on consumer financial products .
It would be funded by taxpayers .
The Republican plan would have created an agency within the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to write and supervise consumer laws for banks , mortgage providers and other nonbank firms " only if they have a pattern and practice of violating consumer laws , " said Sen.
Richard Shelby ( R - Ala . ) , an author of the plan .
Under the Republican plan , the FDIC would have had to sign off on the consumer rules , and funding for the division would come from fees assessed on nonbanks .
And unlike the Democratic plan , Republicans would maintain federal pre-emption of state consumer protection laws , which would prevent the financial industry from having to beat back proposals in 50 different states .
Sen. Bob Corker ( R - Tenn . ) said Republicans would now focus on amendments that make " surgical " changes to the consumer protection provisions , starting perhaps with a measure to protect federal pre-emption of state laws .
Obama stopped short of pledging to veto a bill with weakened consumer protection provisions , but he tiptoed up to the line : " I will not allow amendments like this one written by Wall Street 's lobbyists to pass for reform . "
Wolin took the White House briefing room podium to add his criticism of the GOP alternative , saying , " The Republican amendment will not work . "
He also predicted the amendment would n't pass and called talk of a possible veto " premature . "
But the sparring over the GOP plan pitted the two parties against each other over one of the more hotly contested aspects of the bill .
" We 're just trying to make sure consumers have the tools and information to make sensible choices with their financial resources , " said Sen. Jack Reed ( D - R.I. ) .
" But unfortunately , it appears the other side of the aisle wants to make it appear they are strengthening consumer protection when they are really doing not much but just enforcing the status quo .
Republican senators cast their plan as a more consumer - friendly , taxpayer - focused approach .
They have spent the past week attacking the Democratic plan as a vast overreach of government powers , creating an agency free from congressional supervision and vague new consumer protections that would ensnare Main Street businesses .
" We 're doing this to provide a more rational and constructive alternative to what our Democratic colleagues are trying to slip by the American people , " Shelby said .
" It will create a massive new bureaucracy whose power and autonomy has no current equivalent to anywhere in the federal government .
It can do whatever it wants , whenever it wants without any supervision or real check on its authority . "
Republicans and some business groups argue that the Democratic plan would regulate any small business that extends credit to customers .
Democrats say their proposal applies only to firms in which extending credit makes up a significant portion of their business .
Democrats acknowledge that auto dealers and department stores could fall under that umbrella but dispute that other small businesses such as dentists and florists would be affected .
The Society of American Florists was among 11 business trade organizations that signed a letter to the Senate Wednesday supporting the Republican plan .
" It is pretty unclear how this will affect retailers , " said Drew Gruenburg , chief operating officer of the florists society , of the Democratic version .
" We are just concerned about the possibility that the bill applies to retailers .
This more a matter of clarity , trying to get some better definition of who will be affected . "
A lettuce recall is causing wholesalers , restaurants , delis , and grocery stores in 23 states to pull romaine products off their shelves .
While these companies are expected to pull most of the suspect lettuce before it reaches consumers , consumers should watch out for so - called " grab and go " salads containing romaine lettuce sold at in - store salad bars and delis at Kroger , Giant Eagle , Ingles Markets , and Marsh stores , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) warns .
The romaine lettuce comes from Freshway Foods and is sold under the Freshway and Imperial Sysco brands in Alabama , Connecticut , the District of Columbia , Florida , Georgia , Illinois , Indiana , Kansas , Kentucky , Maryland , Massachusetts , Michigan , Missouri , New Jersey , New York , North Carolina , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , South Carolina , Tennessee , Virginia , West Virginia , and Wisconsin .
They have a " use by " date of May 12 or earlier .
Consumers who have such salads from Freshway should throw them away , the company says .
Freshway salads with " use by " dates after May 12 are not affected by the recall , nor are any bulk or prepackaged romaine lettuce or bagged salad mixes using romaine , Freshway says .
The company , based in Sidney , Ohio , does n't make those products , which are typically sold in the produce section .
Consumers with questions can call the company at 888-361-7106 on weekdays ( 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EDT ) or visit its website for updates ( www.freshwayfoods.com).
You can read the company 's release here .
The company voluntarily recalled its lettuce after the FDA on May 5 found E. coli bacteria in an unopened bag of Freshway 's shredded romaine lettuce .
So far , the tainted lettuce has been linked to 19 cases of illness in Michigan , New York , and Ohio .
Twelve people were hospitalized , with three cases involving a potentially life - threatening complication .
" Multiple lines of evidence have implicated shredded romaine lettuce from one processing facility , " the FDA said in a release .
So far , however , Freshway says an extensive FDA investigation has not found any contamination at the company 's Sidney plant .
Here 's one for the history books - this is what a semi-inverted yield curve looks like .
The reason for the shaded area , and why the curve is n't inverted off the bat : the IMF has pledged your money , dear Americans , to make sure Greece can at least roll its immediately maturing debt .
Americans , via the IMF and Ben Bernanke 's Frankensteinian printing press are now guaranteeing the differential between 10 % and 5 % on Greek < 1 year debt .
And why ?
Is it going to prevent a Greek default in the end ?
Of course not , but at least US taxpayers can enjoy some of the the great moral gratification that being a part of the Komintern provides .
( CNN ) --
A tsunami warning was canceled Friday for Vanuatu , the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean when the threat from a 7.2 - magnitude earthquake had passed .
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued the warning early Friday when the quake struck near the island of Vanuatu , saying that an earthquake of that size " has the potential to generate a destructive tsunami that can strike coastlines in the region near the epicenter within minutes to hours . "
There were no reports of serious damage or injuries .
The earthquake was 20 kilometers ( 12.4 miles ) deep , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
Its epicenter was 215 kilometers ( 135 miles ) from Luganville , Vanuatu .
It struck at 4:14 a.m. Friday ( 1:14 p.m. Thursday ET ) , the USGS said .
The USGS initially classified the quake as a 7.6 - magnitude , but later downgraded it .
IT was a heavenly setting for a medical conference about such a grim subject .
The first international workshop on HIV persistence during drug therapy took place last December on the tropical island of St Martin in the West Indies .
At the end of the meeting , the two American members of the organising committee – Robert Gallo , the co-discoverer of HIV , and Roger Pomerantz of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania – sat down for lunch at a local cafe .
Pomerantz recalls that the air was filled with the little white butterflies for which the island is famous .
“ There were thousands , ” he says .
“ I doubt Bob even noticed . ”
Sipping his beer , Gallo had his mind on a more serious subject .
The men had spent the past three days hearing about HIV ’s ability to hide from even the strongest anti-retroviral medicines available .
Pomerantz asked Gallo the question that had been on everyone ’s lips .
Did he think it would be possible to eradicate the virus from these hiding places ?
In other words , would a cure for HIV ever be found ?
No , said Gallo , it was impossible .
“ It was a cordial conversation , ” says Pomerantz .
“ As cordial as you can be , when you really do n’t agree . ”
Because Pomerantz thinks the prospects for a cure are only getting better .
Is he put off by one of the world ’s most famous HIV researchers dismissing his idea ?
“ Not really , ” he says with a shrug .
“ I have to admit it , I like to tilt at windmills . ”
The current dogma , as espoused by Gallo , is that there is no likelihood of a cure for HIV infection .
Of course , we should be thankful …

The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a federal lawsuit against Itawamba County School District officials for their allegedly discriminatory actions .
The school board has maintained that it canceled the April 2 prom because the controversy was distracting McMillen 's fellow students from their education .
McMillen admitted that she 's been having a rough time at school in the wake of all the drama .
" My friends and stuff , there are a few people that are still supportive and everything , but the majority of people are angry because I guess they feel like I 'm the one that caused prom to get canceled , " she told DeGeneres .
The talk - show host has offered to organize a replacement prom for Itawamba Agricultural High School , as have dozens of other groups and individuals sympathetic to McMillen 's cause , but the graduating senior has remained firm .
" I just want to go and be able to be myself , go to the prom that I was supposed to have since I 've never known what prom was , " she said .
And DeGeneres is also one of many who 's hoping that the school board changes its mind .
" I just admire you so much , " she told McMillen , " because when I was your age I never would have had the strength to do what you 're doing .
And you 're clearly a very shy girl , so just being yourself and doing what 's right , you 're going to make a lot of change .
You really will . "

Two additional counts of recklessly disseminating the information and one count of transferring criminal property will lie on file .
The discs were sold worldwide on a website , which is now closed , between 2003 and 2008 from his home in Whitworth Road .
They included , among other things , extracts from the Mujahideen Poisons Book and instructions on how to build improvised explosive devices .
The court was told that Brown made tens of thousands of pounds from the business but had no terrorist sympathies .
He is now penniless and has county court judgements against him , the court heard .
Parmjit Cheema , prosecuting , told the court that the haul of terrorist information was the largest ever found in the UK .
The judge , Sir Geoffrey Grigson , granted Brown bail and adjourned the case for reports .
Julian Assange , the founder of the whistleblower website Wikileaks , has had his passport confiscated by immigration officials when he arrived at Melbourne Airport last week .
According to reports , the passport was returned to him after about 15 minutes , but Assange was told by authorities that his passport was going to be cancelled because it was looking worn .
But Assange told the Australian current affairs programme Dateline that he has since received a letter from the Australian Communication Minister Steven Conroy 's office stating that the the Australian Federal Police ( AFP ) has been asked to investigate the recent disclosure on Wikileaks of the Australian government 's blacklist of banned websites .
Last year Wikileaks published the confidential list of websites the Australian government is preparing to block under its proposed internet filter , which included links to YouTube clips , sites on euthanasia and pornography .
Immigration officials reportedly told Australian newspaper The Age that Assange 's passport is classified as ' normal ' on the immigration database , meaning the Wikileaks founder can travel freely on it .
Assange said half an hour after his passport was returned to him , an AFP officer searched one of his bags and questioned him about a previous criminal record relating to computer hacking offences from when he was a teenager .
However , The Age reports that an AFP spokeswoman said the federal police had dropped the case earlier this year because it was ' not in our jurisdiction ' .
Wikileaks , which publishes anonymously sourced confidential documents from governments and corporations , was launched in January 2007 .
Last month Wikileaks published classified US military footage of an American attack helicopter gunning down Iraqi civilians in 2007 .
Assange , who is Australian but does not have an official home base and travels every six weeks , told Dateline that Australia is one of several countries where he feels unsafe .

UNITEC - 1 was one of five small spacecraft that hitched rides on the H- IIA rocket used to launch Japan ’s Akatsuki mission to Venus ( Illustration : JAXA )

A spacecraft built by students has been launched towards another planet for the first time , but it has fallen ominously silent .
The toaster - oven - sized cube called UNITEC - 1 was launched towards Venus on 21 May .
It hitched a ride on the same rocket that launched a half - tonne Venus orbiter named Akatsuki , which was built by Japan ’s national space agency .

UNITEC - 1 was designed and built largely by students , though the project was led by University of Tokyo professor Shinichi Nakasuka .
Its main purpose was to test computer chips for longevity in the harsh radiation and temperature environment of space .
It carried six chips designed at different Japanese universities , which were to compete to see which one would last the longest .
It also carried a radiation detector and a small camera .
Radio dishes in Japan briefly detected signals from UNITEC - 1 after launch , but for reasons that are not yet clear , the spacecraft fell silent a few hours later and has not been heard from since .
The growing length of the silence has the mission team worried that the spacecraft has broken down .
“ But we are still working to receive the signal , ” says team member Naomi Kurahara .
Though the UNITEC - 1 mission may have failed , there will likely be similar attempts soon , says Robert Twiggs of Morehead State University in Kentucky , who pioneered the development of small satellites called CubeSats .
“ I believe it will be a trend in the near future , ” he says .
“ I would expect to see students planning some missions now and attempts being made within the next five years . ”
Exploration of space beyond Earth orbit has long been the preserve of government space agencies .
A previous attempt to break out of that mould was the Beagle 2 Mars lander , which was designed and built by a consortium of universities and corporations , though it went silent on the day it was supposed to land in 2003 and was never heard from again .

At a time when the American economy is already reeling like a drunken sailor , the United States is being hit by what seems like an endless parade of horrible disasters that threaten to push the fragile financial system over the edge .
The massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that is now destroying not only the the entire economy of the Gulf Coast but also the entire way of life for hundreds of thousands of people is getting all the headlines right now , but it is far from the only major crisis that has hit the United States recently .
The old saying , “ when it rains it pours ” , is certainly applicable to the United States right now .
Already faced with some of the biggest economic problems in a generation , America is also being forced to deal with horrifying natural disasters , rapidly growing environmental nightmares and agricultural problems that could end up being absolutely unprecedented .
So why do so many bad things keep happening to the United States ?
Does there come a point when the economic damage from all of these disasters just becomes too much ?
After all , how many body blows can the “ biggest economy in the world ” take and still remain standing ?
Consider just a few of the major disasters that the U.S. is having to deal with ….
* The Gulf Of Mexico Oil Spill
Industry experts are now saying that the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico could be increasing at a rate of 25,000 barrels a day – five times the U.S. government ’s current estimate .
In fact , Barack Obama is calling the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico a potentially unprecedented environmental disaster .
So how much is this disaster going to cost ?
Well , estimates vary at this point , but it is being reported that some analysts are already projecting that the costs related to the oil spill drifting toward Louisiana from a well operated by BP in the Gulf of Mexico could exceed 14 billion dollars .
The cost to the fishing industry in Louisiana alone could top 3 billion dollars , and it is being projected that the tourism industry in Florida could lose even more than that .
This is rapidly shaping up as one of the biggest environmental nightmares ( perhaps the biggest ) that the United States has ever had to face .
In fact , there are some who are saying that this incident has already eclipsed the 1989 Exxon Valdez incident as the worst U.S. oil disaster in history .
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal is warning that the oil spill in the Gulf threatens the very way of life of people in his state .
As bad as Hurricane Katrina was , there are those who are already claiming that this disaster will be worse than Hurricane Katrina for the region , because it will literally take years for this mess to be cleaned up .
In fact , there is a very real possibility that the fishing industry may be crippled for generations by this disaster .
* The Disappearance Of The Honeybees
For the fourth year in a row in the United States , more than a third of all bee colonies have failed to survive the winter .
To be more precise , according to the annual survey by the Apiary Inspectors of America and the U.S. government ’s Agricultural Research Service , the number of managed honeybee colonies in the United States fell by 33.8 % last winter .
Needless to say , this is not a good trend .
In fact , it could quickly turn into an unmitigated disaster as it is estimated that a third of all that we eat depends upon honeybee pollination .
Are you starting to get the picture ?
Most flowering plants require insects for pollination .
The most effective insect for pollination is the honeybee .
Without honeybees , we are going to be in a world of hurt .
According to WorldNetDaily , the following is a list of just some of the crops that depend on honeybees : almonds , apples , apricots , avocados , blueberries , boysenberries , cherries , citrus fruits , cranberries , grapes , kiwi , loganberries , macadamia nuts , nectarines , olives , peaches , pears , plums , raspberries , strawberries , asparagus , broccoli , carrots , cauliflower , celery , cucumbers , cantaloupe , honeydew , onions , pumpkins , squash , watermelon , alfalfa hay and seed , cotton lint , cotton seed , legume seed , peanuts , rapeseed , soybeans , sugar beets and sunflowers .
In fact , Ohio State University ’s honeybee specialist , James Tew , recently told the following to the Dayton Daily News … .
“ The average person should care .
Bees of all species are fundamental to the operation of our ecosystem . ”
So what happens if they all die off ?
You do n’t even want to think about that .
But certainly our scientists can find a solution , right ?
Well , the World Organization for Animal Health announced on Wednesday that the huge die off of bees worldwide is not due to any one single factor .
Some of the factors for the honeybee deaths the World Organization for Animal Health included in its report include parasites , viral and bacterial infections , pesticides , and poor nutrition .
Other researchers claim that genetically modified crops and cell phone transmissions are also playing a role in the disappearance of the honeybees .
But the truth is that a “ solution ” seems to be very far away right now and we are running out of time .
* The Deadly Tornadoes Which Have Ravaged The Southeast
Last Sunday saw an unprecedented outbreak of tornadoes across the southeast United States .
Officials said 61 tornadoes erupted as a massive storm marched across states such as Mississippi , Florida and South Carolina .
Winds inside some of the tornadoes were clocked as high as 160 mph , and one of the tornadoes had a base one and a half miles wide .
The tornadoes killed at least 12 people , and it is estimated that the damage that they caused could reach into the billions of dollars .
* The Drying Up Of The Ogallala Aquifer
Most Americans have never heard of the Ogallala Aquifer , but it is absolutely critical to food production in many areas of the United States .
The water from this massive underground lake is used to irrigate much of America ’s Great Plains .
But it is being drained at a rate of approximately 800 gallons per minute and it is starting to dry up .
So why is that a bad thing ?
Well , the Ogallala Aquifer is a gigantic underground lake that stretches from southern South Dakota all the way through northern Texas , covering approximately 174,000 square miles .
If it gets depleted , the era of “ pivot irrigation ” in the region will be over .
That would mean that the Great Plains could quickly turn into the Great American Desert .
America could very well see a return to the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s .
Are you prepared for that ?
Even if agricultural production continues to grow normally , scientists are telling us that the world is heading for a massive global food shortage .
So what happens if our food production does not increase or is even reduced ?
Sadly , the United States has only enough grain stored up to give about a half a loaf of bread to every man , woman and child in the United States .
How long do you think that is going to last in the event of a major emergency ?
The truth is that “ the good times ” we have all grown up with are not going to last forever .
The United States is in big trouble economically , and all of these natural disasters and environmental problems are not helping things one bit .
We are not entitled to endless wealth and prosperity just because we are Americans .
In fact , we have recklessly squandered the wealth that prior generations have left for us .
But even as the economy crumbles around them , millions of Americans will remain in denial until the day they have to cook a dinner of “ mouse soup ” for their starving family .

Test goes down to the wire
Cricinfo reports on the ninth day's play in the Timeless Test between South Africa and England at Durban in March 1939
“ Big Daddy G ” was going to take former MP Rahim Jaffer ’s company public , riding the green technology wave with high - level financing and , yes , maybe a few government grants thrown in , says Jaffer ’s business partner .
Nazim Gillani , whose street name came from his Vancouver days , failed to deliver on a series of promises and Jaffer partner Patrick Glemaud decided to pull the plug .
“ Nazim was making promises and they were not realistic , ” said Glemaud , an Ottawa lawyer who for the past year has been business partners with Jaffer in a venture they call Green Power Generation .
Glemaud said that with his name being linked to Gillani through media reports and Opposition critic comments , his “ name is being dragged through the mud . ”
“ The only thing I have is my reputation .
I have n’t done anything wrong . ”
Their Green Power Generation business is a “ shambles , ” Glemaud said .
Some of Gillani ’s promises were made last fall at his home - business address in Etobicoke .
Others were made at Club Paradise , a strip club where Glemaud was invited on one occasion as a guest of Gillani .
Told by the Star that Gillani sometimes photographed people in the VIP lounge using a cellphone camera , Glemaud said he did not see any photographs taken the evening he was there .
Glemaud is now trying to distance himself from Gillani , a wheeler - dealer facing one set of fraud charges and under investigation by several police forces , including the RCMP , Halton Region Police and York Region Police .
“ I do n’t understand why people are trying to destroy my life , ” Glemaud said yesterday .
He said the pressure from government critics and the media is getting to him .
“ I was an immigrant , I came to this country and worked hard . ”
The Star revealed last week that Gillani runs a business that has allegedly bilked several investors of hundreds of thousands of dollars .
In each case , Gillani promised to raise funds in the stock market , but only after the businesses had kicked in cash of its own .
Victims of these schemes speculate that it is their money that funds Gillani ’s fast car , strip club lifestyle .
Gillani was introduced to Jaffer last year by a mutual friend .
Glemaud wo n’t name the friend .
Before Glemaud entered the picture , Jaffer had already attended several Gillani - chaired business meetings at Toronto - area steakhouses , handing out his MP business card ( he was no longer an MP ) and suggesting to those attending that he could connect them with government funding .
Glemaud , who has known Jaffer since their university days , said he is sure that Jaffer was unaware of Gillani ’s checkered financial past at the time .
By this time — September 2009 — Jaffer and Glemaud were trying to grow their fledgling company .
Its website boasts it is “ Canada ’s Premier Green Energy Development Firm . ”
Glemaud said he firmly believed at the time that , just as the Internet spawned many new business ventures , there was a great deal of money to be made in the “ Green ” movement .
As a lawyer , he had worked for the federal natural resources department reviewing and approving government grant contracts .
That taught him both how to make a grant application and gave him a basis for his green energy company .
“ I wanted to be at the forefront . ”
Enter Gillani , who , Glemaud said , proposed that his International Strategic Investments company could take Jaffer and Glemaud ’s company public .
Glemaud liked the idea , and he and Jaffer continued their dialogue with Gillani and green companies that could become part of Green Power Generation .

“ I wanted to build businesses , we were going to own many pieces of projects and then go public . ”
Glemaud said he hoped to get private financing and , if it was possible , secure government grants as well .
Some things about Gillani concerned him , Glemaud said .
His office was unusual , he had an odd assortment of associates and he had a lifestyle that the father of four young children said was different than he was accustomed to .
“ He was into drinking , a flamboyant person , ” Glemaud said of Gillani .
The meetings were at Gillani ’s home and business in a house on Kipling Avenue in Etobicoke , with four or five fine cars in the driveway .
After one , Glemaud accompanied Gillani and others to the Paradise Club , a strip joint on Bloor Street near Dufferin Ave.
Glemaud said Jaffer was not at that meeting or Paradise Club visit .
( The Star has interviewed a former bouncer at the club , who described the scene when Gillani pulled up on any occasion .
“ The owners would clear the VIP lounge and we would be sent outside to hold the door for Naz and whoever he brought . ”
The bouncer , who spoke on condition of anonymity — he fears retribution from other people who work at Paradise — said Gillani threw around “ up to $ 10,000 cash ” a night .
He said Gillani photographed people he brought as guests “ when a girl ’s head was between his legs . ”
The Star previously reported that nervous investors caught in compromising positions at the club were afraid to speak to police about Gillani . )
By October , Glemaud said he was getting nervous about the business dealings with Gillani .
He said Jaffer had other meetings with Gillani ( “ it was more Rahim meeting him than me ” ) but he decided to cool the association .
He said that in November , when York Region police arrested Gillani on a $ 1.6 million fraud charge , Gillani told Jaffer .
“ I am trying to cut my ties on behalf of GPG .
I do n’t know about Rahim , ” said Glemaud .
Brian Kilgore , a spokesman hired by Gillani , said yesterday that Gillani did meet with Glemaud , but only provided an “ introduction ” to another company that had an interesting green technology .
Kilgore would not comment on Glemaud ’s claim that Gillani promised to take Green Power public .
Kilgore also would not comment on the allegation that Gillani photographed business associates in compromising positions .
Most of these are smaller versions of images that will take you to a larger one .
The image shown on the right , however , will take you to two animated images ; one is of a ruby - thraoted hummingbird feeding one of her young ( it 's a 1.6 mb file ) and the other is a smaller file of a rubythroated hummingbird feeding from our nectar feeder .
For some time , I figured that the best possible way to photograph hummingbirds was to do all the focusing , set - up , etc. with the tripod in advance , choose my settings purposefully and be extremely prepared .
This has been quite useful .
It helped me get these photographs :
But sometimes , you have to throw that away .
The photograph below taught me that .
I had the lens all set up on the tripod but suddenly I realized that there was another bird and I was focused in too tight to get them both .
So I quickly zoomed out and switched to autofocus and took a whole lot of shots .
Of those , this was the only one that was worth anything :
Later , I discovered that if I 'm lucky , I can get photos without even using the tripod at all .
That 's where dumb luck comes in .
I was able to get these two photographs on different days by just sitting on my porch with the camera and having a hummingbird show up :
Another way to photograph these birds is to go where you know they will be .
A friend of mine told me he had a hummingbird nest right outside his window .
I really could not believe how close this was .
The photo I got of the nest the first day was is this one :
Notice the thin strands on the nest .
Those are spiderweb strands .
Hummingbirds will use the sticky substance from spiderwebs to connect the lichen together to form the nest .
They also use the webs to reinforce the nest 's attachment to the tree .
This tiny nest was in a tree that was blowing all over the place , but still held incredibly steady .
One of the comments below gives this description from Barbara Kingsolver of the process of a hummingbird nest being built :
When the lump had grown big enough - when some genetic trigger in her small brain said , " Now , that will do " - she stopped gathering and sat down on her little tuffet , waggling her wings and tiny rounded underbelly to shape the blob into a cup that would easily have fit inside my cupped hand .
Then she hovered up to inspect it from this side and that , settled and waddled with greater fervor , hovered and appraised some more , and dashed off again .
She began now to return with fine filaments of shredded bark , which she wove into the webbing along with some dry leaflets and a slap - dab or two of lichen pressed onto the outside for curb appeal .
Thanks ,
Blissing for the addendum .
A couple weeks later , I got this shot :
A few days later , he let me know that the babies in the nest had hatched , so I went back again to get more photos of the babies :
Finally , I 'd like to close with this Rufous Hummingbird .
Rufous Hummingbirds are rarely seen in the Northeast .
But sometimes unusual hummingbirds pop up during migration time .
This one showed up in November of 2007 , at this woman 's feeders in Westmoreleand , NH ( those of you who did canvassing in NH during the primaries will know this town as being just north of Keene ) and hung out for a few weeks .
A friend of hers who was a birder asked if she 'd give permission to stop by and check it out .
She said sure .
We figured we'd check it out one morning and made our way through the back roads of Westmoreland and found her house far down a dirt road .
She had a guestbook on the porch and was requesting people sign it .
Not only did the bird show up at the feeder multiple times , the feeder was on her porch and we were about six feet away at the time .
That gave me the opportunity to not only photograph it , but to photograph it well enough that it ended up on the cover of the NH Audubon 's New Hampshire Bird Records , Fall 2007 :
Obligatory links :
Again , I hope you 've enjoyed these photos .
I 've only ever seen these two kinds of hummingbirds .
If I can handle the heat , some day I will go to Arizona to get a bunch of other types , but I just really hate the heat , so we 'll see .
As usual , feel free to treat this as an open photography and / or birding thread .
I should mention : I do n't post all my photographs on ' Kos , ' cause I take a lot of photographs .
If you want weekly ( or daily ) e-mail alerts when I 've put new photos on my web site , you can do so via this link .
Also , FYI , I 'll be hosting this Sunday 's Dawn Chorus .
Here 's a preview :
United Air Lines is set to move its operational headquarters , starting this year , from the Illinois suburb of Elk Grove to downtown Chicago .
Quicken Loans , also citybound , recently began leasing space in Detroit and plans to build its headquarters there .
And in February , Walgreens announced its acquisition of New York drugstore chain Duane Reade , signaling a deliberate decision to improve its capabilities in urban settings .
These companies are getting a jump on a major cultural and demographic shift away from suburban sprawl .
The change is imminent , and businesses that do n’t understand and plan for it may suffer in the long run .
To put it simply , the suburbs have lost their sheen : Both young workers and retiring Boomers are actively seeking to live in densely packed , mixed - use communities that do n’t require cars — that is , cities or revitalized outskirts in which residences , shops , schools , parks , and other amenities exist close together .
“ In the 1950s , suburbs were the future , ” says University of Michigan architecture and urban- planning professor Robert Fishman , commenting on the striking cultural shift .
“ The city was then seen as a dingy environment .
But today it ’s these urban neighborhoods that are exciting and diverse and exploding with growth . ”
Why Such a Major Shift ?
The change is about more than evolving tastes ; it ’s at least partly a reaction to real problems created by suburbs .
Their damage to quality of life is well chronicled .
For instance , studies in 2003 by the American Journal of Public Health and the American Journal of Health Promotion linked sprawl to rising obesity rates .
( By contrast , new research in Preventive Medicine demonstrates , people living in more urban communities reap health benefits because they tend to walk more . )
Car culture hurts mental health as well .
Research by behavioral economist Daniel Kahneman and his team shows that out of a number of daily activities , commuting has the most negative effect on people ’s moods .
And economists Bruno S. Frey and Alois Stutzer have found that commuters who live an hour away from work would need to earn 40 % more money than they currently do to be as satisfied with their lives as noncommuters .
A recent report sponsored by Bank of America , the Greenbelt Alliance , and the Low Income Housing Fund examines the inefficiencies of the current “ geographical mismatch between workers and jobs . ”
Focusing on California , it says that sprawl “ reduc[es ] the quality of life , ” “ increase [s ] the attractiveness of neighboring states , ” and yields “ higher direct business costs and taxes to offset the side - effects of sprawl ” — which include transportation , health care , and environmental costs .
The Unintended Consequences of Cul - de- sacs
Though suburban cul - de - sacs have long been attractive as quiet , safe places for families , their disadvantages are becoming clear .
One of the biggest problems is interference with motor - and foot - traffic flow .
Research by Lawrence Frank , Bombardier Chair in Sustainable Transportation at the University of British Columbia , looks at neighborhoods in King County , Washington : Residents in areas with the most interconnected streets travel 26 % fewer vehicle miles than those in areas with many cul - de - sacs .
Recent studies by Frank and others show that as a neighborhood ’s overall walkability increases , so does the amount of walking and biking — while , per capita , air pollution and body mass index decrease .
Last year , the Virginia legislature took action against the municipal costs of cul - de- sacs and passed a law limiting them in future developments ; the new policy was highlighted in the New York Times Magazine ’s “ Ninth Annual Year in Ideas . ”
Along with such moves to more - accessible street systems will come an economy that rewards businesses ’ proximity to customers and employees .

These images compare a one - kilometer walk in the Seattle suburb of Woodinville with one in Seattle ’s Ballard neighborhood .
The former is limited by a disconnected street network and few destinations within walking distance , while the latter offers easy access to parks and shops .

Solving problems like these is on the Congress for the New Urbanism ’s agenda as the group holds its conference this month in Atlanta , fittingly cosponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
As the CNU ’s charter explains , proponents of New Urbanism , an architecture and design movement , advocate for “ neighborhoods … diverse in use and population ” and “ communities … designed for the pedestrian and [ public ] transit as well as the car . ”
Max Reim of the urban - planning firm Live Work Learn Play describes the model by alluding to Starbucks ’s creation of a “ third place ” for consumers , away from home and work .
New Urban centers deliberately put all three places in close proximity , he says , with plenty of room for pedestrians and bikes .
Houses are on the same streets ( often in the same buildings ) as shops ; trains and parks are within walking distance from home .
How Companies Can Benefit
In the last U.S. census , almost two - thirds ( 64 % ) of college - educated 25 - to 34 - year - olds said they looked for a job after they chose the city where they wanted to live .
That suggests that businesses like Quicken Loans are on to something :
Move in and help build up urban neighborhoods , the argument goes , because that ’s what will draw the talent .
Almost 64 % of college - educated 25 - to 34 - year - olds said they looked for a job only after they ’d chosen the city where they wanted to live .
For example , CEOs for Cities president Carol Coletta says that by supporting education in cities , companies not only help improve the prospects of entrants to the workforce but also enhance the overall value of the city and hence its attractiveness as a place for people to live and work .
CEOs for Cities research suggests that increasing the proportion of residents with four - year - college degrees in the 51 largest metropolitan areas by only one percentage point would be associated with a $ 124 billion spike in aggregate annual per capita income .
n 1990 , college - educated 25 - to 34 - year - olds were 12 % more likely than others in the U.S. to live within three miles of a central business district .
By 2000 , they were 33 % more likely .
“ Increasingly CEOs understand that without a vibrant central city , their region becomes less competitive , ” says Coletta .
“ Good CEOs care about the fate of their cities , because they have to question whether that is the place where they can attract the talent they need . ”
A shift to an urban model affects corporate strategy — especially for retail businesses currently thriving in strip malls on busy commuting arteries .
Firms base many decisions on store locations and the types of customers served , and a move to the city changes both .
Cheri Morris , CEO of the New Urban design firm Hedgewood Commercial Properties , warns that the rigid criteria for national chains ’ store locations — such as deep buildings and interstate visibility — often render them unable to conform to the aesthetic or logistical requirements of New Urban developments , leaving them locked out of such areas entirely .
Even in more traditional urban areas , big - box stores are forced to configure their familiar floor plans into narrower , multilevel spaces .
A Cautionary Tale from the Last Big Shift
The story of 7 - Eleven , a classic case from the shift to sprawl , shows how major changes in community planning can affect business .
“ Southland Company [ 7 - Eleven ] did n’t read the spatial patterns and lost its market niche as a result , ” says New Urbanist planner Peter Katz .
He told HBR that U.S. cities used to have a dozen levels in their road hierarchy , ranging from residential streets to interstates .
The strategy at 7 - Eleven was to build on streets between residential and commercial areas .
But once sprawl took over , many of those options vanished .
So 7 - Eleven was forced into larger shopping sites , next to stores like Target , which learned its game of late hours and convenience items .
Meanwhile , the chain ’s model continued to thrive in Japan , where people still walked everywhere .
It did so well that 7 - Eleven was bought by its largest franchisee , Ito - Yokado .
— A.W .
Marketing changes , too .
In densely packed , walkable centers of living , “ many of the benefits of costly national branding go away , while the benefits of passion and a close connection to the customer emerge , ” says Peter Katz , the head planner for Sarasota County , Florida .
In such settings , he and other New Urbanists believe , it ’s easier for small , local , experience - and relationship - based businesses to thrive , and indeed many New Urban developers seek merchants like these to populate their newly minted commercial areas .
Bigger retail companies will have to work hard to adopt strategies that take New Urban principles into account and learn to provide an authentic “ local ” experience .
In many ways , New Urbanism and the trends it captures are part of broader recent changes businesses already accept : the shift to an experience economy , consumers ’ and employees ’ demands for greater corporate social responsibility , an emphasis on work / life balance , and the importance of interaction between companies and their customers .
The demographic aspect is simply the newest part of an ongoing conversation .
Companies that recognize the larger trend , however , and seize the opportunities that it presents will contribute to its social impact — and may gain a competitive advantage in the process .
German scientists have added up the emissions reductions pledged in the Copenhagen Accord and calculate that they put the planet on a pathway that misses the Accord ’s stated 2 º C target , and only delivers a 50/50 chance of coming in under 3 ºC by the end of the century .
In an opinion article in this week ’s Nature , Copenhagen Accord pledges are paltry , Joeri Roelgj et al show how the current emissions commitments amount to little better than “ business as usual ” , and effectively mean that global emissions will have increased by 20 % by 2020 .
The key points in the article are :
Nations will probably meet only the lower ends of their emissions pledges in the absence of a binding international agreement
Nations can bank an estimated 12 gigatonnes of CO 2 equivalents surplus allowances for use after 2012
equivalents surplus allowances for use after 2012 Land -use rules are likely to result in further allowance increases of 0.5 GtCO 2 - eq per year
- eq per year Global emissions in 2020 could thus be up to 20 % higher than today
Current pledges mean a greater than 50 % chance that warming will exceed 3 °C by 2100
If nations agree to halve emissions by 2050 , there is still a 50 % chance that warming will exceed 2 °C and will almost certainly exceed 1.5°C
A lack of ambition now means that countries will face steep emissions cuts in future .
Co-author Malte Meinshausen told the BBC :
In an ideal world , if you pull off every possible emission reduction from the year 2021 onwards , you can still get to get to 2C if you ’re lucky .
But it is like racing towards the cliff and hoping you stop just before it .
Commenting on the article , Andy Reisinger of VUW ’s Climate Change Research Institute told the SMC :
“ This analysis shows that it is imperative to substantially strengthen the emissions targets for 2020 as part of a strong international agreement if the world is to have a realistic chance of limiting warming to 2°C .
We are no longer gambling the future of the planet — if we stick with current emissions targets we are folding our cards entirely and leaving it to our ( and other people ’s ) kids to pay our accumulated debts . ”
VUW ’s Martin Manning points out that politicians need to be given the mandate to act decisively :
It is becoming increasingly obvious that dealing with climate change is something that needs to become driven by society more broadly .
People need to consider how much of a problem we want to pass on to our grandchildren and tell politics and industry to act accordingly .
The BBC coverage is excellent , dramatically illustrating the lack of ambition in European targets .

Video Shows Pakistani Taliban Leader Hakimullah Mehsud Alive Threatening Attacks Against US
PAKISTAN , Islamabad : Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud , who was believed killed in January , vowed attacks on the United States in a new video apparently made last month , the SITE monitoring group said on Monday .
Mehsud threatened to retaliate against the United States within a month for the killing of Islamist militant leaders , according to a transcript of the video .

( CNN ) --
The only surviving gunman in the 2008 attacks on Mumbai that killed more than 160 people was sentenced to death by hanging on Thursday .
Mohammed Ajmal Kasab , a Pakistani , was convicted on Monday of murder , conspiracy , and waging war on India .
He was sentenced to death on five separate counts , and life imprisonment on five others .
On receiving the sentence , Kasab lowered his head .
He was silent when the judge asked him if he wanted to say anything .
Kasab is the only man to have been sentenced in connection with the three - day siege in November 2008 .
During the raids , 10 men attacked buildings including the luxury Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi - Trident hotels , the city 's Victoria Terminus train station , and the Jewish cultural center , Chabad House .
Kasab was photographed holding an assault weapon during the attacks .
India blamed the attacks on the Lashkar - e - Tayyiba , a Pakistan - based terror group allied with al Qaeda .
Authorities said Kasab was trained by the organization , which was banned in Pakistan in 2002 after an attack on India 's parliament .
The group denied responsibility .
Indian forces killed nine suspects in the attack .
Their bodies were embalmed and kept in a hospital morgue as some local Muslim groups refused to bury them in their graveyards , saying the attackers were not true followers of Islam .
An Indian official in Maharashtra state , where Mumbai is located , has said a burial took place in January this year .
He did not give the date or the exact location of what he described as a secret funeral .
Two Indian nationals accused of conspiracy were acquitted in the trial .
The prosecutor said he would fight their acquittals .
SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Aliens exist and they live in our midst disguised as humans -- at least , that ’s what 20 percent of people polled in a global survey believe .
The Reuters Ipsos poll of 23,000 adults in 22 countries showed that more than 40 percent of people from India and China believe that aliens walk among us disguised as humans , while those least likely to believe in this are from Belgium , Sweden and the Netherlands ( 8 percent each ) .
However , the majority of people polled , or 80 percent , do n’t believe aliens in our midst .
“ It would appear that that there ’s a modest correlation between the most populated countries and those more likely to indicate there may be aliens disguised amongst them compared with those countries with the smaller populations , ” said John Wright , Senior Vice President of market research firm Ipsos .
“ Maybe the it ’s a simple case that in a less populated country you are more likely to know your next door neighbor better , ” he said .
More men than women -- 22 percent vs 17 percent -- believe that alien beings are on earth .
Most of those believers are under the age of 35 , and across all income classes , the survey showed .
Of those who do not believe , most are women .

The ENDA FRC 's unflipped wig
by Jeremy Hooper
The Family Research Council , a group that is considered completely mainstream in conservative circles , is now running the following graphic in opposition to basic workplace protections for LGBT people .
No , this is not a parody image :
The War To End All Wars [ FRC ]
But wait , there 's more !
FRC's also launched a new website that implies that LGBTs , if they gain that pesky inability to be denied employment / fired because of who they are , are going to shut down America 's small businesses :
Fight ENDA
Oh , and that 's not all !
For the same low price and scruples level , you can also see a new fear - ocumentary which uses figures like Jim " starving ourselves is what won Prop 8 " Garlow , Rep. Virginia " Matt Shepard 's murder was n't a hate crime " Foxx ( R - NC ) , and Austin " I 've never met an ENDA straw man I would n't use " Nimocks to throw out incidents like the wholly unrelated and wholly misrepresented Ocean Gove , NJ , situation to make ENDA sound as grim - reapery to your ears as their above images ham - fistedly make it seem to your eyes :
So let 's recap : LGBT folks ' desire for fair workplaces will bring about a scythe - wielding masked skeleton , those same protections will put Mom & Pop shops in the retail retirement home , and the whole thing causes grown adults to sit in front of a camera and throw everything but the kitchen sink at certain lives and loves ( and they 'd surely haul out the sink , too , if they thought a tossed faucet would keep the public from paying attention to their unsavory agenda )
If you think they are just showing " Christian love " to us gay folk , then you 're having a much better 4/20 than this writer is !

A genetic achilles heel that helps viruses invade the body and trigger cancer has been uncovered by scientists .
Some viruses learned to protect themselves by exploiting a natural " brake " on the immune system , research has shown .
The process is complex and involves microRNAs – small chunks of genetic material that help regulate gene activity .
One of their roles is to dampen immune responses so they do not run out of control , leading to harmful inflammation .
The UK study found that some viruses can boost microRNA activity to suppress the immune system 's reaction to them .
One herpes virus with this ability can trigger a cancer called Kaposi 's sarcoma in susceptible individuals .
Another is the herpes virus which causes cold sores .
Scientists are investigating the role of microRNAs which , like the RNA molecules involved in protein synthesis , are derived from DNA .
But instead of performing the usual RNA function of carrying protein - making instructions from the genetic code , they suppress the action of genes .
Scientists estimate a third of genes may be regulated by microRNAs .
The new study shows how viruses are able to " upregulate " the production of immune system microRNAs to facilitate infection .
The head of the study , Dr Dimitris Lagos , from the Cancer Research UK viral oncology group at University College London , said : " The viruses we tested have evolved with humans for millions of years and use a variety of biological tricks to establish life - long and mostly harmless infections .
" We discovered that it is likely that other viruses , which can cause diseases including cancer , exploit the tiny molecules present in everyone 's DNA , called microRNAs , to turn cells into a viral ' hotel ' which they can check into , to cause infection and spread . "
The research was reported in the journal Nature Cell Biology .
Dr Lesley Walker , director of cancer information at Cancer Research UK , said : " This is intriguing research which unravels an ancient molecular mystery – and provides a hot new therapeutic target to prevent cancer - causing infection from viruses .
" Infectious viruses and human DNA have been around for so long that a relationship has developed and viruses can cheekily use the bits of our DNA that we often think of as rubbish for their own benefit .
Now we know how they are using our DNA we can research ways to put the brakes on it . "
Despite record child support collections by state child support programs , considerable sums of child support go unpaid every year .
These past due payments of child support , referred to as child support arrears , accumulate each year and have reached unprecedented levels in recent years .
In September 2006 , the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement ( OCSE ) reported that the total amount of child support arrears that had accumulated nationwide since the program began in 1975 had reached $ 105.4 billion .
These large amounts of arrears are disturbing for many reasons .
First and foremost , most of these arrears are owed to custodial families who would benefit if they were collected .
Second , some of these arrears are owed to the government .
If these arrears were collected , it would improve the cost effectiveness of the child support program .
Finally , high arrears are often interpreted by the public as a sign of agency incompetence and a failure to serve custodial families , when , in fact , the picture is more complicated than that .
The purpose of this report is to provide information about the underlying characteristics of child support arrears in the nation and in nine large states to help OCSE and state child support programs ( also known as IV - D programs ) improve their ability to manage arrears .
The nine study states are : Arizona , Florida , Illinois , Michigan , New Jersey , New York , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Texas .
They were selected because of their relative size .
Collectively , they held 39 percent of the nation 's arrears in FY 2006 .
Each of the study states volunteered to participate in the study and provided detailed administrative data about their obligors and the arrears they owed .
These data were matched by OCSE to six quarters of national quarterly wage and unemployment insurance data .
Based on these data , each study state was provided with a detailed analysis of their arrears .
This report draws from those analyses .
The analysis is organized around three basic questions :
Who owes the arrears ?
How collectible are the arrears ?
Why have arrears grown so rapidly ?
Child support arrears have a very distinct distribution .
(1) Most of the arrears are owed by a relatively small number of non-custodial parents , each of whom owes a large amount of arrears .
In the nine study states , 11 percent of the non-custodial parents with an obligation to pay child support , or obligors , owed 54 percent of the total arrears held by these states .
(2) Each of these obligors owed over $ 30,000 in arrears .
The arrears distribution found in the nine study states is similar to that found in other states and for the nation as a whole .
In California , 11 percent of the non-custodial parents who owed arrears owed a total of 45 percent of the state 's arrears in March 2000 and each of those debtors owed over $ 40,000 in arrears .
(3) Using data from the federal tax refund offset program in April 2006 , researchers found that 43 percent of the nation 's certified arrears were owed by just 10 percent of the debtors , each of whom owed over $ 40,000 in certified arrears .

Chart 1 .
Percent of Obligors and Arrears in Nine States , by Amount of Arrears Owed : 2003/04
Source : Data are from Arizona , Florida , Illinois , Michigan , New Jersey , New York , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Texas .
On the other hand , most of the obligors in the nine study states owed relatively small amounts of arrears .
In fact , 15 percent of the obligors did not owe arrears at the time of the study .
Another 16 percent of obligors owed less than $ 500 in arrears .
Adding obligors across the first four categories of arrears in the chart above shows that 57 percent of the obligors in the nine study states owed $ 5,000 in arrears or less .
These findings are also corroborated by other research on national certified arrears .
( 5 )
Given that most obligors owe relatively modest amounts of arrears , one can easily understand why a casual observer might conclude that arrears should be easy to collect .
Unfortunately , as we discuss below , this is not correct .
While most obligors owe modest amounts of arrears , they owe a small percentage of the total arrears held by state child support programs .
In the nine study states , the 57 percent of obligors who owed up to $ 5,000 in arrears owed less than 6 percent of the total arrears held by these states .
In the nine study states , the obligors who owed over $ 30,000 in arrears , whom we refer to as high debtors , were quite different from other obligors .
A major difference was the amount of reported income that high debtors had compared to other obligors .
(6 ) Nearly three quarters of the high debtors had no reported income or reported incomes of $ 10,000 a year or less .
In contrast , one fifth of obligors with no arrears had reported incomes this low .
High debtors were also more likely than other obligors to have multiple current support orders , interstate orders , and orders that had been in effect for at least 10 years .
In addition , they were less likely than others to have paid support in the last year and to have a ZIP code on record .
Just as high debtors tended to have no or low reported income , arrears tended to be concentrated among obligors with these characteristics .
In the nine study states , 70 percent of the arrears were owed by obligors who had either no reported income or reported income of $ 10,000 a year or less .
It is probably not surprising to many readers that arrears tend to accumulate among individuals with no or low reported income because the most effective means of collecting support , wage withholding , is not effective among this population .
Although some of these individuals may have unreported income ( or assets ) , it tends to be very difficult to collect support from these individuals , which is evident when you compare payment rates among obligors by the amount of reported income that they have .
In eight study states , 93 percent of obligors with reported incomes over $ 10,000 a year paid child support in the past year , but only 57 percent of obligors with no or low reported income paid child support in the past year .
( 7 )
Some child support professionals have suggested that states should examine obligors by their ability and willingness to pay child support .
(8) We attempted to stratify obligors in this manner , but found it difficult to do so given the data that we had available .
In an effort to shed light on this idea , we divided obligors by the amount of reported income that they had and whether or not they paid child support .
However , having no or low reported income does not necessarily mean individuals have no or a limited ability to pay child support .
These individuals may have other sources of income beyond that which we had access to or they may have assets , which we had no information about .
Nonetheless , it is instructive to see how arrears are distributed by reported income and payment behavior .
We find that , when obligors were divided by their payment behavior and reported income amounts , the only group of obligors who owed significantly more arrears than it represented in the obligor population was those who had no reported income or reported income of $ 10,000 a year or less and did not pay child support in the past year .
In eight study states , 22 percent of the obligors fell in this category , but they owed 41 percent of the arrears in these states .
(9 ) These findings suggest that this group of obligors those with no or low reported incomes who do not pay child support are the most difficult to collect from .
Another large group of obligors ( 28 percent ) had no or low reported incomes and paid child support in the past year .
These obligors owed roughly a proportional share of the arrears ( i.e. 29 percent ) .
Thus , this group of obligors those with no or low reported incomes who paid child support were not contributing disproportionately to arrears in these states .
This suggests that these study states did not have as difficult a time collecting from these obligors as they did from those with no or low reported income who did not pay child support for a year .
Due to insufficient data , we cannot conclude that all obligors with no reported income or reported income of $ 10,000 a year or less and did not pay child support for a year are " unable to pay child support " .
Some of these obligors may be self - employed or working in industries that are not covered by quarterly wage data .
Others may be working in covered industries , but are working under the table .
Still , some may be engaged in illegal activities .
It may be that individual obligors within this group have large amounts of unreported income and sizable assets , but the group as a whole appear less able to pay child support than other groups of obligors .
This conclusion is based on the median order amounts that these obligors were expected to pay , which were considerably lower than the median order amounts of other obligors , including those who had no or low reported income and paid support .
Specifically , in seven study states , the median order for obligors with no or low reported income who did not pay child support for a year was $ 180 per month , which was $ 59 per month lower than the median order for obligors with no or low reported income who paid support .
( 10 ) In addition , we should note that other research has found that 10 percent of debtors who did not match to four quarters of quarterly wages were institutionalized , 9 percent were receiving Social Security Administration benefits , and 6 percent were receiving Supplemental Security Income benefits , suggesting that about a quarter of the obligors without reported quarterly wages are either disabled or incarcerated .
( 11 ) Another study of debtors with no reported wages for four quarters looked at their income in the following year .
Less than half of these obligors had any income in the following year .
( 12 ) And of those that did have income , the amounts were low ( median $ 7,500 ) .
Because this group of obligors those with no or low reported income who did not pay child support for a year is contributing disproportionately to arrears , it is important that child support enforcement agencies focus on these obligors and learn more about them .
Chart 2 also shows that a very small percent of obligors in eight study states had an ability to pay child support ( i.e. their reported incomes were over $ 10,000 a year ) , but they did not pay child support for a year .
Only 3 percent of the obligors fell in this category in the eight states and they owed 4 percent of the arrears in these states .
In contrast , nearly half of the obligors ( 47 percent ) had an ability to pay child support ( i.e. their reported income was over $ 10,000 a year ) and they paid child support in the last year .
They owed 27 percent of the arrears in these states , a much smaller proportion of the arrears than their relative share of the obligor population .
Chart 2 .
Percent of Obligors and Arrears in Eight States , by Annual Reported Income and Payment Status in the Last Year : 2003/04
Source : Child support data are from Arizona , Illinois , Florida , Michigan , New Jersey , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Texas .
Reported income is based on six quarters of national quarterly wage and unemployment insurance data from OCSE .
[ Go to Contents ]
We find that the study states varied by the characteristics of their obligors and this variation helped explain differences in the amount of arrears held by states .
The extent to which obligors matched to quarterly wage and unemployment insurance data varied by state , with New York having the lowest match rate at 68 percent and Pennsylvania having the highest match rate at 80 percent .
Of course , the more obligors who match to quarterly wage data the easier it is to collect support and keep arrears under control .
Thus , based on this measure , Pennsylvania had an easier time managing its arrears than New York .
States also varied by the extent to which their obligors had arrears - only cases .
In Illinois , Michigan and New York about a quarter of the obligors had arrears - only cases , but in other states , such as Ohio , considerably fewer obligors had arrears - only cases .
While obligors with arrears - only cases are no longer accumulating new arrears , they tended to owe large amounts of arrears .
Thus , states that have larger percentages of arrears - only cases tended to have higher arrears than states that did not .
Another characteristic that varied among the states was the proportion of obligors with a current support order who had more than one current support order , meaning that they had more than one family for whom they owed current support .
In Arizona , 8 percent of the current support obligors had two or more current support orders , the lowest percentage among the study states .
The highest percentage figures were in Illinois , New Jersey , and Ohio .
Each of these states had 15 percent of their current support obligors with two or more current support orders .
These obligors tended to owe about twice as much of the arrears owed by current support obligors than they represented in the population .
Thus , in Illinois , New Jersey , and Ohio , current support obligors with two or more current support orders owed over 30 percent of the arrears owed by current support obligors .
Differences in state policies also influenced the amount of arrears each state held .
Study states that assessed interest on a routine basis had considerably higher arrears per obligor than states that did not .
States that assessed retroactive support on a routine basis tended to have higher arrears per obligor than states that did not .
States that appeared to impute income when establishing orders in a large percentage of their cases tended to have higher arrears per obligor than states that did not .
Furthermore , state policies can influence the characteristics of obligors .
For example , in Pennsylvania , nearly all orders established in the state are in the IV - D program .
The Domestic Relations Court in Pennsylvania provides IV - D services under a cooperative agreement and it includes IV - D applications as part of the court intake process .
Individuals are not required to complete the IV - D application , but because it is part of the intake process , most people do .
This practice may explain why 70 percent of the obligors in Pennsylvania had their IV - D case opened within a year of their order established .
Other study states had considerably fewer obligors who had their orders established and their IV - D cases opened within a year of each other .
This is an important distinction because obligors who had their IV - D cases opened around the same time as their order was established tended to owe considerably less arrears than other obligors .
In Pennsylvania , for example , the median amount of arrears owed by obligors who opened their IV - D case around the same time as their order was $ 800 , while the median amount of arrears owed by obligors who had their order established at least a year after their IV - D case was opened owed twice that amount .

To answer this question , we developed a microsimulation model that estimates how much arrears are likely to be collected over a 10 - year period and how much arrears are likely to grow during this time frame .
Combining results across seven study states , we estimate that 40 percent of the arrears owed at the time the data were extracted will be collected over 10 years .
( 13 ) At the time the data were extracted , these states held $ 30 billion in arrears ; we estimate that $ 12 billion of that will be collected in 10 years .
In addition , we predict that arrears will grow in these seven states by 60 percent over 10 years , reaching $ 48 billion in 2014 .
The reason we estimate that less than half of the arrears will be collected over 10 years is because so much of the arrears are owed by obligors with no or low reported income .
It is very difficult to collect from obligors who have no or low reported income .
Further , the amounts that tend to be collected from these obligors are relatively small compared to the amounts of arrears that are owed .
Thus , this combination of traits no or low reported income and high arrears result in very low arrears payment rates .
Chart 3 shows that obligors with no reported income owed 40 percent of the arrears in these seven states , respectively , but they are estimated to pay only 16 percent of their arrears over a 10 - year period .
Similarly , obligors with reported incomes between $ 1 and $ 10,000 a year owed 30 percent of the arrears and they are estimated to pay 27 percent of their arrears over a 10 - year period .
Thus , relatively little of these arrears are likely to be collected .
Chart 3 .
Percent of Arrears Owed and Percent of Arrears Paid in 10 Years for Seven States , by Reported Income Categories : 2003/04
Source : Child support data from Arizona , Illinois , Michigan , New Jersey , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Texas .
These data were matched by OCSE to national quarterly wage and unemployment insurance data , which were used to generate reported income .
In contrast , once reported incomes exceeded $ 10,000 a year , obligors tended to owe relatively small amounts of arrears .
Further , these obligors are relatively easy to collect from since they have reported incomes that exceed $ 10,000 a year .
Because , in general , these obligors have relatively high reported incomes and lower arrears , they are predicted to pay considerably more of their arrears in 10 years .
In fact , we predict that obligors with reported incomes over $ 40,000 a year will pay 100 percent of their arrears in 10 years .
These obligors , however , owed only 5 percent of the arrears in these states .

The primary factor that has caused arrears to grow so dramatically has been the assessment of interest on a routine basis .
Many states began to assess interest on a routine basis in the 1990s , as their computer systems could manage to calculate and track interest .
In addition , in 1986 , Congress enacted legislation , referred to as the Bradley Amendment , which mandated that child support arrears be considered a judgment by operation of law .
Since most states require that interest be charged on judgments , many states began to charge interest on child support arrears after this legislation was enacted .
Today , 18 states charge interest on a routine basis , 18 states and Guam may charge interest but do so intermittently , and 14 states , Puerto Rico , the Virgin Islands , and the District of Columbia do not charge interest .
( 14 ) The chart below divides states , territories , and the District of Columbia into these three groups and tracks their arrears since fiscal year 1987 .
All states have experienced an increase in arrears between FY 1987 and FY 2006 , but the chart below shows that states that charge interest on a routine basis have experienced a much larger increase in arrears than other states .
Between FY 1987 and FY 2006 , states that charged interest routinely experienced more than a ten - fold increase in arrears , going from $ 5.4 billion in FY 1987 to $ 58.7 billion in FY 2006 .
In contrast , other states saw their arrears grow about half as fast .
States that charged interest intermittently experienced a 353 percent increase in arrears over this period ( arrears went from $ 6.0 billion in FY 1987 to $ 27.2 billion in FY 2006 ) , while states that do not charge interest experienced a 592 percent increase in arrears ( arrears went from $ 2.7 billion in FY 1987 to $ 19.5 billion in FY 2006 ) .
Chart 4 .
Child Support Arrears Held by State IV - D Programs from FY 1987 to FY 2006 , Grouped by States ' Interest Policies
Fiscal Years
Source : Arrears data are from OCSE , Annual Statistical Reports and Preliminary Reports .
Note : Data in FY 2006 are not strictly comparable to earlier years .
In FY 2006 , OCSE instructed states to not report arrears for responding interstate cases to eliminate the double counting of these arrears .
Prior to that time , these arrears had been reported to OCSE by both responding and initiating states .
Data are also not strictly comparable before and after FY 1999 .
In FY 1999 , OCSE changed the reporting instructions to states regarding the inclusion of interest and penalties when reporting arrears .
We examined three other factors thought to contribute to arrears growth the assessment of retroactive support , the lack of compliance with current support orders , and the low payment rate on arrears .
Retroactive support did not appear to be a major factor contributing to arrears in the study states .
This is not surprising since only three of the nine study states assessed retroactive support on a routine basis ( i.e. Arizona , New Jersey , and Texas ) .
Furthermore , these three states do not assess retroactive support back to the date of birth in paternity cases , which limits the amount of retroactive support that can be assessed .
In Texas , retroactive support represented about 10 percent of the arrears ( we do not have comparable information for Arizona and New Jersey ) .
On the other hand , we find that non-compliance with current support orders was a major factor contributing to arrears , especially among obligors with no or low reported income .
In the study states , 40 percent of the current support obligors had no or low reported income , but they generated 60 percent of the unpaid current support during the year .
The majority of current support obligors with no or low reported income paid something toward current support , but the median amount that they paid was very low , especially compared to their order .
Among current support obligors with reported incomes of $ 10,000 a year or less , their median order represented 83 percent of their reported income and their median payments represented 7 percent .
This gap between the amount due and amount paid among obligors with low reported income is a major factor contributing to arrears .
Another factor that we find that contributes to arrears is the low payment rate on arrears .
Nationally , during the past several years , about 6 percent of arrears have been collected .
If states could have doubled their collection rate on arrears to 12 percent since FY 2002 , we predict that arrears would have stopped growing and would have totaled $ 86 billion in FY 2006 .
Unfortunately , most debtors do not pay 12 percent of their arrears each year .
Those who do , tend to owe less than $ 1,000 in arrears .
We examined debtors by their characteristics and found that debtors with no reported income were the least likely to pay arrears .

The study states have taken numerous actions to manage their arrears , which are presented in this report to provide ideas for other states to consider as they manage their arrears .
These strategies cover the entire range of arrears management techniques , from order establishment to arrears compromise programs .
One strategy that study states have used to prevent arrears from accruing in the first place is to set realistic orders .
Having access to verifiable earnings data helps child support workers set realistic orders .
It reduces the need to impute income at levels that often exceed actual income .
In the past , study states did not have access to state and national quarterly earnings records to assist in the order determination process , but today many of the study states have this information readily available for case workers to use as they seek new orders .
Some of the study states request state income tax records to assist in this process as well .
Nearly all of the study states have a low - income provision in their state child support guidelines , which aims to reduce the child support order amount for low - income obligors .
Most of the low - income provisions utilize a self - support reserve for the obligor , although the guidelines do not always use that term .
Not surprisingly , given that the states have different costs of living , the size of the self - support reserve varies , from a low of $ 550 per month in Ohio to a high of $ 1,047 per month in New York .
Many of the study states have taken steps to increase parental participation in the order establishment process .
Making documents more readable , using welcoming letters , and holding pre-hearing conferences are some of the strategies that study states have used .
Study states have also taken steps to improve their service of process to ensure that parents are notified of their pending order .
Study states have reduced the length and use of retroactive support .
Two study states Michigan and Texas passed laws that eliminate the policy of setting retroactive support back to the date of the birth of the child in paternity cases .
Now Texas may go back up to 4 years prior to the date of filing to set retroactive support ; Michigan may go back to the date of filing to set an order unless there is willful avoidance .
A variety of early intervention strategies have been adopted by the study states .
The primary aim of these strategies is to intervene early enough after the order is established to prevent delinquency from occurring in the first place .
These strategies rely on increased contact with the non-custodial parent , mainly through reminder calls or letters .
In some study states , new positions have been created to conduct this outreach .
Efforts have also been made to make employment services and other services available to non-custodial parents at the time the order is established if these services are needed to prevent arrears accumulation .
Improving the wage withholding process is also key to preventing arrears from accumulating in the first place since so much of child support is collected using this process .
Texas has focused considerable attention on improving this process in recent years , culminating in a fully revised employer repository , updated interfaces , and a single website that employers can use to meet all of their child support - related responsibilities .
Increasing review and modification of orders is another strategy for preventing arrears accumulation .
The Deficit Reduction
Act of 2005 will result in greater utilization of this strategy since it reinstated the requirement that all TANF cases must be reviewed and modified every three years , effective October 1 , 2007 .
Possibly the toughest task for states is to manage their existing arrears .
Chapter 5 describes several strategies that the study states have undertaken to tackle this problem .
Revising a state 's interest policy is an important step in this process .
Two of the study states Michigan and Texas have lowered their interest rate in recent years .
Another strategy that study states have used to manage their existing arrears is to conduct amnesty programs .
Pennsylvania and other study states have conducted arrears amnesty programs .
These programs allow obligors to come forward and take steps to correct their delinquencies without being arrested .
Two other study states Michigan and Illinois have passed legislation that authorizes arrears compromise programs .
These programs allow the child support program ( or the court ) to reduce the amount of arrears owed to the state if the obligor meets certain criteria .
Since 2005 , judges in Michigan may approve payment plans that discharge some of the state - owed arrears if the plans are in the best interest of the children , the arrears were not the result of willfully avoiding the obligation , and the obligor does not have the ability to pay all of the arrears in the future .
In Illinois , the legislation allows the child support program to reduce state - assigned arrears in exchange for regular payments of support to the family if the obligor was unable to pay the arrears during the time it was accumulated .
Another strategy that study states have used to manage their existing arrears is to conduct a special review of their non-paying arrears cases .
Typically , states start with their highest arrears cases .
Workers are asked to contact the parties involved and make every effort to move the case , either to payment or closure .
The Deficit Reduction
Act of 2005 should also increase arrears collections .
Three provisions are particularly noteworthy in this regard .
First , the amount of arrears that triggers passport denial was reduced from $ 5,000 to $ 2,500 , effective October 1 , 2006 .
Second , the Act authorizes the federal tax offset program to collect child support arrears owed to adult children in non-TANF cases , effective October 1 , 2007 .
Third , it authorizes OCSE to match cases with arrears to information maintained by insurance companies effective October 1 , 2005 .

The seven states are : Arizona , Illinois , Michigan , New Jersey , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Texas .
14 . State interest policies are based on information from the OCSE Intergovernmental Referral Guide and telephone interviews with state child support administrators .
The states that charge interest routinely are : Alabama , Alaska , Arizona , California , Georgia , Massachusetts , Michigan , Minnesota , Nebraska , Nevada , New Mexico , North Dakota , Oklahoma , Rhode Island , Texas , Virginia , West Virginia , and Wisconsin .
The states that charge interest intermittently are : Arkansas , Colorado , Guam , Idaho , Illinois , Indiana , Iowa , Kansas , Kentucky , Maryland , Mississippi , Missouri , New York , Ohio , Oregon , Utah , Vermont , Washington , and Wyoming .
The remaining states do not charge interest .
In late March , Apple CEO Steve Jobs took the stage with Arnold Schwarzenegger at the Lucile Packard ’s Children ’s Hospital to help drum up support for a proposed bill in California that would require individuals receiving their license to indicate whether or not they would like to be organ donors .
As it stands now , drivers in California have to take pro-active steps to sign up as organ donors .
Addressing the crowd , Jobs was uncharacteristically open about his liver transplant , and recounted just how close to dying he actually was .
“ I was almost one of the ones that died waiting for a liver in California last year , ” Jobs said , ” there were simply not enough livers in California to go around , and my doctors here advised me to enroll in a transplant program in Memphis , where the supply - demand ratio of livers is more favorable than it is in California . ”
“ I was very fortunate , ” Jobs continued , “ Many others died waiting to receive one . ”
Earlier this week , a Silicon Alley Insider reader named James emailed Jobs to thank him for his efforts in spreading awareness about the importance of organ donations and rallying up support for the proposed law .
His email reads :
Thank you , you ’re awesome .
I lost my girlfriend on April 23 , 2008 from melanoma which spread rapidly to her liver , 48 hours after we found out it spread to her liver she sadly passed away ….
she was only 24 and I think about her every day .
I am so grateful you took time out to do this .
My girlfriend and I are from Cupertino , since childhood , and it ’s really nice to see the hometown hero take time out to do this .
Once again , thank you so much .
Sincerely , James
Jobs soon replied ,
Your most welcome , James .
I ’m sorry about your girlfriend .
Life is fragile .

SAI acknowledges the grammatical error in Jobs ’ email , but after investigating the headers , they ’re confident that this email did , in fact , come from Jobs himself .
In an email to SAI , James explains why chose to make his correspondence with Jobs public :
Captured Jundallah leader Abdolmalek Rigi has said that while in Morocco , suspected Israeli or US agents had given him a list of people to assassinate in Tehran .
In a recent interview , Rigi told Press TV that before his arrest Jundallah had held a series of meetings in Casablanca with a group who had claimed to be NATO contacts .
" When we looked back at all the things that had happened we felt that two things were unclear .
First , if they are from NATO why did they not meet with us in Afghanistan where they have bases and where they can contact us in a much more easy and secure manner , " said Rigi .
" The second issue was that the first time that they informed us that NATO forces wanted to meet with us we thought they were going to speak about eastern parts of Iran , because NATO forces are stationed in Afghanistan . "
" But they insisted that we should transfer our operations from the eastern border region to the capital .
We thought that this was very strange .
When we thought about it we came to the conclusion that they are either Americans acting under NATO cover or Israelis , " he added .
Iranian security forces arrested Rigi while he was onboard a flight from Dubai to Kyrgyzstan in late February .
Jundallah , which is based in Pakistan , has carried out numerous bombings , assassination attempts , and terrorist attacks in Iran , one of which killed at least 40 people in the southeastern city of Pishin .
After his arrest , the ringleader confessed that Western intelligence agencies supported his terror activities against Iran .
These Republicans make me laugh .
And here I thought all government was evil and all links had to be cut so business can be unleashed from the shackles of government tyranny .
And threats of legal action ?
Is n’t that what liberals do ?
Does n’t that drive up costs ?
Which is it , Bobby ?
Is government evil or can it be used as a force for good ?
Sounds like he ’s your run of the mill fraud and opportunist :
Louisiana state and local officials continued to hammer BP and the federal agencies responding to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on Sunday , repeatedly threatening to “ take matters into our own hands ” if the response fell short .
At a news conference at a marina here , Gov. Bobby Jindal recited a timeline of his requests to BP and the Coast Guard for containment boom , skimmers and other supplies , saying that the resources were still far from adequate weeks later .
I went to MongoSF today – quite an event , and I hope to have a chance to write more about it .
This post is about one replication problem and how MongoDB solves it .
If you ’re using MySQL Replication when your master goes down it is possible for some writes to be executed on the master , but not on the slave , which gets promoted to the master .
When Master comes back up it has some updates done to it which cause it to be inconsistent with data on the new Master .
In MySQL world we can chose to either ignore this problem ( or may be even replay those changes on slaves and hope it works out ) , re-clone it from the slave or use mk - table - checksum to find inconsistencies and re-sync them with mk - table - sync .
Both of these operations can be very expensive for large databases .
MongoDB approach used in Replication Sets is for failed master to scan its log files to find all object ids which were modified from the point slave synchronized successfully and retrieve those objects back from the new master ( or delete them if they no more exist ) .
Such approach allows quick synchronization without any complex support of rolling back changes .
In MongoDB there is a catch with this approach – because there is no local durability this also works as long as network goes down but server stays up , however once Single Server Durability is implemented it will be pretty cool .
What is really interesting – it should be possible to apply the same concept to MySQL Replication , possibly with help of some tools like MMM .
Row level Replication makes it possible to identify the objects which were changed on the Master after failover to Slave happened and they can be dumped to local file ( in case one wants to synchronize them manually ) and when fetched again from the master .
This of course will require IDEMPOTENT slave mode but otherwise it should work unless you have DDL operations in between .
In general listening the great presentation on MongoDB Replication by Dwight Merriman as well as previously looking at how replication done in Redis I should say things can be done a lot more simple way when there is no schema and when you do not have to mess with complex features like triggers or multiple storage engines .
Fox Charlotte reports that a gun went off inside the desk of a third grader in Charlotte , N.C .
It is unclear how the gun went off , but luckily , the bullet missed all 20 students in the classroom and only hit a wall .
Parents rushed to the school not knowing the extent of the situation after they were told , “ A serious incident occurred in a University Meadows classroom this afternoon . ”
The gun was a . 22 - caliber handgun " small enough to fit in the palm of your hand , " said Sgt. David Schwob .
Police are investigating the boy's father who came to the school in the afternoon .
Schwob said investigators were interviewing the boy , his parents and other students in the class .

Green space is important for mental health Just five minutes of exercise in a " green space " such as a park can boost mental health , researchers claim .
There is growing evidence that combining activities such as walking or cycling with nature boosts well - being .
In the latest analysis , UK researchers looked at evidence from 1,250 people in 10 studies and found fast improvements in mood and self - esteem .
The study in the Environmental Science and Technology journal suggested the strongest impact was on young people .
The research looked at many different outdoor activities including walking , gardening , cycling , fishing , boating , horse - riding and farming in locations such as a park , garden or nature trail .
The biggest effect was seen within just five minutes .
With longer periods of time exercising in a green environment , the positive effects were clearly apparent but were of a smaller magnitude , the study found .
Looking at men and women of different ages , the researchers found the health changes - physical and mental - were particularly strong in the young and the mentally - ill .
Green and blue A bigger effect was seen with exercise in an area that also contained water - such as a lake or river .
Study leader Jules Pretty , a researcher at the University of Essex , said those who were generally inactive , or stressed , or with mental illness would probably benefit the most from " green exercise " .
We would like to see all doctors considering exercise as a treatment where appropriate
Paul Farmer , Mind " Employers , for example , could encourage staff in stressful workplaces to take a short walk at lunchtime in the nearest park to improve mental health . "
He also said exercise programmes outdoors could benefit youth offenders .
" A challenge for policy makers is that policy recommendations on physical activity are easily stated but rarely adopted widely . "
Paul Farmer , chief executive of mental health charity Mind , said the research is yet further evidence that even a short period of green exercise can provide a low cost and drug - free therapy to help improve mental wellbeing .
" It 's important that people experiencing depression can be given the option of a range of treatments , and we would like to see all doctors considering exercise as a treatment where appropriate . "
Mind runs a grant scheme for local environmental projects to help people with mental illness get involved in outdoor activities .

We started a weekly column this week with Nate Winslow , a 22 year - old trying to get a $ 1 M movie produced .
I asked in comments :
Nate ’s informative response deserves promotion to the front page :
Hm .
Good question .
Let ’s start with the basics .
Some of the everyday “ moments ” in screenplays that can be really expensive :
1. WEATHER .
Water is really , really expensive .
Rain machines , for example — avoid them at all costs .
If a scene does n’t absolutely NEED to be set in the pouring rain , do n’t have it be raining .
Same goes for the season of the film — if you ’re making a winter -y film noir , it ’ll cost more than if you were making that same film noir and shooting it in a calmer season / in a place like San Diego where it never gets cold .
2 . Huge crowds .
Anything with huge numbers of extras can be expensive .
I say can because there are some ways to get huge crowds without every person in them being a SAG Extra ( expensive ) .
But in general , filming a speech to an arena of soldiers , or a political figure at a rally , or a sporting event , or a scene at the Boston Marathon is all going to be really expensive for you .
Keep your characters away from huge public gatherings and you ’ll save yourself a lot of money .
3. Complicated action sequences .
Explosions , car chases , helicopter chases , anything involving planes and anything involving weapons are expensive .
4. Public transportation scenes : this might sound weird , but usually scenes involving some form of public transportation are really expensive .
Buses , subways , trains … all really expensive because they ’re all owned and branded , and they all charge you way too much money .
Shooting in the subway in New York for one day is the cost of a tiny independent film in and of itself .
5. Like Scott mentioned , avoid shooting scenes on the water .
It ’s incredibly time consuming ( which equals expensive ) , it ’s potentially dangerous for your cast and crew , it ’s really hard to control the shooting environment that you ’re in ( which equals more time spent setting up and doing that take over and over and over which equals expensive ) , transportation out on the water is slower / more complicated / more expensive and camera ’s do n’t like water .
In terms of general ideas of reducing costs at the writing stage , I think the most simple advice I can give is to know the cost of your sentences .
Example : it ’s easy to get caught up in the rhythm of writing and scene and , in a race to finish the scene at the pinnacle of tension , you write “ Linus picks the bag of groceries off the counter , pockets his change and as he walks out of the door , 6 POLICE CARS - sirens FLASHING — go screaming by . ”
It fits with the story : he ’s in a dangerous part of town , maybe Linus is a David - Kimble - esque character and he’s on the run from the authorities and every wail of a siren makes him tense up so every chance to twist that tension should be taken .
Right .
But as easy as writing “ 6 police cars go screaming by ” is , shooting that is a totally different story …
Finding 6 retired police cars , renting them from whatever car company it is , getting permission from the police department to be using police car replicas , paying for the police supervision because you ’re using sirens , getting permission to close down the road so you can line up the cars and have them go racing by on the correct mark …
The list goes on .
And that was one sentence in the screenplay .
Know how much the sentence costs : if we ’re going with the idea that Linus is a fugitive and we ’re trying to heighten the tension there , how about this .
That story beat — the fact that he ’s a fugitive and the sound of sirens signals his potential impending doom / discovery — does n’t need a visual to have the same amount of impact .
What if instead of 6 police cars racing by as he ’s walking out onto the street it happens when he ’s still inside the store ?
At the counter , about to pay the cashier , and the sirens come wailing up the street — the SOUND of the sirens and the faint red and blue glow on his face as Linus whips around and stares terrified at the window deliver the same beat and all it takes is a light rig with some colored gels and putting in the siren in post .
And just as effective .
That type of editing when you ’re writing or revising your screenplay is what ’s going to save you the most money at that stage of the process .
By being aware of what you ’re really writing when you off - handedly mention a scene detail , you ’re going to save yourself thousands and thousands of dollars .
Same goes for locations .
If you know this is going to be a million dollar movie and you ’ve picked your genre and your story and you ’ve got an idea of the main plot points , it never hurts to do some location scouting ( mentally , physically , Google , whatever ) to figure out what ’s available to you at the start .
A friend of mine is in the process of writing a horror film that he plans to film for around a million dollars at some point in the future .
Originally , it was supposed to take place at a highway rest stop : after the first outline , he realized he was n’t going to be able to easily get access to a rest stop for 21 straight days without spending a large amount of money .
Turns out a very distant cousin owns a ranch out in Texas that he never uses and that my buddy should feel free to use for whatever he likes .
Boom !
That horror film is now set on a ranch that costs absolutely nothing to use and completely controllable , and now that he knows where he has a locked - down location to set the movie in , his next draft is even more focused : the “ limitation ” of having the movie move from its original location actually sharpens the script ’s potential because he knows exactly where his movie is taking place and can shape the horror accordingly .
Apple will shut down Lala , effective May 31st .
No more new subscribers , no more service , no more Lala .
Customers that bought music from Lala can still play those MP3s , although no new music can be uploaded and songs and gift cards are now unavailable .
No new subscribers are being taken for Lala 's streaming platform .
Streams will end on May 31st as well .
The notice was given via the Lala web site , saying " Lala is shutting down , The Lala service will be shut down on May 31st , 2010 .
Unfortunately , we are no longer accepting new users .
Members , you can still use Lala through May 31st , 2010 .
Log in for details . "
Lala was said to have 8 million songs available for streaming and purchase .
Apple acquired Lala for anywhere from $ 20 - $ 80 million , according to estimates .
So the big question then and now is : how will Apple use LaLa ?
Will Apple integrate it into iTunes , and allow a personal iTunes library to be available via the web ?
Will they start offering a subscription - based service like the old Lala for use , or did they just want to get a look under the hood of LaLa 's technology ?
With Apple 's big press event known as the Worldwide Developers Conference due in June in San Francisco , the future of Lala has to be going through a radical change .
The shut down date is one week before the conference begins .
Apple could mention this during the press event , and the recent speculation / hysteria of a new iPhone 4G make the future of mobile music look very enticing .
Imagine this : streaming music from the cloud , via your phone , with high quality audio .
In your car , at work , at home , anywhere .
That sounds incredible .

It turns out that SB1070 sponsor Russell Pearce is n't the only prominent legislator hating on the 14th Amendment of the United States , as it applies to birthright citizenship .
Turns out that we can add the United States Constitution to one more thing that Rand Paul does n't like , in addition to civil rights , the disabilities act , holding BP accountable , and everything else fair and just in this world .
From the Los Angeles Times Blog :
The Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate from Kentucky said in the interview done shortly after his primary victory last week that the U.S. should n't provide an easy route to citizenship .
The interview was done with RT , an English - language station in Russia .
Legislation dubbed the Birthright Citizenship
Act was introduced in the House last year , seeking to prevent citizenship to babies born to illegal immigrants even though the 14th Amendment to the Constitution guarantees citizenship to everyone born in the U.S .
Memo to nativist Republicans : the issue of birthright citizenship under the 14th amendment was decided by the Supreme Court over a century ago .
If you 're going to undo it , try using the appropriate process : a Constitutional amendment .
Good luck .
Hm , jag skrev ju i mitt förra inlägg att jag skulle försöka undvika ämnen som Melodifestivalen och Eurovision Song Contest ett tag framöver .

In December , a 33 - year - old music writer dropped his iPod onto the B train tracks at 110th Street .
He jumped in and was killed instantly when a train entered the station .
The victim ’s mother was quoted by The Daily News as saying her son was “ very young and kind of adventurous , so maybe he thought he could pull the iPod out of the tracks . ”

Impulse , intoxication , love of risk :
It is never clear why people put themselves in harm ’s way .
Those who have successfully retrieved items from the track say the behavior is more common than people think — but they almost always come to regret it .
“ There are a thousand things you can do in this town that are , on paper , unwise , ” said Thomas Beller , an author who wrote about his own foray to retrieve an iPod .
( It took him two tries and a cut shin to make it out . )
“ They could have tragic ends , but people do them all the time anyway , ” Mr. Beller said , citing bicycling without a helmet and exploring Central Park in the city ’s grimier days .
When he told friends of his adventure on the tracks , “ it was universally greeted as something that was totally nuts , ” he said , adding , “ It always get a laugh , but it ’s a kind of nervous laugh . ”
Mr. Beller , speaking on the telephone , was interrupted by his daughter , newly arrived since the subway incident .
“ Let me add , ” he said , “ that once you become a parent , the nature of those calculations changes . ”
Transit officials say that in the event of a lost item , passengers should alert a police officer or transit worker , who can often arrange for a hook or net to retrieve the item .
“ It ’s just not worth taking the risk , ” said Paul Fleuranges , a spokesman for New York City Transit .
“ In one instant the coast looks clear , and you think you can hop down , retrieve your item and hop back up .
In reality , it ’s not that simple . ”
Schumpeterian Liberalism
Liberal bloggers Bradford Plumer and Ezra Klein recently challenged the totemistic status of small business , Mom -n - Pop , and Main Street .
When small businesses can afford to pay decent wages and benefits , more power to them .
But in general , small businesses “ pay their workers less , offer fewer benefits , are much , much harder for unions to organize , and are often more dangerous places to work .
They ’re rarely more innovative , and they are n’t the really the ‘ motor ’ behind job growth … ”
Eric Husman , of GrimReader blog , summarized their position this way : “ It ’s not that they are against Small Business , it ’s just that they are in favor of those things that characterize Big Business .
Returns to Scale ?
Check .
Market power ?
Check .
Bureaucratic and unionized ?
Check ?
Okay , you are an acceptable small business ! ”
I think the liberal attitude toward big business can be summed up as Schumpeterian .
Schumpeter argued that it was only large managerialist corporations run by central planner types that could afford technological innovation , because they had the market power necessary to administer prices and sell above marginal cost , and thus recoup outlays for R&D .
For liberals , likewise , it ’s the large , bureaucratic businesses that are most likely to be able to afford to be “ progressive ” because of their market power .
A certain kind of liberal , as a result , tends to distrust any alternative to conventional managerial - professional ways of doing things .
That ’s why you see people like Jaron Lanier and Chris Hedges who think it ’s “ progressive ” to defend “ intellectual property rights ” against Internet culture , and people like Michael Moore who think it ’s great for GM to own half the economy so long as its workers have lifetime job guarantees with union wages .
The same people instinctively react to garage factories as “ sweatshops ” and see any kind of decentralist alternative to the centralized corporate - state nexus as just another version of neoliberalism in sheep ’s clothing ( hence Tom Frank ’s bristling at all criticisms of Taylorism and Weberian rationality by proponents of networked organization or Enterprise 2.0 ) .
They tend to favor a “ regulated utility ” model where a handful of giant organizations are guaranteed reasonable profits , and in return take good care of their serfs .
That model applies whether it ’s Michael Moore ’s GM of ca. 1948 , or the Big Three network gatekeepers regulated by the Fairness Doctrine .
A lot of this probably results from the origins of 20th century liberalism as an ideology .
Liberalism , or “ Progressivism ” as it was known at the turn of the 20th century , was the ideology of the managerial - professional classes that arose to run the new large organizations that mushroomed into existence in the late 19th century .
The first corporate managers were mostly from an industrial engineering background , and saw organizations as processes to be rationalized in the same way as the production process .
From there it was only one more step to seeing society itself as a process to be rationalized by professional managers , and calling for politics to be replaced by administration .
Hence the Progressive agenda .
So it ’s only natural that their ideological descendants today are more than a little suspici0us of any major undertaking that ’s not supervised by “ properly qualified authorities . ”
One question worth bearing in mind is WHY the big guys can afford to be progressive , and whether the same market power might just be putting the little guy at a competitive disadvantage where he CAN ’T afford to be progressive .
Neo -Marxist James O’Connor ’s thing about the competitive sector providing the tax base to subsidize monopoly capital is relevant here .
Another thing to bear in mind is what a faulty model the regulated monopoly is for controlling costs , when both regulators and regulated share the same unquestioned assumptions about the normal way of organizing an enterprise .
Monopoly and restricted competition is a source of cost , not only because of the rate of profit , but because of managerialism and bureaucracy .
And the government , in “ regulating ” the prices monopolies can charge , generally takes that form of Weberian / Taylorist bureaucracy ( mission statements , bureaucratic work rules , job descriptions , stovepiping of functions ) as the natural way of doing things .
I ’m far less interested in the kind of “ competition ” between a larger number of conventional capitalist corporations that share the same organizational culture , than I am in opening up competition from the kinds of unconventional entities currently hampered by regulation : low - cost , cooperative , self - organized , small and agile bodies like Colin Ward describes in his history of the mutual welfare state .
The federal ethics commissioner says the use of Conservative Party logos on ceremonial funding cheques is inappropriate but not against the MPs ' code of ethics or the Conflict of Interest Act .
MP Gerald Keddy presents a ceremonial cheque that includes the Conservative Party logo and Keddy 's signature .
(( Chesterns.ca ) ) Mary Dawson issued two reports Thursday — one on the code and one on the act — in response to dozens of complaints about the cheque logos last fall from opposition MPs and the public .
Conservative MPs and ministers were handing out large - sized ceremonial cheques with the Conservative Party logo on them , even though the money was from the government of Canada , the critics said .
Dawson determined that such props might help raise the profile of the people using them , but they do not further an MP's " private interests " as defined in the code or the act .
She acknowledged an MP might have a private financial interest in re-election , since being an MP comes with a good salary and benefits .
But by that logic , she said , anything an MP does to improve his or her image with constituents could be seen as furthering a private interest .
Still , Dawson said the practice of using partisan or personal identifiers in announcing government initiatives " goes too far and has the potential to diminish public confidence in the integrity of elected public officials and the governing institutions they represent . "
" Public spending announcements are government activities , not partisan political activities , and it is not appropriate to brand them with partisan or personal identifiers . "
She recommended the government consider strengthening existing policies on props used for funding announcements and other government communications .
She pointed to Ontario and Alberta , which already have legislation governing the politicization of government communications .
IN 1956 , nearly a century after Fort Sumter , Robert Penn Warren went on assignment for Life magazine , traveling throughout the South after the Supreme Court ’s school desegregation decisions .

“ History , like nature , knows no jumps , ” he wrote , “ except the jump backward , maybe . ”
Last week , Virginia ’s governor , Robert McDonnell , jumped backward when he issued a proclamation recognizing April as Confederate History Month .
In it he celebrated those “ who fought for their homes and communities and Commonwealth ” and wrote of the importance of understanding “ the sacrifices of the Confederate leaders , soldiers and citizens during the period of the Civil War . ”
The governor originally chose not to mention slavery in the proclamation , saying he “ focused on the ones I thought were most significant for Virginia . ”
It seems to follow that , at least for Mr. McDonnell , the plight of Virginia ’s slaves does not rank among the most significant aspects of the war .
Advertently or not , Mr. McDonnell is working in a long and dispiriting tradition .
Efforts to rehabilitate the Southern rebellion frequently come at moments of racial and social stress , and it is revealing that Virginia ’s neo-Confederates are refighting the Civil War in 2010 .
Whitewashing the war is one way for the right  alienated , anxious and angry about the president , health care reform and all manner of threats , mostly imaginary  to express its unease with the Age of Obama , disguising hate as heritage .
Geological investigations in the Himalayas have revealed evidence that when India and Asia collided some 90 million years ago , the continental crust of the Indian tectonic plate was forced down under the Asian plate , sinking down into the Earth 's mantle to a depth of at least 200 km kilometres .
" The subduction of continental crust to this depth has never been reported in the Himalayas and is also extremely rare in the rest of world , " said Dr Anju Pandey of the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton , who led the research .
Pandey and her colleagues used sophisticated analytical techniques to demonstrate the occurrence of relict majorite , a variety of mineral garnet , in rocks collected from the Himalayas .
Majorite is stable only under ultra- high pressure conditions , meaning that they must have been formed very deep down in the Earth 's crust , before the subducted material was exhumed millions of years later .
" Our findings are significant because researchers have disagreed about the depth of subduction of the Indian plate beneath Asia , " said Pandey .
In fact , the previous depth estimates conflicted with estimates based on computer models .
The new results suggest that the leading edge of the Indian plate sank to a depth around double that of previous estimates .
" Our results are backed up by computer modelling and will radically improve our understanding of the subduction of the Indian continental crust beneath the Himalayas , " said Pandey .
The new discovery is also set to modify several fundamental parameters of Himalayan tectonics , such as the rate of Himalayan uplift , angle , and subduction of the Indian plate .
The new research findings were published this month in the journal Geology .
The study was supported by the UK's Natural Environment research Council .
The researchers are Anju Pandey and Andy Milton of the National Oceanography Centre , Southampton , Mary Leech of San Francisco State university ) , and Preeti Singh and Pramod Verma of the University of Delhi .
Down the road from the disaster scene at the Upper Big Branch Mine , two unassuming brick buildings stand side by side , hugging the bank of the Big Coal River .
One is the Assembly of God Church ; the other is the meeting hall of Local 6608 of the United Mine Workers Union .
When you make your living digging coal , miner Albert T. Bonds says , you 'd better have God and family behind you .
" It 's a tight bunch — and a religious bunch — that 's up and down the river , " says Bonds , 51 , who worked 27 years underground , eight of them at the Massey Energy Co. mine in nearby Montcoal , where 25 were killed and four still missing in an explosion Monday .
" And it 's a good place to grow up and be . "
But to grow up here is to know that death , massive and swift , can come at any time .
It hit home four years ago , when 12 miners died at the Sago Mine in the northeastern corner of the state , and again Monday when methane gas apparently ignited , causing the blast .
Benny R. Willingham , who died in Monday 's explosion , was just five weeks from retirement .
His daughter , Michelle McKinney , says he was looking forward to a Virgin Island cruise , but was also prepared for death .
" He talked about it all the time .
He said if the Lord come and got him , he 's ready , " she said Tuesday as she clutched a photo of her parents and their youngest grandson .
" He was a family man and he loved the Lord .
We know where he's at , but we still want him to come back . "
In isolated places like Raleigh County , there has never been much of a choice besides coal , timber and low - paying service jobs .
" That 's what you get when you live in this area , " said Terry Holstein , 49 , a mine electrician .
" Because that 's all we have . "
Unincorporated towns — neighborhoods really — cling to the banks of the Big Coal and up into the surrounding hollows .
Covered conveyor belts snake up the sawtooth hills behind the clusters of houses , illuminating the moutainsides like strings of Christmas lights at night .
Holstein was supposed to start his underground shift at the Oak Hill mine at 5 a.m.
Tuesday , but his boss told him to come in when he felt like it .
At 7:15 , he was just arriving at Charles B. Jarrell General Merchandise in Dry Creek to buy his day 's supply of cigarettes : three packs of USA Full Flavors .
His boss " wanted to make sure our heads was right and stuff before we went in there , " Holstein said as he stood on the store 's cinderblock porch .
" I wanted to be safe about what I 'm doing and make sure I really wanted to go up there and do my job , and that I could do it right and safe . "
As a herd of painted horses grazed on a hillside studded with redbud and dogwood trees in the slowly lifting mist , miners filed into the Jarrell store , their work pants striped with the telltale orange reflective tape , their rough hands stained with coal dust that can never be fully scrubbed off .
The store , with its creaky wooden floors and dust - stained American flag , stocks everything from chewing tobacco and hose clamps to 50 - pound salt blocks and apple deer corn for hunting season .
The oldest continuously run business in the county , it also doubles as Dry Creek 's Post Office .
Although the names of the dead had yet to be officially released Tuesday morning , store manager Lavon Collins was sure each would be a familiar one .
Already , regular takers of her ham and Colby sandwiches had failed to show .
" I usually have all kinds of guys , " she said , her eyes brimming with tears .
" I 'm heartbroken . "
Coal pays the mortgages on homes and the monthly payments on shiny new pickups , often bearing " Friends of Coal " stickers .
Even though Massey Energy and some of its mining methods have stirred controversy , most here support the company and accuse outsiders of trying to divide the community with their criticisms .
At Flint 's Hardware in Sylvester , just 8 miles north of Montcoal , miners ' uniforms hung on the walls , equipment waiting to be purchased .
" We probably know 90 percent of the men , " said Betty Taylor , who has worked there for eight years .
" It 's terrible .
...
People are just devastated .
They do n't know what to say , what to do . "
At Libby 's City Grill in Whitesville , the accident was the talk of every breakfast table , and owner James Scott was grieving his own loss .
The family learned late Monday that his 58 - year - old uncle , Deward Scott of Montcoal , was among the dead .
Deward Scott had spent his whole career in the mines except for a brief stint to teach karate — a skill he 'd learned in the Army .
But neither his uncle nor his customers at talked much about their work .
" I never heard anyone say anything about the mine , good or bad , " James Scott said .
" You just do n't talk about it . "
The tragedy binds everyone , said patron John Bell , 65 , a retired schoolteacher from Whitesville .
" It 's just like 9/11 , " he said .
" I did n't know anybody personally , but the whole country was feeling it .
We 're all a part of it . "
Larry Asbury , a retired miner from Sylvester , said his son is the director of a Massey mine - rescue team , but he has n't talked to him since the explosion .
" This is rare , this many deaths , " he said .
" There 's death in the mines every day , but not like this . "
Asbury , 69 , was an underground miner for 27 years and said he tried not to think about the danger , the fear .
" You did n't , or you would n't work , " said Asbury , who suffered back , neck and head injuries when he was pinned against a mine rib in 1992 .
" And if you want to live in your own home , you 'll work in the mines . "
" God put coal up there , " agreed Teddy Jarrell , 45 , who works at a paint and body shop but whose father was a miner .
" He give us but one way to get it out , that 's it .
God put the coal up there for us to get out to survive .
So that 's the way you get it out — take the mountain off . "
There is a pride among miners that seems born of inevitability , or resignation .
When you have no other choice , you can rage against fate , or embrace it .
" A coal miner is a rare breed , " said Bonds , who switched to aboveground work at a coal preparation plant in 2006 .
" They 're somewhat like a soldier , I think .
Because every time you go underground , there 's always a slight possibility you might not come out .
But that 's the occupation you 've chosen .
That 's how you earn your living and feed your family . "
Holstein , a father of five grown children , was shaken by Monday 's explosion .
But he has known for years that he could die " anytime , anywhere . "
" You just put it in the back of your head and go on . "
So on Tuesday morning , Holstein grabbed his lunch pail and said goodbye to his wife , Cassandra .
" Be careful , " she told him .
" I 'll see you this evening . "
ODESSA , Texas --
A lot of guys dream about going back to high school and recapturing their athletic glory days .
A man who went by the name of Jerry Joseph did it , police say , and now he 's in big trouble .
Authorities say the boyish - looking 22 - year - old posed as a 16 - year - old sophomore phenom to lead the Permian High School basketball team to the state playoffs .
He was jailed on fraud charges , and the rabidly competitive West Texas high school that inspired the movie " Friday Night Lights " may have to forfeit its season .
" Everyone just thought he was a big guy , " said Permian senior football player Steven Pipes .
" He played the part good , skipping down the hallways acting goofy like a 16 - year - old . "
Pipes and some teammates approached the 6 - foot - 5 player they knew as Joseph soon after he enrolled last year , asking him if he wanted to play football .
Pipes said Joseph , who was attending a junior high at the time , declined .
He liked basketball instead , and he was good enough to average about 20 points per game over the final nine games heading into the playoffs , where Permian lost in the first round .
Joseph was a starter and played center and forward .
But suspicions about the player 's identity first arose when three Florida basketball coaches familiar with a former player named Guerdwich Montimere recognized him last month at an amateur tournament in Little Rock , Ark .
Montimere , a naturalized U.S. citizen from Haiti , graduated from Dillard High School in Fort Lauderdale in 2007 .
School officials and immigration authorities initially believed Joseph when he denied the allegations and let him remain enrolled .
But school police and immigration agents confirmed Montimere 's identity Tuesday .
When confronted , he confessed , said school district spokesman Mike Adkins .
Montimere was arrested and charged with failure to identify himself to a police officer .
He posted $ 500 bond Wednesday , said Ector County sheriff 's Sgt. Debbie Bruce .
If convicted of the misdemeanor , he could face a maximum of six months in jail and a $ 2,500 fine .
Bruce said there was no record of an attorney for Montimere .
Montimere 's mother , Manikisse Montimere of Tamarac , Fla. , said she had not seen her son in about two years .
She said basketball was important to him .
" I guess he does n't want me in his life at all , " she said .
" I always pray to wish him the best . "
A 37 - year - old cousin , Tales Simeon of Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , was baffled .
" At 22 years old , if you 're good , they still take you in the NBA or wherever you want to go .
So why did he try to be something else , to change his age .
What happened ? " Simeon said .
" I have no idea .
I do n't know what 's going on .
This is crazy . "
Montimere presented himself as Joseph after moving to Odessa in February 2009 and enrolling as a ninth - grader at a junior high .
He showed officials a Haitian birth certificate indicating he was 15 and claimed he lived with a half - brother in the dorm of a local university , Adkins said .
After admitting the person was a friend , not his half - brother , Montimere moved in with Permian boys basketball coach Danny Wright when the friend left the state last summer , Adkins said .
On Wednesday afternoon , some players practiced shooting in the Permian gym as Wright looked on .
He declined to comment , citing a directive from school officials .
Moments later while speaking with a substitute teacher who had Joseph in classes this year , Wright said he felt compassion for the young man .
" I genuinely love that kid and wish him the best , " he told the teacher , Liz Faught .
He said he chose to take Joseph into his family and hoped their time together " showed him virtues . "
Faught said later than Joseph was a " most respectable young man " and " was well mannered " when she taught him in class .
And , she said , " he was totally dedicated to basketball . "
Randy Lee , a former men's basketball coach at the University of Texas - Permian Basin , said he was introduced to a teenager known as Jerry Joseph last spring .
Lee said the young man looked more physically developed than a lot of the basketball players he encountered , but he did not seem older than 15 .
" Maybe I 'm gullible , but he did n't look much different from a lot of city kids , " Lee said .
Documents obtained by The Associated Press show that Permian officials obtained a waiver in October from the governing body of Texas public school sports allowing Jerry Joseph to play basketball as a 10th grader , even though he would be living with Wright and not a parent or legal guardian .
The application for the waiver submitted to the University Interscholastic League stated that the player 's birthdate was Jan. 1 , 1994 , that his mother and father were dead , and that he had never been in school before enrolling in ninth grade on March 3 , 2009 .
Under the heading " signature of student " is a neatly written " Jerry Joseph . "
Permian Principal Ray Garcia signed the document in the space designated for a school administrator .
Permian received the district 's approval to seek the waiver in August , when Wright stated that Joseph was a student from Haiti who came from an " unstable family situation , " according to minutes of a meeting where the issue was discussed .
Wright also told the group that the player was not a U.S. citizen but was working with immigration officials to become one .
The rules of the University Interscholastic League require forfeiture of any games involving an ineligible player .
The league will wait to hear from local officials before determining if any other punishment is necessary , said Mark Cousins , the group 's director of policy .
With nearly 1,300 member schools and more than 700,000 athletes , the group counts on schools to determine athletes ' eligibility .
" We put a lot of faith in our administrators , " Cousins said .
" Ultimately , it 's the school 's responsibility . "
ABSTRACT
Information is represented inside a computer by using structures that mimic mathematical models .
Many different kinds of models can be used for the same information ; conversely , many different kinds of information can be represented with the same model .
One of the main reasons that we are able to solve problems efficiently is that we have mathematical tools that tell us how to convert between alternative representations .
This talk focuses on one of the most fundamental mathematical models , the notion of a " family of sets " over some universe .
This model is essentially equivalent to many other models , such as Boolean functions , hypergraphs , or matrices of 0s and 1s .
But the " family of sets " interpretation leads to a different way of thinking , and to a fundamentally different class of problems from those that are normally associated with functions or matrices .
A family of sets is naturally represented by a data structure called a ZDD .
Two or more families are combined by basic operations such as union , intersection , join , meet , quotient .
We are often interested in , say , the maximal sets of a family , or in the members of one family that do n't contain any members of another , etc .
Such operations form a " family algebra , " and there are interesting algorithms to implement the operations of family algebra as operations on ZDDs .
Family algebra is a relatively new topic that is just beginning to be understood .
Examples will be given of applications to ( i ) families of words in a dictionary ; ( ii ) families of patterns that tile a shape ; ( iii ) families of cycles and paths in a graph or network .

Google is planning to launch Google TV later this month according to news reports , with the Google I/O conference on 19 - 20 May tipped to be the most likely date for the big announcement .
There is also speculation Google is seeking partnerships with big players such as Sony Corporation , Intel , and Logitech , to maximize the chances of success .
Google TV ( so far officially unnamed ) will operate on the Google Android operating system , and would add Internet applications such as web searches and other Internet content to video entertainment .
The Google software for set - top boxes could give consumers an alternative to cable / satellite packages now available .
Revenue would be raised from the web - based ads , which would reach a far wider audience than they do at present .
If the concept is successful , it could change the face of TV , turning every set equipped with the software into an Internet terminal .
The first product to use Google TV is expected to be a set - top box running a version of Android called Dragonpoint , and using an Intel Atom processor and Logitech remote control .
The device , connected to televisions and even Blu-ray DVD players , would essentially allow them to act as computers running Internet searches , YouTube , and other Internet applications .
Sony may add Google TV to its next generation of Internet - ready TVs , and it could also be built into other devices with connections to the Internet .
There are also unconfirmed reports that Google and the Dish network are testing a system that allows viewers to search for content on the Internet and from the Dish network ’s own programs .
The annual Google I/O conference will be held on May 19 - 20 in San Francisco , and will be attended by an estimated 3,000 developers .
The conference is regularly used by Google to showcase new technologies for developers , and is widely expected to be the forum in which Google TV is introduced , although others warn Google may wait until the technology is more mature before launching the software .

WASHINGTON — The District of Columbia Council approved a measure on Tuesday that would allow people with certain chronic illnesses to obtain medical marijuana from a handful of dispensaries regulated by the city .
The 13 - member Council voted unanimously to allow doctors to recommend marijuana for people who are infected with H.I.V. , as well as people with glaucoma , cancer or a “ chronic and lasting disease . ”
The legislation permits Mayor Adrian M. Fenty to establish up to eight dispensaries where patients could receive two ounces of marijuana a month .
The measure gives the mayor the option of raising the amount to four ounces without further council action .
Some doctors say marijuana helps relieve nausea , vomiting , certain AIDS symptoms and some side effects of chemotherapy .
For glaucoma patients , the drug is believed to help lower eye pressure .

The December fiasco in Copenhagen has posed a major challenge to the left , indeed to everyone who wants to defend our world and humanity .
The world ’s rich countries went to Copenhagen not to fight global warming , but to block any action that might weaken the narrow national interests of their corporate rulers .
As Bolivia ’s ambassador , Pablo Solón , writes :
For rich countries , the key issues in negotiations were finance , carbon markets , competitiveness of countries and corporations , business opportunities along with discussions about the political makeup of the US Senate .
There was surprisingly little focus on effective solutions for reducing carbon emissions .
Even if they had reached agreement , it would have focused on the fraud of carbon trading , not on slashing carbon emissions by rapidly phasing out coal and oil , as the crisis demands .
As the summit closed , US President Barack Obama put forward a document adopted in a backroom meeting that excluded most of the delegates and that ignored the concerns of most of the world ’s nations without discussion .
With no timelines , no targets , and no enforcement mechanism , the " Copenhagen Accord " is a huge step backwards .
The Kyoto Protocol was clearly inadequate , but as Fidel Castro wrote recently , the Copenhagen Accord is “ nothing more than a joke ” .
The so - called world leaders spoke passionately to the cameras about the need to fight climate change .
But that was just theatre : in practice , they wrecked hopes for a meaningful fight .
Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez pointed out the striking contrast between the rich nations ’ response to climate change and their response to the banking crisis .
He quoted one of the banners in the demonstration outside : “ If the climate were a bank , they would have saved it by now . ”
Why wo n’t they act ?
To a naïve observer , this must seem bizarre .
Climate change will affect everyone , including the children and grandchildren of politicians and corporate leaders .
If you ask any of them individually , our rulers would undoubtedly say that they want their children and grandchildren to live in a stable and sustainable world .
So why do their actions contradict their words ?
Why do they seem determined , in practice , to leave their children and grandchildren a world of poisoned air and water , a world of floods and droughts and escalating climate disasters ?
Why have they repeatedly sabotaged international efforts to adopt even half - hearted measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions ?
When they do consider or implement responses to the climate crisis , why do they always support solutions that do not work , that cannot possibly work ?
Karl Marx had a wonderful phrase for the bosses and their agents – the big shareholders and executives and top managers and the politicians they own – a phrase that explains why they invariably act against the present and future interests of humanity .
These people , he said , are “ personifications of capital ” .
Regardless of how they behave at home , or with their children , their social role is that of capital in human form .
They do n’t act to stop climate change because the changes needed by the people of this world are directly contrary to the needs of capital .
Capital has no conscience .
Capital has no children or grandchildren .
Capital has only one imperative : it has to grow .
As Joel Kovel says , “ Capitalism can no more survive limits on growth than a person can live without breathing . ”
Only profit counts
Under capitalism , the only measure of success is how much is sold , and how much profit is made , every day , every week , every year .
It does n’t matter that they are producing and selling vast quantities of products that are directly harmful to both humans and nature , or that many commodities cannot be produced without spreading disease , destroying the forests that produce the oxygen we breathe , demolishing ecosystems , and treating our water , air and soil as sewers for the disposal of industrial waste .
It all contributes to profits , and thus to the growth of capital – and that ’s what counts .
In Capital , Marx wrote that from a capitalist ’s perspective , raw materials such as metals , minerals , coal , stone , etc. are “ furnished by Nature gratis ” .
The wealth of nature does n’t have to be paid for or replaced when it is used – it is there for the taking .
That ’s true not only of raw materials , but also of what are sometimes called “ environmental services ” – the water and air that have been absorbing capitalism ’s waste products for centuries .
They have been treated as free sewers and free garbage dumps , “ furnished by Nature gratis . ”
Capitalism combines an irresistible drive to grow , with an irresistible drive to create waste and pollution .
If nothing stops it , capitalism will expand both those processes infinitely .
But the Earth is not infinite .
The atmosphere and the oceans and the forests are very large , but ultimately they are finite , limited resources – and capitalism is now pressing against those limits .
The 2006 WWF Living Planet Report concludes :
The Earth ’s regenerative capacity can no longer keep up with demand – people are turning resources into waste faster than nature can turn waste back into resources .
My only disagreement with that statement is that it places the blame on “ people ” as an abstract category .
In fact , the devastation is caused by the global capitalist system , and by the tiny class of exploiters that profits from capitalism ’s continued growth .
The great majority of people are victims , not perpetrators .
In particular , capitalist pollution has passed the physical limit of the ability of nature to absorb carbon dioxide and other gases while keeping the earth ’s temperature steady .
As a result , the world is warmer today than it has been for 100,000 years , and the temperature continues to rise .
Embedded in capitalism ’s DNA
Greenhouse gas emissions are not unusual or exceptional .
Pouring shit into the environment is a fundamental feature of capitalism .
Waste and pollution and ecological destruction are built into the system ’s DNA .
How big a problem is this ?
A recent study conducted for the United Nations found that the world ’s 3000 largest corporations cause 1.6 trillion euros [ US $ 2.2 trillion ] in environmental damage , every year .
More than half of that is caused by greenhouse gas emissions .
If they were forced to pay for the damage they cause , their total profits would be reduced by a third .
Many including some of the world ’s largest and most powerful companies would have no profits at all if they could not offload these environmental costs onto society .
That ’s what the pioneering environmental economist William Kapp meant nearly 60 years ago , when he wrote , “ Capitalism must be regarded as an economy of unpaid costs . ”
In short , pollution is not an accident , and it is not a “ market failure ” .
It is the way the system works .
Former US vice - president Al Gore ,
In his book An Inconvenient Truth , quoted the US socialist writer Upton Sinclair : “ It ’s difficult to get a man to understand something if his salary depends upon his not understanding it . ”
That is an oversimplification of the complex relationship between consciousness and social context , but it is fundamentally true .
Al Gore himself , who seems to understand the seriousness of the climate crisis and who sincerely wants to solve it , cannot accept the really inconvenient truth that the crisis is caused by the system that made him rich , the system that he has devoted his life to defending .
He cannot accept any change that limits or restricts capitalist operations , let alone one that challenges its fundamental nature .
That ’s why the so - called world leaders spoke passionately in Copenhagen about the need to fight climate change , while in practice ensuring that nothing was done .
The other side of Copenhagen
But that was only one side of Copenhagen .
The rich nations did n’t get everything their own way .
The great majority of the world ’s peoples , those whose lives are at stake , were also represented in Copenhagen , inside and outside of the conference centre .
Inside the summit , protests and dissent from the global South could not be ignored .
Delegates from the poorest countries staged several walkouts to protest the dirty Copenhagen deal .
They chanted : “ We will not die quietly . ”
Opposition to Obama ’s backroom deal was led by members of the ALBA alliance , particularly Bolivia , Venezuela , Cuba and Nicaragua , along with Sudan and the heroic Pacific island nation of Tuvalu .
These countries are small and poor , but in this cause they are moral giants , and they deserve our honour and gratitude .
Bolivia ’s Evo Morales , the first elected indigenous head of state in South America , condemned Obama ’s Copenhagen Accord :
There is a profound difference between their document and the peoples fighting for humanity and the planet .
This group of friends led by Obama accept that temperatures can increase by 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 .
This will end the existence of many island states ; it will end our snow - capped mountains .
And Obama only seeks to reduce gas emissions by 50 % in 2050 .
But we want and need 90 to 100 % reduction , in order to save the planet .
Evo went beyond proposing emission targets : he called for a legally binding enforcement mechanism .
We want an International Climate Justice Tribunal that can sanction failure to comply with agreements , so that we can govern based on balance and achieve real solutions .
Outside the hall , climate protesters took over Copenhagen ’s streets for days .
These were the biggest climate demonstrations ever held in Europe .
The unofficial counter - summit , the Klimaforum , attracted 25,000 activists to discuss and debate how the people can force political change .
Klimaforum issued a People ’s Declaration on Climate Change , which was everything the Copenhagen Accord was not .
It called for building “ a global movement of movements dedicated to the long - term task of promoting a sustainable transition of our societies ” .
It proposed four central demands that the movement should support :
A complete abandoning of fossil fuels within the next 30 years , which must include specific milestones for every five - year period .
We demand an immediate cut in GHG of industrialised countries of at least 40 % compared to 1990 levels by 2020 .

Rejection of purely market - oriented and technology - centred false and dangerous solutions such as nuclear energy , agro-fuels , carbon capture and storage , Clean Development Mechanisms , biochar , genetically “ climate - readied ” crops , geo-engineering and reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ( REDD ) , which deepens social and environmental conflicts .
such as nuclear energy , agro-fuels , carbon capture and storage , Clean Development Mechanisms , biochar , genetically “ climate - readied ” crops , geo-engineering and reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ( REDD ) , which deepens social and environmental conflicts .
Real solutions to climate crisis based on safe , clean , renewable and sustainable use of natural resources , as well as transitions to food , energy , land and water sovereignty .
If a movement based on that program is built , it will be a huge step forward .
For too long , the conservative wing of the environmental movement , headed by big NGOs , has locked the climate movement into a strategy of lobbying politicians and adapting to corporate power , in the hope of winning petty reforms .
The failure at Copenhagen proves once again that backroom lobbying has not worked and will not work .
We are not yet powerful enough to win permanent solutions by ending the capitalist system forever , but we can make the political and economic costs of inaction unacceptable to our capitalist rulers .
To do this we can and must build mass democratic movements against the climate vandals .
Mass climate emergency movements in every country are the only force with the potential to force the politicians into effective action against greenhouse gas emissions .
That is the only way to win time for the Earth and humanity .
That is the most important task we now face .
On to Cochabamba
The most positive result of Copenhagen was the evidence that a mass democratic movement against climate change has already begun to grow .
The next step in building that movement will take place next month in Cochabamba , Bolivia , when thousands of activists from around the world meet , answering Evo Morales ’ call for a Peoples ’ World Conference on Climate Change and Mother Earth ’s Rights .
The meeting ’s ambitious goals include :
(1) To analyze the structural and systemic causes that drive climate change and to propose radical measures to ensure the well - being of all humanity in harmony with nature .
(2) To discuss and agree on the project of a Universal Declaration of Mother Earth Rights .
(3) To agree on proposals for new commitments … that will guide future actions in those countries that are engaged with life during climate change negotiations …
(4) To work on the organization of the Peoples ’ World Referendum on Climate Change .
(5) To analyze and develop an action plan to advance the establishment of a Climate Justice Tribunal .
(6) To define strategies for action and mobilization to defend life from Climate Change and to defend Mother Earth ’s Rights .
That ’s an ambitious but absolutely essential agenda .
I urge the parties represented here today , along with socialists and climate activists around the world , to endorse that project , to participate in it if possible , and to give its outcome the widest possible publicity and support .
The defeats and achievements in Copenhagen , combined with the Cochabamba conference , offer an historic opportunity and challenge for ecological activists to join hands with workers , with Indigenous activists , with anti-imperialist movements here and around the world , to make ecological transformation a central feature of the broader economic and social changes that are so clearly needed .
Together we can stop the climate vandals , together we can build a better world for future generations .
It wo n’t be easy , and it wo n’t be quick , but together we can make it happen .

After months of speculation , it appears Apple is finally going to deliver new MacBook Pro systems to customers .
The above screenshot shows part numbers that Microcenter has received for new Mac systems .
We 've since received independent confirmation from another source besides Microcenter that those part numbers are real , and that we should expect new 15 " and 17 " MacBook Pros very soon .
The image shows 4 different systems :
Apple System Good -USA $ 1799.99
Mac system # 1 Best - USA $ 2199.99
Mac system # 2 Best - USA $ 2299.99
Mac system Better - USA $ 1999.99
These seem to correspond with three 15 " MacBook Pros and a 17 " MacBook Pro ( $ 2299.99 ) .
The new machines are likely using Intel 's Core i7 and i5 mobile processors .
While previous rumors have pinpointed April 13th as the likely day , other reports we 've received are less certain of that date .
Regardless , we feel reasonably confident that the new MacBook Pros will come very soon .
Beware the ... pussycat !
Postmen boycott house because they are scared of 19 - year - old pet ' Tiger '
Postmen are refusing to deliver letters to a house because they are terrified of one of the residents - an elderly cat .
Ageing Tiger , who bears a striking resemblance to Postman Pat 's pet , is terrorising delivery men in Leeds to such an extent that they are now refusing to go anywhere near his cat flap
Royal Mail say the 19 - year - old black and white cat , who spends most of his day napping , has attacked three postmen in the past few weeks .
Terrifying for posties : 19 - year - old Tiger is fond of leaping through the catflap and chasing postmen down the garden path
Owner Tracy Brayshaw , of Farsley , Leeds , said the postmen have complained that Tiger stalks his cat flap waiting for them to deliver letters and is ready to pounce and chase them down the garden path .
Mrs Brayshaw , 43 , branded the move ' ridiculous ' and said she now has to trek to her local sorting office for her post because Tiger is deemed a health and safety risk .
She said : ' If Tiger climbs up a tree , he is done in for the rest of the week .
I find it really hard to believe .
' The post has been suspended for two weeks now .
It was funny at first but it is going a bit far now .
' This is an old age cat who gets dressed up as Santa each year - he would n't have the energy to attack postmen . '
Terrifying Tiger :
The 19 - year - old cat has been accused of attacking the local postmen
The pharmacy dispenser added : ' I do think they have been a bit unfair , they have taken health and safety too far - we do n't have a lion or a Rottweiler , this is a 19 - year - old cat .
' We 've had him since he was a kitten when he wandered in off the street .
He has never done anything like what they say he has done before . '
She added that , according to a letter from the Royal Mail , the neutered tomcat has attacked three different postmen on three different occasions , including chasing one down the garden path .
' When I went to the post office to collect my mail , the person behind the counter told me that Tiger had lacerated a postman 's arm but when I asked to see pictures of the wound they did n't have any , ' she said .
' They said he jumped up and slashed the postie 's arm through his jacket .
' I think this incident and the postman being chased down the path are meant to have happened quite recently and the third incident , of a postie getting his legs scratched , is meant to have happened last summer .
' Tiger 's back end is going as well , he has no more spring in his hocks - so I can't see how he could have jumped at a postie .
Our vet is amazed he is still alive .'
Mrs Brayshaw is hoping to appeal against the decision to suspend her post .
A spokeswoman from Royal Mail said : ' We are sorry for the inconvenience to Mrs Brayshaw and we want to resume delivery of mail to her address as quickly as possible .
' We 're trying to agree a way to do this and avoid our employees suffering further nasty injuries , as has happened three times already . '
PORT -AU - PRINCE , Haiti 
With graffiti and protests , from sweltering tents to air - conditioned offices , Haitians are desperately trying to get a message to their government and the world : enough with the status quo .
The simple phrase “ Aba Préval ” ( Down with Préval , a reference to Haiti ’s president , René Préval ) has become shorthand for a long list of frustrations , and an epithet expressing a broader fear  that Haitians will be stuck in limbo indefinitely , and that the opportunity to reinvent Haiti is being lost .
While few have given up entirely on the dream that a more efficient , more just Haiti might rise from the rubble , increasingly , hope is giving way to stalemate and bitterness .
“ Is this really it ? ” Haitians ask .
They complain that the politically connected are benefiting most from reconstruction work that has barely begun .
They shake their heads at crime ’s coming back , unproductive politicians and aid groups that are struggling with tarpaulin metropolises that look more permanent every day .
“ We ’re going to be in this position forever , ” said Patrick Moussignac , the owner of Radio Caraïbes , a popular station broadcasting from a tent downtown .
“ We could be living on the streets for 10 or 20 years . ”

Dell and HP have recently made very strong declarations of OS independence from Microsoft .
Take HP first .
With the buying of Palm for its webOS and the annoucement by HP that webOS would be used in not only its mobile phones [ displacing Microsoft Windows Mobile ] but also some of its tablets and notepads including the new Slate – this was tantamount to an open declaration of OS independence in the fastest growing IT sector mobile smartphones and smart connected devices .
Infoworld has all the buzz here .
At the sametime Dell has committed to the Android OS for both its Streak tablet and its lineup of new mobile phones .
In sum , both vendors a ) cant wait for Microsoft to get its mobile act together and b) the appeals of the customizing advantage of Android or self - owned webOS are too big to ignore .
For Microsoft , the executive blood is already on the wall .
For Apple , the critical mistakes are already being made .
For Google , there is a capacity to make big Goofles .
Yes , this is the official notice of the break up of the Windows monopoly .
One of the most played out things in comedy is when black comedian tells jokes about the differences between black people and white people .
Sometimes the joke starts ‘ White people be crazy ! ‘
And then they rant about something that WASPs do .
Other times the bit starts ‘ You know the difference between white people and black people ?
Black people do < insert everyday act > while white people do < insert everyday act >.’ ( for that , the funny part may go either or both ways ) .
The bit was even parodied by Homer Simpson , “ White people have names like Lenny and black people have names like Carl . ”
Regardless , most successful black comedians , at one time or another , start a joke one of those ways , all for our amusement .
Let ’s watch :

Canada Spending $ 1B on Security for G8/ G20 Summit in June
Amazing :
The Canadian government disclosed Tuesday that the total price tag to police the elite Group of Eight meeting in Muskoka , as well as the bigger - tent Group of 20 summit starting a day later in downtown Toronto , has already climbed to more than $ 833 - million .
It said it ’s preparing to spend up to $ 930 - million for the three days of meetings that start June 25 .
That price tag is more than 20 times the total reported cost for the April , 2009 , G20 summit in Britain , with the government estimating a cost of $ 30 - million , and seems much higher than security costs at previous summits ­ the Gleneagles G8 summit in Scotland , 2005 , was reported to have spent $ 110 - million on security , while the estimate for the 2008 G8 gathering in Japan was $ 381 - million .
These numbers are crazy .
There simply is n’t any justification for this kind of spending .
By comparison , the estimated total cost of security for the 17 - day 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver was just over $ 898 - million .
Think of all the actual security you can buy for that money .
EDITED TO ADD ( 6/12 ) : Two links detailing how the money was probably spent .
Pittsburgh ’s cost , less than a year before , was estimated at $ 18 million .
EDITED TO ADD ( 6/28 ) : The total seems to be $ 1.2B .
I have n’t found any breakdown of the spending that differentiates between operational costs and capital improvements .
If , for example , the Toronto police all got new radios out of this budget , those radios will continue to provide benefits for the city of Toronto long after the summit .
On the other hand , money spent on extra security guards for the week provides no ongoing benefit .
My best quote to the media : “ If it really costs this much to secure a meeting of the world ’s leaders , maybe they should try video conferencing . ”

HONG KONG —
While BP tries various short - term efforts to plug a leaking oil well in the Gulf of Mexico , the company is preparing to drill a relief well as a backup plan .
BP hopes to drill that well diagonally to intersect the original one below the seabed and then flood it with mud and concrete to stop the uncontrolled flow .
Although the idea sounds simple , the experience with a similar spill last year near Australia shows just how difficult it can be to execute the maneuver .
“ It ’s like finding a needle in a haystack , ” said Rachel Siewert , an Australian senator who is a member of the country ’s opposition Greens Party and is critical of the oil industry .
The Australian accident , known as the Montara spill , began Aug. 21 with a blowout of high - pressure oil similar to the one in the gulf .
With the well spewing 17,000 to 85,000 gallons per day , precious weeks passed before the relief wells were started .
When efforts got under way , the first four attempts — drilled on Oct. 6 , 13 , 17 and 24 — missed the original well .
Do you feel attacked for your religious beliefs ?
Do you consider popular views that people can be good without God as a direct hit on the moral system you treasure ?
Two scientists offer insight into why you might feel that way .
Our science blogger Dan Vergano highlights an opinion piece in the Journal of Cognitive Sciences in which Ilkka Pyysiainen of Finland 's University of Helsinki and Marc Hauser of Harvard look at the links between religion and morality and find
... no differences between religious and atheist answers to moral dilemmas .
So why are many people so affronted when atheists crow that religion is optional for a " good " society ?
The British Telegraph interview with Hauser adds a little more on that .
He says ,
It seems that in many cultures religious concepts and beliefs have become the standard way of conceptualizing moral intuitions .
Although , as we discuss in our paper , this link is not a necessary one , many people have become so accustomed to using it , that criticism targeted at religion is experienced as a fundamental threat to our moral existence .
Do you equate attacks on religion -- such as popular atheists Richard Dawkins , Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens do almost as sport -- as an attack on morality itself ?
What about people who simply think faith is optional , not essential ?
As of August 6 , minimal oil was reported on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico .
The beginnings of all ancient and modern religions have a common thread : one or two people have a revelation and persuade others to follow .
Thus , for example , Buddhist writings tell us that Prince Siddhartha Gautama launched Buddhism after his solitary ascendance through the eight stages of Transic insight ; Islamic texts tell us that Muhammad founded Islam following the first of many personal , prophetic experiences ; Christian writings reveal that Paul first met Jesus , converted to Christianity , and spread the faith more than three decades after Jesus ’ death ; Joseph Smith , Jr. , and his partner , Oliver Cowdery , launched the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( the Mormon church ) after the two men were visited by angels and long - dead disciples of Jesus ; and Sun Myung Moon launched the Unification Church after privately receiving direct orders to do so from Jesus himself .
The beginnings of Children of God , Christian Science , Eckankar , Elan Vital , I AM , and Theosophy — in fact , the beginnings of all world religions — are equally unverifiable .
Never does a large , clearly identifiable group of people experience prophecy and live to tell others about it .
Moreover , in a handful of cases wherein large groups of people supposedly witnessed miracles , rarely are these witnesses named or identified in any way that would allow for verification ; and in the very exceptional cases involving clearly identified groups of witnesses , never more than one or two of the religion ’s current adherents claim to have met or descended directly from the named witnesses .
In all these cases , the religion ’s credibility rests on the credibility of its one or two founders .
While it is certainly possible that the beginnings claimed by any of the thousands of sects and cults included in the world ’s more than three hundred major religious traditions could be true , it is easy to imagine how charismatic charlatans could have launched any of these movements .
The one known exception to this rule is Judaism .
The Torah claims that every Jewish man , woman , and child alive in 1312 B.C.E. — about three million people , according to the Torah — heard God speak at Mount Sinai and survived to teach their descendants about the event .
Here we have an easily identifiable group — all of Jewry — who could have verified or denied the story any time during the first two or three generations after the alleged mass prophecy transpired .
While it is easy to imagine how most religious mythologies could have been fabricated and spread , understanding how Judaism could be a lie requires more extensive analysis .
Smart Lies and Foolish Lies
Anyone who has studied history will affirm that people are gullible .
We consistently find that sufficiently charismatic leaders can persuade people of any lie , even a lie that obligates followers to engage in painful or self - destructive behavior , as long as followers cannot check the lie .
Lies that cannot be checked or validated are “ smart ” lies , insofar as they are maximally seductive .
However , claims that can be checked , “ foolish ” lies , tend to be tested and rejected , especially when the lie obligates followers in unpleasant or suicidal observances .
As an illustration of this principle , consider the case of the California cult known as Heaven ’s Gate .
The group , led by Marshall Applewhite , included seventeen men and twenty - one women between the ages of eighteen and seventy - two .
Applewhite taught his followers that he was an alien who first “ moved into and took over ” Jesus ’ body just prior to Christianity ’s founding , and that he again in 1970 “ incarnated into ” his current human body .
In March 1998 , Applewhite revealed to his followers a prophecy indicating that an approaching spaceship tailing the Hale Bopp comet was coming to pick up members of Heaven ’s Gate , but that they would have to take lethal doses of phenobarbital in order to join him aboard the alien craft .
On video , members of the group affirmed their faith in Applewhite ’s vision and then commenced committing suicide .
Significantly , Applewhite did not tell his followers that “ the spaceship that dropped you ( or your grandparents ) here on Earth is coming to pick you up . ”
This would be a foolish lie .
Applewhite , like all successful religious leaders , told smart lies — lies that could n’t be checked .
Moses Theory and Fred Theory
The claim that three million people heard God speak appears in every intact Torah scroll ever found .
The claim is either true or false .
If it is a lie , and no such revelation ever took place , at some time in the past someone must have made such a claim .
If we contemplate what the scene must have looked like when a false claim of national prophecy was first launched , we find ourselves locked into one of two scenarios :
The person making the claim either told his followers ( a ) that the national prophecy happened in the present —
“ You personally heard God speak ” — or ( b ) that the national prophecy happened in the past — “ Your ancestors once heard God speak . ”
We might call the first theory “ Moses Theory , ” since the Torah records that “ Moses ” was the name of Jewry ’s leader when the prophecy took place .
We can call the second possibility “ Fred Theory , ” since the leader during this post - Sinaitic period need not be Moses — he might as well be Fred .
According to Moses
Theory , ancient Jewry ’s leader told a foolish lie : “ You personally heard God speak , and He said these words : ‘ I am the Lord your God. . . .’ ” We can imagine the scene as people first examined the supposedly divine Torah and their charismatic leader tried to explain to Jewry some of the text ’s more unpleasant rituals : “ Circumcision ?
Yes , use a very sharp knife and a quick downward motion . . . and it was the God Whom you heard speak
Who told me you should do this ! ”
People would probably know if they had heard God speak ; and if they had n’t heard God speak , they might be a little hesitant to accept the Torah ’s validity .
Because people wo n’t accept foolish ( checkable ) lies that demand self - destructive behavior , even critics who posit that the Torah is a fictional , man -made document reject Moses Theory .
Those who view the Torah as a work of human imagination therefore put their faith in Fred .
They posit that the initial lie was : “ God spoke not to you but to your ancestors .
He gave them the Torah .
They carried the Jewish tradition for a period but then fumbled , and it was forgotten .
Now I , Fred , am returning to you your long - lost religious heritage . ”
When would Fred claim the national prophecy took place ?
If he said it happened recently — to his followers ’ parents , grandparents , or great - grandparents — the lie would be checked , discovered , and rejected .
Therefore , Fred must claim the national prophecy took place during “ ancient times , ” five hundred or a thousand years earlier .
This is a smart lie insofar as it ca n’t be checked .
Followers would understand why they have no memory of a tradition supposedly lost hundreds or thousands of years before .
However , followers would reasonably wonder how Fred himself recalls this otherwise forgotten tradition .
Fred could explain things , again with a smart ( uncheckable ) lie , claiming that God spoke to him alone and revealed the Torah ’s long - lost text and the story of its original revelation at Mount Sinai .
Indeed , most modern skeptics gravitate toward a theory like this .
A major problem with this theory is we ’ve never heard of Fred or his heroic resurrection of Judaism .
Certainly one of the most significant events in Jewish history would have been the fumble , when world Jewry forgot they were the three million prophets , and the recovery , when Fred reminded the Jews about the national prophecy at Mount Sinai .
Yet in an otherwise comprehensive Jewish history we find no mention of such a claim .
Jewish texts describe myriad historical crises and the heroes who assisted during these difficult times .
We know that Moses brought the Torah down from Mount Sinai , Joshua first brought the Jews into the Land of Israel , David slew Goliath , Solomon built the Temple in Jerusalem , and Ezra brought the Jews back to the Land of Israel after the Babylonian exile .
We know that Rabbi Judah the Prince compiled the Mishnah and that Ravina and Rav Ashi compiled the Talmud .
We know about Maimonides , Nachmonides , and hundreds of other stars of medieval Jewry and what their respective contributions were .
We possess detailed records about every great Jewish personality , except for one .
We do n’t have any mention of the man who reminded Jewry that they were the only people in human history ever to experience national prophecy , and we do n’t have any record of the amnesia Fred rescued them from .
Until two hundred years ago ( with the founding of the Reform movement ) , every Jew and member of a Jewish breakaway group ( like the Christians , Sadducees , and Karaites ) affirmed that ancient Jewry , their direct ancestors , had experienced national prophecy at Mount Sinai .
Indeed , virtually every Jew alive today can trace himself back to Orthodox relatives ( usually within five generations ) who believed with all their heart and soul that they were links in an unbroken genealogical chain going back to Sinai .
Yet not a single ancient or contemporary individual or religious community has any tradition about the man who should have been the second greatest hero of Jewish history : Fred .
Why ?
Calm , unbiased observers will be quick to admit that perhaps there never was a “ Fred ” who lied about a national revelation ; perhaps something supernatural really transpired at Sinai .
( Occasionally people try to pin the title “ Fred ” on minor players like Hilkeyahu , Shafan , or Yoshiyahu .
At best , such attempts are forced and ask the reader to interpret texts with crowbar and mallet in hand .
They also require shamefully contrived rationalizations attempting to explain ( a ) why not one Biblical verse explicitly mentions the key point that the Jews forgot about the Torah and “ Fred ” reintroduced them to it , and ( b ) why the name of the second most important Jewish hero ( next to Moses ) appears in the Bible less often than the names “ Pharaoh , ” “ Yeravam , ” and “ Haman . ” )
Science , History , and the Probability Paradox
The ultimate attack on both Moses and Fred Theories sprouts from the work of physicists and historians .
Physicists believe that the laws of nature are constant and can be depended upon , and that therefore natural events will reoccur .
Indeed , when faced with a phenomenon that cannot be naturally duplicated , scientists and historians doubt it ever transpired naturally in the first place .
As an illustration , imagine someone exhibited a brick of solid gold and claimed that it was once wood , but that he had used a natural chemical process to convert the wood into gold .
Imagine further that twenty thousand chemists were handed a description of the process supposedly used , but that in fifty years of trials not a single experimenter succeeded in duplicating the effect .
What would the scholarly community conclude ?
Precisely because we believe that natural events will happen more than once , we would deduce either that wood never really became gold , or , if the phenomenon really took place , that it transpired supernaturally .
The axiom that natural events reoccur is translated by historians into the principle “ History repeats itself . ”
Since history is the story of natural creatures interacting according to natural laws , we expect and do find the same sort of human experiences and responses happening over and over again .
Hence religions throughout history and across the globe have produced a strikingly limited set of claims of how they began : individual founders of religion have interacted with the gods , sun , moon , stars , oceans , trees , animals ; individuals claim to have been visited by the dead or by aliens from outer space ; and individuals claim to be incarnations of divinity .
Although the details of theology vary , all of the general claims about how the world ’s religions began fit neatly into a handful of general categories .
There is only one categorically unique claim in mankind ’s religious history : only the Torah claims that a large , easily identifiable group heard God speak and survived to tell about it .
The Torah is aware of its uniqueness and unabashedly offers this challenge to every Jew who has lived since Sinai :
You might inquire about times long past , going back to the time God created man on earth [ exploring ] one end of the heavens to the other .
See if anything as great as this has ever happened , or if the like has ever been heard .
Has any nation ever heard God speaking out of fire , as you have , and still survived ?
( Deuteronomy 4:32–33 )
Crucially , the Torah ’s claim about national revelation is n’t esoteric .
If a religion claimed to have started when a centipede metamorphosed into a gorilla who , falling into a river , exploded in flame and disintegrated into ashes before rising in the form of a great human prophet , we would understand why such a claim might never be repeated .
It is unlikely that two people would independently dream up identical stories with such intricate and nonintuitive details .
Yet the Jewish claim is obvious and simple : God spoke to a group of people .
This is the sort of claim that would occur to anyone .
Moreover , the claim of mass revelation was needed by other religions .
Because Jews believed that millions of people — all of their ancestors — received the Torah directly from God , they were hesitant to accept just Jesus or Muhammad ’s word that the Torah had been annulled .
If God changed His mind , Jewry reasoned , why did n’t He let us or any other large group of people know ?
Furthermore , intelligent pagans might have wondered why , if God really intended to reveal an equally acceptable alternative to Judaism , He did n’t do it in front of a few million non-Jews .
By hesitating to claim a mass prophecy , early Christians and Muslims thus lost an opportunity to raise their credibility , even in the gentile world .
Skeptics who would construct apparently reasonable scenarios explaining Judaism ’s beginning are thus faced with a paradox : as they become more convinced of any scenario ’s plausibility , they become increasingly incapable of explaining why no other group seized the obvious , simple , and valuable claim of national prophecy .
Maybe one generation of Jews was unusually wily and succeeded in forming and maintaining a national conspiracy .
Maybe one generation of Jews were exceedingly gullible and incorporated the whole story without checking their older relatives .
Maybe the Jews were developmentally disabled or on a massive drug trip .
Maybe thunder sounded like “ I am the Lord , thy God. . . . ”
Whatever scenario we formulate , we face the challenge : if it ’s natural for an entire people to think they or their ancestors heard God speak , why did n’t it happen more than once in history ?
Just as thousands of failed trials would persuade us that wood cannot naturally be transformed into gold , so too the total absence from history of the most basic religious claim — national revelation — should tell us that people do n’t naturally come to the conclusion that they or their ancestors experienced prophecy .
We understand the beginnings of Buddhism , Christianity , Islam , and modern cults .
We can envision how such faiths started .
But how do we explain Judaism ’s genesis ?
What rational , natural explanation describes the events leading to the only claim of mass revelation in four thousand years of recorded human history ?
The proposition that God indeed spoke to the Jewish nation seems at least as probable as the alternatives .

LISBON , Portugal , May 17 ( UPI ) -- Caffeine may slow Alzheimer 's disease and other dementias , researchers in Portugal said .
Alexandre de Mendonca of the University of Lisbon and Rodrigo Cunha of the University of Coimbra , both in Portugal , assembled a group of international experts to explore the effects of caffeine on the brain from multiple perspectives .

The collection of epidemiological and other studies corroborated by meta- analysis have been published as a special supplement in the Journal of Alzheimer 's Disease .
" A few epidemiological studies showed that the consumption of moderate amounts of caffeine was inversely associated with the cognitive decline associated with aging as well as the incidence of Alzheimer 's disease , " Mendonca and Cunha said in a statement .
" This was paralleled by animal studies showing that chronic caffeine administration prevented memory deterioration and neurodegeneration in animal models of aging and of Alzheimer 's disease . "
Mendonca and Cunha have observed one of the most prevalent complications of Alzheimer 's disease is mood change -- especially depression -- and they suggest caffeine might be a mood normalizer .
' Killer games ' are making you smarter
Our findings support the idea that playing FPS games promotes cognitive flexibility .
[...] videogame experience enhances cognitive flexibility in general
A study published three days ago by the faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences of the Leiden University ( Colzato et al. ) found that ' Killer Games ' , what our politicans call First Person Shooters are making you more intelligent .
It 's quite interesting to read , it seems that you are training a lot of abilities of your brain by planning strategies and reacting to fast events in these games .
Nice read , the PDF is available as well .

Images spanning 130 years show non-effects of sea level rise
By Steve Goddard
Above , imaginary alarmist imagery : London Drowning from the BBC
One of my favorite CAGW climochondrias is worry about sea level .
From Wikipedia :
Hypochondriasis ( or hypochondria , often referred to as health phobia or health anxiety ) refers to an excessive preoccupation or worry about having a serious illness .
Often , hypochondria persists even after a physician has evaluated a person and reassured them that their concerns about symptoms do not have an underlying medical basis or , if there is a medical illness , the concerns are far in excess of what is appropriate for the level of disease .
From National Geographic :
Warming to Cause Catastrophic Rise in Sea Level ?
Stefan Lovgren for National Geographic News Updated April 26 , 2004
Most scientists agree that global warming presents the greatest threat to the environment .
There is little doubt that the Earth is heating up .
From the melting of the ice cap on Mount Kilimanjaro , Africa ’s tallest peak , to the loss of coral reefs as oceans become warmer , the effects of global warming are often clear .
However , the biggest danger , many experts warn , is that global warming will cause sea levels to rise dramatically .
The esteemed Dr. Hansen has made the threat clear :
a study led by James Hansen , the head of the climate science program at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York and a professor at Columbia University , suggests that current estimates for how high the seas could rise are way off the mark – and that in the next 100 years melting ice could sink cities in the United States to Bangladesh .
That sounds serious .
New Year ’s Eve in Manhattan could be rough if Times Square was underwater .
But I keep thinking that if sea level was rising significantly , some of the billions of people who live along the coasts might have noticed ?
My favorite snorkeling beach in California is The Cove in La Jolla .
I first went there around 1960 , when Raquel Welch ( Tejada at the time ) was named Homecoming Queen at La Jolla High School .
I went snorkeling there again last summer .
The beach is still there and has n’t changed .
Below is a photo of The Cove from 1871 .

And a recent photo :

And here is the animation with the two images matched to scale and overlaid :

A lot of erosion has occurred over the last 130 years .
In the blink animation above ( click on the image to see animation ) note that the rock under the three people standing on the right in the 1871 image is gone , and has formed a small island of boulders with three people sitting on it in the recent image .
There is no evidence that sea level has risen .
A few Palm Trees have been planted , but the sea appears to be in exactly the same place it was 130 years ago .
In fact the rocks on the upper right are higher above the water now than in the earlier picture ( high tide . )
There is no glacial rebound in San Diego , and the faults in the region are strike - slip ( horizontal ) faults .

Excuses , excuses .
The Catholic Church seems to have a bag full of 'em .
Especially when it comes to their outed struggle with paedophilia .
Take Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone , the Vatican Secretary of State , who publicly stated on a visit to Chile that " Many psychologists and psychiatrists have demonstrated that there is no relationship between celibacy and paedophilia .
But many others have demonstrated , I have been told recently , that there is a relationship between homosexuality and paedophilia .
That is true .
That is the problem . "
That is NOT true , and that is NOT the problem .
Instead , what is , is the fact that children all over the world are being touched by old , wrinkly men who are n't practicing what they ( literally ) preach .
It 's not like it 's just a recent problem or like recent psychology has anything to do with it .
Paedophilia is a psychological disorder that is completely independent of being homosexual .
Oh and also , throughout the history of Catholicism there have been :
- 12 sexually active Popes .
- Out of these , 5 of them either fathered illegitimate children , had romantic affairs or were killed by jealous husbands .
- Out of the 12 , 4 of them had some kind of homosexual relationship during their pontificate .
Pregnant women need them for their babies ’ brains .
Kids need them to learn .
Adults get healthier hearts from them .
The do - it - all nutrients known as omega - 3 fatty acids appear to reduce pain in people with rheumatoid arthritis — and may help treat autism , bipolar disorder , depression , Alzheimer ’s disease , ADHD and prostate cancer .
Even dogs and cats need omega - 3s to stay healthy .
So eat more fish .
Take fish oil pills ( or their vegetarian counterparts ) .
Start buying fortified foods .
However you do it , you — like most Americans — could likely benefit from getting more omega - 3 fatty acids , specifically DHA and EPA .
“ There ’s very strong , medical - nutrition , literature - based evidence in humans suggesting that the average American would probably have a healthier life , a lower risk of dying from heart disease and improved brain function by consuming more fish , more supplements or more functional foods with DHA and EPA , ” says nutritional scientist Bruce Holub , of the University of Guelph in Ontario and executive director of the DHA / EPA Omega - 3 Institute there .
But keep in mind , omega - 3 fatty acids are not just a single nutrient .
The term refers to a family of compounds that are naturally abundant in fish , seafood and algae , and it ’s their surprising chemical variety that may hold the key to improving our health .
Increasing evidence suggests that each type of omega - 3 plays a different role .
The benefits depend on the amount , one ’s life stage and specific medical conditions .
Such complexity is something that guidelines , at least in the United States , do n’t yet reflect .
Researchers are still trying to clarify the details , but some health experts already are pushing for clearer recommendations that will help people reap the benefits of omega - 3s without wasting money on useless varieties .
“ There are strong indications that requirements for many groups should be higher and that there should be specific requirements for different types of omega - 3s , ” says Bruce A. Watkins , professor of food science at Purdue University in West Lafayette , Ind. , and director of the International Omega - 3 Learning and Education Consortium for Health and Medicine , an educational resource .
The various types
Omega - 3 fatty acids are long chains of carbon atoms that bond to each other in different ways to produce molecules with various functions .
Out of the five forms that we consume , the three that matter most to human health are alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA ) , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) and eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) .
Of those three , ALA is the only form that is specified in the United States ’ official guidelines with a dietary reference intake .
According to the Institute of Medicine , men should consume 1.6 grams of the fatty acid a day .
Women should get 1.1 grams .
Most Americans easily consume that much .
Sources include flax , canola oil , soybean oil , olive oil , walnuts and other plant - based fats , many of which people eat every day .
There are 1.3 grams of ALA in a tablespoon of canola oil and 7.6 grams in a tablespoon of flaxseed oil .
The problem is that , on its own , ALA has no known function in the body .
The only reason it ’s required , Holub says , is because the human body can convert a small amount of ALA to DHA and EPA , which are far more essential for healthy brains , hearts and other bodily functions .
The amount that gets converted , however , is not nearly enough .
Accumulating evidence now suggests that it is far more important to consume DHA and EPA directly — in amounts ranging from 200 milligrams to 4 grams a day , depending on the person .
Salmon , herring , sardines and other oily varieties of fish have large amounts .
Seafood , algae and meat have lesser amounts .
Although flaxseed does n’t appear to convey the benefits of fish oil , some algae contain omega - 3s that are just as potent as those in fish .
Further , fortified products contain omega - 3s derived from the aquatic plants .
The health effects
Interest in fish - based omega - 3s spiked in the 1970s , when scientists observed that Inuit people of Greenland ate tons of fatty fish but had extremely low rates of heart disease .
Decades later , in a landmark study published in 1999 , Italian scientists studied more than 11,000 men who had suffered heart attacks .
After 3 - 1/ 2 years , a group that took about a gram a day of EPA and DHA were 20 % less likely to die than a group that did n’t take omega - 3 supplements .
In an even larger trial in 2007 , Japanese researchers followed more than 18,000 people with high cholesterol for nearly five years and found that those who took 1.8 grams of EPA a day — in addition to cholesterol - lowering medications known as statins — were almost 20 % less likely to suffer a major coronary event than people who took statins alone .
Those trials build on hundreds of smaller , more focused studies that clearly link EPA and DHA with heart health .
( EPA and DHA are usually measured , and taken , together . )
For example , Holub says , studies show that for every extra gram of EPA and DHA a person takes per day , triglyceride levels drop by 8 % , with benefits showing up in just two weeks .
High triglyceride levels are a major risk factor for heart disease in Americans older than 35 .
Taking 2 to 4 grams of EPA and DHA a day for a couple of weeks could reduce levels in the blood by up to 32 % in people with high triglyceride levels .
While EPA and DHA are both essential for heart health — they seem to lower blood pressure , reduce fat levels in the blood , slow the development of clots and avert abnormal heart rhythms , among other things — DHA is the star player in the developing brain and eyes .
Studies show that women who eat at least four servings of fish a week or take supplements of up to 1.1 grams of DHA daily while pregnant have kids with higher IQ scores through age 4 .
Their babies have lower rates of allergies , better sleep patterns and better vision .
DHA - fortified moms also have lower rates of postpartum depression .
How they work
Scientists have yet to work out many of the details about how omega - 3s work their magic , but inflammation is probably one clue , at least for some conditions .
That would explain why high doses of DHA and EPA on top of more traditional medicines can reduce morning stiffness and joint pain in arthritis patients and can help reduce the amount of pain medication people need to take .
Brain - based disorders are another area of interest .
Some studies have found lower blood levels of omega - 3s in adults with Alzheimer ’s and kids with ADHD than in comparable groups without those problems .
“ All of these pathologies are about things that have to do with cells misbehaving , ” says Philip Calder , a nutritionist and omega - 3 researcher at the University of Southampton in England .
“ You can make cells behave more optimally by having enough omega - 3 fatty acids .
Then tissues behave properly , and you do n’t have these manifestations of disease . ”
To some extent , consumers are catching on .
In a recent survey of more than 6,000 people who already take supplements , 74 % took fish oil or other types of omega - 3 supplements last year , making them more popular than multivitamins , found ConsumerLab.com , an independent health - products testing company .
And in 2009 , sales of products enriched with omega - 3s , omega - 6s and omega - 9s jumped by 42 % compared with 2008 , according to market research firm Nielsen .
Looking ahead
To date , however , most Americans do n’t appear to be getting nearly enough omega -3s .
Americans consume fish an average of only once every 10 days , Holub says , and 50 % do n’t consume fish over a seven - day period .
Supplements , meanwhile , are not a universal dietary staple .
As a result , he points out , the average intake of DHA and EPA in the U.S. is an eighth of what people normally get in Japan and a quarter of what many experts now think we need .
Food labels are n’t especially helpful .
The packaging on a box of granola bars or loaf of bread might tout omega - 3s even though they contain a form that does n’t do much in the body or their concentrations of nutrients might be too small to make a difference .
And even when detailed information is available , it ’s not always clear how much a given individual should get .
Regardless , consumption needs to rise , nutrition experts say .
“ Why have societies consumed fish for so many centuries ? ” Watkins says .
“ I think we ’re just beginning to understand the benefits . ”

Yesterday , the Pirate Bay went down following pressure from the RIAA , which threatened to slap TPB 's hosting provider with huge fines .
We predicted The Pirate Bay 's downfall ages ago , but it still has n't happened .
Things have been looking grim for the file - sharing service for a while .
First , there was the lawsuit from the entertainment industry that left the Pirate Bay 's team scattered and struggling to stay the course it charted for itself .
Then the news that the entire service was to be sold ( the sale never happened ) to a Swedish Gaming Company seemed to have scattered the Pirate Bay 's fans , too .
All these storms have come and gone and the service still stands , seemingly more resilient than ever .
The Pirate Bay has switched hosts and is online again .
This time the site is hosted by the Swedish Pirate Party .
“ We got tired of Hollywood ’s cat and mouse game with the Pirate Bay so we decided to offer the site bandwidth .
It is time to take the bull by the horns and stand up for what we believe is a legitimate activity , ” said the Pirate Party 's Rick Falkvinge in a statement .
TPB itself was , as usual , in the mood for mocking the RIAA .
Here 's the entire text of today 's message from The Pirate Bay 's blog :
" PLZ LEARN : TPB CANT BE SHUT DOWN LOL !
AS U MITE HAS READ OR NOTICD , PEEPS ONCE AGAIN R TRYIN 2 SHUT US DOWN .

REMEMBR DAT , K THX .
TPB , ONLY IN IT 4 TEH LULZ SINCE 2003 "
We 'll leave it up to you to decipher the hidden message .
Have you ever read a book that is being written while you read it ?
In ancient times when men were real men , women were real women , furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real furry creatures from Alpha and only the boldest dared to dream about 2D games whole new style of games has emerged - massive multiplayer in first crude form - telnet games .
They have brought new elements - communication and cooperation ( as well as new cool ways of wreaking havoc ) .
Comparing to classic adventures there is no game ending - player can explore the world , steal from other players , help newbies or just go troll hunting .
Player controls avatar in virtual world with simple text commands - such as " go north " , " go south " or " kill troll " and the world is being described in the same way .
Avatar has to face many dangers - such as hunger , thirst , trolls * and other players .
MUD themes varies from Napoleon wars to Star Wars .
They also have different core engine that participates on gaming experience - most namely DIKU or Circle MUD .
Interesting fact - MUDs are very much alive even today despite nowadays fancy 3D MMORPG - that is a big victory for human fantasy ( perhaps also for the fact that you can open window with text even in work or school ) .
So if you 're interested in trying one - try my favourite www.aardwolf.com

The African savanna has a cornucopia of majestic creatures — lions , elephants and giraffes among them .
But behind the scenes , it is the tiny termite that fuels much of this diversity , a new study reports .
Researchers studying termites in Kenya ’s central highlands found that the abundance of flora and fauna is markedly higher atop termite mounds .
“ We noticed these circular green patches , ” said Todd Palmer , a co-author of the study and a professor of biology at the University of Florida .
“ They had a lot of vegetation and plant material on top of them , and the grass was greener than in other areas . ”

The patches were 30 feet in diameter and spaced several hundred feet apart .
Dr. Palmer and his colleagues did some digging , and underneath each patch they found millions of termites in subterranean mounds .
Quantitatively , they found that plants grow about 60 percent larger on the patches compared with other areas .
The nitrogen content of the plants on the mound is about 20 percent higher , and trees on mounds bear 120 percent more fruit .
Animal populations also dropped off significantly the farther they were located from a patch .
Of the three social media platforms studied , news - oriented blogs share the most similarities with the mainstream press .
Bloggers almost always link to legacy outlets for their information , and politics , government and foreign events garnered the greatest traction .
There are , however , also some clear differences .
While the biggest topic areas overlap , there was considerable divergence in the specific news events that garnered attention .
In less than one third of the weeks did the blogosphere and traditional press share the same top story .
Bloggers tend to gravitate toward events that affect personal rights and cultural norms – issues like same - sex marriage , the rationing of health care or privacy settings on Facebook , while traditional media news agendas are more event - driven and institutional .
And a strong sense of purpose often accompanies the links in blogs and social networking media .
In many cases , it is voicing strongly held and often divisive opinions .
After the botched terror attack on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 on Christmas Day , for instance , a number of conservative bloggers immediately blamed Obama , while others claimed that the fear of terrorism had become larger and more irrational than it should be .
In others , the function was more to share personal connections to events or to take action .
“ I ’m not one to buy into mass hysteria , but I am AFRAID of this swine flu , ” admitted blogger mooneyshine the week that the H1N1 virus threatened to become a global pandemic .
“ I ai n’t landing in the hospital with no pig virus .
Suddenly Piglet is not so cute anymore . ”
Alongside these more heated discussions , bloggers also enjoy sharing and commenting on unusual or off - beat findings and events buried deep in other media coverage .
Topics
In the broadest sense , the top news agenda in the blogosphere coincides with that of the traditional press ; politics and foreign events are the topic areas linked to most often .
The next most popular subject areas , however , tend to differ ; science stories – often off - beat findings – were the No. 3 subject area in blogs and social media pages , followed by technology related news .
( Those topics are much less popular in the traditional press ) .
In 2009 , bloggers , like the mainstream media , were caught up in assessing the first year of the Obama administration .
Fully 17 % of the top five stories each week related to U.S. politics and government affairs , particularly the new president .
This is similar to the level of attention in the mainstream press ( 15 % of the newshole during that same period , according to PEJ ’s News Coverage Index ) .
The discussion accompanying the links in the blogosphere is quite different , however .
Partisanship is strong , but unlike talk radio , the conversation here tends to draw a fairly even mix of conservative and liberal voices .
The Tea Party protests , Sarah Palin and Obama ’s poll numbers , for example , all drew a wide mix of conservative and liberal commentary .
In February , as Congress debated the economic stimulus package , for instance , bloggers clashed over the list of programs included in the bill .
Conservative bloggers scorched the bill as being full of wasteful programs that lacked any economic benefits .
“ Take a look at some of the absolute garbage the Democrats are filling this bill with , ” the conservative blog East Coast Mark charged .
“ Everything on the Republican list of ‘ wasteful projects ’ is stimulative , ” countered Gregg Carlstrom on Fedline .
“ $ 88 million for a new Coast Guard icebreaker ?
Someone is getting paid to build the ship . ”
Often bloggers make the issues and events highly personal .
Linking to an interactive feature on the New York Times website that compared every presidential inaugural address since 1789 , Elisha Blaha shared , “ This is what I will tell my kids … I will tell them that I clapped my hands and stood on the couch as President Obama walked out on to the stage to cheers .
I will tell them that I was gitty with excitement and so proud of the confident man who now represents my country . ” [ 1 ]
The second - biggest subject on blogs in the year was foreign events .
Fully 12 % of the top stories in blogs dealt with international events ranging from the protests in Iran to a vote on the number one song on the Christmas British pop charts .
Access on the Web to overseas news outlets like to the BBC and the Guardian as well as prominent British bloggers buoys this tendency .
As with much of the domestic news agenda , many of the foreign event stories that inspired blogger interest received far less attention in the traditional American press , even if the stories linked to were originally found there .
A comment by a judge in Saudi Arabia that it was acceptable for husbands to slap wives who spend too lavishly , for example , was the second - biggest story one week in May , drawing large amounts of criticism in the blogosphere .
It received almost no attention in the mainstream press .
" Is n’t it ironic that a woman can be punished for spending too much money on a garment that they are forced to wear to authenticate their status as secondary citizens in a patriarchal society , " remarked Womanist Musings .
Other popular topics often took on a less serious , or at least less divisive , tenor .
Science ( at 10 % of the top stories ) was the third - largest topic on blogs and social media pages .
That compares with just 1 % of the newshole in the mainstream press , the No. 23 subject .
Much of the interest here was in off - beat scientific findings , such as the research at the University of Sussex that showed cats have learned to manipulate their owners ’ emotions by emitting a specific kind of purr , the discovery of a new kind of large rat in Papa New Guinea , news that a chemical found in blue M&Ms might have therapeutic qualities , and the discovery of a meat - eating plant in the Philippines .
Technology ( 8 % ) was less of a draw in blogs and social media than on Twitter ( where it accounted for 43 % of all links ) , but it still outpaced the mainstream press ( 1 % ) .
The technology stories that attracted the most attention were often those about problems or dangers .
News about an email phishing scam that compromised at least 30,000 email passwords around the world , for example , accounted for 45 % of the links one week in October as bloggers spread warnings about how to prevent becoming a victim .
There was often a personal tone here , suggesting a sense of highly engaged citizens talking to each other .
" It obviously bears repeating ; NEVER give out your username and / or password to anyone .
Ever .
Not by phone , email , snail mail or in person , " warned the Enertiahost Blog .
" Legitimate companies will never solicit you for your personal information . . . ”
Sprinkled in were stories of general technical interest :
The unveiling of new gadgets such as a new version of the Kindle , an interview with the founders of Twitter , and the experiences of a 13 - year - old British boy who used an old - fashioned Sony Walkman for a week to help mark the 30th anniversary of portable music technology , for instance , are examples of the kind of stories that attracted significant attention .
Bloggers also showed a propensity to want to pay respect to celebrity figures that passed away , and in many cases these were lesser - known celebrities such as TV pitchman Billy Mays and comedian Dom DeLuise .
Most of the time , the attention to celebrity deaths was intense and fleeting .
Of the 17 times ( 7 % of all stories ) that a celebrity - focused story made the top five stories for blogs in a specific week , 12 of them ( 71 % ) involved a death .
And that does not include the two additional weeks where new information following the death of pop icon Michael Jackson earned one of the top spots .
The environment ( 4 % ) , and most specifically the issue of global warming , was also a topic of conversation more often in the blogosphere and in social media pages than in the mainstream press ( 2 % ) .
The passion here was strong enough that stories about global warming made the roster of top five stories in eight different weeks .
Much of this attention was on the so - called “ climate - gate ” scandal that took the blogosphere by storm in December after hacked emails from a British research unit raised the possibility of climate data manipulation .
This discussion was led by voices like that of Teófilo de Jesús at Vivificat who call the science behind global warming “ a fallacy . ”
Bloggers also demonstrated over the year a tendency to weigh in heavily on stories involving changes in society , ranging from the relatively trivial to hot - button cultural issues .
These linked - to stories cut across topic areas with an emphasis on adding their voices to conversations that might otherwise be outside their purview .
Social media circles strongly rejected revised privacy settings on Facebook , for instance , campaigned against changes to the design of Tropicana ’s orange juice container and objected to content fees for streaming music online .
On five separate occasions ( 2 % of the top stories ) , bloggers repeatedly voiced strong support for the right to gay marriage .
Those conversations were often spurred by state legislation or proposals that received minimum attention in the national press .
Sources
Despite the unconventional agenda of bloggers , traditional media still provides the vast majority of their information .
More than 99 % of the stories linked to came from legacy outlets like newspapers and broadcast networks .
American legacy outlets made up 75 % of all items . [ 2 ]
Web - only sites , on the other hand , made up less than 1 % of the links in the blogosphere .
BBC News led the list of individual sources , constituting 23 % of the links studied .
The next three largest sites were the traditional American media outlets of CNN.com ( 21 % ) , the New York Times ( 20 % ) , and the Washington Post ( 16 % ) .
Just one other news site based outside of the U.S. , The Guardian , received even 1 % of the links .
Bloggers also tended to refer to different outlets for different topics .
Newspapers were frequently the sources for stories about politics and government .
Fully 44 % of the stories linked to from USA Today were on those topics , 34 % for the Los Angeles Times , 28 % for the Washington Post and 19 % for the New York Times .
The New York Times was more often linked to for business and economics news ( 28 % of its links ) .
Another 10 % related to technology , while two other popular newspapers , the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times , had no technology - focused stories in their mix .
CNN.com was a source for international news ( 13 % ) , health news ( 10 % ) and crime news ( 10 % ) , while only 7 % of CNN ’s stories were focused on politics or government .
For celebrity news , the New York Post , the tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch , was a major source , as 17 % of the links directed toward its stories were on that subject – more than any other outlet .
And Fox News was the sole source for domestic defense and military news links , accounting 11 % of all Fox News links and 100 % of all U.S. defense stories .
For the most part , bloggers linked to news accounts rather than editorials or op - eds .
Fully 87 % of the stories linked to were straight news accounts , compared with only 13 % that were opinion columns .
Most of the opinion columns came from the Washington Post ( 28 % of all Washington Post linked to stories ) and the New York Times ( 26 % ) .
Those two papers accounted for 73 % of all of the opinion columns that bloggers linked to .
For example , the No. 1 story the first week of September was a Washington Post op - ed where columnist George Will advocated for a pullout from Afghanistan .
It was an opinion by a prominent conservative that sparked conversation in the blogosphere rather than reporting on new events or facts .
Other sites , however , were linked to primarily as sources for straight news accounts .
Almost all ( 97 % ) of the stories linked to on CNN and the BBC ( 96 % ) were news reporting .
The majority of links bloggers examined were also text - based stories as opposed to interactive pages with multimedia components such as video , slide shows or interactive charts .
Fully 83 % of the links were to stories that were text - based stories compared with 17 % of stories that were multimedia based .

On C - SPAN ’s Washington Journal this morning Rep. David Nunes ( R - CA ) expressed his approval of tea party protesters who shouted faggot at Rep. Barney Frank and nigger at Rep. John Lewis .
Nunes said , “ Yeah , well I think that when you use totalitarian tactics , people , you know , begin to act crazy . ”
Racism and homophobia have nothing to do with health care , but everything to do with the tea party movement .
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :
When was asked about the slurs hurled at Reps.
Lewis and Frank , Nunes said , “ Yeah , well I think that when you use totalitarian tactics , people , you know , begin to act crazy .
I think , you know , there ’s people that have every right to say what they want .
If they want to smear someone , they can do it .
It ’s not appropriate .
And I think I would stop short of characterizing the 20,000 people protesting , that all of them were doing that - Of course .
I think the left loves to play a couple of incidents here or there . ”

Just so everyone understands , Nunes was not only defending the conduct of the tea partiers , but also justifying their actions because of the health care reform bill .
There is no piece of legislation that can ever possibly justify racism and homophobia .
If this was the first time that members of the tea party have behaved this way , it could be excused as a few bad apples , but this behavior is a common occurrence at tea party protests .
Instead of praising their behavior , Nunes should have differentiated between their deplorable actions and their opposition to health care reform .
The Constitution gives everyone the right to protest , but no one has the right to personally attack others because they do n’t approve of their position on a piece of potential legislation .
The Republican Party is letting itself be taken over by the darkest elements of right wing thought and people like David Nunes are too cowardly to say anything about it .
Throughout last week 's squall over the new coalition government , the interests of one constituency dominated all others .
It has no MP , nor can it claim any actual voters .
Yet in all the coverage of the results and the cabinet - broking , one question came up again and again : would the markets like it ?
On Monday afternoon , Nick Robinson was on TV heckling Liberal Democrat negotiators : " Are you not in danger of playing both sides while the country waits and the markets quake ? "
True , the BBC 's political editor never makes an intelligent point when a bad jingle will do .
But there was also Peter Riddell of The Times , the venerable archdeacon of lobby journalism , musing , " The main challenge [ for a Labour - led coalition ] would be financial .
Could [ it ] gain and retain the confidence of the financial markets ? "
Nor was it just Westminster - types .
The Daily Mail 's City editor warned : " The markets have no appetite for political horse - trading .
Instead , they are demanding decisive action . "
Never mind that on the day the Telegraph led its business section with " Political deadlock spurs fear of sell - off " , the FTSE shot up 200 points .
Overlook how , when the government went to the markets last week to borrow some cash , eager lenders practically bit its arm off .
And forget that what 's really sowing panic on trading floors is n't the gestation of a new government in a small and stable democracy , but the existential crisis in the 16 - nation eurozone .
So the idea that David Cameron and Nick Clegg were playing Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock in a Whitehall version of Speed – urgently patching together a coalition agreement before a ticking timebomb in the financial markets went off – turned out to be a fiction .
And if this was just about journalists over - applying the melodrama , or the chagrin of the Murdoch papers at having to scrap their Dave 'n ' Sam commemorative pullouts , the matter could rest there .
But what should trouble us is the notion that the markets are now the all - powerful referee on the democratic process .
Rather than being one all - knowing entity , financial markets are a convenient term we apply to the hundreds of thousands of daily deals between buyers and sellers and middlemen .
When the FTSE goes up , the price of government bonds normally goes down , and what the Swiss do with their interest rates can cause all sorts of mischief for the pound .
Nor do employees of financial institutions know better than everyone else .
As one former fund manager recently put it to me , " The idea that traders in bond markets are coolly weighing up the economic data is just nonsense ; they jump around according to the first headlines they see on their Bloomberg terminals . "
Yet we 'll hear many more appeals to the market over the next few months .
If form is anything to go by , every time George Osborne takes the axe to public services he 'll say he is only acting in accordance with the market 's wishes .
There is certainly an argument to be had about how the UK cuts its overdraft , but voters are n't getting that debate – instead they have to contend with the Mafioso - like figure of the market .
In this way , finance is supplanting democratic argument .
How do we explain this process ?
The theorist Mark Fisher describes it in the title of his new book as Capitalist Realism , meaning " the widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system , but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it " .
Or perhaps we should turn to anthropology , because what seems to be happening here is the establishment of a new primitive religion – with the markets as a bloodthirsty god .
According to the classic definition by anthropologist Clifford Geertz , a religion must be " a system of symbols " – for which read the FTSE and the pound .
It has to incorporate " conceptions of a general order of existence " – in our case , the idea that markets know best .
Then , Geertz says , it should give " these conceptions … an aura of actuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic . "
Which is where we are .
Do n't fancy a Cameron government ?
But that 's what the market wants .
Does your tot enjoy his Sure Start centre ?
Too bad : the market must be propitiated with regular sacrifices .
Only by following the way of the market will Britain find its salvation in a recovery led by the private sector .
The Americans got here first .
In 2001 , Thomas Frank published his seminal book One Market Under God , about how Florida retirees were filling their boots by day - trading on internet stocks .
In the dotcom boom , voters trusted the Wall Street Journal more than they trusted the White House .
True to national tradition , the British did not choose such sunniness .
Their God is a vengeful God .
This is not only a Conservative faith , but one held on all sides of the house .
Just heed this comment from one Labour doyen , the late Robin Cook : " The markets always know , and they impose a heavy penalty .
The discipline of the market is not always welcome , but it is a powerful ally of truth , efficiency and transparency . "
Just as the old faiths expire , under the deathblows of Richard Dawkins and his droogs , so rises a new one .
As I type this , Osborne is on the radio describing how he will begin £ 6bn of cuts next Monday – and reveal a new austerity budget in a few weeks .
The market 's will shall be done .
I cannot even remember the last time I played whiffle ball .
I dont know if this is a good or bad thing , but this kid has wicked whiffle ball skills .

India 's Chandrayaan - 1 probe carried US equipment to the Moon Please turn on JavaScript .

A radar experiment aboard India 's Chandrayaan - 1 lunar spacecraft has identified thick deposits of water - ice near the Moon 's north pole .
The US space agency 's ( Nasa ) Mini - Sar experiment found more than 40 small craters containing water - ice .
But other compounds - such as hydrocarbons - are mixed up in lunar ice , according to new results from another Moon mission called LCROSS .
The findings were presented at a major planetary science conference in Texas .
The craters with ice range from 2 km to 15 km ( one to nine miles ) in diameter ; how much there is depends on its thickness in each crater .
But Nasa says the ice must be at least a couple of metres thick to give the signature seen by Chandrayaan - 1 .
Dr Paul Spudis , from the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston , estimated there was at least 600 million metric tonnes of water - ice held within these impact craters .
The equivalent amount , expressed as rocket fuel , would be enough to launch one space shuttle per day for 2,200 years , he told journalists at the 41st Lunar and Planetary Science Conference .
What all these craters have in common are large areas of their interiors that never see sunlight .
Extreme cold Temperatures in some of these permanently darkened craters can drop as low as 25 Kelvin ( - 248C ; - 415 F ) - colder than the surface of Pluto - allowing water - ice to remain stable .
" It is mostly pure water - ice , " said Dr Spudis .
" It could be under a few tens of centimetres of dry regolith ( lunar soil ) . "
This protective layer of soil could prevent blocks of pure ice from vaporising even in some areas which are exposed to sunlight , he explained .
Ice thrown up by the LCROSS impact was in a crystalline form Please turn on JavaScript .

In February , President Barack Obama cancelled the programme designed to return Americans to the Moon by 2020 .
However , Dr Spudis said : " Now we can say with a fair degree of confidence that a sustainable human presence on the Moon is possible .
It 's possible using the resources we find there .
" The results from these missions , that we have seen in the last few months , are totally revolutionising our view of the Moon . "
Chandrayaan - 1 was India 's contribution to the armada of unmanned spacecraft to have been launched to the Moon in recent years .
Japan , Europe , China and the US have all sent missions packed with instruments to explore Earth 's satellite in unprecedented detail .
In Nasa 's LCROSS mission , a rocket and a probe were smashed into a large crater at the lunar south pole , kicking up water - ice and water vapour .
Spectral measurements of material thrown up by the LCROSS impact indicate some of the water - ice was in a crystalline form , rather than the " amorphous " form in which the water molecules are randomly arranged .
Water source " There 's not one flavour of water on the Moon ; there 's a range of everything from relatively pure ice all the way to adsorbed water , " said the mission 's chief scientist Anthony Colaprete , from Nasa 's Ames Research Center .
" And here is an instance inside Cabeus crater where it appears we threw up a range of fine - grained particulates of near pure crystalline water - ice . "
Overall , results from recent missions suggest there could be several sources for lunar ice .
One important way for water to form is through an interaction with the solar wind , the fast - moving stream of particles that constantly billows away from the Sun .
Space radiation triggers a chemical reaction in which oxygen atoms already in the soil acquire hydrogen nuclei to make water molecules and the simpler hydrogen - oxygen ( OH ) molecule .
This " adsorbed " water may be present as fine films coating particles of lunar soil .
In a cold sink effect , water from elsewhere on the lunar surface may migrate to the slightly cooler poles , where it is retained in permanently shadowed craters .
Scientists have also reported the presence of hydrocarbons , such as ethylene , in the LCROSS impact plume .
Dr Colaprete said any hydrocarbons were likely to have been delivered to the lunar surface by comets and asteroids - another vital source of lunar water .
However , he added , some of these chemical species could arise through " cold chemistry " on interstellar dust grains accumulated on the Moon .
In addition to water , researchers have seen a range of other " volatiles " ( compounds with low boiling points ) in the impact plume , including sulphur dioxide ( SO2 ) and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) .
The results from the Mini -Sar instrument are due to be published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
The team is currently analysing results for craters at the Moon 's south pole .

Senior Goldman
Sachs executives are appearing before a US Senate committee to give evidence about the bank 's actions before the global financial crisis .
Senator Carl Levin opened proceedings with the accusation that the investment bank had abused its relationship with clients .
He also said the bank bore some of the responsibility for triggering the crisis , and that " when the system finally collapsed ... Goldman profited " .
He added : “ I thought these issues were resolved 24 years ago .
You won .
The government fell . ”
Over the years , the Marcoses have patiently worked at re-establishing their political power from their stronghold here , in the province of Ilocos Norte , where the younger Mr. Marcos , his older sister Imee and first cousins have , in rotation , held the seats for governor or the House .
An early run by Mr. Marcos for the Senate failed , but he earned plaudits as governor by becoming the first person to erect windmills in the country and building tourism .

This time , Mr. Marcos is considered a very strong candidate for one of the 12 seats open for election in the Senate , the legislative body that has produced most of the country ’s past presidents .
Older voters may associate the Marcos name with martial law , political repression and cronyism .
But in a country where half the population is under 22.5 years old and history is taught poorly , many young voters interviewed outside the Marcos redoubt here , like Jeffrey Zamora , a 31 - year - old caretaker , said they knew little about the Marcos legacy .
Asked whether the family hoped that a Senate victory would allow the late president ’s son to run for the presidency next time , Mariano Marcos , a first cousin , said , “ Oh , yeah , that ’s what all of us are hoping and working toward . ”
But Mr. Aquino ’s run for the presidency , his lead in the polls and his comment about the Marcoses ’ wealth complicated matters , creating a family feud over which of Mr. Aquino ’s opponents to back for president .
When the dust settled , the Marcoses found themselves in need of a candidate for the House .
With no one in the younger generation interested in politics yet , the family turned to its matriarch to run for the House seat being vacated by her son .
Leaving her home in Manila , Mrs. Marcos set up her campaign headquarters here in the little - used family mansion , where cobwebs still laced the living - room chandelier on a recent visit .
In a wide - ranging interview , Mrs. Marcos defended her husband ’s legacy ( thrusting her right index finger in the air ) and bemoaned the government ’s largely unsuccessful lawsuits against her family ( dabbing her eyes ) .
After her son ’s success in exploiting wind power , Mrs. Marcos said she wanted to save the environment .
Nor does the observation that a left - handed artist drew the portrait convince the sceptics .
According to Pietro C Marani , Italy ’s most distinguished Leonardo scholar , who oversaw the restoration of The Last Supper : “ The fact that one is looking at a drawing by a left - handed artist does not carry any weight : there exist copies of drawings by Leonardo made by imitators which present this particular characteristic – by , Francesco Melzi , for example , as Kenneth Clark and others have already written . ”
Likewise , a copyist could easily arrive at the sitter ’s costume by studying any Milanese 15th - century portrait .
Even the drawing ’s obvious antiquity has drawn fire from one museum director , who asked not to be named .
He believes the drawing is not even 19th century , and thinks it is “ a screaming 20th - century fake ” , made up out of a “ compilation of obviously Leonardesque elements that is not even close to Leonardo himself ” .
For this well - known connoisseur of Italian painting and sculpture , the damage and repairs are suspicious , for , although apparent to the naked eye , they are not so extensive that they make the picture unappealing or unsaleable – as it would be , for example , if the repairs disfigured the face .

A title and an abstract for the conference “ 100 Years in Seattle : the mathematics of Klee and Grünbaum ” drew a special attention :
Title : “ A counter - example to the Hirsch conjecture ”
Author : Francisco Santos , Universidad de Cantabria
Abstract :
I have been in Seattle only once , in January 2002 , when I visited to give a colloquium talk at UW .
Although Victor Klee was already retired –he was 76 years old–he came to the Department of Mathematics to talk to me .
We had a nice conversation during which he asked “ Why do n’t you try to disprove the Hirsch Conjecture ” ?
I have later found out that he asked the same question to many people , including all his students , but the question and the way it was posed made me feel special at that time .
This talk is the answer to that question .
I will describe the construction of a 43 - dimensional polytope with 86 facets and diameter bigger than 43 .
The proof is based on a generalization of the $ d$ - step theorem of Klee and Walkup .
Great news !
Congratulations Paco !
Hirsch ’s conjecture ( 1957 ) states that the graph of a d-dimensional polytope with n facets has diameter no more than n − d .
That is , any two vertices of the polytope may be connected to each other by a path of at most n − d edges .
We had quite a few posts regarding the Hirsch conjecture and related problems .
One day the man wakes up and finds that he does not feel like going to work .
He is not sick , exactly ; he just does n’t feel like going to work .
He calls the office and makes an excuse , then he pours himself a bowl of cereal and sits down in front of the television .

The man does n’t usually have time to watch television , so it takes him a while to find a show he ’s interested in , but when he eventually does find one he sits rapt , his cereal forgotten , for a very , very , very long time .
The show seems to last much longer than a normal show .
In fact , it lasts all day .
It is five o’clock before the main character finally leaves his job and heads home , prompting the credits to roll .
The man sets his bowl of cereal aside and stares at the floor for a while .
My God , he thinks .
He gets up , goes into the bathroom , and takes a shower .
As he washes , he thinks about the show he has just seen .
He is shampooing his hair when suddenly he realizes : the show was about him .
Not kind of about him , not metaphorically about him , but actually about him .
That ’s why the main character looked so familiar , he thinks , dunking his head under the water .
But how could it have taken me so long to recognize my own self ?
he wonders .
And how did they manage to find an actor who looks so exactly like me ?
The man stays home from work again the next day , claiming to have the flu .
The show is on again — his show .
Yep , there he is , arriving at work .
He is wearing the suit he bought last week at Macy’s .
There he is , waving at the security guard he always waves at in the morning .
Now he ’s walking down the hallway toward his office , now he ’s moving inside — there ’s his desk , his chair , his in - box and his out - box , his stapler and his letter opener .
It ’s amazing ; the man can hardly believe it .
Onscreen , he sits down at his desk , looks at the clock , and begins to work .
The man does the same thing at work every day ; it is not very exciting .
But somehow watching himself do it from inside his apartment , through the TV , is absolutely fascinating .
The man is mesmerized by all the little unconscious movements his onscreen self makes .
He seems to chew on his lip a lot .
Maybe that ’s why my lips are always chapped , he thinks , running a finger over them .
He will have to watch that in the future .
At lunchtime , the man onscreen leaves the building and goes down the block to a little sandwich shop .
It is Thursday , so the old guy who owns the place is in .
He and the man have a conversation about the state of the world while the man eats his sandwich ( roast beef , same as always ) and drinks his coffee ( black , same as always ) .
Then the man returns to the office and works for the rest of the day .
At five o’clock he finishes up and heads out the door , and once again the credits roll .
This time the man on the couch studies the credits carefully .
Yep , there ’s his name , listed as both the main character and the actor .
So it really is me , the man thinks in relief .
It has been bothering him to think that an actor could so perfectly play him .
It made him feel foolish to be so predictable , so reproducible .
This way is much better .
He feels proud of his role in the whole affair .
The next day , the man goes to work .
He apologizes for having been absent for the past couple of days , but no one seems to care very much .
This does not surprise him , but still it seems a little sad .
The man sits at his desk and does his work .
It is not much fun .
It has never been much fun , he reflects , but now it seems particularly burdensome .
He spends most of the time trying not to chew on his lip , with little success .
At lunch , he goes down to the sandwich shop .
It is Friday , so the old guy who owns the place is not in .
The man sits alone at a table in the corner and remembers the conversation that his onscreen self had with the old guy the day before .
He smiles to himself about some of the witty and observant things the two of them said .
Something nice happens in the afternoon .
The man discovers that , because his onscreen self did his work so well in the past couple of days , he is now done for the week .
The man can hardly believe it .
He almost never finishes his full workload .
Usually , he has to stay late on Friday night , or even come in on Saturday or Sunday — or both — to get it all done .
He sits at his desk , marvelling at the knowledge that he can go home early , and then he does .
He waves goodbye to the security guard on his way out .
He drives home , feeling the wind in his hair and the sun on his face .
At home , the man turns on the TV and is surprised to find that his show is on .
There he is , wearing the same clothes he is wearing right now — but he is still at work .
He is sitting behind his desk , hunched over a legal pad , writing something .
How can this be ?
the man thinks .
All the work is finished !
He squints at the TV , trying to see what , exactly , his other self is working on .
It is hard to tell .
He seems to be writing up a list of some kind .
The man notices that the man behind the desk is no longer chewing on his lip .
That night , the program does not end at five .
The man in the office keeps right on working until almost nine - thirty .
At home , the man has pulled a straight - backed chair up to the TV , and tries to figure out what ’s happening , what his other self is doing .
He can not figure it out .
When the man finally finishes working on his list — or whatever it is — he slides it into his briefcase and leaves work for the day .
Again .
At home , the man sits with his eyes glued to the front door , waiting for himself to walk in .
He has lots of questions .
He wants to know what this list is all about .
Ten , eleven , eleven - thirty , midnight .
The door does not open .
Suddenly it occurs to the man that he can just open the briefcase and take out the list and read it .
After all , it is his briefcase .
He gets up and goes into the bedroom .
Now , where did he put that briefcase ?
He ca n’t remember .
Where does he usually put it ?
He ca n’t remember that , either .
In fact , he ca n’t remember ever owning a briefcase at all .
In the morning , the man awakens confused .
He sits on the edge of the bed .
He feels as if he were forgetting something , but he ca n’t think what it could possibly be .
The man gets to the couch early , so he wo n’t miss anything .
But it turns out he ’s already late .
There he is , in his office , behind his desk , with his feet up , reading a book .
The book is lying open in his lap , so the man cannot tell what it is .
It is very thick , though .
There are other books stacked neatly on the desk .
The man squints to make out the titles .
Some of them seem to be about business management , but one is about calculus , and there are others about art and history , and one narrow volume looks like a collection of poetry .
The man smiles when he sees that .
What on earth is going on ?
When nine o’clock rolls around , the man behind the desk closes the book he ’s reading ( is it the dictionary ? ) and gets down to work .
He works quickly and with an air of extreme concentration .
At home , the man on the couch , though filled with admiration for his other , better self , feels a twinge of jealousy , and even , strangely , something like fear .
At lunch , the man onscreen does not go to the shop on the corner .
Instead , he fixes his tie and heads down the corridor in the direction of his boss ’s office .
The man on the couch cannot believe what he ’s seeing .
He watches as he knocks firmly on the boss ’s door and then goes inside , closing the door behind him .
When he emerges , fifteen minutes later , he is smiling .
He stops and calls back to the person inside , something in the way of an affirmation , and then heads off down the hall , a spring in his step .
With the remainder of his lunch hour , he eats a sandwich he has brought to work in a brown paper bag , and drinks a bottle of water .
The man at home does not know what ’s happening .
He has never purposely gone to speak to his boss .
In fact , he ca n’t imagine ever wanting to do such a thing .
Still , he admires his onscreen self for doing it .
Perhaps something good will come of it — maybe a raise .
The man goes into the kitchen and grabs a bag of cookies from the cupboard .
But when he returns to the living room he finds that his onscreen self has left for the day .
His office is clean , his out - box is full , his pile of books has disappeared .
He begins to get antsy .
Where has he gone ?
There is no way to know .
What did he say to his boss ?
What was on the list ?
And what are all the books for ?
The man is beginning to feel nauseated , thinking about it all .
He is making himself sick .
He has to think about something else .
Perhaps there is something else on TV .
The man changes the channel .
There is a cartoon about a coyote , a commercial for an exercise machine , someone talking about the weather , and , oh , wait , what ’s this ?
There ’s the man again .
He ’s in his car now , driving down a street that the man on the couch finds unfamiliar .
He stops outside a building , an office building , and goes inside .
He speaks to a receptionist , and is then ushered into a conference room .
“ One of our greatest minds in restaurant criticism . ”

In the room are a number of men , all of whom look very serious .
The man on the couch is frightened .
But his other self looks perfectly at home .
He places his briefcase carefully on the table , unlocks it with a pair of decisive clicks , and opens it up .
Inside is a stack of papers .
He begins to hand them out and , as he does so , begins to speak .
He speaks about things the man on the couch does n’t understand .
Stocks and bonds and financial matters , things like that .
The man on the couch furrows his brow , trying to follow it all .
He can’t , but he is relieved to see that the men in the room seem to be following it quite well , and , what ’s more , seem to be happy with what they ’re hearing .
At the end of the meeting , the men rise , smiling , and congratulate the man on what he has said and done .
Cigars are passed around , and the man takes one and sees himself smoking it with a practiced air , despite the fact that he has never smoked a cigar in his life , and would never want to , since they ’re disgusting .
Still , he has to admit , it is quite enjoyable .
When the man leaves the meeting , however , the show does not follow him .
It stays in the conference room with the other men , and after a while — despite the fact that these other men are beginning to seem vaguely familiar — the man on the couch starts to tire of their banter .
He figures he ’s probably returned to the office by now , so he changes the channel again , and then again .
He is almost back to his original station when suddenly he recognizes himself on a show about doctors .
He is in surgery , raising his hands in the air as a nurse slips a pair of latex gloves over them .
He almost did n’t recognize himself , thanks to the mask that covers half his face , but there ’s no doubt about it , it ’s him — after all , if a man ca n’t recognize himself , what can he recognize ?
This is his first day as a surgeon .
Apparently , the man has been going to night school .
The man on the couch is impressed .
He did n’t know you could go to night school to become a surgeon , and yet it turns out that he has actually been doing it this whole time !
He marvels at himself as he cuts open some poor man ’s chest and begins to operate on his malfunctioning heart .
He hopes the operation will go well , and it does .
The nurses congratulate him as he sews the man back together .
Later on , they all go out drinking , and the man makes love to one of the nurses — the most attractive one — in the bathroom of the club .
It is the best sex the man has had in years .
On another station , the man finds himself foiling a gang of jewel thieves .
He has infiltrated the gang , thanks to some ingenious plastic surgery and a number of carefully constructed lies .
He waits until the last possible moment , and then he springs the trap .
Everyone is arrested and found guilty , and after the trial the man is singled out for bravery and is given a medal , and a monument is erected to him in a park downtown .
Lovers sit on a bench beside the monument and feel safe .
It is sad , though , because the man ’s father died in a botched robbery , and , while what the man has done makes him feel that he has finally evened out the situation , he knows that nothing he can do will ever bring his father back from the dead .
Still , perhaps his work has prevented other innocent fathers from being killed .
Meanwhile , on another station , the man is a scientist who has invented a way to bring people back from the dead .
He uses it to bring back his wife , who died a few years ago , but then he learns that she did n’t love him , after all , and that it is better not to mess with bringing people back from the dead .
He is a better man for learning this , but he ca n’t help feeling sorry for himself , as he misses his wife and the love that he thought she had for him .
On another station , the man has become the head of a warlike country and is threatening to unleash Armageddon on the world if his barbarous demands are not met .
The man becomes afraid of himself and changes the channel .
Now he is murdering a small boy in a field with a rusty knife , and he feels absolutely terrible .
Whatever happened to night school and poetry books ?
The man is confused .
He is proud of himself and everything he has accomplished , very proud indeed — he always knew he had it in him .
But at the same time he is scared of what he sees .
There are things about himself that he does n’t want to know , things he does that he does n’t want to think about .
He wishes there were some way he could choose what he does and does not do .
But it is beyond his control .
He runs rampant across the world , helping and killing and saving and selling , buying and raping and stealing and feeling and making love and running away and laughing and crying and dying and being born and dying and being born and dying and being born and dying and being born .
Eventually the man comes to see that he has a mind , and that his mind is like a fist , wrapped tightly around a single thought .
He cannot open the fist to look at the thought , for fear that it will fly away , but he knows that it is very important and that he must hang on to it , no matter the cost .
He stares at the fist and hopes that it is very strong .
He feels like a man who has fallen asleep at the wheel and has awakened to find his car lurching off a cliff .
He has applied the brake , he has swung the wheel to the side , he has offered up a silent prayer , but it is too soon to see whether he has done these things in time .
He can only wait for the next moment to come , and hope as hard as he can .
Finally , the next moment comes .
The man opens his fist and realizes that the thing in his hand is not a thought but the end of an electrical cord .
He looks down and finds that the electrical cord leads to the television — now a dark , silent box lying on the floor at his feet .
The man feels a rush of triumph .
He has come out on top , he has won .
He grins to himself as he contemplates his next move .
He decides that the best thing to do is to take the TV down to the trash and get rid of it .
And this is exactly what he does .
But in the stairwell , on the way back from the trash , the man passes himself carrying the television down to the trash .
He stops to congratulate himself on his wisdom and strength , but his other self averts his eyes , hoping not to be noticed .
The man begins to take offense and is about to say something when both of them are elbowed aside by the man , who is carrying his TV back up from the trash .
The man hurries after himself , yelling , No , no , I do n’t want that anymore !
But he does n’t listen .
As they enter the apartment , the man on the couch looks up from the TV in irritation .
Why ca n’t everyone leave him alone ?
The room is packed with versions of the man running here and there , talking to himself about this and that , making plans on the phone and staring out the window and falling in love and falling out of love and finding himself loved and unloved and hated and feared and liked and disliked and ignored and unknown and known .
He is fired , promoted , rehired and refired , has found a new place to live and is moving out , is moving in and repainting , is in the other room dying and in the kitchen being born .
There is too much going on .
The man walks out the door and down the hall and into the next apartment .
Mommy , Mommy , his children scream , what ’s for breakfast ?
The man makes French toast and waffles and ham and eggs and pancakes and cereal and Pop - Tarts and brownies and hot dogs and hamburgers and baked Alaska and a birthday cake in the shape of a castle and pours glasses of milk and orange juice and coffee and Tang and Kool - Aid and water and puts ice in all of the glasses .
He takes the kids down to the bus stop seven hundred times , and he drives the bus to school .
Drunk , sober , hungover , on acid , pot , cocaine , uppers and downers , or nothing at all — it does n’t matter in the least — he gets in an accident every foot of the way , or he does n’t .
At school , he gets in a fight on the playground and is sent to the office , or does n’t and is n’t , or does and is n’t , or does n’t and is .
He gives himself a good lecture , maybe , winks at the secretary he has or has not been banging for the past two weeks , or four weeks , or ten weeks , or no weeks , then hurries slowly to the women ’s room , realizing that it is or is not his time of the month , mops none or half or all of the gym and goes out back to have a smoke or stare at the sky or remember the time he accidentally ate a spider or became President or something else or nothing else or everything else .
He flies to the next town over and perches in all the trees , then falls to the ground in several different countries and is blown away by the wind , which hammers endlessly in all the ears he has — more than he is capable of counting .
Sometimes the man cries himself to sleep at night , but usually he just changes the channel .
He has not been able to find his way to the office ; he does n’t know where they put it .
He rings and rings , but the nurse no longer answers his calls .
One night , he discovers that his lips are horribly chapped .
This strikes him as the worst thing that has ever happened , and for a moment he sobs uncontrollably .
Then , once more , he opens the fist . ♦
In recognition of the " Boobquake " that was recently celebrated around the world as liberated women shook their breasts ( figuratively ) in the face of the Iranian cleric who recently blamed earthquakes on female sexuality , a few words on the mysterious allure of the human female breast .
Considering its almost total lack of muscle tissue , the female breast wields amazing power .
Curvaceous women have leveraged this power to manipulate even the most accomplished , disciplined men for as long as anyone 's been around to notice .
Empires have fallen , wills have been revised , millions of magazines and calendars sold , Super Bowl audiences scandalized ... all in response to the mysterious force emanating from what are , after all , small bags of fat .
One of the oldest human images known , the so - called Venus of Willendorf , created about 25,000 years ago , features a bosom of Dolly Parton - esque dimensions .
Two hundred fifty centuries later , the power of the exaggerated breast shows little sign of getting old .
According to the American Society of Plastic Surgery , 347,254 breast augmentation procedures were performed in the United States in 2007 , making it the nation 's most commonly performed surgical procedure .
What gives the female breast such transcendent influence over heterosexual male consciousness ?
First , let 's dispense with any purely utilitarian interpretations .
While the mammary glands contained in women 's breasts exist for the feeding of infants , the fatty tissue that confers the magical curve of the human breast has nothing to do with milk production .
Given the clear physiological costs of having pendulous breasts ( back strain , loss of balance , difficulty running ) , if they are n't meant to advertise milk for babies , why did human females evolve and retain these cumbersome appendages ?
Theories range from the belief that breasts serve as signaling devices announcing fertility and fat deposits sufficient to withstand the rigors of and breastfeeding , to " genital echo theory " : females developed pendulous breasts around the time hominids began walking upright in order to provoke the excitation males formerly felt when gazing at the fatty deposits on the buttocks .
Theorists supporting genital echo theory have noted that swellings like those of chimpanzees and bonobos would interfere with locomotion in a bi-pedal primate , so when our distant ancestors began walking upright , they reason , some of the female 's fertility signaling moved from the rear office , as it were , to the front showroom .
In a bit of historical ping - pong , the dictates of fashion have moved the swelling back and forth over the centuries , with high heels , Victorian bustles , and other derrière enhancements .
The visual similarity between these two bits of female anatomy has been facilitated by the recent popularity of low - cut jeans that teasingly reveal the nether cleavage .
" The butt crack is the new cleavage , " writes journalist Janelle Brown , " reclaimed to peek seductively from the pants of supermodels and commoners alike .

It 's naughty and slightly tawdry , " she continues , " but with the soft round charm of a perfect pair of breasts . "
If your moon is waning , you can always don a " butt bra " from Bubbles Bodywear , which promises to create the effect that 's been turning male heads since before men existed .
Like the Victorian bustle , the butt bra mimics the full curves of the ovulating chimp or bonobo .
Speaking of waning moons , it 's worth noting that unless her breasts are artificially enhanced , as a woman 's fertility fades with age , so do her breasts — further supporting the claim that they evolved to signal fertility ( or at least , sexual availability ) .
* * *
Human females are n't the only primates with fertility signals on their chests .
The Gelada baboon is another vertically oriented primate with sexual swellings on the females ' chests .
As we 'd expect , the Gelada 's swellings come and go with the females ' sexual receptivity .
As the human female is potentially always sexually receptive , her breasts are more or less always swollen , from sexual maturity on .
But not all female primates have genital swellings that visually announce their ovulatory status .
Primatologist Meredith Small reports that only 54 out of 78 species surveyed " experience easily seen morphological changes during cycles , " and that half of these showed " only slight pinkness . "
Once again , our two closest primate cousins stand out from the pack in terms of their decidedly indiscreet , being the only primates with such extravagant , brightly colored sexual swellings .
The female chimp 's red - light district comes and goes , reflecting the waxing and waning of her fertility , but as Small confirms , the bonobo's " swellings never change much , so that bonobo females always give a signal of fertility — much as humans do . "

The horrific crash seemed , at the time , baffling .
On June 10 , 2006 , a 29 - year - old driver left eastbound Interstate 94 at Snelling Avenue in St. Paul , traveling about highway speed , he testified in court .
By the time he reached Snelling , his car was going as fast as 90 mph .
“ Like it was shot out of a rocket , ” a Ramsey County prosecutor said at the man ’s trial .
The car hit an Oldsmobile stopped at the red light , killing a St. Paul father and his 10 - year - old son .
His 7 - year - old niece was left a quadriplegic and died a year and a half later .
Koua Fong Lee , who insisted throughout his trial that he was desperately trying to stop , was convicted of criminal vehicular homicide and sentenced in 2008 to eight years in prison .
The St. Paul man ’s car : a 1996 Toyota Camry .
Amid news of millions of recalled Toyotas for problems relating to sudden acceleration , Lee ’s defense attorney said Wednesday that he wants to try to get the case reopened .
“ I do n’t know who could disagree with this being a possible cause — because otherwise , he ’s just a wild kamikaze guy trying to kill somebody , ” said Bloomington attorney Brent Schafer .
Schafer said he sent a letter Wednesday to the St. Paul police impound lot , where the car remains .
He intends to petition the court for an order preserving the car and seeking permission to have it re-examined .
Toyota Motor Corp. is recalling more than 7 million U.S. vehicles due to sudden - acceleration issues , which have been linked to several hundred crashes and at least 18 fatalities .
Lee ’s 1996 model was not among the recalled Camrys , which include those manufactured from 2007 to 2010 .
Nevertheless , Schafer said , the Lee case is worth pursuing .
“ You ca n’t just let it go , because we do n’t know how wide this recall is going to end up being , ” he said .
“ This may be able to provide a piece of the puzzle to explain what was previously an inexplicable case . ”
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a limited recall of the 1996 Camry that year for cruise control systems that “ fail to hold the speed set by the driver and can accelerate above the intended set speed . ”
It is unclear whether the Camry involved in the accident was one of those recalled under that order .
Koua Fong
Lee testified at his trial in 2007 that he was returning home from a church event on the day of the accident .
His pregnant wife , their 4 - year - old daughter , his father and his brother were in the car with him .
He had no criminal history and had not been drinking or on drugs .
He said he was not talking on a cell phone or distracted by anything else .
But as he pulled off the freeway , he said , something suddenly went wrong .
“ I stepped on my brakes .
For some reason , the brakes did not work , ” he testified .
“ And then I was very afraid .
I began to think that my family is all in this car and I was worried I was going to crash into the other vehicles . ”
Both the prosecutors and Koua Fong Lee ’s trial attorney , Tracy Eichhorn - Hicks , said it appeared the defendant accidentally stepped on the accelerator rather than the brake .
A city mechanic who inspected the car testified he found no problems with the brakes .
A much shorter portion of his testimony centered on the accelerator ; mechanic Michael Churchich said the throttle was stuck open about 15 percent to 20 percent .
He speculated that could have been caused by the impact of the crash itself .
Police told Koua Fong
Lee shortly after the accident about Churchich ’s inspection results .
“ Are you guys 100 percent sure about the brakes ? ” he responded .
Schafer said justice may require Koua Fong Lee be freed .
“ I intend to do what I can to examine what I can do to get him out of prison , ” Schafer said .
“ It was one of the most unexplainable cases I ’ve ever seen . ”
Bloomberg News reported Wednesday that Toyota faces at least 41 class - action lawsuits and at least 13 individual lawsuits over the sudden acceleration problems .
Killed in the St. Paul crash were Javis Adams Sr. , 33 ; his son , Javis Adams Jr. , 10 ; and , later , Adams ’ niece , Devyn Bolton , 7 . Jassmine Adams , Javis Adams Sr. ’s daughter , 13 , had permanent leg damage ; and his father , Quincy Adams , 57 , suffered a head injury .

UPDATE MAY 26 – About 100 gay and lesbian people gathered at the Dundonald St offices of Pride Toronto ( PT ) on May 25 to protest the organization ’s decision to censor the term “ Israeli apartheid ” from this year ’s Pride celebration .
As the crowd chanted “ Whose Pride ? Our Pride ! ” and “ Resign ! Resign ! Resign ! ” visibly nervous PT board co-chair Genevieve D’Iorio – separated from the protesters by an iron fence and police guard – told media that “ complaints of discriminatory and exclusionary messaging ” led PT to ban the phrase “ Israel apartheid ” from the July 4 parade .
“ This is a terrible day in Pride ’s history , ” says Elle Flanders , spokesperson for Queers Against Israeli Apartheid ( QuAIA ) , the Palestinian rights group so obviously the target of the move .
“ If we had taken out Totally Naked Toronto Men or Dykes on Bikes , or other people who have offended other people , we would n’t have a Pride . ”
“ We ’re more than happy that people come in and march for the rights of queers in Palestine and queers in Israel , ” says D’Iorio .
“ But the reality is that this particular term has been the crux . ”
D’Iorio says city and corporate sponsors are threatening to pull funding , and banning the phrase “ Israeli apartheid ” is the best position PT organizers could take .
Pride simply would n’t happen , she says , without the city ’s financial and in - kind support .
“ This decision was long overdue and it ’s the right decision , ” says lawyer Martin Gladstone .
“ The broad - based community , virtually all of our political and civic leaders , the sponsors and our stakeholders all think it ’s the right decision . ”
Gladstone created the anti-QuAIA video Reclaiming Our Pride , and almost singlehandedly led the movement to lobby the city and PT sponsors to kick QuAIA out of the parade .
“ Martin Gladstone has been an effective lobbyist , and I doff my hat to him , ” says Flanders .
“ But this whole situation is due to the beef of this one particular right - wing guy with his right - wing politics … .
If he ’s got something to say , why do n’t we get to have something to say ? ”
“ Nobody ’s censoring free speech , ” replies Gladstone , who was not at the protest , choosing instead to speak with Xtra later over the phone .
“ But they have to grow up .
Like every other recipient of public money or corporate money , there are compliance issues .
Pride has no choice . ”
“ This is n’t a free speech issue , ” Gladstone continues .
“ They can go anywhere and march , wherever they want , but it ’s not what Pride ’s sponsors and our stakeholders and our funders sign up for … .
They ’re hurting our Pride parade . ”
Tim McCaskell , a long - time gay community activist and educator who did attend the protest , and who also participated in Toronto ’s earliest Pride marches , vehemently disagrees .
“ Any kind of human rights violation affects queers directly , and those struggles have always been present at Pride , ” he says .
“ If Pepsi can march in Pride , if the Bank of Montreal can march in Pride , if the Canadian fucking military recruitment office can march in Pride , why ca n’t these queer people with a political agenda – whether you agree with it or not – march in Pride ? ” says playwright Brad Fraser , spokesman for the newly created Pride Coalition for Free Speech .
“ Shutting down QuAIA leads to someone else getting shut down next . ”
PT executive director Tracey Sandilands insists that , because of QuAIA ’s message , many potential Pride participants “ do n’t feel welcome because of their faith . ”
“ I do n’t even know what that means , ” says Flanders .
“ Have they never seen dissent ?
What is so threatening here , other than a bunch of signs saying , ‘ End the Israeli occupation ? ’ “
“ We ’re 30 percent down on our sponsorship from last year , ” says Sandilands .
“ And many potential sponsors – no , I wo n’t say who – have said they ’re concerned that Pride is getting involved with political issues that we should n’t be getting involved in … .
We ca n’t move forward allowing one group with one viewpoint and one particular phrase that everyone finds offensive to the detriment of 20 or 30 other groups who also consider themselves part of our community . ”
“ We ’re not just some fringe group , ” says Flanders .
“ I was on the board of Pride three years ago … .
I was asked to create a human rights contingent and built up the politics of Pride , but simultaneously , Pride was saying , ‘ Can you keep it small ? ’
They want to have a little politics but not so much that it spoils the party . ”
PT , she says , represents “ a new group of people riding the wave of civil rights that we ’ve managed to gain through sweat and labour and activism just like this : noisy people saying , ‘ We demand to be heard ’ and speaking for those who are n’t heard .
Pride has somehow forgotten about that . ”
In spite of PT ’s decision to censor QuAIA , Sandilands says Pride ’s growth from “ a little grassroots march ” is a great step for global human rights .
“ The fact that we are as big as we are gives us the unique opportunity and responsibility to take a stand on issues affecting queer people in other countries and actually be heard , get global media and make a difference , ” she says , noting that Pride will focus instead on the many countries that have no queer rights at all .
McCaskell vows that , ban or no , QuAIA ’s message will get out at Pride .
“ I ’ve been arrested before on free speech issues , but I ’m willing to be arrested again if that ’s what it takes , ” he says .
“ You can be damn sure that we ’ll be there . ”
Flanders says , “ They want to make this all go away , but politics are a part of Pride .
It ’s us this year ; it ’ll be somebody else next year . ”

Read the Pride Toronto board resolution to disallow the term “ Israeli apartheid ” ( PDF )
UPDATE MAY 25
Pride Toronto held a press conference this morning to announce that , following a contentious 4 - 3 vote by its board last week , the organization intends to ban the use of the term “ Israeli apartheid ” from any messaging in the Pride parade on July 4 .
About 80 QuAIA members and supporters turned out to protest the move , chanting “ Whose Pride ?
Our Pride ! ” and “ Resign ! Resign ! Resign ! ”
Though Pride Toronto insists the action is n’t “ directed at any one group , ” the decision affects the group Queers Against Israeli Apartheid ( QuAIA ) .
Pride Toronto executive director Tracey Sandilands and board co-chairs Genevieve D’lorio and Margaret Ngai told the jeering crowd that the term “ Israel apartheid ” has led to “ complaints of discriminatory and exclusionary messaging . ”
The issue “ has escalated to the point where Pride Toronto ’s festival is in a state of operational crisis , ” D’Iorio told the crowd .
With the City of Toronto and corporate sponsors threatening to pull funding , she insists , the board has rescued the Pride festival from cancellation .
“ They ’re not going to take away the funding , ” says playwright Brad Fraser , part of The Pride Coalition for Free Speech .
“ There ’s this pervasive fear being built up that bad things are going to happen if you let QuAIA march , but they would be insane to cut funding to the largest festival in Toronto ! ”
Pride Toronto ’s decision to censor the messaging may head off the June 14th vote on funding by Toronto City Council , but Fraser says Pride Toronto has made a huge mistake in caving on free speech .
“ It ’s not going to be easy for them , ” he says .
Check back soon for more on this story – including interviews with Pride Toronto organizers and QuAIA activists .

cstuder wrote : Object - oriented design
Due to the way extensions are implemented ( Most of them just get hardcoded into the OpenCart core classes ) , my installation is now completely un-upgradable .
Most of this could have prevented by cleaner object oriented design .
Some structure is there ( MVC ) , but class overriding is not easily possible .
Worse , some core classes are inexplicably declared final .
Furthermore there is no autoloading which makes easier overriding , well , easier .
Have a look at the PHP documentation and study the code from the hierarchical MVC - pattern in Kohana V3 .
This would make OpenCart much , much more flexible for extensions .
And would not require the insane and error prone patching stuff that SMB does .
Payment models
All payment models have nearly identical code .
That 's not very OO and also makes custom payment modules prone to breaking with each upgrade .
Coding guidelines
The trailing ?> are also not required and always the source for potential problems .
Better language file handling
I 've seen that this actually improved in the current version : English is now always loaded as default before another language is loaded .
Nice .
The creation of language files requires still a lot of Copy & Paste though and could benefit largely from using a centralized system like Gettext .
It almost looks ready too .
What 's completely ridicolous though , is the current way of passing language strings from the file to the view .
What 's more boring than hundreds of lines like this :
Code : Select all $ this ->data ['text_shipping_address '] = $ this ->language ->get (' text_shipping_address ' ) ; $ this ->data ['text_shipping_method ' ] = $ this ->language ->get (' text_shipping_method ' ) ; $ this ->data [ 'text_payment_address ' ] = $ this ->language ->get ( ' text_payment_address ' ) ; $ this ->data ['text_payment_method ' ] = $ this ->language -> get ( ' text_payment_method ' ) ; $ this -> data [ ' text_comment ' ] = $ this -> language -> get ( ' text_comment ' ) ; $ this -> data [ ' text_change ' ] = $ this -> language -> get ( ' text_change ' ) ; $ this ->data [ ' column_product ' ] = $ this ->language ->get ( ' column_product ' ) ; $ this ->data [ ' column_model ' ] = $ this ->language -> get ( ' column_model ' ) ; $ this ->data [ ' column_quantity ' ] = $ this ->language -> get ( ' column_quantity ' ) ; $ this ->data [ ' column_price ' ] = $ this ->language -> get ( ' column_price ' ) ; $ this ->data [ ' column_total ' ] = $ this ->language -> get ( ' column_total ' ) ;
In system / library / language .php : Add the following line at the end of the load ( ) - method : Code : Select all return $ this ->data ; Code : Select all /** * Load language file * * Returns all currently loaded strings * * @param string $ language * @return array $ data */ public function language ( $ language ) { return $ this -> language -> load ( $ language ) ; } Code : Select all $ this -> data = array_merge ( $ this -> data , $ this -> load -> language ( ' payment / ' . $ this -> modulename ) ) ;
I 've seen that this actually improved in the current version : English is now always loaded as default before another language is loaded .
Nice .

It almost looks ready too .
What 's completely ridicolous though , is the current way of passing language strings from the file to the view .
What 's more boring than hundreds of lines like this :
First of all , since you 're already using PHP in the templates , they could actually do this job for themselves .
Otherwise , I suggest the following improvement :
When loading a language file , return its contents directly .
I.e. : In system / library / language .php : Add the following line at the end of the load ( ) - method : Then in system / engine / loader.php : Modify the language ( ) - method in the following way :
Now , in your controller , you can pass all language strings to the view directly and save millions of keystrokes :
Security in custom modules
I stumbled across some controller code in the payment modules ( Search for has Permission ) where the payment module itself is checking the required authorisation .
Huh ?
That 's not a job of the module , that 's a job for the framework .
Database design
If you 're already HTML - encoding all special characters before passing them into the database , then please make the varchar - fields larger :
An é becomes é ( 7 characters ) and if you 're using VARCHAR ( 32 ) , well , the available place runs out pretty quickly .
Plus the error message is non-sensical :
It complains about a string which is cleary fitting into the constraints .
HTML and CSS
The default template looks very nice , but there are some weird chunks of Javascript lying around ( Why submit forms by Javascript when a simple button would do too ? ) .
Plus a lot of styling tags in the HTML source where it does n't belong .
Additionaly , class names like div1 , div2 etc. are rather confusing .
The CSS is clean , though , as far as I can see .
Template code
Templates are kinda weird :
They are not really treated as templates .
Either switch to a real templating system like Smarty or keep them as PHP files .
There is one dynamically extensible area in OpenCart , and that is the Extensions system .
This includes :- Modules ( sideboxes ) - Payment integrations - Shipping Integrations ( rates ) - Order Totals ( discounts , fees , etc ) - Product Feeds ( rss , gbase , etc ) These should never affect the core code .
But you are correct that there are many other mods that do affect the core .
This is an ongoing discussion , and while kohana has been brought up in the past in regards to this , after looking at it breifly , I fail to see how it will really solve our problems .
While it might allow subclassing , it will still have issues with 2 mods changing the same function since subclassing only overrides whole functions and methods .
But there may be more to it than what I 've seen .
I have thought about adding this and it was brought up early on by Daniel but he decided it against it .
But I agree that the ability to dynamically load classes would make things easier .
Desperation leads us the wrong way sometimes
There is a hell of a lot of identical code which is unfortunate .
From what I 've seen , it is a common draw back to MVC in general .
The pro is that you have a more structured design , but the con is that it comes with multiple files .
But I 'm sure there are improvements that could be made .
It seems more to me like leaving it out would be a more lazy approach .
While not necessary , it has a value of marking the end of the file and not wondering if something got cut off .
I suppose the potential problem you refer to is having extra space or carriage returns after the closing tag causing php warnings , which has crept up a few times as well .
I am in 100 % agreement with you here .
I proposed a method of doing this to Daniel 2 weeks ago but he was unhappy with the way that it would mix the framework with the application .
Perhaps your method is a better one by returning the language results to the controller .
But I agree , this is extremely unnecessary and redundant .
Loading of the language should automatically push it to the template for use .
A fair point .
Yea the error messages have historically been off .
Must be greater than 1 and less than 255 does n't cover 1 and 255 .
They should be changed to " between 1 and 255 " or something of that nature .
It 's on the backburner for a change but not a main focus .
Most of the forms are submitted by a link , which is done to allow nice button - style links with images , without using the an actual image with text .
You will note that buttons are all selectable so that a simple language file can change them rather than having to have multiple button images for each language .
So there are no simple buttons ( Because they are ugly ) .
Agreed tho that the inline css needs to be pushed to the stylesheet .
Well as you pointed out before , php is embeddable .
There is no need and has never been a need for a template engine .
Smarty is just a waste of space and uses more characters than just php calls IMO .
It 's an answer to a problem nobody had but now thinks they had .
I think the major bad design here is in the way that template files are really hard - linked to the controllers .
A system like joomla allows you to take ANY html page and add the available tags to it , resulting in thousands of templates being made and promoting popularity .
However , opencart uses a system that requires the template to be designed around the controller and framework , which results in only tens of templates being created , and the slightest change breaks the rest of it .
This is especially true for repeating code in the modules for the main box structure .
That should be pulled from a common place and only the specific code for the module itself should be added .
The tpl structure is just extremely limited from the start and really needs a redesign but that wo n't happen for a while yet while features & stability are the main focus .
All in all , while OpenCart does have some improvements that can be made , comparing it to some of the other popular options like ZenCart and Osc , it is miles ahead in 2 years than they are in 10 .
While it can be tedious and repetitive in places , it is extremely clean looking and something that is missing from almost every other cart I 've tried , proper tabbing .
OpenCart uses the basic 4 space tab for ALL php and 2 space tab for tpl files resulting in a much easier to read process than most other scripts I 've worked with .
That alone made me get involved enough with it to join the team and still Daniel has created an extremely impressive cart overall .
Sometimes it just comes down to preference of design , and you can't always please everyone all of the time , but we are a progressive cart and your ideas and opinions will certainly be discussed and are appreciated .
Thanks !
West Ham eye moving into Olympic Stadium after 2012 Games - but want it to house 60,000 fans
West Ham insist they are still ' hopeful ' of moving to the Olympic Stadium after the London 2012 Games .
The eight - week deadline for would - be tenants of the £ 537 million venue in Stratford , east London , to lodge expressions of interest to the Olympic Park Legacy Company ( OPLC ) ends today .
The club , which is making a joint bid with Newham Council , have spent that time in ' meaningful discussions ' with a range of organisations include UK Athletics ( UKA ) , Essex Cricket and AEG , the owners of the nearby O2 arena , to try and broaden and fine - tune its proposal .
No place like home ... but the London 2012 Stadium will be for West Ham once it 's finished
A West Ham spokesman said : ' We hope that we are called in very soon to get into much more detailed discussions about what is , or is not possible .
' We are extremely excited and cannot wait to take our ideas forward .
We have had positive discussions with UKA for how it would be used for athletics .
' We have also had positive discussions with Essex Cricket about putting on cricket , possibly Twenty20 games .
' There is also the possibility for showcasing rugby , plus concerts and wider general events . '
Newham and Essex Beagles , the local athletics club , have also been contacted by
West Ham about whether there is interest in using the stadium 's athletics warm - up track .
' We realise there is an opportunity for a vibrant multi- sport community , ' the spokesman added .
Leaving Upton Park ?
West Ham David Gold ( left ) and David Sullivan want the Olympic Stadium to house the Hammers
The OPLC will examine and filter out the different bids until June 18 .
A decision on the future use of the Olympic Stadium should be made by the end of March 2011 .
After the 2012 games the venue is set to be reduced from 80,000 seats to 25,000 .
A promise to the International Olympic Committee when London was awarded the
games means it must be used for athletics .
The OPLC is still to confirm how many bids have been made .
It will be less than the 100 - plus registrations on its website which includes journalists and people seeking information about the bidding process .
The Hammers have pitched their proposal as one which will get ' the greatest legacy from the greatest Games ' .
Their plans included a 55,000 - 60,000 capacity stadium - ' our optimum size , ' the spokesman said .
This could potentially be achieved by widening and putting in different types of seating from its Olympics use .
The spokesman added : ' We feel that the stadium itself should be left as untouched as possible .
It should stay the same height but we should look at the roof to see if it
could be extended so that it could cover all seats in football mode . '
LONDON — An action - packed chase through the subway tunnels beneath London 's famed Victoria Station , culminating in a climactic , pulse - pounding fight sequence atop a speeding double - decker bus , did not occur Monday , when a terrorist bomb exploded on a crowded downtown bus after not being defused at the very last moment .
The aftermath of a deadly terrorist attack that was not averted in an edge - of - your - seat finale .
Advertisement
The bombing , which killed 22 and seriously injured at least 30 more , ranks among the worst incidents of terrorism to hit London in years and was not presented in THX digital Surroundsound .
" That 's it , scum — now it 's time to take out the trash , " a grim - faced CIA agent , who had been working closely with a team of Britain 's top anti-terrorism experts , did not say moments before defeating the leader of a mysterious terrorist organization in a deadly , desperate encounter atop the speeding bus .
Advertisement
" It was horrible , just horrible , " said a visibly shaken Edith Nesbitt , 38 , a London homemaker whose 12 - year - old daughter Annalee was badly injured in the explosion .
" Everywhere you turned , there was smoke and death .
So much senseless pain and suffering .
How could anybody do something like this ? "
Annalee is currently listed in critical condition at a local hospital after not being pulled out of harm 's way by a man who lost his own family to a terrorist attack years before and swore never to let another child suffer again , no matter what the cost .

London police officials do not yet know whether the deadly attack — which was not accompanied by selections from today 's hottest acts , including hits by The Chemical Brothers , Foo Fighters and Method Man — was the work of a militant faction of the IRA , Palestinian extremists , or an individual not affiliated with a terrorist organization .
However , evil criminal masterminds bent on destroying the world from their top - secret , high - tech undersea headquarters have been " definitely ruled out " as suspects .
In addition , no psychopathic former FBI demolitions experts who went insane after the deaths of their wives , which to this day they blame on the government agents who originally trained them to be killers , have stepped forward to claim responsibility for the tragedy .
And no streamlined black helicopters , dangling rope ladders from which trained SWAT teams dropped onto the bus at high speeds , arrived on the scene just in time to freeze the bomb 's homemade timer casing with liquid nitrogen , saving the lives of the dozens of innocent people on board .

An ambulance carrying victims not pulled from harm 's way by anyone 's recklessly brave actions .
" Out of nowhere , nobody suddenly leapt onto the bus from the roof of a nearby building , tackling the foul villain behind this unthinkable act , " said shopkeeper Thomas Kent , who lost most of his right arm in the blast .
" Then , after stopping the mad bomber 's plan , nobody got the girl , grabbing her roughly about the waist and kissing her slightly smudged face as the credits rolled . "

Added Kent : " The doctors say my wife may not survive the night . "
Though top Scotland Yard officials have assigned a special team to investigate the crime , they currently have no leads regarding the identity of the culprits or a possible motive .
The officials also have not surprised any onlookers by swimming alive to the surface of the Thames River after driving any speeding sportscars into the river in slow motion , momentarily causing people to think they 'd been killed before emerging unharmed .

" We are slowly sifting through the forensic evidence , but it is still far too early to draw any definitive conclusions about this bombing , " Scotland Yard spokesman Winston Crawford told reporters at a Monday press conference , not held in a room in which any special supercomputer swivels out from behind a giant antique bookcase .
" At this point , all we really know is that none of us have recently slept with any stunning , exotic - looking foreign women who may or may not be working for the Russians , and that there may be as many as a dozen more bodies still underneath the rubble that rescue workers have yet to locate and identify . "
When asked if police have come across any secret satellite photos , coded messages , or double - dealing informants who have revealed a way to track the deadly bombers to their lair , surround them with an elite assault team , and somehow , against all odds , stop them before they kill again , Crawford replied , " No . "
Earlier we disclosed that finally someone with more than just 4 neurons is going to pursue Goldman ; Reuters now confirms that indeed Neil Barofsky is on the case , and , unlike the SEC , may collaborate with the Department of Justice " to see if there are cases of fraud and if AIG and as a result , the American taxpayers , were victims of similar types of fraud . "
Should he find fraud , and let 's not forget that Goldman bought protection on all parties that bought Abacus exposure from it , with a special place in its heart saved for AIG , whose bailout by the US kinda makes all claims that Goldman lost money on its Abacus exposure moot : can someone finally ask Blankfein or Viniar or whoever , how much money Goldman made on its CDS over AIG 's exposure in all Goldman underwritten and AIG purchased CDOs ?
Be it on a total or pro-rata basis .
Anyway , we are tempted to believe there may yet be hope that some justice could after all be served : the SigTarp , whose $ 40 million budget to date , has uncovered more dirt on the US financial system , than the SEC has in its entire history , with its $ 1 billion a year moneyhole .
What is also notable , is Barofsky 's disclosure that he is considering an audit of the role of BlackRock in TARP .
Dear SIGTARP , while you are doing that , please also investigate why the Federal Reserve is actively managing its Maiden Lane portfolio , presumably via BlackRock , and whether BlackRock is also advising the Fed on managing its $ 2.5 trillion SOMA holdings , which as was discussed yesterday has a DV01 of $ 1.5 billion , and is the biggest ticking time bomb at the heart of the US banking system , and just how much any such off - balance sheet hedging costs the US taxpayer .
More from Reuters :
The special inspector general for the government 's bailout program said he would probe whether securities sold by Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N led to losses at AIG and if the American taxpayer was a victim of fraud .
There are seven deals similar to Abacus for which AIG wrote credit default swaps , according to Neil Barofsky , the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
Barofsky said he is in touch with the SEC and will possibly coordinate with the Department of Justice " to see if there are cases of fraud and if AIG and as a result , the American taxpayers , were victims of similar types of fraud . "
Barofsky made the comments in response to questions from the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee , Charles Grassley , at a hearing examining the TARP .
Separately , but also in response to questions , Barofsky said he is considering a broader audit of the role of BlackRock Inc BLK .N in TARP .
" We are doing a number of audits that touch on Blackrock 's role .
And it is an extensive role throughout this financial crisis , " Barofsky said .
For example , current audits , including one on Citigroup Inc's C.N asset guarantee program , touch on Blackrock , he said .
" We are considering doing a more overarching audit report on their role throughout the financial crisis . "
So yes , something may happen ... after about 10 years .
In the meantime , Goldman et al will continue to make record profits , representing an ever increasing portion of total S&P Net Income , thanks only to the yield curve , its monopoly in the fixed income derivative market , and its comprehensive REDI suite which every hedge fund manager uses and signs off on some very peculiar " information sharing " waivers .
Yet who cares what happens in 2020 : by then America will certainly be insolvent .

While some are making objections to the passing car in their own special way , others are n’t really understanding the nature of the technology .
This woman was inside when she spotted the Google car , and leapt up to expose her bra through a window at the passing car .
However she probably failed to realise that – while the existence an anonymised picture of you flashing your underwear is n’t a particularly risky thing in itself – having a picture of you posted on Google Maps while flashing your underwear at work is probably another matter .

Iran has suggested that Washington propose a prisoner swap in return for the release of three Americans who are being held in Tehran after being accused of spying .
According to the Iranian news agency , intelligence minister Heydar Moslehi has ruled out releasing the Americans without what he described as " a gesture " from the US .
The three Americans have not been formally charged with spying but it is an allegation that has appeared , disappeared and reappeared during their 10 months of detention .
They were arrested last July after crossing into Iran illegally from neighbouring Iraq .
Their families say the three were hiking in Iraq 's scenic northern Kurdish region and had strayed across the border by mistake .
The mothers of the Americans returned back home just yesterday after a long - awaited two - day visit to Tehran where they met their children face to face .
Tehran is seeking the release of several Iranians held by the United States but this is the first time a possible prisoner exchange has directly been mentioned by the Islamic republic .

He is the friendly , folksy billionaire next door .
Or is he ?
Jamming on the ukulele , munching chocolate , sipping cherry coke and dispensing homespun wisdom , Warren Buffett effortlessly revels in his popularity as middle America 's favourite businessman .
But as push came to shove , the world 's third - richest man aligned himself firmly with the big beasts of Wall Street .
At this weekend 's annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway investment empire , Buffett , 79 , surprised many of his 40,000 followers with an emphatic defence of Goldman Sachs , showering compliments on its chief executive , Lloyd Blankfein , and declaring that he " loved " his $ 5 bn ( £ 2.7bn at the time ) investment in the embattled bank .
" I do n't hold it against Goldman at all , the fact that allegations have been made by the US Securities and Exchange Commission , " said Buffett , describing himself as " 100 % " behind Blankfein .
He was scornful of $ 840 m losses shouldered by Royal Bank of Scotland 's ABN Amro subsidiary from an allegedly doomed derivatives contract written by Goldman .
" It 's a little hard for me to get terribly sympathetic with the fact that a bank made a dumb credit deal . "
In a remark likely to horrify many campaigners for financial reform , Buffett relished the profits produced by credit - rating agencies , which are blamed by many in Congress for grossly underestimating the risk of a housing collapse and a financial meltdown .
" They succumbed to the same mania as the rest of the world .
They could n't see a world where the residential housing countrywide would collapse , " said Buffett , whose Berkshire Hathaway group owns a stake in the rating agency Moody's .
Yet he said : " If they 're not forced to change the structure around them , it 's a pretty damn good business . "
In an unusually overt intervention in federal politics , Buffett has dispatched a senior Berkshire executive to Washington to fight the Obama administration 's effort to clamp down on derivatives .
The legendary investor is worried that he could be liable for billions of dollars in collateral to underwrite Berkshire Hathaway 's $ 63bn of hedging contracts .
" If we were found to be a ' danger to the system ' by a secretary of the treasury , then we could be required to post collateral on retroactive contracts , " explained Buffett , who objects to having to go back and re-price potentially profitable deals predicting the direction of stockmarket trends .
" We would lose substantial amounts of money . "
Packed into Omaha 's Qwest convention centre , Buffett 's investors , who travel to his annual gatherings from as far afield as India , Europe and Australia , were as enraptured as ever , hanging on his every word and asking occasionally cult - like questions ( one wanted to know Buffett 's " unifying theory " of life ) .
A carnival mood prevailed , with visitors eagerly shopping for Fruit of the Loom underwear , Justin Brands cowboy boots , life insurance policies and Dairy Queen snacks from stalls selling the wares of firms owned by Berkshire Hathaway .
There was a brisk trade in T - shirts bearing Buffett 's smiling face and baby clothes bearing the motto " future Berkshire Hathaway shareholder " .
One shareholder , management teacher Galen Lorem from Los Angeles , had his hair cut in a lime - green mohican with " BRK " – the firm 's trading symbol – shaved into one side of his scalp and a dollar sign etched on the opposite side .
The topiary , he said , was a tribute to Buffett : " He 's such an amazing man , such an inspiration . "
Yet the official tone at the gathering , often dubbed the " Woodstock of capitalism " , was different .
Justin Fuller , a Chicago fund manager who runs a website , Buffetologist.com , said Buffett had noticeably pulled back on his usual bashing of financial elites .
" He certainly stood up for Goldman Sachs a bit more than I 'd have thought .
And I was surprised he was n't more critical of the general Wall Street culture , " said Fuller .
" In the past , there has been more criticism of investment banks and Wall Street generally than at this meeting , which I think is noteworthy . "
At previous get - togethers , Buffett and his business partner , Charlie Munger , are usually only too happy to play to the crowd with jibes at the New York and Washington power bubbles .
The pair make much of their relatively humble lifestyles – Buffett , whose wealth is estimated at $ 47bn , still lives in a suburban house bought for $ 31,500 in 1958 and he celebrated his second wedding in 2006 with a seafood meal at a chain restaurant , Bonefish Grill .
Buffett once described derivatives as " financial weapons of mass destruction " and just last year complained that as the banking crisis ended , " nobody 's going to jail , in fact a lot of them are walking off with tons of money . "
He is disdainful of remuneration consultants and refuses to pay tens of millions to senior executives , arguing that no business chief has ever left his company on the grounds of insufficient money .
He is notoriously anti-intellectual , shunning hi-tech stocks in favour of everyday consumer brands , insurance or bricks and mortar .
He joked on Saturday about buying shares in Harley - Davidson : " I like a business where customers tattoo your name on their chest . "
And Buffett bemoaned the decline in the popularity of newspapers , saying that although he loves newsprint , the " primacy " of the medium had withered .
He owns one publication , the Buffalo News , and looked at buying the Philadelphia Enquirer before deciding the sums did not add up .
" The math is really tough – the distribution cost , the printing cost , " said Buffett , who laments the decline of print media .
" It 's as vital to me as everyone but clearly , it 's changed for the populus as a whole . "
Berkshire Hathaway shareholders are overwhelmingly protective and supportive of Buffett , valuing the phenomenal returns thrown up by his business empire .
The firm 's book value has grown from $ 19 to $ 84,487 a share over 45 years , an annual growth rate of 20 % .
The company has only had four " down " years since 1980 and the price of a single A share is an eye - watering $ 115,325 .
Mark Roth , a New York publisher , praised Buffett 's " calm , rational thinking " and said it would have been foolish ever to doubt Buffett 's affinity with Wall Street : " There 's this notion that because he's in Omaha , he 's not part of Wall Street .
Anyone who engages in these financial transactions is a part of Wall Street . "
But with bankers ' popularity at a low ebb , if anything singes Buffett 's popularity , it could yet be his push against the White House 's legislation that seeks to make derivatives transparent and less risky .
Last week , Buffett 's home state senator , Ben Nelson , infuriated his party by becoming the only Democrat to vote not once but three times , against Obama 's package of Wall Street regulatory reforms .
The overhaul ranges from a tax on banks to the so - called Volcker rule banning risky trading .
Nelson , who has shares in Berkshire Hathaway and counts the company as his biggest campaign donor , admitted that he was siding with Republicans because he opposed the bill 's derivatives measures .
Nelson accepted that he had been lobbied on the issue by Buffett 's company .
But he insisted that other businesses in Nebraska would be affected and he lashed out at the " parlour game of wild speculation " when political political bloggers questioned his loyalties , complaining that he was a victim of a " cesspool of gotcha politics " .

I ’m depressed .
As you guys know , I ’m a news junkie .
I listen to right wing news , liberal news , conservative talk , liberal talk , you name it , I engage in it .
My news addiction had become the bane of my existence .
I ’m not depressed because of a giant oil spill in the Gulf Of Mexico .
I ’m not depressed because a lunatic tried to detonate a bomb in Times Square .
I ’m not even depressed because our financial system is hanging by a thread .
I ’m depressed because all of that media that I diligently take in every day is either batshit crazy , or utterly uninformative .
Let ’s start with the BP oil disaster .
The right wing media has been cooking up a conspiracy theory that the whole situation was n’t an accident , but that it was sabotage .
I ’m not going to go into details about the conspiracy theories , because that would be a giant waste of my time and yours .
But Media Matters has compiled a good synopsis .
The crux of it is basically that the white house orchestrated the spill so that President Obama could renege on his offshore drilling plans .
Really ?
He created a monumental oil spill that will potentially fuck up three states so that he does n’t have to risk expanding offshore drilling , which he ’s opposed to , because it could fuck up nearby states ?
Has anybody ever heard anything more stupid ?
We just lived through eight years of George W Bush , and this is still the dumbest thing I ’ve ever heard !
I ’m not depressed because the right wing is crazy and stupid .
Sadly , I ’ve come to expect that they will be .
I ’m depressed because there is a legitimate criticism of Obama that we ’ll never hear .
Obama never should have consented to expand offshore drilling .
We have mountains of evidence to show that it ca n’t be done with 100 % certainty that something wo n’t go wrong .
I ’m not opposed to it because it sounds bad .
I ’m opposed to it because logic and reasoning tell me that when you ’re drilling under 16,000 pounds of pressure per square inch , a lot of shit can go wrong .
And with that kind of pressure , the tiniest thing that goes wrong , rips the whole pipeline open .
The legitimate attack on Obama is that his administration did n’t do enough to impose stronger safety regulations on the oil industry and that , like Bush before him , he let the oil industry largely police themselves .
But we ’ll never hear that from the opposition because they are wearing ideological handcuffs .
They want offshore drilling , regardless of the very real and now , demonstrable downside .
This is an ideology that is n’t based in facts therefore , it is an an ideology that is impervious to cogent debate .
The right wing , who hated Ted Kennedy never went after him for blocking the building of wind farms in his backyard .
THERE was a legitimate criticism of someone they loathed , and yet they never raised it because they do n’t want to get off our oil dependency .
Ideological handcuffs are preventing them from taking legitimate shots at the opposition .
Let ’s move onto the failed attempt to bomb Times Square on Saturday .
As usual , the right wing was a bottomless pit of useless , uninformative , and crazy .
FOX spent its time trying to prop up the Bush administration by falsely claiming that there were no successful attacks on US soil after 9/11 .
Brian Kilmeade had his panties in a bunch over the reports that the suspect was ( OMG ) white !
Let me digress for a moment to say to Mr. Kilmeade , “ Hey ASSHOLE , I do n’t care what color this psychopath is .
I just want him caught , and so should you ! ” .
I have to admit that my initial reaction to this stupidity was to hope that the suspect was not only white , but was married to Brian Kilmeade ’s cousin .
But then I realized that my reaction would make me as guilty and stupid as FOX .
I do n’t have a racial dog in this race and neither should anyone else .
I ’m a New Yorker .
The only thing I want is to catch this shitbag .
Based on the information that we had at the time , should n’t the conversation have been about the rise of domestic terrorism ?
Or maybe , we could have had a discussion about how people become radicalized .
But no , we ca n’t have that from the right because implying that crazy does n’t have a minimum melanin requirement would contradict their narrative that brown people are to be feared .
It ’s not terrorism if the terrorist is n’t Muslim .
Guess what ?
Crazy does n’t have a color .
It ’s not born , it ’s created .
We need to talk about how it ’s created and why it ’s created .
Now onto financial reform .
I ’ve realized that the worst sources for any sort of information on economic matters are CNBC , FOX Business , Bloomberg , or any other business channel .
None of them will report what actually caused the collapse , or what needs to be done to ensure that it will never be done again .
They can ’t .
Watch the commercials that air on these networks , and you ’ll see why they can ’t .
When a company is spending $ 50 M a month on advertising on your network , are you really free to report them in a negative light ?
Have you ever wondered why you see commercials on TV for products you ca n ’t buy ?
Why would Dow Chemical , Lockheed Martin , or Boeing spend money on prime time ad buys when you ca n’t buy their products ?
Because they ’re buying insurance .
The networks they advertise with would never risk losing that giant pile of ad dollars , just to keep you informed .
If you ’re watching news or commentary on television , you need to pay more attention to the advertisers than you do to the content .
Here ’s a great clip of audio from a comedian named Jimmy Dore , talking about NBC ’s reporting on the financial reform bill .
It ’s thirteen minutes long , but well worth the listen :

I ’m depressed because a freaking comedian is more informative than any of the news outlets that are available to me .
He makes an excellent point about how network news is completely devoid of anything resembling investigative journalism anymore .
They have become stenographers , relaying information from both sides , making sure that they create a false equivalency in the process .
Our media is handcuffed by financial interests .
Ironically , the best source of legitimate criticism for the Obama administration on television comes from Jon Stewart .
Rachel Maddow and Keith Olbermann come in second and third to the comedian .
My favorite source for intelligent , unbiased analysis is The Young Turks .
Give them a listen .
You can get the first hour of their podcast for free through iTunes .
I did n’t love them when I first started listening two years ago , but they ’re the first thing I listen to every day now .
They are n’t handcuffed in the same way that everyone else out there is .
I ’m depressed that comedians are doing a better job of informing Americans than traditional media is .
These ideological and financial handcuffs that plague our media is the reason why most Americans have no idea what ’s what anymore .
After a recent run of retro - themed bikes , I ’ve been waiting for a contemporary machine to catch my eye .
And finally , Ducati has delivered the goods with a 2010 model that will probably be regarded as an all - time classic in 2030 .
The $ 39,995 1198 R Corse is a special edition of the 1198 , with mostly cosmetic changes .
That ’s a testament to the soundness of the 1198 platform , but the bike does come with a ‘ race kit ’ for true power junkies .
The big bore Desmo 90° L - Twin produces 180 hp in standard mode and 186 hp when using the race kit ( “ intended strictly for track use only ” , Ducati says ) .
You also get a Termignoni racing exhaust system with carbon fibre mufflers and a rear paddock stand .
The gearbox has a very high ratio 6th gear , “ fully enabling the speed increase achieved from additional performance modifications ( suggested for track use only ) . ”
But the highlight for me is visual — the gorgeous fuel tank .
Weighing 1kg ( 2.2lb ) less than the stock tank , it also boosts capacity by 2.5 litres to 18 litres ( 4.75 US gal ) .
And it ’s brush - finished and clear - coated to maintain a factory team look .
Molto bella .

Sleep has long been known to improve performance on memory tests .
Now , a new study suggests that an afternoon power nap may boost your ability to process and store information tenfold -- but only if you dream while you 're asleep .
" When you dream , your brain is trying to look at connections that you might not think of or notice when [ you 're ] awake , " says the lead author of the study , Robert Stickgold , the director of the Center for Sleep and Cognition at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , in Boston , Massachusetts .
" In the dream ... the brain tries to figure out what 's important and what it should keep or dump because it's of no value . "
In the study , Stickgold and his colleagues asked 99 college students to memorize a complex maze on a computer .
The researchers then placed the students inside a virtual , 3 - D version of the maze and asked them to navigate to another spot within it .
After doing this several times , half of the participants took a 90 - minute nap while the other half stayed awake and watched videos .
Health.com :
What 's keeping you awake at night ?
When the students were given the maze test again five hours later , the nappers did better than the students who had stayed awake , even those who had reviewed the maze in their heads .
However , the nappers who dreamed about the maze -- one described being lost in a bat cave -- performed 10 times better than the nappers who did n't .
The students who dreamed about the maze did poorly on the test the first time around -- which may not be a coincidence , the researchers say .
If a task is difficult for you , your brain seems to know it , and you may be more likely to dream about it than if the task were easier .
" If you 're not good at something , and you dream about it , you seem to get better at it -- especially if the information can be used in different situations , " says Michael Breus , the clinical director of the sleep division for Arrowhead Health , in Glendale , Arizona , who was not involved in the study .
" The sleeping brain seems to be processing information on one level , but on a higher level it helps evolve your memory network if the information is relevant or helpful in your life experience , " adds Breus , who is also the author of " Beauty Sleep . "
The study 's findings , which appear in the journal Current Biology , underscore just how important sleep is to our memory and mental function .

It does n't even need to be a deep sleep , as the researchers found when they monitored the brain activity of the students while they slept .
Although the deep slumber known as rapid eye movement ( REM ) is most closely associated with dreaming , the students ' dreaming and learning occurred after as little as one minute of non-REM sleep .
Health.com : Turn your bedroom into a sleep haven
The type of learning that occurs while you dream can be illustrated by the classic dream that many people have in which they show up for an exam that they have n't studied for , Stickgold says .
" When you 're in school -- especially college -- there 's this ongoing sense that you have n't done enough , " he says .
" Maybe you did n't make it to a lecture , or you had a paper due in three days that you had n't started , so you 're laying down memories that say , ' I have n't done anything that I need to do . ' "
When someone has the exam dream ( or nightmare ) , he says , " Your brain is taking the knowledge of what happened to help you behave differently in the future . "
You may be able to harness the dream power displayed in the study to perform better in your everyday life , Breus says .

How to sleep easier and avoid midday fatigue
" If you 're studying something tough , get the basics down and take a nap .
If you dream about it , you will probably understand it better , " he says .
" Or , go to bed a little earlier the night before , wake up early , review the material , and then take a quick nap to solidify your understanding . "
That 's good advice , says Dr. Rafael Pelayo , an associate professor of sleep medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine , in Palo Alto , California .
" Instead of cramming , study intensely , catch a nap , and then maybe do some more studying , " he says .
" A nap may be a good tool to enhance your ability to remember information . "

How to cope with less sleep at work
Like a Government , Minus the Hypocrisy
The US government rolled out its latest crackdown on “ organized crime ” last week , announcing indictments versus 14 alleged members of the Gambino “ family . ”
Every time some prosecutor struts out with this kind of thing , I ’m reminded of the sign that Congressman Ron Paul supposedly keeps on his desk : “ Do n’t steal — the government hates competition . ”
Charges against the accused mafiosi include murder , racketeering , prostitution and jury tampering — in other words , activities the government itself engages in on a daily basis .
If the government kills you ( and governments have killed hundreds of millions over the last century ) , it ’s legal .
If the mob kills you , it ’s a crime .
If you ’re the killer , you ’re a soldier or enforcer in either case , but be sure to put scare quotes around the word if you ’re not a government employee .
Drag a businessman out of his establishment and board the place up because he did n’t fork over for the proper “ business permits , ” you ’re a “ public servant . ”
Drag a businessman out of his establishment and set the place on fire because he did n’t cough up “ protection money , ” you ’re a goon .
Play the government lottery , you ’re an upstanding citizen .
Put $ 50 on your neighborhood numbers game — or worse , help set up that game — you ’re a crook .
Give a pimp or madam a hundred bucks for an hour with one of his escorts , you ’re a john .
Pay the county clerk $ 50 for a “ marriage license ” and keep up with the attendant annual tax penalties , have all the sex you want for life — it ’s “ legit . ”
Buy or sell an oxycodone tablet on the street , you ’re a “ drug dealer ” or a “ substance abuser . ”
Get a license from the DEA to sell , or a prescription from a doctor to buy , that same pill and you ’re a “ pharmacist ” or a “ patient . ”
Pressure a jury to acquit your associate , you ’re a “ mobster ” engaged in “ jury tampering . ”
Pressure a jury to convict your opponent , you ’re a “ prosecutor ” making good use of “ voir dire . ”
The differences between what Barack Hussein Obama II does on a daily basis and what John Gotti , Jr. is accused of doing are n’t differences of kind , they ’re differences of degree .
And even if Gotti ’s guilty , he comes out of the comparison looking like a piker .
Furthermore , while the legend of the American mafia is rife with tales of the boss - men dispensing charity in their neighborhoods , through their churches and among their ethnic group , there ’s no pretense that that charity is what the enterprise is all about .
“ La Cosa Nostra ” is crime for profit , without evasion or apology .
It ’s “ we ’ve got the muscle , and you ’ll play and pay or we ’ll hurt you . ”
It ’s like a government , without the hypocrisy .
Of all the things I hate about government , it ’s this :
These grifters rake a double - digit percentage off the top of damn near every payroll and sale of goods or services in their countries .
They use part of that money to ensconce themselves in oak - paneled offices , pay themselves healthy salaries , and provide for their own well - appointed retirements .
The rest of the money , they use to reward their benefactors and allies with sinecures and monopolies and sweetheart contracts , and to punish their victims and competitors with extortion , abduction , sometimes even death .
Just like the mafia writ large .
Except that the mafia does n’t try to tell us it ’s for our own good .
The mafia does n’t pose as our benefactor .
The mafia does n’t guilt - trip us for our vices while simultaneously profiting from those vices .
Unlike government , the mafia does n’t give us the 1950s - television - dad , more - in - sorrow - than - in - anger , “ this is going to hurt me more than it hurts you ” line when it takes off its belt .
It does n’t pretend to be helping you , or to be protecting society from you .
When the mafia comes after you , it wants you ( and anyone who ’s watching ) to know that you ’re utterly screwed and being made an example of .
Government wants to be feared like the mafia — and loved like Dear Old Dad .
I take back what I said about government being like the mafia minus the hypocrisy .
The comparison is insulting — to the mafia .

75MHz Pentium , 8MB RAM , 800MB hard drive , 10.4 - inch 640 x 480 LCDGoing through high school in the early '90s , computing was at the time something done at home -- probably in a rickety office chair at a narrow desk .
If you were lucky you might get the keyboard and mouse cables to stretch over to the couch and , if you could make out what was happening on the 15 - inch CRT from there , you might be able to get in a few games of Command & Conquer in relative comfort .
It would n't be until entering college in 1996 that I 'd get my first taste of computing on the go in the form of a Toshiba Satellite Pro 400CS .
Hartwick College , my alma mater , was at the time doing something rather interesting : " giving " ( as part of tuition ) each incoming freshman a laptop that they would then be required to use throughout their four ( or five ... or more ) years at the school .
Given the speed of technical progression during this time you can imagine that , four years later , few would still be relying entirely on these clunky gray boxes , but we were the first class to get lots of exciting and new tech .
( CD - ROM drives !
Color VGA screens !
Windows 95 !)
And , thanks to a PCMCIA NIC , we could tether ourselves into one of the many Ethernet cables that were slowly coiling their way around campus .
It was never a very good gaming machine , but it was on here that I honed my programming skills , wrote editorials for the local paper , and spent a little too much time pretending to be Don Juan on IRC .
By junior year the various software development environments I was using required more horsepower and the videogames I was reviewing needed a graphics card , so I built myself a desktop and gave up on the mobile life .
It 'd be 10 years before I 'd buy myself another portable machine , a little Eee that offers roughly 21 times the processing power and far greater battery life in a much smaller package all for a fraction of the price -- yet still felt too slow .
So , I 've since moved on again to a Lenovo T400s , but I have a feeling no machine will ever trump the many hours I spent clacking away on the giant keyboard of that big gray brick of a laptop .
CHANNEL EXP TM 332T P2-366 6.4GB 64MB 12.1 TFT
24X WIN98
It was n't until sometime in early 2001 that I finally took the plunge .
I was always envious of these " road warriors " with their " mobile telephony " and ability to read Suck.com in coffee shops and libraries , but for the most part laptops were large and ugly , and when they were n't they were well out of my price range .
When a friend of mine offered to sell me a two year old Acer TravelMate 332T I lept at the chance !
The specs , by no means heroic , were more than adequate for the novels and communiques I would be writing on the Hunter S. Thompson - esque journeys I imagined myself making : an Intel Pentium II 366MHz processor , 64MB RAM , 12.1 - inch display , Windows 98 .
And the thing was tiny !
Roughly the same thickness as my MacBook , the only concession to the antiquated storage of the time was a detachable CD - ROM / 3.5 - inch FDD that communicated the thing by means of a proprietary cable .
I do n't believe I ever used this .
The case also featured some sort of " magnesium - alloy chassis for durability , " although it mostly seemed like it was made out of plastic .
My friend offered to sell me the computer for $ 200 -- it will be no surprise to anyone who knows me that I somehow talked him up to $ 350 by the time the transaction was completed ( it should also come as no surprise that I was a little intoxicated at the time ) .
That said , my TravelMate was a constant companion for years in busses , planes , and hotel rooms , and I got a lot of work done on that thing !
Definitely worth every penny that I spent on it .300 MHz Pentium II CPU , 128MB of SDRAM , 6GB hard drive , DVD - ROM , floppy drive , 14.1 - inch 1,024 x 768 LCDUp until the purchase of this here WinBook , I had used desktops exclusively .
And my life was fine .
I saw no need to take a computer with me wherever I went , and it seemed that I was always a 15 minute drive away from the nearest desktop .
Eventually , however , I became hooked on Half - Life -- Team Fortress in particular .
My love for this title was so strong that I began to yearn for it when away from home , and believe it or not , I began to feel that I could n't live a week without some access to the Internet .
At the time , all I knew was a 56 k dial - up connection , but I figured I could dial - in from anywhere if I had a mobile machine .
I paid far , far too much for this heap .
I can't even recall the exact amount ( call it a self - protection mechanism ) , but I purchased it used from a highly enthusiastic eBayer .
I remember getting it , opening the box with wide - eyes , nailing the power button and wondering what on Earth was taking so long .
' Course , I 'd probably been spoiled by the boot - up power of my best bud 's Alienware desktop , but still -- this thing was slow .
Truth be told , I was never happy with the WinBook .
The battery life was awful ( 1.5 hours of real - world use , on average ) , the screen had to be looked at directly , and my precious Half - Life was just barely playable at the lowest resolution setting .
The only shining moment in this thing 's life was that time it enabled me to hop online at my auntie 's house ; if not for that , I think I would 've perished from boredom .
A little over six months after this monstrosity came into my life , it was re-listed on eBay and sold to some other sucker .
I always wondered how long it would take for laptops to become anywhere near as powerful as desktops , and I swore up and down I would n't buy another portable machine until the gap was closed .
A few years later , I sunk entirely too much money into the " world 's first " 17 - inch laptop ( a 1GHz PowerBook G4 ) , and six months later , I sold it for the same reason as the WinBook .
Some say I never learn .
Look , I stole my actual first laptop .
It was a Wall Street PowerBook , with a 233MHz G3 and not enough RAM .
I did n't feel bad about it at the time for a variety of reasons , but I do now ... kind of .
Anyway , that machine was n't very interesting to me , because I never used it .
Seriously , this might date me , but the University of Chicago did n't install its first WiFi access points until my fourth year , so having a laptop just was n't a thing -- almost everyone I knew had some sort of giant tower with a CRT and an direct Ethernet connection .
What good was a six - pound laptop that could just barely run Word 98 ?
I left it at home , next to my Sawtooth G4 and guilty conscience .
Later on I sold it -- and used the proceeds to buy a used first - gen white iBook from one of my roommates , who 'd gotten himself caught up with a notorious eBay scammer named Teresa Smith , a woman who later went to jail for bilking like 350 people out of a total of $ 880,000 .
These kinds of things just sort of happened to me in college .
Anyway , so yeah -- I got off to an ignominious start on the mobile computing tip .
But let 's talk about my first interesting laptop : a first - gen 15 - inch aluminum PowerBook G4 , for which I paid full retail using legitimately - earned American dollars , a machine I used from my first year of law school until literally the night before the Macworld 2008 keynote , when it stopped booting and I had to race out and pick up a MacBook so I could work the next day .
Man , I loved that PowerBook -- most everyone in law school takes notes on a laptop , and I stuck it out with that painfully - slow G3 iBook through my first semester because I knew the titanium G4 was due to be replaced and I wanted the new model .
It was painful , but worth it ; I bought a 1.25 GHz model with 512MB of RAM ( later upgraded to 1GB ) over Christmas break and never looked back .
I used the hell out of that PowerBook -- Madison was n't great about having WiFi all over on campus until my 2L year , but I still took it everywhere in my backpack .
Having access to the internet anywhere I went was simply wild -- and when Engadget launched in 2004 I found the perfect distraction from studying .
By the end of its run the top part of case was almost completely unglued , the sides were dented so badly the PC card slot was unusable , and the battery had about 10 minutes of juice left in it .
What can I say ?
I love my babies hard .
Now I 've got a very - similar MacBook Pro , which looks the same but just feels like a tool to me -- maybe the unibody MBP that 's been sitting unused on my dining table for three months will once again capture my fancy when I finally find the time to set it up .
But I doubt it .400 MHz Mobile Celeron , 64MB RAM , 5.7GB hard drive , 14.1 - inch 1024 x 768 LCDI grew up in an exclusively Dell household .
There was a period of time where I 'll plainly admit that I desperately wanted a ZEOS Pantera -- and a brief ( and inexplicable ) brush with lust for the IBM PS / 1 when I was just a sprout -- but alas , we stayed true to our code .
The 90s , of course , were a time when computers were still viewed exclusively as tools , not as extensions of one 's personality , so it did n't bug us that we were buying nondescript beige boxes ;
Dells were reliable , generally speedier than many of their competitors , and could be infinitely customized to suit your needs .
You could n't say that about the Compaqs down at CompUSA .
Though I 'm hardly the youngest member of the Engadget team , I was a late bloomer as laptops go ; I 'd always preferred desktops ( or more accurately , I could afford desktops ) .
When I needed them somewhere else , I just tucked them under my arm and away I went .
My first laptop purchase was an Inspiron 3800 somewhere around 1999 or 2000 that I named Xenon ( every computer I 've ever owned is named after an element -- it makes finding the machines on a network a little bit friendlier ) and got me through a couple years of college .
I ran Windows 2000 on it -- which I still believe to be a turning point for Microsoft and perhaps the single greatest version of Windows ever made -- and occasionally played Final Fantasy III with an emulator during impossibly boring Electromagnetics lectures .
Was it cool ?
No , not really , but it got the job done just long enough to upgrade to that killer new Inspiron 8100.400 MHz PowerPC G3 , 64MB of RAM , 6GB hard drive , DVD - ROM , 14.1 - inch 1024 x 768 LCDI longed for a laptop for much longer than is strictly healthy .
As a longstanding Mac user ( thanks , dad ) , I loved telling my PC - loving friend back in 7th grade how ugly ThinkPads were , particularly in comparison to Apple 's works of art .
But the price was simply unbearable , and with no decent low - end alternative to the PowerBook class , I was stuck with my dreams and a hunk of beige desktop on my desk .
Finally , after saving up about $ 1 ,500 my sophomore year of high school , I coaxed another grand from my parents in the form of a loan and finally purchased the base model PowerBook G3 .
Mere months later , and after years of minor iterations of its pro-level plastic chassis , Apple debuted the all - new Titanium PowerBook G4 .
Yeah , I was a little peeved .
Still , I loved my dear " Pismo . "
I remember freaking people out by walking around with it on my hand like a platter , pecking at the keys with my free hand .
Once I 'd added the optional AirPort card , things got silly great .
I was addicted to WiFi , using my laptop from any corner of the house that would have me , for as long as my battery would last .
I 'd frequently pop out the modular DVD - ROM drive and swap it with the dummy spacer to save on weight ( I was too poor for the second battery ) , and I generally perceived myself to be the most powerful human on the planet when equipped with the machine .
I think what eventually ended my reign of internet and graphics dominance was OS X .
Despite the after market RAM upgrades I 'd done to get the machine up to 192MB , and the 20GB hard drive I 'd swapped in , I was still hardly a match for those beastly early versions of OS X .
I downgraded to OS 9 eventually , but the damage was done : developers , the internet , and the " future " was going to OS X , and me and my delicious OS 9 could only hang on so long .
I was eventually forced to purchase an eMachines desktop to keep up with the times and my somehow diminishing amount of discretionary income .
For less than $ 500 I had oodles of more computing power and expandability at my fingertips , but Windows never felt right to me , and I bought a MacBook a few years later .
Looking back on my first laptop fills me with fond memories of being young , stupid , and light on money .
The time was mid-2000 , the place was Philadelphia .
I had just moved to the city from Pittsburgh after a group of my friends had made the cross -state transition .
I was in a new place surrounded by new people , and woefully in need of a laptop ( though at this time , it was mainly to play network games of Myth II at my friend Damian 's apartment ) .
As a frequent shopper at 911 Records in the city , I 'd made friends with some of the employees and managed to strike up fairly comfortable conversations .
After sorting through a stack of records one day , I learned that a staff member was looking to unload a PowerBook G3 ( a Pismo to be exact ) for a shockingly small amount of coin -- maybe too small in retrospect , and I probably should have asked him just how he'd come by the device in the first place ( ah , the ignorance of youth ) .
I could n't really afford it at the cut -rate discount , but I could afford the shame of not having a laptop of my own even less .
Somehow I scraped together just enough cash to make a first installment on the then - cutting - edge notebook , and promised to pay the rest as soon as humanly possible ( which luckily was n't too long down the road ) .
I 'll never forget the day I managed to buy myself that second battery pack for extended gaming sessions ( if you 'll remember the laptop had two swappable bays on either side ) .
The Pismo is still somewhere in my old studio , collecting dust on the record shelf I 'd filled with vinyl from those days ... one of them still seems like money well spent .
600MHz PowerPC G3 , 640MB RAM , 20GB hard drive , CD-RW / DVD-ROM , 12.1 - inch 1024 x 768 LCDLike many young geeks , I had always wanted a laptop , but invariably wound up getting desktop after desktop .
The bang for the buck was always too great to pass up and -- in my younger days , at least -- laptops were never really well - suited for gaming , which was always a top consideration .
That finally changed after a year or so in university , however , when I finally got an iBook G3 ( a late 2001 , " dual USB " model ) -- not only my first laptop , but my first Mac .
I 'd used Macs previously , of course , and would have liked to get one sooner but , again , the extra cost was hard to justify for a student , and Macs had their own issues with gaming .
But changing priorities led to a change in computers and , in many ways , I have n't looked back .
The dual USB iBook G3 ( or " iceBook " ) was n't a huge leap over its predecessor in terms of performance , but it broke completely with past iBooks in terms of style , and it still does n't look too shabby by today 's standards .
In fact , I continued to use it as a backup laptop until just a few years ago , having maxed out the RAM to 640 MB , added a FireWire hard drive and an AirPort card , and upgraded the OS to Panther .
I still have it tucked away , and sometimes feel like firing it up for old times .
If only I could get it to boot .
1.6GHz Pentium 4 - M , 256MB of RAM , 30 GB hard drive , DVD / CD -RW drive , 14.1 - inch 1024 x 768 LCDIt was the summer of 2002 , which marked the end of my second year at my British boarding school ( in the Third Form or Year 9 ) .
I told my parents that there 'd be a lot of projects from then onwards , but really , I was just mightily jealous of the two guys in my year who had a laptop each , and they were n't even good machines -- both were very hot and noisy .
Back then I already had " It runs on a Celeron ! " as my catchphrase ( accompanied by a shaking head ) , but strangely I knew little about laptops , and at one point I even considered lugging a small desktop from Hong Kong all the way to the English countryside .
Fortunately , in August I stumbled upon a pretty impressive laptop demo -- a salesman banging his fist onto the back of a laptop screen .
It was the Fujitsu LifeBook C2010 , a $ 1,930 Windows XP machine featuring a power - hungry Pentium 4 processor , a DVD / CD - RW combo drive , a floppy drive and some sort of tough metal alloy casing .
I was sold , and I remember the excitement from watching the laptop 's first - ever boot - up at the shop .
" Mum , this thing is really fast ! "
Two weeks later I was back in England and showing off my speedy seven - pound laptop to my schoolmates .
Needless to say , there were a few envious looks among the jolly crowd .
This beast lasted me the remaining four years at school , during which I performed a few upgrades ( RAM , HDD and DVD drive ) plus a couple of teardowns for cleaning ( and scaring my friends ) .
As I entered university I moved on to the ASUS A8Ja for its better portability plus graphics performance , and consequently my mother is now the proud owner of my C2010 back in Hong Kong -- apart from the dead battery , everything 's working in fine order including the stiff hinge .
That said , two years after my Fujitsu purchase I encouraged my younger brother to buy the C2210 , which turned out to be a major flop -- loose hinge , dead pixels , overheat issues and faulty motherboard within the first two years .
He never asked me for computer shopping advice again . [ Image credit : TaoBao 2.0 GHz Pentium 4 - M , 512MB of RAM , Mobility Radeon 9000 64MB , 40 GB 5400 RPM hard drive , DVD / CD - RW drive , 15 - inch 1600 x 1200 LCDIn fall 2002 , I was wholly undecided .
Flush with cash from a successful summer job , I was advised by friends and family both that when I left for college the following year , I 'd do well to invest that money in a laptop .
Newspapers wrote about how laptops boosted student productivity .
It sounded like a great idea .
On the other hand , 2002 was the year I started to really indulge in LAN parties , and it would be generous to say my AMD K6 desktop gaming rig was getting dated .
Google search and computer - savvy friends told me that on my budget , I could n't do both .
Dell Outlet proved them all wrong .
For about $ 1700 , I found a fully - loaded , refurbished Dell Inspiron 8200 laptop that gave me not only my first personal DVD drive and my first disc burner , but also -- with a discrete Radeon 9000 graphics card and a fast Pentium 4 processor -- beat the pants off of every heavy , CRT - laden desktop my friends carried to our LAN parties .
While I had to keep a pair of PCMCIA cards around to provide USB 2.0 and WiFi , the Inspiron 's huge 15 - inch , 1600 x 1200 screen made it a fantastic desktop replacement , and two eight - cell Li-ion batteries gave me a whole three hours ( imagine that ! ) of on - the - go battery life .
Weighing nearly nine pounds without the AC adapter , I never once actually took it to class , but when I lived in Japan in 2005 it became my only ( fiber - optic ! ) link to the English - speaking world , and as late as 2007 my younger brother was kicking tail and taking names with the old girl in Battlefield 2 before the GPU died .
Though I 've never again had quite as good an experience with Dell , I 've recommended refurbished machines ever since .
1.7 - GHz Mobile Intel Pentium 4 Processor -M , 256MB DDR SDRAM , 40GB hard drive , DVD / CD - RW drive , 1600x1200 - resolution 15 - inch display , Microsoft Windows XP HomeI now feel comfortable enough with my nerdy self to admit that when I was accepted early admission to college I was more excited about getting a laptop I could call my own than the frat parties , err collegiate education that lay ahead .
So after collecting close to $ 2,000 in graduation presents , I headed to Dell.com and eagerly configured an Inspiron 8200 with a then - state - of - the - art 1.7GHz Pentium processor , 256MB of RAM and a 60 GB hard drive .
" Delly , " as a friend of mine named her , rarely left my side over the next four years – it witnessed the churning out of a 150 - page thesis , the downloading of way too much Wyclef , and the exchange of countless , not - always - sober IMs .
Even despite a few hard drive crashes , screen issues and RAM upgrades it always managed to get its large , dual fans up and running again .
Thank you , campus IT department .
Funny enough I pulled out eight - pound " Delly " while writing this , and there are still parts about the ten year - old , 15 - inch Inspiron that best even some of the thinnest and lightest laptops / netbooks I 've reviewed over the past few years .
The matte keys are still molded to my fingers , and the touchpad is n't riddled with finicky multitouch features .
Of course , things are downhill at boot up -- it makes an Atom Z Series netbook look like a multimedia powerhouse , and the Linksys external WiFi card to get on the net it shot , but I 'm sure I 'll find some use for this swappable floppy drive I 've got sitting right here .

Pressed in a committee meeting by U.S. Sen.
Patrick J. Leahy , she said the government had tried to make the expansion as small as possible , but that it could n't get any smaller and still work .
If the Morses Line Port of Entry can't be expanded , it may have to close , the CBP statement said .
" Our airports , seaports , and land ports of entry are all part of an interconnected security network to facilitate entry and exit to and from our country , " the agency said in a statement Tuesday .
" When we fail to fortify one , we weaken the entire system , putting our national security at risk . "
Originally , a $ 15 million expansion was planned , using 10 acres of the Rainville farm .
That plan has since been scaled back .
It calls for a two - story building on 1.5 acres , with the rest of the parcel devoted to parking , vehicle turnaround space , a stormwater pond , water well , septic and security fencing .
Trucks passing through have to be inspected as they sit on Morses Line Road , because the porte - cochere that hangs over the one inspection lane is n't big enough to accommodate them .
The building , which went up in 1936 after the government seized about a half - acre of land from the farm 's then - owner , is outdated by any standards .
Its detention area is a bench with a set of handcuffs attached to one end , just inside the glass front door .
The public need is national security , according to Customs and Border Protection .
" The arrogance of it is breathtaking , " said Brian Rainville , 37 , whose parents and two brothers run the 220 - acre farm and milk 80 cows on it .
" Why are we being asked to make that kind of sacrifice when they can't demonstrate a public need ? "
Owners of the Rainville dairy farm were told last week that if they wo n't sell the hayfield for $ 39,500 , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will use eminent domain to seize it .
Not the U.S. Department of Homeland Security :
The government , which got $ 420 million from the federal bailout to modernize land ports like this , wants to spend about $ 7 million to build an expanded station .
To do it , the government says , it needs an adjoining 4.9 - acre parcel now used to grow hay and corn .
Some here think the World War II - era brick structure that houses the border station should be abandoned entirely .
On average , 2 1/ 2 cars pass through an hour .
The pace is so slow that U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents who man it have been known to fill out their days by driving golf balls in an adjoining meadow , shooting skeet or washing their cars .
At the Morses Line Port of Entry , on the U.S. - Canada border , the border station is located smack - dab in the middle of a Vermont dairy farm .
" This is one of those things where we are trying to work with the owners to get down to the footprint .
I believe it 's actually been reduced down from 5 acres to 1.5 acres in terms of what CBP has determined it needs to actually do the kind of port improvement there -- there 's a certain minimum amount , unless you do it , you might as well not do it at all . "
Leahy , who has taken up the Rainvilles ' cause , believes it 's not necessary at all .
" If it 's not necessary , let 's spend that money to improve other stations where there 's heavy traffic and there are delays , " said Leahy , D - Vt .
In an interview , CBP spokesman Rafael Lemaitre would n't address the Rainvilles ' complaints .
" CBP takes the concerns of our partners , including those in Congress and the local community , very seriously and has been in frequent contact with all stakeholders involved with the Morses Line Port of Entry over the past year , " he said in the statement .
" CBP looks forward to discussing any outstanding issues as we work to find a solution that balances security with the needs of the local community . "
That 's not the tenor of the letter received April 19 by the Rainvilles ' attorney , Richard Gadbois .
" ... CBP , in coordination with USACE , is writing to inform you that it will be necessary to move forward with condemnation to acquire the necessary property interests , " said the letter from Noreen Dresser , chief of the Corps ' real estate division .
" We anticipate filing a condemnation action within the next 60 days through the U.S. District Court for the District of Vermont . "
For the Rainvilles -- parents Betty and Clement , 70 , and sons Tony , 39 , Brian , 37 , and Craig , 33 -- it is survival that 's at stake .
They say the land seizure could put the farm out of business .
Buffeted by low prices for milk , the 220 - acre farm lost money in 2009 .
Losing that much hay production -- about 1,000 bales a year -- would force them to buy hay to feed their milking cows instead of growing it themselves .
With hay at $ 3.25 per bale , the sale price would n't go far , says Craig Rainville , who says the government 's negotiators see a city block when they look at the land , not a vital cog of a working farm .
" There 's a culture gap here as wide as the Grand Canyon , " he said Tuesday , sitting in the living room of the farmhouse .
" They act like the farm is a movie set , where you take part of it out and the rest is supposed to function .
It does n't work that way . "
" Save This Farm " reads the hand - painted 4 - by - 8 - foot wooden sign that Brian Rainville recently erected on the land .
" It 's what we do , it 's who we are , " he said .
" We 're hanging on by our fingernails .
The last thing we need is for the government to break us . "

“ If there is no flour , there is no Torah ; if there is no Torah there is no flour .
” The first half of this saying , coined by Rabbi Elazar Ben Azaria , who lived in the first century CE , has been the subject of much media attention in recent months .
A wave of caustic criticism has been heaped on the haredi population for stubbornly clinging to an educational system that enjoys extensive funding from the state , but that is producing an ever - growing number of Talmud scholars who lack the basic skills needed to earn a living .
But not much attention has been given to the second part of the ancient rabbi’s pithy statement :
The sorrowfully inadequate level of Jewish studies provided to our nation ’s secular schoolchildren .
Our founding fathers understood the centrality of the Bible to the Jewish people ’s connection to the land .
In 1937 , for instance , David Ben-Gurion told the British Peel Commission , saddled with the job of ending conflict the between Jews and Arabs , that the Bible was “ the Jewish people ’s mandate ” for the land of Israel .
Israel policy makers , educators and IDF commanders have come to appreciate the strong correlation between a solid Jewish education and patriotism .
Religious convictions aside , without a strong Jewish identity , Israeli citizens cannot be expected to make the necessary sacrifices demanded of them in a Jewish state surrounded by enemies .
Nor can they hope to create an original Jewish culture .
But despite the appreciation for Jewish learning and Jewish identity , the reality today is far from ideal .
Just two hours a week of Bible studies are required by the Education Ministry .
According to minutes from a Knesset Education Committee meeting in March , many secular state schools teach even less , sometimes as little as one semester during all of the last three years of high school .
Often this is the first subject to be abandoned when time constraints arise .
Bible teachers lack proper training and the requisite passion needed to bring to life the ancient text .
Meanwhile , other Jewish subjects , such as Mishna and Talmud or Jewish philosophy , are completely optional .
All this is despite the recommendations of the 1994 Shenhar Commission , which explicitly called for more state - funded Jewish studies in the state school system .
We fear that a new commission appointed by Education Minister Gideon Sa’ar and headed by Prof.
Binyamin Ish - Shalom will face a similar fate .
Meanwhile , privately funded initiatives such as TALI , a Hebrew acronym for Tigbur Limudei Yahadut ( enhanced Jewish studies ) , and the Hartman Institute are filling the vacuum , proving once again that private initiative always beats state - funded projects .
TALI , with an annual budget of just under $ 2 million , funded principally by North American Jews , works in cooperation with 40,000 families and hundreds of teachers to introduce a pluralistic , liberal version of Judaism and prayer into the secular state school system on the preschool and elementary school level , while Hartman works with 50 junior high and high schools .
The only education minister who agreed to fund TALI was the late Zevulun Hammer ( National Religious Party ) , who argued that a little liberal Yiddishkeit is better than no Yiddishkeit at all .
Previous and subsequent ministers have distanced themselves from TALI , either because their secular sensibilities led them to oppose any form of Jewish particularism or because of their own or their coalition members ’
Orthodox parochialism .
Dr. Eitan Chikli , executive director of TALI , says that the fund , with90 elementary school and 70 preschool members , is stretched to itslimit .
Supply cannot catch up with demand .
True , some secular schools are ideologically opposed to the teaching ofJudaism .
But many secular Israelis who reject Orthodoxy arenevertheless open to liberal approaches to Judaism , as is clear fromthe rising interest in non-Orthodox educational frameworks for adults , such as Alma Hebrew College , Bina Center for Jewish Identity and Elul , all of which are privately funded .
An absurd situation has been created in which the State of Israel fundsharedi schools that produce graduates who lack the occupational skillsand the Zionist ethos to integrate into Israeli society , while itrefrains from enriching secular schools with Jewish studies .
Thiscounterproductive policy must end .
It 's simple to say that piracy is a problem in the game industry , and particularly so in PC gaming .
No extra hardware ( like a mod chip ) is required to pirate a PC game — just a fast Internet connection or a burnt disc .
What is n't simple is finding out how many real - world sales are lost due to piracy ( a problem that has bedeviled the content industries for some time ) .
The question : if a pirate could n't get his or her game for free , would he or she pay for it ?
The head programmer at Wolfire Games goes by the name of David , and he has some thoughts on the matter .
What follows is some heavy conjecture mixed with common sense , but it leads to a single conclusion : pirates may grab a large number of games , but lost sales due to piracy are much lower than everyone assumes .
How much money is lost ?
The industry may believe that every pirated game is a lost sale , but that stance makes little to no sense .
" From personal experience , I know this is not possible — most pirates that I 've met have downloaded enough software to exceed their entire lifetime income , were they to have paid for it all , " David wrote .
" A more plausible ( but still overly optimistic ) guess is that if piracy was stopped the average pirate would behave like an average consumer . "
The truth lies somewhere in between , where piracy does cause developers to lose some money and sales , but not on a 1:1 basis with games pirated .
To illustrate how this works , David turned to iPhone games .
i Phone developers claim that 80 percent of the copies of their games on phones are pirated , but only around 10 percent of iPhones are jailbroken , allowing illegally downloaded games and non-Apple - approved applications to run on the hardware .
" This means that even though [ developers ] see that 80 percent of their copies are pirated , only 10 percent of their potential customers are pirates , which means they are losing at most 10 percent of their sales , " David concludes .
The reason for the disparity is that pirates download a huge number of games , but apparently play very few of them .
On the other hand , gamers buy fewer games when they pay for them , and generally spend more time playing them .
If jailbroken iPhone users could n't get these games for free , they would either not buy them , or simply buy one or two .
Imagine yourself at a restaurant where you could dine for free and eat as much as you want .
You may order the highest - priced dishes on the menu , but you 're still only going to eat as much as your stomach can hold .
The software industry is , in effect , looking at your hypothetical plate saying " If that guy had to pay , he would have bought the pork chops , two steaks , and the lamb ! "
So what 's the problem with PC games ?
David gives a simple reason for the problems in PC gaming : developers do it poorly .
" It 's easier for these developers to point their fingers at pirates than to face the real problem : that their games are not fun on [ the ] PC ... they are not fun to play with a mouse and keyboard , and do n't work well on PC hardware .
Their field of view is designed to be viewed from a distant couch instead of a nearby monitor , and their gameplay is simplified to compensate for this tunnel vision . "
He points to Blizzard as a success story , a company that focuses exclusively on PC and Mac gaming , and has been wildly successful as a result .
" If developers spent more time improving their PC gaming experience , and less time complaining about piracy , we might see more successful PC games . "
He knows what he 's talking about .
Wolfire is hosting the Humble Bundle , a sale of five independent games that work on the PC , Mac OS X , and Linux .
No DRM , so you can install each game on all your systems .
You pay what you like , and you can split the payment between the developers and two charities .
This may not be a strategy that would work for new releases , but it does make a point by putting all the power in the hands of the gamers : if they want to spend one cent for everything , they can .
If they want to pirate , they can .
As of this writing the bundle has earned $ 363,000 , from around 46,000 customers — in just a few days .
" Would we have seen this much support if the games were console ports that only worked when connected to a secure online DRM server ? "
David wrote .
" We 'll never know for sure , but somehow I doubt it . "
If pirates truly are gluttons that would never buy most of what they download , and if treating non-console gamers like adults instead of thieves leads to more sales , it may be time for companies to begin reevaluating their stances on PC gaming .
Less DRM , combined with more polish , may do a lot to improve their bottom line .
Darryl Rouson used to be a crack addict .
But his life took a turn for the worse when he quit and became a politician .
On Wednesday , Rouson's " bong bill " was unanimously approved by the Florida Legislature and is awaiting the Governor 's signature .
Rousen says that restricting the sale of pipes and bongs will discourage people from smoking cannabis and crack cocaine .
Under the bill , only shops where the sale of tobacco products and accessories constitute 75 % of income or shops where the sale of pipes and bongs constitutes less than 25 % of income will be allowed to sell a long list of smoking devices .
These include pipes of any material , water pipes , carburetion tubes and devices , chamber pipes , carburetor pipes , electric pipes , air - driven pipes , chillums , bongs , and ice pipes or chillers .
So if a crack addict can't buy a pipe from a head shop , is he going to shrug his shoulders and become a state representative ?
Or is he going to " use glass stems , broken antennas , small liquor bottles , really anything they can get their hands on to smoke , " as one commenter in the news story wrote ?
I wonder what this poor fellow , who lost his motorcycle spark plugs to a crackhead , would have to say about this law ?

When we first started working on large scale search we confronted the issue of whether to index pages or complete books as our fundamental unit of indexing . [ i ]
We had some concerns about indexing on the page level .
We knew we would need to scale to 10 - 20 million books and at an average of 300 pages per book that comes out to about 6 billion pages .
At that time we did not think that Solr would scale to 6 billion pages . [ ii ]
If we indexed by page , we also wanted to be able
But what was Citi thinking , handing over $ 40,000 to an undergraduate who had already amassed debt well into the five figures ?
This was , in effect , a “ no doc ” or at least a “ low doc ” subprime mortgage loan .
A Citi spokesman declined to comment , even though Ms. Munna was willing to sign a waiver giving Citi permission to talk about her loans .
Perhaps the bank worried that once it approved one loan , cutting her off would have led her to drop out or transfer and have trouble paying back the loan .
Today , someone like Ms. Munna might not qualify for the $ 40,000 she borrowed .
But as the economy rebounds , there is little doubt that plenty of lenders will step forward to roll the dice on desperate students , especially because the students generally can’t get rid of the debt in bankruptcy court .
The University
The financial aid office often has the best picture of what students like Ms. Munna are up against , because they see their families ’ financial situation splayed out on the federal financial aid form .
So why did n’t N.Y.U. tell Ms. Munna that she simply did not belong there once she ’d passed , say , $ 60,000 in total debt ?
“ Had somebody called me and said , ‘ Do you have a clue where this is all headed ? ’ , it would have been a slap in the face , but a slap in the face that I needed , ” said Cathryn Munna .
“ When financial aid told her that they could get her $ 2,000 more in loans , they should have been saying ‘ You are in deep doo - doo , little girl . ’ ”
That ’s not a role that the university wants to take on , though .
“ I think that would be completely inappropriate , ” said Randall Deike , the vice president of enrollment management for N.Y.U. , who oversees admissions and financial aid .
“ Some families will do whatever it takes for their son or daughter to be not just at N.Y.U. , but any first - choice college .
I ’m not sure that ’s always the best decision , but it ’s one that they really have to make themselves . ”
Image Citibank gave Cortney Munna $ 40,000 in loans , though she had already amassed debt well into the five figures .
It was like the “ no doc ” loans that home buyers used to get in over their heads .

The complications here go well beyond the propriety of suggesting that a student enroll elsewhere .
Colleges do n’t always know how much debt its students are taking on , which makes it hard to offer good counsel .
( N.Y.U. does appear to have known about all of Ms. Munna ’s loans , though . )

ISRAEL DEPLOYS THE CONTROLLED PRESS AND CONGRESSIONAL STOOGES AGAINST AMERICA
By Gordon Duff STAFF WRITER / Senior Editor
Even before 9/11 , Cheney and Rumsfeld started weeding any intelligent life out of America ’s military command structure .
Anyone who would ask hard questions or say “ no ” when asked to betray the United States , violate the Geneva Convention or be willing to wage aggressive war was cashiered .
A pack of rank amateurs led by famed military genius Karl Rove and listening to continual whisperings from Tel Aviv started America on the road to ruin .
A massive dossier was accumulated on nearly everyone , covering falsified intelligence , payoffs from military contractors , a rendition program now admitted to have averaged over 90 % “ innocent bystanders ” and more .
Mostly , however , it was contracting fraud , hundreds of billions of dollars of over payments , missing weapons , unfinished but paid for projects and defective everything from poisoned drinking water to electrocuted troops living and working in defective buildings .
With AIPAC controlling congress for Israel and everyone else “ on the take , ” running America around by the nose was simple .
The movie , Green Zone , covers our attack on Iraq with considerable accuracy .
The film clearly outlines how , in order to justify an illegal invasion , an American government created “ false flag ” intelligence .
Despite any crimes Saddam may have committed , currently America has caused more civilian deaths in Iraq than Saddam in 30 years , the invasion was illegal and any and all involved in its planning , according to international law , should face tribunals .
Those who were misled are innocent .
Those who did the misleading are war criminals , exactly like Saddam .
Our war to save Iraq from a brutal dictator was simply cover for a bank robbery and some “ dirty work ” that needed to be done , work that opened the door to country after country being destabilized .
All of this was done to deal drugs , steal gas and oil and loot the American economy .
Oh , they forgot to tell you that on Hannity last night ?
Sorry about that .
This is how Iraq was destroyed , over a million killed and untold damage was done to America .
In the process , the balance of power in the Middle East swung to Iran , who now largely controls Iraq and to the India / Israel alliance .
The United States is no longer a factor , bogged down in Iraq , over its head in Afghanistan and flat broke at home .
The surrogate wars fought for Greater Israel left America castrated .
Now Israel is laughing at us .
The original plan , the Bush / Israeli plan was to use NATO as cover to expand into oil and gas rich Asia , flank Russia and gain control of key hydrocarbon supplies worth trillions of dollars , supplies that would give defacto control of China , India and Western Europe , not to America , but to key international groups in bed with Israel .
The whole thing was going to be kept going with timely terror attacks , staged conflicts like the Georgia / Russia war and lubricated with billions in heroin profits that would undermine the governments of the narco - republics , Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan , Tajikistan , Kyrgyzstan and last , but far from least , Afghanistan .
Managing Afghanistan would be easy .
President Karzai is a puppet of India , a country willing to sell its soul to get into Afghanistan and organize terrorist groups to attack Pakistan .
Kids there go to schools surrounded by fully armed military .
If you want to see the real cost of the war in Afghanistan , you can see it in the faces of school children in Pakistan , who risk death daily because their army is fighting beside ours .
WHY IS IRAN A TARGET ?
Russia was supposed to sit around stupidly while Bush and company put the Ukraine , Georgia and the other break - away republics into NATO .
Weak and corrupt governments would quickly become corporate puppets , greased with drug money and ready to pump millions of cubic feet of natural gas into Israeli controlled pipelines for pennies on the dollar .
However , Russia had different plans .
The Ukraine fell away from the west .
Hungary is doing that even as we speak .
Kyrgyzstan threw out its narco - dictatorship and Russian owned Gazprom got control of the regions natural gas supplies .
All that is left to steal is Iran ’s natural gas , the world ’s largest supplies .
The excuse to go after them , of course , will be imaginary nuclear weapons and , as nearly everyone has predicted , some “ 9/11 ” type attack that can be blamed on Iran .
This contingency plan , war on Iran , using the same falsified intelligence or a “ false flag ” attack , is the only way of moving plans for an economic empire forward , a cabal of Israeli and Christian Zionists , “ robber baron ” Wall Street types and oil companies .
Expect some type of international tensions or an incident to spike gasoline prices during the summer of 2010 , something meant to push America toward ruin and financial desperation and to condition them for another war .
WHY GO AFTER THE U.S. ARMY , WHY ARE THEY STARTING TO RESIST “ GANGSTERISM ? ”
The CIA and other American intelligence agencies all agree that Iran has no nuclear program .
Pat Buchanan probably states it best :
“ Diplomacy has failed , ” Sen . Chuck Schumer , D - N.Y. , told AIPAC , “ Iran is on the verge of becoming nuclear and we cannot afford that . ”
“ We have to contemplate the final option , ” said Sen. Evan Bayh , D - Ind. , “ the use of force to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon . ”
War is a “ terrible thing , ” said Sen. Lindsay Graham , R - S.C. , but “ sometimes it is better to go to war than to allow the Holocaust to develop a second time . ”
Graham then describes the war we Americans should fight :
“ If military force is ever employed , it should be done in a decisive fashion .
The Iran government ’s ability to wage conventional war against its neighbors and our troops in the region should not exist .
They should not have one plane that can fly or one ship that can float . ”
Danielle Pletka of the American Enterprise Institute , Neocon Central , writes , “ The only questions remaining , one Washington politico tells me , are who starts it , and how it ends . ”
As to who starts it , we know the answer .
Teheran has not started a war in memory and is not going to launch a suicide attack on a superpower with thousands of nuclear weapons .
As with Iraq in 2003 , the war will be launched by the United States against a nation that did not attack us — to strip it of weapons it does not have .
Before Israel can put its forces into motion , starting with Rupert Murdoch and his media empire , Fox News , Limbaugh , Beck , Palin and the WSJ , and the congressional hacks fall in line , Secretary Gates , Admiral Mullen and General Petraeus have to be flanked .
They are the voices telling us , not only that an attack in Iran is unwarranted but that war would be a disaster for America .
The easiest way to destroy the credibility of the military is to marshal assets , the press , President Karzai and so many others .
How has this begun ?
WIKI - LEAKS , A SMALL “ PEARL HARBOR ” ATTACK ON THE ARMY
Kablam !
In one fell swoop , we learn the Army has been lying all the time , murdering reporters , gunning down children and lying thru their teeth .
Followup stories seen everywhere now claim this was done every day .
Then we hear that the Special Forces use their knives to dig bullets out of bodies .
When you think of an 5.56 mm rifle ammunition of 5.7 mm pistol ammunition , all designed to penetrate body armor , either capable of passing through a human body with little reduction in muzzle velocity having to be dug out of a poor innocent Muslim woman with one of those huge butcher knives that the Special Forces carry , I have a bad moment .
I begin to feel the pressure of a myth coming on , a story , a legend , perhaps even a movie script .
I think Israel .
When I see poor hapless President Karzai telling the world he plans to move into the hills and command the Taliban in its war against the American occupiers , all the while his friends , family and associates are drowning in drug profits and massive American contracts , that same “ Tel Aviv tango ” seems to be playing in the background .
Is n’t this the same Karzai , who in the last two weeks tried to set up a permanent commission to rig elections in Afghanistan ?
Is this the same Karzai given a “ no confidence ” vote from a tribal Shura last week ?
Someone should search him for his secret Israeli decoder ring .
Did General Stanley McChrystal admit to broad failures in “ collateral damage ” as is being reported ?
Is the Army “ out of control ” as claimed my the press ?
Moreover , recent operations in and around Marjeh , we are told , have now led to a reassessment ( again ) of policy toward drug eradication .
Have we , as the news claims , embarked on a path of nation building that coincides with maintaining a narco - republic , an economic model deemed impossible to maintain ?
Is this flood of reported failures , combined with destabilization of Iraq , renewed defense spending scandals there , part of a pattern meant to discredit the Army , discredit them at the same time they are the only institution in the United States supporting the executive branch in resisting demands for a preemptive strike , perhaps even using nuclear weapons , against Iran ?
CAN ISRAEL FORCE A GEOPOLITICAL REALIGNMENT ?
Both Pakistan and Iran feel they are targeted by Israel .
Pakistan feels Israel is using its massive influence in the US to fill the news with rumors of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists and of Pakistani complicity in world terrorism , despite the recent successes Pakistan has had militarily .
In fact , Pakistan is the only US ally to have any successes against terrorism at all .
Pakistan is also under daily attack by terrorists they feel are armed and trained by the Indo - Israeli alliance , trained in Afghanistan , under the eye of President Karzai and also under circumstances that the United States could effectively oppose were the terrorist operations not being managed by Israel .
When the destabilization of Pakistan is considered , certain inherent problems come to mind , in particular , corruption and lack of national cohesion .
The exacerbation of these problems by a concerted terror campaign coordinated with the American military operations in Afghanistan , operations that have pushed Pakistan into long term military operations well beyond their financial capabilities , has pushed Pakistan to near collapse .
Thus , Pakistan ’s options are few .
She can be dismembered by India and Israel or she can form an alliance with Southern Afghanistan and Iran , providing a nuclear umbrella for Iran in exchange for oil and gas revenue .
The oddity of this , of course , is that , despite what is reported as news , Pakistan is still very much allied with the United States and has always been so , to as much a degree as Israel and , currently , more .
Such an alliance , which could be expanded easily to include Iraq , even Syria , could provide economic stability to the region , end any discussion of nuclear proliferation except that of Israel , and establish a basis for a regional trade zone capable of engaging India and China in a productive way , something Pakistan , as it now exists , is unlikely to be able to accomplish .
This would also represent the recognition of the waning influence of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States , the reactionary Bedouin cultures that have so long been the external face of Islam .
SOCIAL REALIGNMENT AND REAL DEMOCRACY
It is n’t only the Palestinians who are being removed from their land or “ ethnically cleansed . ”
The Kurds , through Turkey , Iraq and Iran have , for centuries , struggled for identity , as have the Baloch ’s , millions of Pashtuns in Afghanistan and Pakistan and many other groups .
The “ economic pie ” has always been cut to favor Israel , the oil princes , the Punjabi ’s and a series of oligarchic families whose control stretches , not only thru Islam but India as well .
Oil culture , drug culture or gun culture , even brushes with Islamic extremism and socialism have all led to political and social inequities .
Israel , once technically the region ’s only democracy , is now looked on as a thinly veiled military dictatorship with controlled press , a brutal justice system and racist policies .
If we are demanding democratic governments in Islamic countries , governments that comply with UN Resolutions , international law and civilized practice , then why are n’t we asking the same of Israel ?
From being presented to us for years on TV and in the news as a “ beacon of light ” we now see the truth .
They are made of the same cloth as our other dictator friends , Noriega , the Shah , Diem and so many more .
Noriega helped us run drugs , the Shah kept Russia out of the Persian Gulf and Diem helped create the Viet Cong to keep a generation of Americans off the street .
Maybe Israel is doing what Diem did , starting wars so unemployed Americans can fill body bags , wars started by insane policies , greed , hubris and lots of phony talk about democracy .
With ethinic cleansing in Palestine still going on and similar issues in Darfur and earlier in Rwanda , Bosnia , Kosovo , Iraq , Kashmir and elsewhere , this and other issues of human rights have to be addressed through whatever international conventions we currently have .
Currently Iran is under sanctions and facing more .
Israel faces sanctions which are vetoed by the United States .
Leaders of more than a few countries , including even the United States and Israel , but many others also , face war crimes prosecution , an imperfect protection .
Over 60 years ago , Eleanor Roosevelt helped establish these principles which need full force of law , military force if necessary , to guarantee :
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
PREAMBLE
Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom , justice and peace in the world ,
Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind , and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people ,
Whereas it is essential , if man is not to be compelled to have recourse , as a last resort , to rebellion against tyranny and oppression , that human rights should be protected by the rule of law ,
Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between nations ,

60 YEARS OF MOVING BACKWARDS
If you asked Americans today if their country fulfilled the promise of the 1948 declaration , a majority would admit we are moving backwards .
Some would say so based on massive foreign propaganda that has infiltrated our media to destroy confidence in our ability to rule ourselves .
Those talking “ birth certificates ” or “ socialism , ” the “ tea bag ” revolutionaries organized by monied interests and Israeli pressure groups are using fear and our history of class warfare and racial hatreds to cripple America .
Driven by a plummeting standard of living and a massive realignment of wealth from the middle class to the upper 3 percent , a group that no longer invests in America , no longer provides jobs , develops technology nor advances productivity and innovation , a group that simply buries money overseas and “ vacations ” in America , living in gated communities and parking their yachts in our harbors , class warfare may be a real threat .
In fact , Americans have been living it for years .
While Fox News and Glen Beck have been lulling America to sleep , America ’s wealth has disappeared and with it , America ’s standard of living .
70 % of America ’s families face homelessness based on a job layoff , and half the jobs in the country are in doubt .
Yet , million of Americans are ready to take to the streets to support the same groups that planned it all , simply based on what they see on television .
When America lost its free press , it really lost all its rights .
DEBT , SLAVERY AND FEUDALISM
When the World Bank and IMF show up in a country to loan them money , the result is always the same .
Within a few years , people are starving , a few wealthy have everything and the government that supports the process is always corrupt and totalitarian .
The basic concept is that debt services itself and never delivers development , education , health care and human rights .
As with dozens of countries around the world , the United States , as it buries itself further and further in debt becomes , as the Heritage Foundation points out , “ less free . ”
We now have a Department of Homeland Security , an analog for Hitler ’s GESTAPO , and a pattern of subterfuge , from controlled news to rigged elections to a looted economy , all with a backdrop of endless wars and threats against our “ security ” that have taken the focus off our loss of freedoms and blame a world of “ terrorists ” and “ extremists . ”
These enemies are all people who have been helped into extremism by debt , by the IMF and World bank , and are all living under military threat from the great enforcer , the United States .
Calling such a political system socialist is wrong .
Calling it Fascist insults the social programs and efficiency delivered by Italy and Germany .
It is Feudalism , the rule by armed thugs and ignorant despots that kept the world in a dark age for centuries .
Instead of “ serfs ” we have “ guest workers . ”
When Saddam invaded Kuwait , hundreds of thousands there lived in slavery .
The United Arab Emirates , a close American ally has over 80 % of its population as foreign workers .
Today , Israel is displacing the Palestinians who grew the food and worked in the factories for foreign workers , soon to number over 1 million in that tiny country , workers who are paid a tenth the wages of even a Palestinian .
In Thailand , the fishing industry is run on slavery .
In Burma , oil workers were cheaper to murder and replace than to pay .
India is ready to send a man to the moon yet the majority of her population is the poorest on earth .
40 families control a country with over 1 billion people .
If you ever wondered why the water cannons and demonstrators , the mass arrests when the “ Big 8 ” get together or what it is all about , those are the people who “ get it . ”
They are out there screaming for you to listen .
Their message is that your world , the wars , the poverty , the job losses , the mortgage scandals , the rigged elections and the insane lies we see on the news are all about they money boys playing with debt .
Is there a “ new world order ” or some other secret organization ?
Who needs one when we are all slaves to debt .
If you think you owe money personally , you have no idea .
You have lent billions you will never have , money you will owe for generations , to countries that could never hope to pay it all back .
Is it all as imaginary and sinister as it sounds ?
No , it is actually far worse .
ELIMINATING THE THREAT , DESTROYING THE INSTITUTIONS OF FREEDOM
Information is the basis for all decision making .
If someone walks up with a gun and robs you , you see their face .
Now , when it is done , we see no one .
The robber controls newspapers or has a “ think tank ” blame someone else .
In America , the robbers of the health care industry bought half our government , spending hundreds of millions on bribes , hired thousands of liars , really just paid thieves , all to continue control of one of the greatest financial frauds on earth , a health care system based on a mix of private insurance , public charity and millions of untreated sick , all being done at astounding cost and with incredible inefficiency .
Health care costs are the major reason America has almost no manufacturing jobs .
With a two party political system where both parties receive massive contributions from Israeli / AIPAC sources and America is continually at war , fighting the imaginary enemies of Israel , most powerful country in the Middle East , our “ free government ” has become a joke .
If a small nation like Israel can buy us into war , imagine what our own banking / insurance or oil industries can do ?
With enough phony religious “ hoopla , ” and more Israeli reminders of the holocaust , some “ mysterious group ” could blow up a school and we might invade anyone , even ourselves .
We have simply given away any rational control of our lives .
FIGHTING BACK
300 American members of congress signed a letter of support for Israel , a letter meant to tell our government that , even if Israel is getting our troops killed because of their war crimes , 300 bribed criminals sworn to support the United States will become traitors .
They have to go , every single one of them and anyone else who accepts money from a foreign power unfriendly to the United States has to leave office .
We must admit that Fox News and its affiliates are part of the Israeli government .
We also have to admit that some Jewish Americans , those who support AIPAC , or who have dual citizenship , are foreign agents and should be registered as such .
Our laws require it .
No one should be above the law .
If the United States Supreme Court continues to operate outside the Constitution , as it has for some time , the members , 5 that we know of , who are no longer loyal to the United States should be removed from office .
The entire concept of the Supreme Court is one the Founding Fathers never thought out that clearly .
SCOTUS is a form of tyranny protecting the interests , most often , of criminal classes in the United States from lawful government .
When they started deciding elections , they had gone too far .
When they authorized endless bribes , turning our government over to multi-national corporations , they became a threat .
We are capable of governing ourselves without Clarence Thomas and those of his ilk , people no decent American would trust to watch a parakeet , ruling over us like Princes .
ONE COUNTRY , PART OF A WORLD OF PEOPLE , NOT IDEAS
It is time that we admitted that the ideas we hold have become our enemy .
Our ideas are seldom our own .
They always come from others , other that profit from convincing us that we are going to be safe from terrorism , have eternal life or “ get rich quick ” if we only accept their ideas .
Every idea is a denial of our innate goodness , decency and intelligence .
If someone stops to help a stranger change a tire , they are a “ liberal . ”
If someone fails to give a panhandler money for drugs , they are a ” conservative . ”
The people who invented those terms have made fools of everyone who uses them , people who gave up their common sense for a promise of something that never existed and never will .
All ideas offer the same thing , something for nothing .
Free lunch .
There is no free lunch .

Diane Lucas is a Harvard Law School graduate and an attorney in New York .
After the jump , she discusses the Stephanie Grace scandal in the context of her own experiences of sexism and racism at Harvard .
Advertisement
Earlier this week , a Harvard 3L named Stephanie Grace [ Ed. — pictured ] was introduced to many people in the country ( or at least to people who follow legal blogs ) .
She has a resume that could make her the next president of the USA .
Grace went to HLS and Princeton undergrad .
( the same pedigree as Michelle Obama ) .
She is an editor on the Harvard Law review and has a federal clerkship lined up .
Yet Grace still holds some archaic , backwards , and flat - out racist views .
In short , Grace believes that there is a scientific possibility of black people being genetically inferior to white people .
She equates it to being as simple as Irish people being more likely to have red hair , and African Americans being more likely to have darker skin .
Of course , she explains intellect is about nature –for example , if her baby is raised by her in America or in a Nigerian orphanage , her baby would still share her intellectual prowess ( wow , that is just too much ignorance in one sentence ) .
Grace first spewed her racist statements at a law school dinner and then later clarified her views over an email .
It was sent to a Black Law Students Association ( BLSA ) member , and then became viral .
I refuse to waste my time and energy refuting a point as ridiculous as this , as I literally cannot have the intellectual equality of black people be open for debate .

The deeper issue here is how and why Harvard Law breeds a racially tense environment , which often culminates in " race wars . "
And why the administration often ignores or ridicules any backlash from black students after a racist incident .
As an African - American woman and a HLS alum , I dealt with the Harvard racism everyday .
I felt like I was an outsider on campus ; and often invisible .
When I felt accepted , I sometimes felt exoticized .
My classmates would refer to me as " homegirl " or " diva " , but call other students by their given name .
Worse , black students were often racially profiled on campus– made to show identification to and from class .
In classes I was often confused with the five other black women in an 80 - person class .
And then of course , there were the infamous classroom discussions .
I heard the statistical explanations for why black people were pre-disposed to be more violent , which of course was cited in support of racial profiling ; or the affirmative action discussions in which , essentially , some of my white classmates explained why black students in the class did not deserve to be there .
Interestingly , Harvard Law has deep ties with racism .
It was built from the proceeds of Antiguan slave labor on wheat plantations , which is reflected today by the three wheat sheaves in the HLS school crest .
I believe HLS ' current battles with race are a result of it having a significant population of sheltered , often white - bred students , who went to non-diverse prep schools , many of whom were made to think at an early age they were geniuses and everything they spewed was brilliant .
When these students attempt to intellectualize racist views , they often cite statistics and / or science to support their views .
This leads to a false sense of validity and creates a twilight zone in which the irrational somehow becomes acceptable in intellectual , legal debate .
Problematically , HLS fails to address the racial tension until it reaches a boiling point .
Even then , in recent history , HLS has failed to take appropriate steps to discuss or address the racist acts of students , and has even condoned them in certain instances .
The HLS administration has criticized students who take a stand as being over sensitive , overly passionate , irrational and / or not appreciating the right to freedom of speech .
So with that in mind , I was not surprised at all when I read Grace 's email .

Back in 2002 , Kiwi Camara , a native Filipino who grew up in Hawaii , enrolled at HLS at age 16 , making him the youngest person to matriculate at HLS .
As a 1L , Camara posted an outline on HL Central , a student run outline database .
It was an outline of the Supreme Court case Shelley v. Kraemer , which barred restrictive covenants in real estate based on race .
Camara referenced African Americans as " nigs " in his summary of the case .
For example , he wrote " Nigs buy land with no nig covenant . "
Cite .
Professor Charles Nesson decided to have an open debate and have students defend Camara in class , in a mock trial - like setting .
The purpose was to promote free discussion on the issue .
But this completely backfired , and many students , especially African - Americans , were very offended .
In response , Professor Nesson was asked to step down from teaching 1L classes , in which students did not have an election of professors .
I know Professor Nesson very , very well ( I call him " Poppa " ) , and I am very confident that he did not have a malicious or racist intent .
To be clear , he is and was an avid civil rights activist .
And he stepped up and tried to diffuse a very tense , highly racialized situation when no one else did .
Many students , however , thought it was an inappropriate reaction to a sensitive situation .
Students did not , at that time , need a lesson on free speech .
Rather , there was a desperate need for an open forum to discuss how offensive the use of the word " nig " was in that context , particularly in discussing a landmark civil rights case ; there should have also been a discussion as to why Kiwi felt so comfortable using that word , and there should have been some action from HLS to improve the situation .
Of course , HLS did not provide any meaningful forum to discuss this incident and the racist tension just continued to brew .
Further , African - American students who criticized this incident were portrayed as overly - sensitive and opposed to free speech .
HLS professor Charles Fried described student reaction as a " hysterical , ridiculous overreaction to a couple of unfortunate incidents . "
According to Wikipedia , the controversy is also the subject of the book The People Vs. Harvard Law : How America 's Oldest Law School Turned Its Back on Free Speech and a talk at the New England Appellate Judges ' Conference .
There is more about the controversy here .

When I was at HLS in 2006 , there was a student - run but HLS - endorsed parody play featuring students and professors , in which individual students , mostly women of color , were roasted using highly offensive racial , gender and classist stereotypes–basically a modern day minstrel show .
I was disgusted .
One of my friends who is a very articulate , intelligent , black woman , was made to sound like a Shanaynay - like character from the show , Martin ( I love Shanaynay - who does n't ?
But , really ?! ) .
Another woman , who is Cuban - American was depicted as having very large breasts , which were actually balloons that were violently popped during the play .
They portrayed another woman , who is Dominican - American and speaks fluent English , as barely speaking a word of English .
Another black woman was depicted as being sexually promiscuous with classmates and professors .
These women were / are my friends , and it was very difficult for them and for me to cope with this parody .
HLS is already a hostile place to be for a black woman .
The parody made it worse , but it gave us more insight into what our classmates really thought of us .
Some of the women who were depicted in the play were so deeply offended they wanted to transfer schools .
When we protested and communicated how upset many of the black and Latino students were , we were criticized as being too sensitive , for not being able to take a joke and for trying to suppress free speech .
Dean Elana Kagan refused to take a stand , stating that she could not take responsibility for the parody - even though she actually had an on - stage role in its performance .
After many requests from concerned students , including myself , Professor Charles Ogletree , Jr. and Professor Martha Minow ( now Dean Minow ) took the lead in organizing a town hall , which was extremely well attended .
Other concerned students and I specifically asked Dean Kagan to start diversity sessions to keep the conversation going , and . . . crickets .
That was another missed opportunity for HLS to be an institution that cares about racial issues , and prepares and encourages its students , of all backgrounds , to be racially sensitive .
Well , here we are again .
Members of BLSA and others were disparaged by Above the Law and other bloggers for making too much of this story , for suppressing freedom of speech and intellectual debate and for disclosing Stephanie Grace 's name .

Since when does freedom of speech mean not speaking out in outrage when you are in a racially hostile environment and are subjected to racist statements ?
Freedom of speech was not in any way suppressed .
It would be ludicrous , however , to give validity and legitimacy to Grace 's arguments by encouraging intellectual debate on the genetic equality of black people .
( I could n't even write that without cringing ) .
This is , however , another opportunity for Harvard Law to open a dialogue about race and hopefully institutionalize diversity training and routine dialogues .
Further , BLSA had every right to make this email viral , and by so doing , it did all of us a service .
Some people may wonder , what is the big deal ?
This is one woman with isolated , extreme views .
Well , this is a huge deal .
This is a public concern .
Let 's look at the facts : HLS grads run and will continue to run our country and make our laws .
Grace has a federal clerkship in which she will help interpret the laws of our country .
With her credentials , she could be a powerhouse attorney determining the fate of her subordinates .
Or she could have a high - powered position in government making decisions affecting us all .
Like I said before , she could even be president .
To be clear , Grace 's views are very dangerous , and as seen from some comments on some legal blogs , they are not isolated .
The theory that black people are on the bottom of the chain of evolution and have intellect slightly higher than apes was a central tool in justifying efforts to colonize , enslave , and even exterminate people .
The theory was , they are less human and intellectually inferior , so we can treat them accordingly .
Today , this theory can be and is used to determine that a black applicant is unqualified for a job , to vet black political candidates more extensively than others , and to deny educational grants to predominantly black schools ( reasoning that they are genetically inferior , so why waste the money ) .

Lastly , there seems to be something peculiar about my profession .
I have encountered more than a few racists throughout my law school and professional career - so many that it seems vastly disproportionate in comparison to other professions .
Maybe it is just that by nature we , as attorneys and advocates , are more vocal with our opinions .
But it is especially disturbing because we are a service profession , and most lawyers inevitably have to interact with others who are not like them in a professional context .
Many of our country 's leaders are lawyers , or individuals with legal backgrounds .
It is imperative that law schools , including HLS , make an effort to increase racial sensitivity in law schools , before their graduates enter the real world and cause a lot of damage .

We have received a legal complaint from Philippa Stroud .
She disputes the claims made in this article .
We summarise her complaint at the foot of the article .
A high - flying prospective Conservative MP , credited with shaping many of the party 's social policies , founded a church that tried to " cure " homosexuals by driving out their " demons " through prayer .
Philippa Stroud , who is likely to win the Sutton and Cheam seat on Thursday and is head of the Centre for Social Justice , the thinktank set up by the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith , has heavily influenced David Cameron 's beliefs on subjects such as the family .
A popular and energetic Tory , she is seen as one of the party 's rising stars .
The CSJ reportedly claims to have formulated as many as 70 of the party 's policies .
Stroud has spoken of how her Christian faith has motivated her to help the poor and of her time spent working with the destitute in Hong Kong .
On her return to Britain , in 1989 , she founded a church and night shelter in Bedford , the King 's Arms Project , that helped drug addicts and alcoholics .
It also counselled gay , lesbian and transsexual people .
Abi , a teenage girl with transsexual issues , was sent to the church by her parents , who were evangelical Christians .
" Convinced I was demonically possessed , my parents made the decision to move to Bedford , because of this woman [ Stroud ] who had come back from Hong Kong and had the power to set me free , " Abi told the Observer .
" She wanted me to know all my thinking was wrong , I was wrong and the so - called demons inside me were wrong .
The session ended with her and others praying over me , calling out the demons .
She really believed things like homosexuality , transsexualism and addiction could be fixed just by prayer , all in the name of Jesus . "
" T " said he moved to Bedford because he believed the church could help him stop having homosexual thoughts .
" I was trying to convince myself that a change was possible but , at the same time , a part of me did n't believe it was possible , " he said .
" The church 's approach was not that it was sinful to be homosexual but that it was sinful to act on it .
The aim is to get a person to a position where they do n't have these sinful emotions and thoughts . "
" T " said it was only after he " took a break " from the church that his depression lifted .
" It was the church 's attitude towards my sexuality that was the issue , " he recalled .
" My impression is that she genuinely cares about people , " he said of Stroud .
" Her personal beliefs may get in the way sometimes , but she is a positive person . "
Stroud and her husband , David , a minister in the New Frontiers church , allied to the US evangelical movement , left the project in the late 1990s to establish another church in Birmingham .
Angela Paterson , who was an administrator at the Bedford church , said : " With hindsight , the thing that freaks me out was everybody praying that a demon would be cast out of me because I was gay .
Anything – drugs , alcohol or homosexuality , they thought you had a demon in you . "
Kacey Jones , a hostel resident , said she was told to end her lesbian relationship or leave the church .
" Philippa was still around when I first moved in , " Jones said .
" There was a ' discipleship house ' for Christians struggling with issues , including their sexuality .
They told me my feelings were n't normal .
I did n't want to be gay , I wanted to be like everybody else , get married , have kids and please my parents . "
Stroud wrote a book , God 's Heart for the Poor , in which she explains how to deal with people showing signs of " demonic activity " .
Stroud , who declined to talk to the Observer , writes : " I 'd say the bottom line is to remember your spiritual authority as a child of God .
He is so much more powerful than anything else ! "
In the book she discusses the daily struggle of running the hostel .
" One girl lived in the hostel for some time , became a Christian , then choked to death on her own vomit after a drinking bout .
Her life had changed to some extent , but we wondered whether God knew that she had n't the will to stick with it and was calling her home . "
One resident featured in the book , Mary , was in an abusive relationship .
" We discovered further layers of the tangle when she admitted to previous lesbian relationships and to being on the receiving end of abuse from her family , " Stroud writes , adding : " No wonder she was in such a mess ! "
The Conservatives have tried to win over gay voters after a string of controversial comments by party members .
The shadow home secretary , Chris Grayling , said owners of B&B accommodation should have the right to turn away gay couples .
Julian Lewis , the shadow defence minister , said he was against lowering the age of consent from 18 to 16 for homosexuals .
Revelations about Stroud 's past are likely to make the party 's task even more difficult .
" This reinforces our long - held suspicions that those out of sight , but with their hands on the levers of power , have deeply reactionary ambitions , " said Keith Porteous Wood , executive director of the National Secular Society .
Ben Summerskill , chief executive of the Stonewall group , said : " If Mrs Stroud has been praying to rid Britain of its homosexuality , she clearly has n't been praying hard enough .
It would be highly regrettable if someone who continued to hold these views held any significant office in government . "
• The article refers to " Abi " as a teenage girl .
For the sake of clarity it should be noted that Abi is a transexual - someone who identifies with a physical sex that is different from their biological one
COMPLAINT FROM PHILIPPA STROUD
Since publication , we have received a legal complaint from Philippa Stroud .
She disputes the testimonies contained in the article and states that she has helped individuals of all sexual orientations to deal with a multitude of problems such as drug addiction , self - harming , alcoholism , eating disorders , and sexual abuse through prayer as well as offering practical help and advice .
She also says that she has never founded a church , let alone a church that tried to ' cure ' homosexuals .
She has never prayed or advised any person to change his or her sexuality and has never countenanced any person for whom she has had responsibility attempting to question any person 's sexual orientation or to re-orient them .
In addition , the reference to demonic activity in her book " God 's help for the poor ' does not relate to sexual orientation but to those who have been involved in occult practices , including violence and sexual abuse .
She adds that the New Frontiers Church network is based in the UK and has over 600 branches worldwide of which 220 are in the UK and no more than 30 are in the USA .
It is not part of the US Evangelical Movement .

On his radio show today , Glenn Beck confuse the progressive movement of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries with the modern definition of progressive , so that that he could make the case that progressives are the most racist people who have ever lived in America , “ The most racist people ever to live .
The most racist people to ever live in America were the progressives . ”
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :
Advertisements
Beck got on his Woodrow Wilson kick again because US News and World Report wrote that he was wrong about Wilson , “ All you have to do is read Woodrow Wilson and you know the truth .
These people are trying to spin history yet again on Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt …
He put over 30,000 people in jail for speaking about his policies .
30,000 Americans went to jail , and I find it really fascinating that the only time we have rounded people up and put them in jail for either their skin color or their points of view , progressive Democrat Woodrow Wilson , progressive Democrat Franklin Roosevelt .
Those are the only two times in American history , and their washed , nobody talks about them .
Nobody looks at them .
Nobody remembers who they did it to . ”
Stu chimed in with the claim that the right has never done that to anybody , and Beck responded with , “ The most racist people ever to live .
The most racist people ever to live in America were the progressives , really radical , awful racist people . ”
While he was distorting the term progressive , Beck complained that , “ These people constantly morph , and they constantly change the argument , and change the language . ” ( Just as Beck is doing with the term progressive and the history of progressivism ) .
As usual , Beck has managed to leave some details out of his history lesson .
When talking about how Woodrow Wilson had 30,000 Americans arrested for disagreeing with him , Beck leaves out that this was known as the Palmer Raids , which was a red scare during World War I , where left wing anarchists , radicals , and communists were rounded up out of fear that they were collaborating with the US ’s war time enemies .
Notably , American Socialist Party presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs was also arrested .
The raids focused on alien foreign nationals , not US citizens as Beck claimed .
Importantly , Beck neglected to tell his listeners that the Palmer Raids took place after a series of 30 anarchist mail bombings in April 1919 against government offices and business leaders , and those arrested were held for up to four months while the Justice Department investigated them .
After they were investigated all were released except for a few hundred who were deported .
The claim that only progressive Democrats have imprisoned people based on their skin color is absurd .
Have they already forgotten about the post - 9/11 round up of American Muslims that was carried out during the Bush administration ?
These kinds of detentions and internments are an ugly part of American history that both parties have participated in .
The point of this whole little rant was to lead his listeners to the false conclusion that the progressives of yesteryear were racist , thus the progressives of today are racist , which would then excuse the racism of the right .
These fractured history lessons are a way for the right wing to invalidate the election of Barack Obama .
The fact that they are so willing to dismiss the modern progressive movement ’s role in the election of the first black United States president is not surprising .
These are the same people who are allowing Glenn Beck to rewrite US history so that it reflects their world view .
The fact that Beck is dealing half truths is irrelevant , because they are only seeking to have their behavior excused and their ideology confirmed .
A US official acknowledged Wednesday that the oil and gas industry largely polices its own drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico with little government supervision .
At a hearing into the deadly rig explosion that led to a massive , growing oil spill , the Minerals Management Service official said the regulatory agency did not enforce compliance with its “ safety alerts ” on underwater blowout preventers and allowed oil companies to inspect their own drilling equipment .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I am not aware of who does the self - certification , ” Michael Saucier , the Minerals Management Service regional supervisor , said when asked about the inspections .
The testimony came a day after Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced plans to break up the functions of the MMS to eliminate a conflict of interest in its role as oil industry regulator and a leaser of lucrative federal oil rights .
“ I ’m not understanding what good these regulations are if they are not enforceable , ” said Coast Guard Captain Hung Nguyen , who co-chaired the Deepwater Horizon Joint Investigation hearing with MMS .
The little known agency brings in billions of dollars a year in revenue from leases and royalties from an industry whose safety and environmental practices it also regulates .
Saucier said the accident on the Deepwater Horizon was the first deadly blowout on a Gulf rig drilling at a depth of 5,000 feet or more .
ADVERTISEMENT
Fiery explosions ripped through the rig on April 20 , killing 11 workers , sinking the structure and fracturing a riser pipe that is now gushing more than 200,000 gallons of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico .
The public hearing was part of a federal probe into the cause of the disaster , which threatens the ecology and economy of a Gulf coast rich in fish and wildlife .
Also testifying were officials from the tiny Marshall Islands , where the 600 million dollar Deepwater Horizon was registered in December 2004 .
ADVERTISEMENT
Brian Bubar , deputy commissioner of maritime affairs for the Marshall Islands , testified that safety inspections of the ill - fated rig were delegated to reputable third parties .
“ We have nothing to do with the drilling operation , ” said Captain Thomas Heinan , a second Marshall Islands deputy commissioner .
ADVERTISEMENT
The US depends on oil and gas operations on the federal Outer Continental Shelf — three to 200 miles off the coast — of the Gulf of Mexico for roughly one third of the nation ’s energy , according to MMS figures .
Asked what type of training the agency provides inspectors to keep up with the high - technology used in deepwater drilling rigs , Saucier replied , “ primarily on - the - job training . ”
Since the Deepwater Horizon exploded and sank , MMS inspections show that all deepwater drilling rigs in the Gulf are compliant with MMS safety regulations .
There were 42 drilling rigs operating in the Gulf as of May 3 .
Richard Blumenthal video : ' I did not serve in Vietnam '
Here 's some video of Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal -- who is under fire for embellishing his war record -- stating clearly in a high - profile setting earlier this year : " I did not serve Vietnam . "
The video , which was sent over by the DSCC , will be central to Blumenthal 's damage control efforts in the wake of a stunning New York Times report saying Blumenthal never served in Vietnam despite repeatedly suggesting otherwise .
The pushback from the Blumenthal camp , the heavy favorite to win the Senate race , will be that Blumenthal did not intend to deceive .
To be clear , the video does not get Blumenthal off the hook for his previous claims to have served .
But the video , which is from a debate in March , suggests that Blumenthal was not wedded in all settings to maintaining the fiction that he did active duty :
In the vid , Blumenthal says :
" Although I did not serve in Vietnam , I have seen firsthand the effects of military action , and no one wants it to be the first resort , nor do we want to mortgage the country 's future with a deficit that is ballooning out of control . "
The Times , however , unearthed repeated instances of Blumenthal stating clearly , or leaving a very strong impression , that he had served abroad .
In a sense , the above video only makes the story more bizarre : Blumenthal is a highly - regarded lawyer who clearly knows how to wield language effectively , and in the setting of a debate , he clearly had no interest in deceiving his audience .
Yet in other multiple settings he did just that , either through incompetence or by design .
It still remains to be seen whether his candidacy can , or should , survive this .
UPDATE , 9:40 a.m. :
Watch this original video of him clearly claiming that he did serve .
Inside the converted shipping container
Specialists in equipment for climbers claim to have built the world 's first " climbing wall in a box " .
Extreme Dream in Aviemore converted a redundant shipping container .
The outside has been made to look like an Alpine chalet , while inside is a mini climbing centre for training in bouldering and wall climbing .
The first Wall in a Box is to be shipped to the Naval Outdoor Centre Germany , an adventure training site used by the Royal Navy and marines .
Scott Muir , of Extreme Dream , said the idea for the box came while he was watching television programme Pimp My Ride .
The outside has been made to look like an Alpine chalet
He said : " I decided that if old cars can be given a full makeover , why could n't I do something to incorporate a climbing wall ?
" The plan to recycle an old shipping container that was ready for the scrap heap appealed to me and I did a couple of drawings on the back of an envelope . "
Mr Muir said other designs have been produced and the company has had inquiries from the UK and abroad , including the Middle East .
The Naval Outdoor Centre Germany , the first to order a Wall in a Box , is in Bavaria .

' New Culture of Stability ' Germany Forges Ahead on Reforming the Euro
Berlin means business .
In addition to pushing for increased regulation of hedge funds and of the financial markets , Chancellor Angela Merkel 's government has drafted a list of proposals to revamp the European common currency .
From suspending voting rights to national bankruptcy proceedings , the plan is far - reaching .
Ronnie James
Dio died the other day , quietly succumbed to a relatively sudden onset of stomach cancer and up and left the planet in a blaze of stage fire , dragonsmoke and general metal awesomeness .
Maybe you heard .
It was an abrupt end to a sort of stunning , nearly unprecedented 35 - year career in hard rock megastardom , a shock that sent all flags of classic campy Bic - lighter rock n' roll greatness to half mast for at least a solid year , or until Ozzy Osbourne spontaneously combusts , whichever comes first .
It is quite possible you have no idea who Dio was , or you do n't really care , or you think he and his various multiplatinum bands -- Rainbow , Black Sabbath , Dio -- were a bit of a long - haired crotch - rock musical circuslike joke .
Or maybe you were all aswoon for Rick Springfield or the Go - Go's at the time when a post - Ozzy Sabbath 2.0 was cranking out some of the best hard - rock songs of all time ( " Heaven & Hell , " " Mob Rules , " " Voodoo , " " Die Young " ) circa 1980ish .
It 's also possible you know just enough to know RJD was pretty much heavy metal personified , a tiny 5 - foot - 4 - inch sorcerer with a mangy mane , demonic eyes and sly grin , all coupled to a simply huge , operatic voice , a diminutive powerhouse who prowled the stage like a feline elf and who was , it turns out , also finely intelligent and well spoken , an actual gentleman in a genre known all too well for its bombastic , monosyllabic doltbuckets .
A rare thing indeed .
Metal is made up of many silly cliches , and Dio 's songs rarely shied away from a good cheeseball lyric about medieval knights and crystal balls .
But the amazing thing is , Dio the man never succumbed to the typical ravages of drugs , booze or hideous all - body tattoos .
He never gained 75 pounds later in life or lost most of his voice through merciless shredding and ended it all playing county fairs for 19 drunk dudes in a barn before collapsing in a heap in a motel room in Jersey .
There 's a lesson in there somewhere .
Or everywhere .
Hence , it is time for respect .
It is time to raise the fist and light the lighter and , of course , make the sign .
Oh , the sign .
It is formidable indeed .
It is the thing that will last forever .
It has the power .
Of the myriad impressive notables related to Dio's passing , perhaps foremost is the fact the man was 67 years old and was still making quality hard rock records , still touring with a new ( old ) version of Black Sabbath , still singing his absolute heart out about dragons and rainbows , making the infamous devil horns hand gesture he swiped from his Italian grandmother and which has since became the universal , undeniable , completely badass symbol for true metal across all galaxies everywhere , and for which Dio deserves to be ensconced in the heavens forevermore .
The gesture , it shall not be denied .
The gesture is all .
The gesture is made to this day by any true fan of rock ' n ' roll , even punk or glam or Goth .
Thus spaketh the gods :
If you do not know the gesture , you simply do not know how to rock .
Perhaps you should try it now .
Thumb in , middle and ring finger down , index and pinkie finger up , raised in defiance , awesomeness , true devotion to all that is heavy and pulsing and 4/ 4 .
See ?
The symbol makes almost anything better .
It also makes it more metal .
Ronnie James Dio was even older than Mick Jagger .
This is sort of amazing , doubly so because Mick Jagger 's band has n't written a good song since the Carter administration .
Dio , in some ways , remained more true to his origins and his passion than Jagger & Co .
Deny it at your peril .
It 's also worth noting because , as far as I can tell , Dio is officially the first of metal 's genuine elder statesmen to exit this planet , the first of its true legends to have contributed a lifetime of songcraft to the genre .
Sure , you had your Jimi Hendrix and Bon Scott and John Bonham , guys who all died lifetimes ago and who did n't even make it much into their 30s .
No one of Dio 's stature has made the move to the great throne room in the sky .
Until now .
It 's a little disquieting .
The lions of hard rock , guys like Robert Plant , Roger Daltrey , Brian Johnson , Rob Halford , these monsters feel completely timeless , iconic , eternal .
They simply shall not , will not , do not die .
It 's almost impossible to imagine a musical world without Robert Plant .
No metal fan of any stripe can imagine a day when , say , Iron Maiden shuts it all down because Bruce Dickinson turned 85 and suddenly can't remember the lyrics to " Hallowed Be Thy Name . "
Metal revels in the raw energy and unchecked phantasmagorical ridiculousness of youth .
It is all fire and testosterone and rebellious fantasy .
It does n't go well with reality .
So it is for hard rock and a guy like Dio , an elfin titan with an undying love for lasers and sorcery , dragons and kings .
The man wrote some terribly corny metal songs , but he sang every one with a ferocity and love and total honesty .
He also wrote some of the finest hard rock melodies of all time , sang them with a precision and love unmatched by any hard rock singer since .
It 's a rare thing to give metal some heartfelt props .
It is time .
Raise your devil horns and salute .

Researchers say a new study from the University of Minnesota 's School of Public Health and Masonic Cancer Center definitively links the use of indoor tanning devices to increased risk of melanoma , the most serious form of skin cancer .
This research study involving 2,268 Minnesotans is the largest of its kind .
It found :
People who use any type of tanning bed for any amount of time are 74 percent more likely to develop melanoma , and ;
Frequent users of indoor tanning beds are 2.5 to 3 times more likely to develop melanoma than those who never use tanning devices .
The study defines frequent uses as people who used indoor tanning for 50 plus hours , more than 100 sessions , or for 10 - plus years .
This increased risk applies similarly to all ages and genders .
DeAnn Lazovich , Ph.D. , led the research team on this study .
Lazovich is an associate professor of epidemiology with the School of Public Health and co-leader of the Masonic Cancer Center 's Prevention and Etiology Research Program .
The study findings are published online on May 27 in Cancer Epidemiology , Biomarkers and Prevention , a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research .
" We found that it did n't matter the type of tanning device used ; there was no safe tanning device , " Lazovich said .
" We also found -- and this is new data -- that the risk of getting melanoma is associated more with how much a person tans and not the age at which a person starts using tanning devices .
Risk rises with frequency of use , regardless of age , gender , or device . "
Melanoma is one of the fastest increasing cancers across the United States and in Minnesota .
About 69,000 people in the United States will be diagnosed with melanoma this year ; nearly 1,000 of those people will be Minnesotans .
Although melanoma accounts for only about 4 percent of all skin cancer , it causes about 79 percent of all deaths from skin cancer .
In a more advanced state , melanoma is especially difficult to successfully treat .
Before this study , indoor tanning has been only weakly associated with melanoma risk , Lazovich said .
" Most reports were not able to adjust for sun exposure , confirm a dose - response , or examine specific tanning devices , " she said .
" Our population - based , case - control study was conducted to address these limitations . "
Lazovich and her colleagues assessed Minnesota cases of invasive cutaneous melanoma diagnosed between 2004 and 2007 at ages 25 - 59 .
The study participants and results included :
1,167 people diagnosed with melanoma and 1,101 people ( control group ) without melanoma .
62.9 % of group with melanoma and 51.1 % of control group had tanned indoors .
Melanoma risk was about 3 times greater among users of UVB - enhanced devices and 4.4 times greater for UVA - emitting devices .
Risk increased with use , defined as 10 or more years , 50 or more hours , or more than 100 sessions .
Funding for this research was provided by the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society .

NEW YORK , May 6 ( Reuters ) -
The biggest intraday point drop ever in the Dow Jones Industrial Average may have been caused by an erroneous trade entered by a person at a big Wall Street bank , multiple market sources said on Thursday .
The so - called “ fat finger ” trade apparently involved an exchange - traded fund that holds shares of some of the biggest and most widely traded stocks , sources said .
The trade apparently was put in on the Nasdaq Stock Market , sources said .
Several sources said the speculation is that the trade was entered by someone at Citigroup C.N.
A Citigroup spokesman said it was investigating the rumor but that the bank currently had no evidence that an erroneous trade had been made .

Allegations that Britain was complicit in the use of chemical weapons linked to an upsurge in child deformity cases in Iraq , are being investigated by the Ministry of Defence .
The case raises serious questions about the UK's role in the American - led offensive against the city of Fallujah in the autumn of 2004 where hundreds of Iraqis died .
After the battle , in which it is alleged that a range of illegal weaponry was used , evidence has emerged of large numbers of children being born with severe birth defects .
Iraqi families who believe their children 's deformities are caused by the deployment of the weapons have now begun legal proceedings against the UK Government .
They accuse the UK Government of breaching international law , war crimes and failing to intervene to prevent a war crime .
Lawyers for the Iraqis have sent a letter before action to the MoD asking the Government to disclose what it knows about the Army 's role in the offensive , the presence of prohibited weapons and the legal advice given to Tony Blair , Prime Minister at the time .
Legal actions against America are blocked by US federal immunity laws and the US government 's boycott of the International Criminal Court .
The offensive against Fallujah , codenamed Phantom Fury , in 2004 was described as the most bitter fighting experienced by American soldiers since the war in Vietnam .
But US forces were assisted by British units .
On 21 October , British soldiers were ordered by the Cabinet to help US forces throw a " ring of steel " around Fallujah .
Six days later , a British battle group of 850 troops made up of the armoured infantry from the 1st Battalion , The Black Watch , an armoured reconnaissance squadron from the Queen 's Dragoon Guards , elements of 40 Commando Royal Marines and supporting specialists including Royal Engineers and Royal Military Police were redeployed from Basra .
The battle group established a base at Camp Dogwood on the eastern approach to Fallujah where they provided essential aid and assistance to the subsequent attacks on the city .
Before the attack the former Attorney General , Lord Goldsmith is alleged to have warned Mr Blair about the legal dangers of committing British forces to the attack .
Public Interest Lawyers , the law firm representing the Iraqi families , wants the Government to release this advice in full and say whether any British soldiers were involved in the fighting or supplied or helped fire prohibited weapons .
During the attack coalition forces are alleged to have used weapons including white phosphorus , a modern form of napalm , and depleted uranium .
The World Health Organisation , after reports first broadcast by Sky News two years ago , has begun investigating evidence of a worrying rise in the incidence of birth defects in the city , which Iraqi doctors attribute to the use of chemical weapons during the battle .
Malak Hamdan , a British Iraqi researcher working with doctors in Fallujah , told The Independent : " Doctors in Fallujah are witnessing unprecedented numbers of birth defects , miscarriages and cancer cases .
Now , according to gynaecologists , paediatricians and neurologists in Fallujah , the numbers of these cases have been increasing rapidly since 2005 . "
She explained that the most common birth defects involve the heart and the nervous system but there have also been reported cases of babies being born with two heads , upper and lower limb defects and eye abnormalities .
" What is more disturbing is that pregnant women are completely unaware that they are carrying an abnormal child until the day they give birth – traumatising the mother and the rest of the family , " said Ms Malak .
Mazin Younis , a UK - based Iraqi human rights activist who visited the city before the attack , said : " When I visited Fallujah a few weeks before the attack , I was shocked to see the majority of people had not left the city .
Many of them had no one to go to ....
We attacked this city ruthlessly without any concern for the fate of tens of thousands of civilians who were still living there .
The unlawful use of white phosphorus in built - up areas was ... never objected to by the British Government who assisted in the attack on Fallujah . "
Phil Shiner , the UK lawyer leading the legal challenge , said : " The rate and severity of both foetal abnormalities and inexplicable illnesses such as leukaemia or those suffered by our clients in infants born to mothers in Fallujah has been the subject of numerous reports and letters to governments ....
The full extent of the emerging public health crisis is unknown ....
Doctors report a " massive , unprecedented number " of congenital health problems .
The media investigation found that the incidence of birth defects in Fallujah has reached a rate 13 times higher than in Europe . "
‘ hiding in triangles ’ – mountain bike hotel by philip modest schambelan and anton fromm
the new mountain bike hotel is a proposal by philip modest schambelan and anton fromm .
located on the edge of pregasina in italy offers sports enthusiasts a place to stay , an unforgettable view and a fast connection to an impressive variety of routes , trails and single tracks .
pregasina is located on a plateau 500 meters above the northern tip of lake garda .
to totally exploit the panoramic view the new hotel is situated on a steep mountain ridge on the southeastern edge of the small town .
this on the one hand dissociates the new building of the traditional architecture , on the other hand the unconventional construction can be guessed by a small protrusion .
the principles in the draft include : complete access by mountain bike at all levels , maximum use of the panoramic view of lake garda and the mountain slopes of the alps , no impairment of the view from pregasina and a full and individual accommodation of riders and sports equipment in each residential unit .
to ensure the trafﬁcability each access element has a tilt angle of 12 ° . the angle of the access routes to each other changes both by the natural curve of the mountain , as well as by the decreasing distance between the building and the mountain in the vertical direction .
these two factors generate the ﬁxed points in the front supporting framework , as well as spaces in the metal braiding .
In these spaces , the residential units will be established .
the structure is stabilized by three cores , which provide access to the rooms .
thus , way and construction form a unit that deﬁnes the form .
the access routes form two different paths , which are connected on the top and bottom ﬂoor .
this system of a contiguous band provides an optimal pathways in terms of trafﬁcability and the access to each residential unit .
the main facade is oriented towards the north - east , which guarantees each unit a view of the northern tip of the lake .
at the same time it allows shading of the living areas by the hill .
the communal areas such as coffee shops , snack bar , the sun deck and a media room are located on the top ﬂoor , level 0 , which looks out over the mountain easily .
here , the sunlight is desired and used .

Artist 's rendering depicts the Voyager 2 spacecraft as it studies the outer limits of the heliosphere - a magnetic ' bubble ' around the Solar System that is created by the solar wind .
Scientists observed the magnetic bubble is not spherical , but pressed inward in the southern hemisphere .
NASA engineers have fully revived the far - flung Voyager 2 probe on the edge of the solar system after fixing a computer glitch that scrambled its messages home for nearly three weeks .
A single bit flip in one location in the 33 - year - old probe 's memory storage caused the problem , and was remotely reset Sunday by engineers at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
After a computer reset , the Voyager 2 is back on track , they said .
The malfunction began April 22 while Voyager 2 was flying 8.6 billion miles ( 13.8 billion km ) from Earth in the heliosphere , the magnetic bubble that surrounds our solar system .
Mission scientists could not decipher the probe 's science data messages and put the spacecraft in an engineering mode to just send health updates to Earth .
The actual cause of the computer glitch is still unknown , NASA 's Voyager 2 project manager Ed Massey told SPACE.com .
Voyager 2 hiccup in deep space
Memory bit flips and other electronic problems have affected spacecraft , and even Voyager 2 and its twin Voyager 1 , in the past .
But they occurred when the spacecraft were much closer to Earth , around 1 or 2 astronomical units ( AU ) .
One AU is the distance between the Earth and the sun , about 93 million miles ( 151 million km ) .
That 's close enough for their onboard systems to be affected by the electric charge of the sun 's solar wind , Massey said .
" In some spacecraft that are closer to the sun one could think of single event upsets caused by solar activity .
But we 're so far away , it 's hard to say that 's what caused it , " he added .
" We 're like 93 , 94 AU out . "
Way , way out there
The two Voyager probes are currently the farthest human - built objects from Earth .
Voyager 1 is about 10.5 billion miles ( 16.9 billion km ) away from Earth and in perfect health .
Their signals take nearly 13 hours to travel to NASA 's worldwide Deep Space Network of listening antennas and back .
After detecting the problem on Voyager 2 , engineers ordered Voyager 2 on May 6 to only send engineering data to Earth until they could solve the glitch .
That occurred on May 12 , when engineers realized that a single memory location had been changed from a 0 to a 1 .
By May 19 , commands to reset the bit were sent to Voyager 2 and the probe resumed sending science data to Earth on May 22 .?
NASA announced the deep space operation 's success this week .
NASA launched Voyager 2 in 1977 primarily aimed at studying Saturn , though the spacecraft gained fame for its so - called " grand tour " of the solar system that also included flybys Jupiter , Uranus and Neptune thanks to a planetary alignment that only occurs once every 176 years .?
Now , both Voyager 2 and Voyager 1 are headed out of the solar system entirely .
Scientists hope the data they are sending back will help answer questions surrounding the magnetic bubble around the solar system .
No known source of magnetic or electric field exists in the membrane which separates the heliosphere from interstellar space , said Massey .
Voyager 2 has occupied this region since 2007 , said Massey , and has not seen any problems .
" The real question is whether we 'll ever know , " He said .
The opening of the new week sees the first reactions to the placing of Greece under IMF supervision : air - force pilots and means of transport strike .
Only hours after the Greek PM Giorgos Papandreou announced the entering of Greece under IMF supervision from the remote island of Kastelorizo last Friday , stressing that " hellenism is beginning a new Odyssey " , a sponteneous protest march of 5,000 organised on - line and via cell phone texting took to the streets of Athens , leading to clashes with the police and the arrest of a 15 year old girl .
At the same time , banks were reported to be besieged by customers seeking to withdraw their deposits in fear of a default .
The opening of the new week has seen the government announcing the merging or abolition of a series of public services , the only way to constitutionally sack civil servants .
And yet , reactions to the IMF supervision have been rather mild .
The means of mass transport ( one of the sectors threatened by merging ) performed a 4h stoppage today , while GSEE , the private sector union umbrella , refused to attend the planned meeting with the Minister of Labour , in a ritual but empty gesture of discontent .
Perhaps the most unexpected reaction has come however from the armed forces , where Air -Force pilots have staged a white strike refusing to fly their scheduled training flights .
The strike has infuriated the Ministry of Defence , especially as it seems like underwater special forces and submarine forces are soon to perform similar white strikes .
The reason for the strike is the taxing of the 6,000 Euro biannual subsidy to Air -Force pilots .
At the same time the harbour of Piraeus remains closed due to the continuing seafaring workers strike .
Meanwhile PAME ( Communist Party union umbrella ) allied hotel workers have occupied the Ministry of Labour .
The workers have declared they will continue the occupation until the Minister comes to meet them .
I trust Google with a lot of things , but when in doubt I always fall back on good - old common sense .
Lauren Rosenberg did not .
She walked onto a highway because Google told her to and got hit by a car .

Rosenberg , who apparently takes things very literally , was reading the directions on her Blackberry and thus was n't privy to the warning that shows up when you access walking directions on a computer :
Walking directions are in beta .
Use caution –
This route may be missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths .

Deer Valley Drive , also known as Utah State Route 224 , was one such route , and following Google 's instructions to brave it on foot , Rosenberg was hit by a car and is now suing the company for $ 100,000 .
She probably figures it 's a reasonable sum , considering that Google 's worth $ 1 with a hundred zeroes after it .

STATEN ISLAND , N.Y . -- A 9 - year - old boy was forced naked into the oven of his Graniteville home by his enraged father , police said .
The boy 's crime ?
He apparently foraged in his parent 's wallet .
" I ’m going to burn you alive ! ” James Moss , 52 , yelled at young Christopher before closing the oven door , according to court papers .
Investigators say the hulking Moss — he stands 6 feet , 3 inches and weighs 270 pounds — did not light the oven with Christopher inside , but the boy suffered second - and third - degree burns of his hands when his father held them over the burner ’s open flame for two minutes , court documents state .
Christopher was taken to Staten Island University Hospital , Ocean Breeze , for treatment of his injuries .
The boy ’s hellish ordeal began Wednesday at about 9 p.m. inside the family 's townhouse apartment at 40 Regal Walk , according to a spokesman for District Attorney Daniel Donovan .
Moss accused his son — a fraction of the size of his imposing father — of stealing from him , and claimed that burning his son ’s hand and tossing him into the oven was a justified course of discipline , authorities said .
“ My son stole some money from my wallet and I burnt him and burnt his hand on the stove , ” Moss told police , according to court papers .
Moss also hit his son in the back with a spatula , smacked his face and dragged him across the floor , scratching the boy ’s knees , police said .
Prosecutors charged Moss with second - degree assault and endangering the welfare of a child .
View Larger Map
Moss did n’t post his $ 15,000 bail or bond and was remanded to Rikers Island , according to the city Department of Correction Web site .
Reached on the telephone , Moss ' wife declined comment on her husband 's arrest .
The case is being investigated by the Staten Island Special Victims Squad .
The accusations put Moss in some pretty poor company : Island parentswho have tortured their children , oftentimes resulting in death .
On May 18 , 2007 , Joseph Wallace of Port Richmond sodomized and fatally beat his 2 - month - old son in a beer - fueled rage .
Wallace , 24 , was sentenced to a minimum 15 years to life behind bars after pleading guilty to second - degree murder .
On Aug. 7 that same year , 20 - month - old Hailey Gonzalez of New Brighton was viciously beaten and violently thrown into her crib by her mother 's boyfriend , Edwin Garcia .
The toddler 's mother , Marlene Medina , waited more than five hours to seek medical attention for Hailey .
Garcia , 32 , was sent to prison for 25 years while Ms. Medina , 27 , was given two to six years behind bars for manslaughter .
And in April , Melissa Sekulski of Mariners Harbor was sentenced to 20 years in prison for killing her son , Jaquan Porter , on Dec. 26 , 2008 .
She had pleaded guilty to first - degree manslaughter .
Ms. Sekulski , 31 , restrained her 10 - year - old son's hands with duct tape as she beat him to death in their apartment .
Ms. Sekulski pummeled the boy , who weighed more than 260 pounds at the time of his death , for being obese , investigators said .
One of two former judges accused of taking kickbacks to send youths to for - profit detention facilities has agreed to plead guilty to a federal racketeering charge .
Michael Conahan , a former Luzerne County judge , will plead guilty in the $ 2.8 million “ kids for cash ” scandal , according to an agreement filed Thursday in Scranton .
Prosecutors said Mr. Conahan and another former judge , Mark Ciavarella Jr. , took kickbacks from the owner and builder of two private juvenile detention facilities .

4 Things that Lower Testosterone
1. Milk
This study confirms 70 % of the estrogens you probably eat come rom dairy products ( see avoiding xenoestrogens for more testosterone )
Men is this study saw their testosterone levels decrease after drinking just 2½ cups of milk .
According to this story how Mongolian kids ( who truly consume organically raised dairy products ) saw their estrogen levels go up quickly after only 1 month of consuming genetically modified American milk .
2. Losing Too Much Fat
Losing so much fat to where your bodyfat percentage is lower than 5 - to - 8 % can dramatically reduce your testosterone levels by almost 75 % like these natural bodybuilders ( who were already at a healthy 15 % bodyfat ) when they went down to 4.5 % bodyfat .
3. Licorice
These men lost 34 % of their testosterone taking 7g of licorice tablets daily and it took them 4 days of not taking licorice to regain their original testosterone level .
4. Certain Drugs
Statins & Beta blockers
Corticosteroids
Opiate - based painkillers
Tagamet & Cimetidine
Finasteride & Dutasteride
Ketoconazole
Sylfonylurea
Spironolactone

Cloud computing promises a number of advantages for the deployment of data - intensive applications .
Most prominently , these include reducing cost with a pay - as - you - go pricing model and ( virtually ) unlimited throughput by adding servers if the workload increases .
At the Systems Group , ETH Zurich , we did an extensive end - to - end performance study to compare the major cloud offerings regarding their ability to fulfill these promises and their implied cost .
The focus of the work is on transaction processing ( i.e. , read and update work - loads ) , rather than analytics workloads .
We used the TPC-W , a standardized benchmark simulating a Web - shop , as the baseline for our comparison .
The TPC - W defines that users are simulated through emulated browsers ( EB ) and issue page requests , called web - interactions ( WI ) , against the system .
As a major modification to the benchmark , we constantly increase the load from 1 to 9000 simultaneous users to measure the scalability and cost variance of the system .
Figure 1 shows an overview of the different combinations of services we tested in the benchmark .
The main results are shown in Figure 2 and Table 1 - 2 and are surprising in several ways .
Most importantly , it seems that all major vendors have adopted a different architecture for their cloud services ( e.g. , master - slave replication , partitioning , distributed control and various combinations of it ) .
As a result , the cost and performance of the services vary significantly depending on the workload .
A detailed description of the architectures is provided in the paper .
Furthermore , only two architectures , the one implemented on top of Amazon S3 and MS Azure using SQL Azure as the database , were able to scale and sustain our maximum workload of 9000 EBs , resulting in over 1200 Web- interactions per second ( WIPS ) .
MySQL installed on EC2 and Amazon RDS are able to sustain a maximum load of approximate 3500 EBs .
MySQL Replication performed similar to MySQL standalone with EBS , so we left it off the picture .
Figure 1 shows that the WIPS of Amazon ’s SimpleDB grow up to about 3000 EBs and more than 200 WIPS .
In fact , SimpleDB was already overloaded at about 1000 EBs and 128 WIPS in our experiments .
At this point , all write requests to hot spots failed .
Google AppEngine already dropped out at 500 emulated browsers with 49 WIPS .
This is mainly due to Google ’s transaction model not being built for such high write workloads .
When implementing the benchmark , our policy was to always use the highest offered consistency guarantees , which come closest to the TPC - W requirements .
Thus , in the case of AppEngine , we used the offered transaction model inside an entity group .
However , it turned out , that this is a big slow - down for the whole performance .
We are now in the process of re-running the experiment without transaction guarantees and curios about the new performance results .
Table 1 shows the total cost per web - interaction in milli dollar for the alternative approaches and a varying load ( EBs ) .
Google AE is cheapest for low workloads ( below 100 EBs ) whereas Azure is cheapest for medium to large workloads ( more than 100 EBs ) .
The three MySQL variants ( MySQL , MySQL / R , and RDS ) have ( almost ) the same cost as Azure for medium workloads ( EB=100 and EB=3000 ) , but they are not able to sustain large workloads .
The success of Google AE for small loads has two reasons .
First , Google AE is the only variant that has no fixed costs .
There is only a negligible monthly fee to store the database .
Second , at the time these experiments were carried out , Google gave a quota of six CPU hours per day for free .
That is , applications which are below or slightly above this daily quota are particularly cheap .
Azure and the MySQL variants win for medium and large workloads because all these approaches can amortize their fixed cost for these workloads .
Azure SQL server has a fixed cost per month of USD 100 for a database of up to 10 GB , independent of the number of requests that need to be processed by the database .
For MySQL and MySQL/R , EC2 instances must be rented in order to keep the database online .
Likewise , RDS involves an hourly fixed fee so that the cost per WIPS decreases in a load situation .
It should be noted that network traffic is cheaper with Google than with both Amazon and Microsoft .
Table 2 shows the total cost per day for the alternative approaches and a varying load ( EBs ) .
( A " - " indicates that the variant was not able to sustain the load . )
These results confirm the observations made previously : Google wins for small workloads ;
Azure wins for medium and large workloads .
All the other variants are somewhere in between .
The three MySQL variants come close to Azure in the range of workloads that they sustain .
Azure and the three MySQL variants roughly share the same architectural principles ( replication with master copy architectures ) .
SimpleDB is an outlier in this experiment .
With the current pricing scheme , SimpleDB is an exceptionally expensive service .
For a large number of EBs , the high cost of SimpleDB is particularly annoying because users must pay even though SimpleDB drops many requests and is not able to sustain the workload .
Turning to the S3 cost in Table 2 , the total cost grows linearly with the workload .
This behavior is exactly what one would expect from a pay - as - you - go model .
For S3 , the high cost is matched by high throughputs so that the high cost for S3 at high workloads is tolerable .
This observation is in line with a good Cost / WI metric for S3 and high workloads ( Table 1 ) .
Nevertheless , S3 is indeed more expensive than all the other approaches ( except for SimpleDB ) for most workloads .
This phenomenon can be explained by Amazon 's pricing model for EBS and S3 .
For instance , a write operation to S3 is hundred times more expensive than a write operation to EBS which is used in the MySQL variant .
Amazon can justify this difference because S3 supports concurrent updates with an eventual consistency policy whereas EBS only supports a single writer ( and reader ) at a time .
In addition to the here presented results , the paper also compares the overload behavior and presents the different cost - factors leading to the here presented numbers .
If you are interested in these results and additional information about the test - setup , the paper will be presented at this year 's SIGMOD conference and can also be downloaded here .
The mass shooting at Virginia Tech , which killed 32 people three years ago Friday , touched off an intense debate over whether colleges should remain gun- free zones , or whether allowing students and faculty to carry concealed weapons might have resulted in fewer deaths .
Though the debate continues , so far colleges have generally declined to move to allow concealed guns on campus – and most state legislatures have not forced them to do so .
Today 26 states prohibit conceal and carry on college campuses , and 23 states leave the decision to the schools , according to the nonpartisan Project America .
In these 23 states , a large majority of colleges prohibit conceal and carry .
Only Utah has a 2004 law requiring publicly funded schools to permit students over 21 with conceal and carry licenses to carry guns on campus .
“ After Virginia Tech , we faced a push by the gun lobby to expand conceal - and - carry rights at colleges , ” says Andy Pelosi of the Campaign to Keep Guns Off Campus .
“ But we have been trying to raise awareness , and more and more people are joining our cause . ”
This year at least 10 state legislatures are considering bills dealing with guns on campus , he says .
Gun rights proponents argue that colleges should allow students and faculty to carry concealed weapons as a deterrent and as a means of protection in situations such as the Virginia Tech shooting , in which a student with a history of mental illness went on an extended rampage against fellow students and faculty before shooting himself .
Gun control advocates respond that allowing students to carry concealed weapons would create more violence , not less .
Since the Virginia
Tech tragedy , measures to allow concealed carry on college campuses have stalled or been voted down in state legislatures 34 times , The Wall Street Journal reported in July 2009 .
No laws allowing conceal and carry on campuses have passed since then , says Mr. Pelosi .
Last year , Texas , Tennessee , and Louisiana each voted on measures similar to Utah's .
The votes in Texas and Tennessee were close , but the bills failed .
Louisiana voted the measure down 86 to 18 .
“ Texas was a huge win , but we knew they ’d be back , ” says Pelosi , referring to gun rights groups and their allies in the legislature .
Students who support broad gun rights are mobilizing .
Last week , Students for Concealed Carry on Campus reported holding “ Empty Holster Protest ” events at dozens of college campuses .
Participants wore empty holsters to show they are legal gun owners forbidden to carry concealed firearms at their schools .
“ We call gun - free zones ‘ disarmed victim zones , ’ ” Steve Khemthong , a participant in the Empty Holster Protest and a student at Central Connecticut State University , told the New Britain Herald .
Mr. Khemthong ’s gun club hosted “ NRA University , ” a two - hour seminar discussing US gun laws and the work of the National Rifle Association .
During the seminar , the NRA ’s Seth Waugh encouraged various forms of pro-gun activism , such as communicating with state legislators and volunteering for a campaign , the Herald reported .
Despite legislative setbacks , gun rights advocates have achieved some success in the courts .
On Thursday , a Colorado appellate court ruled in favor of Students for Concealed Carry on Campus , finding that the University of Colorado ’s rule prohibiting conceal and carry violates the state ’s 2003 Concealed Carry Act .
The university is considering appealing to the Colorado Supreme Court , spokesman Ken McConnellogue told the Associated Press .
If the school does not appeal , gun-control proponents in the legislature are expected to try to rewrite the law in question – the Concealed Carry Act of 2003 .

Story by Luis Carrión
The music of Namoli Brennet is often labeled as folk .
But if you listen closely you can tell that the lyrics and tone of her songs push beyond the boundaries of this catchall generic term .
Namoli herself finds it difficult to try to categorize her sound .
“ That ’s for some sort of objective third party to try to decide , ” she says before conceding that she ’s primarily a singer - songwriter who is trying to deliver an artistic vision while being true to herself .
“ Being true to herself ” is an ongoing process , and she says that being Trans , is simply a natural outcome of that need to have integrity .
Namoli Brennet was born male , and transitioned to female .
She says that without embarking on this transformative journey she would not have been able to write and perform music with any sort of creative substance .
“ It was impossible for me to get to ( this ) point creatively without uncovering the purest and most authentic version of myself . ”
Namoli has been a resident of Tucson for about 15 years , and has been playing music since she was 6 .
She came the University of Arizona to study choral conducting after having received her undergraduate degree in music from Western Connecticut State University .
She says “ eventually I came back to being a singer - songwriter , which was my original idea … I sort of got a little distracted . ”
She may have had a few distractions in the process , but her roundabout path to becoming a singer songwriter and touring musician has been well served by her ongoing academic focus on music .
In her home studio , where she ’s currently fine tuning the mix of her upcoming CD , she moves fluidly between piano , guitar , mandolin , and bass .
She ’ll also get behind the drum kit to lay down some tracks if she feels inspired .
She considers herself lucky to be able to play so many instruments , and says that it ’s a little like being a painter that tests different colors on a canvas .
She keeps working through an intuitive process until it feels right .
Namoli currently performs and tours primarily as a soloist .
She says that she prefers the intimate connection with the audience as a soloist , and finds that the ensemble setting often dissipates the power of her songs .
“ With a group your energy goes latterly … and the connection with the audience is more direct as soloist , ” she says .
“ I think that ’s part of why I like it …
It ’s a very direct line of communication . ”
You can see Namoli Brennet , in February , as part of the local music program In Tune on KUAT Channel 6 .
The Google Street View car in Sydney .
" The question is why an organisation like Google that already knows so much about individuals , that is driving around and taking photos of every street in Australia , is collecting data that could enable it to physically map that information to a physical street and presumably a physical house , " asked Geordie Guy , vice - chairman of Electronic Frontiers Australia .
The EFA and Australian Privacy Foundation are jointly drafting a letter that will be sent to Google today .
Privacy concerns
Google has taken some heat lately about its commitment to privacy after officials from 10 governments - including New Zealand , Canada and France - wrote a letter to chief executive Eric Schmidt to express their concern over data collection for Street View and the implementation of its Buzz social networking tool .

Google claims the Wi-Fi data is only being used to help pinpoint the location of mobile devices on Google Maps and other location services much like a GPS signal , and that no details it collects about the network are published online .
However , privacy advocates are seeking details of exactly what data is being captured by the Street View cars as well as assurances that its use will not extend beyond this application .
The Google Street View car .
" In terms of what they are collecting about Wi -Fi networks , there 's a bajillion questions we have that are n't answered there , and we 're likely to have more .
Google talks about wireless routers at home but what about the printers , computers , mobile phones and other devices that might be sending out wireless information ? "
Guy said .
The German government was surprised last month to discover that Wi -Fi data was being collected alongside Street View photographs .
German newspaper Der Spiegel reported that Germany 's Data Protection Commissioner Peter Schaar was " horrified " by the revelations .
The UK Information Commissioner 's Office said it was also ignorant of the practice .
" At no point did Google make us aware that it would be scanning Wi-Fi too , " ICO spokesman Nick Day told New Scientist magazine .
Little is known about Google 's collection of this data .
Although the company argues the information is public and therefore not in breach of any laws , it conceded last week that it could have been better publicised .
In response to why Google had not specifically informed governments of its activities , the company 's privacy spokesman Peter Fleischer said : " Given it was unrelated to Street View , that is accessible to any WiFi- enabled device and that other companies already collect it , we did not think it was necessary .
However it 's clear with hindsight greater transparency would have been better . "
Wi -Fi data in Australia Google Australia confirmed yesterday it was collecting Wi -Fi data in Australia .
It said the collection of such data was commonplace , although the EFA said it was not aware of any such projects here .
One of the companies gathering this type of data for creation of location - based services is Skyhook Wireless , which operates from the US .
Guy said : " If what Google 's doing is an apples - to - apples comparison with Skyhook , and that information is already collected globally by Skyhook , why not buy it off them ?
Cheaper than driving a van down every street in Australia , right ?
" Google is in a position to make inferences about that kind of data .
Skyhook does n't have a year 's worth of search history . "
Karen Curtis , Australian privacy commissioner , who did not sign the letter from government officials to Google last month , said she had been informed of the Wi-Fi data collection by Google .
" From a privacy perspective , our preliminary inquiries have indicated that the information about Wi -Fi data that Google is collecting would not be considered personal information under the Privacy Act , " she said .
However , Guy said more assurances were needed .
" A MAC address on a home wireless connection or any other piece of electronics that uses Wi-Fi is a serial number , it 's unique .
If Google rang you up - or anyone else - and asked you to read out a serial number of your mobile phone , what would you say ?
I 'd tell them its none of their business .
If I saw them on the street with binoculars trying to read it , I 'd close the curtains . "
Social network security
This is not the first time Google has been questioned over its privacy policies .
The botched roll - out of its Buzz social network , which made the contact lists of Gmail users public to other subscribers , was highlighted in last month 's letter to the company from international privacy officials .
" It is unacceptable to roll out a product that unilaterally renders personal information public , with the intention of repairing problems later as they arise .
Privacy cannot be sidelined in the rush to introduce new technologies to online audiences around the world .
" Unfortunately , Google Buzz is not an isolated case .
Google Street View was launched in some countries without due consideration of privacy and data protection laws and cultural norms .
" We therefore call on you , like all organisations entrusted with people 's personal information , to incorporate fundamental privacy principles directly into the design of new online services , " the letter to Google said .
Loading
Google responded to that letter this week with assurances that it took personal privacy seriously .
" Respecting privacy is part of every Googler 's job .
We also have a team of seasoned privacy professionals , including legal , policy , security and engineering experts , to help guide the development of responsible privacy policies across Google , " it said .
Monthly Financial Checklist : 6 Activities for June
We ’re approaching the mid-year mark , and it ’s a great time to evaluate your financial situation .
If you ’ve been working on financial goals this year , a personal financial checklist by month is a great way to help you keep track .
( See checklists for May and April . )
As you contemplate the remainder of the year , here are 6 financial activities for June that can help you keep your money management goals on track :
1. Make Your Quarterly Estimated Payment
If you make quarterly estimated payments , your estimated payment is due on June 15 .
It seems like tax season just ended , but for those who pay quarterly , tax season never really completely ends .
2. Review Your Finances
Now is the time to take stock of your finances .
How have you been with your budget for the first half of the year ?
What unexpected expenses have cropped up ?
Has your spending plan been realistic ?
It might be time to make adjustments to your financial plan , or it might be time to rein in some of the practices that have been slowly creeping out of control .
Re-commit to your financial goals .
3. Review Your Bills
Go through your bills and subscriptions and see what you can do about them .
Cancel subscriptions to publications you do n’t read anymore , and see if you can find alternatives online .
Review phone bills , Internet costs and TV costs .
See if it makes sense to bundle ( it might not ) , or if you can save money by ditching the landline and using VoIP instead .
It might also be time to put a limit on texting , or add unlimited texting to your plan ( depending on your needs ) .
4. Arrange for an Inspection for Your Heating System
Now that the heat is off , and you do n’t need the heating system , have it inspected — or do it yourself if you know how .
Check the furnace , the ducts and other parts of the system .
Make sure it is working properly , and have it serviced if needed .
If you have an old furnace , consider upgrading .
Plug leaks and clean vents and filters .
5. Consider Making Green Home Improvements
If you want to make green home improvements to improve the energy efficiency of your home , this is the year to do it .
Green home improvement credits are set to expire at the end of 2010 , so if you want to do replacement windows , get a solar or wind system , get better insulation or make a number of other improvements , you can get a tax credit .
Do your research in June , finding out what tax credits are available at the federal and state levels , as well as discovering what special programs your city or utility company might have to help pay for green home improvements .
6. Plant a Garden
One of the ways to save on produce is to plant a garden .
You can grow your own food inexpensively .
You save money on food , and reap some health benefits .
Start an organic garden in your backyard .
If you do n’t have the space for a larger garden , start a container garden .
It is possible to grow a number of different plants that can provide herbs , fruits and vegetables in a variety of settings — including indoors .
LONDON - Britain's top medical group on Monday banned a doctor whose research suggesting a link between a common vaccine and autism caused millions of parents worldwide to abandon the shot for measles , mumps and rubella .
Dr. Andrew Wakefield was the first to publish peer - reviewed research suggesting such a connection , even though the study was later widely discredited .
The ruling by Britain 's General Medical Council found him guilty of serious professional misconduct .
Wakefield , 53 , then moved to the U.S. and set up an autism center in Texas , where he has a wide following , but faces similar skepticism from the medical community .
The ruling in Britain only applies to his right to practice medicine in the U.K. , not in other countries .
Appearing on NBC's " Today Show " on Monday , Wakefield described the decision as " a little bump on the road . "
He claimed the U.S. government has been settling cases of vaccine - induced autism since 1991 .
Wakefield said the council 's ruling against him - which cited alleged unethical conduct in carrying out his research - had been " made from the outset " and vowed to continue his research into the link between vaccines and autism .
" These parents are not going away ; the children are not going to go away and I most certainly am not going away , " he said .
Two rulings by a special branch of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in March and last year found no link between vaccines and autism .
But more than 5,500 claims have been filed by families seeking compensation for children believed to have been hurt by the measles vaccine .
Wakefield has the right to appeal the ruling , which takes effect within 28 days .
Vaccination rates in Britain have never recovered since Wakefield 's research was published in 1998 and there are measles outbreaks in the country every year .
The disease is also on the rise in the U.S .
Numerous other studies have been conducted since then and none have found a connection between autism and any vaccine .
Britain's General Medical Council struck Wakefield from the medical register Monday and found him guilty of " serious professional misconduct . "
The council 's investigation focused on how Wakefield and colleagues carried out their research , not on the science behind it .
Wakefield has been a central figure in the anti-vaccine lobby and has garnered much support from parents suspicious of vaccines , including some Hollywood celebrities .
In February , U.S. actress Jenny McCarthy , who has an autistic son , issued a statement with her former partner Jim Carrey .
" It is our most sincere belief that Dr. Wakefield and parents of children with autism around the world are being subjected to a remarkable media campaign engineered by vaccine manufacturers , " McCarthy and Carrey said in February .
" Dr. Wakefield is being vilified through a well - orchestrated smear campaign . "
Wakefield and colleagues published a study in the medical journal Lancet in 1998 alleging a link between autism and the vaccine for measles , mumps and rubella .
At the time , Wakefield was working as a gastroenterologist at London 's Royal Free Hospital and did not have the ethical approval to conduct the study .
He had also been paid to advise lawyers representing parents who believed their children had been hurt by the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine .
Ten of the study 's authors later renounced its conclusions and it was retracted by the Lancet in February .
In 2005 , Wakefield founded a nonprofit autism center in Austin , Texas , but quit earlier this year .
In January , Britain 's medical council ruled that Wakefield and two other doctors acted unethically and showed a " callous disregard " for the children in their study .
The medical body said Wakefield took blood samples from children at his son's birthday party , paying them 5 pounds ( today worth $ 7.20 ) each and later joked about the incident .
In a statement then , Wakefield said the medical council 's investigation was an effort to " discredit and silence " him to " shield the government from exposure on the ( measles ) vaccine scandal . "
In Monday 's ruling , the medical council said Wakefield abused his position as a doctor and " brought the medical profession into disrepute . "
At least a dozen British medical associations including the Royal College of Physicians , the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust have issued statements verifying the safety of the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine .
" I hope this ruling will finally persuade the public and some misguided journalists that Dr. Wakefield behaved irresponsibly , " said Dr. Jennifer Best , a virologist at King 's College University in London .
" ( The measles ) vaccine is a safe vaccine . "
Bill left out George Allen 's Macaca moment among a few others , but he 's right , it 's harder to lie now that everyone 's recording everything , not that the Republicans will ever care .
They 're shameless and they have ClusterFox to cover for them .
New Rule : Politicians Must Be Informed of Their Rights : " Everything You Say Can and Will Be Used Against You in a Google Search " :
New Rule : Before running for office , politicians must be informed of their rights : that " Everything you say can and will be used against you in a Google search . "
Now , of course , we all embellish our resumes a little .
In college , I described my job of pot dealer as " regional sales associate for a large multi-national firm . "
But we just had the fifth anniversary of YouTube and the twelfth of Google , and between them , they 're killing off a great institution : lying .
You just can't lie anymore -- facts are too easy to check , everything is on video , and your wife put a GPS in your glove compartment .
Our privacy is gone , our Internet conversations are forever .
I even have reason to believe I 'm being recorded right now ...
Jesus once said that there was nothing hidden that would not some day be revealed , but if he was alive today , and walked on water , it would be instantly on YouTube between a skateboard accident and a turtle biting a baby 's ass .
And the first comment would be " fag . "
Twenty - four hours of new video is posted on YouTube every 60 seconds .
Mostly of a girl named Kelly , showing off things she bought at Forever 21 , but still ...

In der Berufung eines Verfügungsverfahrens gegen den File - Hoster Rapidshare hat das Oberlandesgericht ( OLG ) Düsseldorf eine zunächst vom deutschen Film - und DVD - Verleih Capelight Pictures erwirkte Einstweilige Verfügung aufgehoben ( Az. I - 20 U 166/09 ) .
Der Hoster sei für die Veröffentlichung urheberrechtlich geschützten Materials durch Dritte nicht haftbar zu machen , erklärte das Gericht und nahm die vom Landgericht Düsseldorf im Hauptsacheverfahren zunächst bestätigte Verfügung zurück .
Rapidshare - Anwalt Daniel Raimer bezeichete das Urteil als " richtungsweisend " .
Das Urteil liegt über Kreuz mit vorangegangenen Entscheidungen der Oberlandesgerichte Hamburg und Köln , die dem umstrittenen File - Hoster in die Mitstörerhaftung genommen und zumindest eingeschränkte Prüfpflichten auferlegt hatten .
Auf diese Urteile gehen auch die Düsseldorfer Richter in ihrer ausführlichen Begründung ein , kommen aber zu einem anderen Ergebnis : Rapidshare ist nicht haftbar und muss auch nicht mehr als bisher tun , um hochgeladene Dateien auf mögliche Rechtsverletzungen zu prüfen .
Rapidshare biete " Dienstspeicherplatz zum Hochladen beliebiger Dateien " an und gebe Dritten die Möglichkeit , die Links zu den Dateien weiterzugeben , führen die Richter aus .
Damit nehme das Unternehmen selbst allerdings keine " keine Veröffentlichungen des Inhaltes vor , so dass ein täterschaftlicher Urheberrechtsverstoß ausscheidet " .
Auch eine Haftung als " Teilnehmerin an Urheberrechtsverletzungen der Nutzer " komme nicht in Betracht , weil kein " bedingter Vorsatz " vorliege .
Die vom OLG Hamburg vertretene Auffassung , das Geschäftsmodell des Hosters verdiene nicht den " Schutz der Rechtsordnung " , teilen die Düsseldorfer Kollegen nicht .
Bei Rapidshare , das " in weiten Teilen legal " sei , handele es sich " um ein von der Rechtsordnung durchaus gebilligtes Geschäftsmodell " .
Da Rapidshare selbst keine Liste der gespeicherten Inhalte anbiete , hänge es alleine vom Nutzer ab , " ob und wie leicht Dritte auf den Servern der Provider gespeicherte Inhalte abrufen können " .
Damit fällt für das OLG Düsseldorf auch die Störerhaftung aus : " Soweit das Geschäftsmodell selbst nicht auf der Nutzung der Rechtswidrigkeit eingestellter Inhalte beruht , ist dem Provider nicht zuzumuten , auf Grund der Prüfpflichten sein gesamtes Geschäftsmodell in Frage zu stellen . "
Denn die tatsächlichen Prüfmöglichkeiten , die sich dem Hoster böten , seien nicht zumutbar , argumentieren die Richter .
Eine gezielte Überprüfung von Inhalten lasse sich wegen des damit verbundenen Personalaufwands in der Praxis nicht realisieren .
Die von der Klägerin verlangte Filterung etwa nach Filmtiteln oder Wortlisten hält das Gericht für nicht praktikabel .
Ein Verbot , bestimmte Dateinamen zu speichern , betreffe oftmals generische Begriffe und schränke " auch die Meinungsfreiheit unangemessen ein " .
Zudem sei " der Titel des Films als solcher kein Gegenstand des Urheberrechts und damit auch als Name einer Datei rechtmäßig speicherbar " .

Watch the cute - as - can - be clip for “ Higher Than the Stars ” below .
The song — from the late - 2009 EP of the same name — carries on the band ’s sensual , bright - eyed shoegaze pop , and benefits from a particularly glowing keyboard swell from Peggy Wang .
In the video , a pretty girl searches for comfort and companionship on the rough streets of Brooklyn , struggling to find her place until she meets a colorful bunch of plush characters come to life — which may or may not be the product of a drug - enhanced trip .
“ Our songs are not some cartoon version of us , ” singer - guitarist Kip Berman told SPIN last year .
“ They ’re our life . ”
So maybe it ’s a true story !
Enjoy the video below — it ’s a small nugget to tide fans over until the band ’s second full - length album arrives in Spring 2011 .

Its a magazine most of you here would not read , bacause it explaines most of the time basic perl stuff .
But many of you , I guess , care that there is a beginnerfriendly Perl publication .
So do I .
Thatswhy i wrote 2 articles for this isssue .
About Perl 5 references and one about Perl 6 .
Also Perl beginner have a right to have a broad overview what is perl 6 about and how it is going .
I think I never summarized it in such simple terms before .
Maybe that spark your interest ? :)
But its written in German , as the name suggest .
This story gets worse by the day .
Whoever was part of the Minerals Management Service who allowed such practices to go on needs to be brought in front of Congress immediately .
Hearing about this only confirms how much control corporate interests have over the system .
Any time I read something like this I ’m also reminded that corruption is as present in our country as it is in the developing world .
How else can you explain such expensive projects being implemented ?
NY Times :
The federal Minerals Management Service gave permission to BP and dozens of other oil companies to drill in the Gulf of Mexico without first getting required permits from another agency that assesses threats to endangered species — and despite strong warnings from that agency about the impact the drilling was likely to have on the gulf .
Those approvals , federal records show , include one for the well drilled by the Deepwater Horizon rig , which exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers and resulting in thousands of barrels of oil spilling into the gulf each day .
The Minerals Management Service , or M.M.S. , also routinely overruled its staff biologists and engineers who raised concerns about the safety and the environmental impact of certain drilling proposals in the gulf and in Alaska , according to a half - dozen current and former agency scientists .

Bernie Ecclestone , President and CEO of the Formula One Group , had this to say :
" For the first time in the history of Formula One in the United States , a world - class facility will be purpose - built to host the event .
It was thirty years ago that the Formula 1 United States Grand Prix™ was last held on a purpose - built permanent road course circuit in Watkins Glen , NY ( 1961 - 1980 ) , which enjoyed great success .
Since then , Formula One has been hosted by Long Beach , Las Vegas , Detroit , Dallas and Phoenix all on temporary street circuits .
Indianapolis joined the ranks of host cities in 2000 when they added a road course inside the famed oval .
Lewis Hamilton won the last Formula 1 United States Grand Prix™ in 2007 , signalling the end to eight years at Indianapolis Motor Speedway .
This however , will be the first time a facility is constructed from the ground up specifically for Formula One in the US . "

US 'will not destroy Kandahar to save it from Taliban '
Afghan President Hamid Karzai ( L ) is in the US on a fence - mending visit US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said an assault against Taliban rebels in southern Afghanistan would not destroy the city of Kandahar .
Speaking with Afghan President Hamid Karzai during his visit to Washington , she said the operation would not be a " huge , massive assault " .
Mrs Clinton had said counter - insurgency lessons had been learned from Iraq .
Ousting the Taliban from their Kandahar stronghold is seen as key to the expanded US - led military effort .
US officials have been saying for months that Kandahar would be the focus of the next big American - led military operation .
' Recover the city '
" They want to have a successful counter - insurgency operation that does n't destroy Kandahar in the effort to save Kandahar , " she said , referring to US commanders in Afghanistan .
" We 're not fighting the Afghan people , " she said during a visit to the US Institute of Peace with President Karzai .
[ It is ] essential that women 's rights and women 's opportunities are not sacrificed or trampled on in the reconciliation process
Hillary Clinton
Analysis : Karzai promises to deliver " We 're fighting a small minority of very dedicated , ruthless extremists who unfortunately are able to enlist young men ... for a variety of reasons and send them out into the battlefield . "
The goal was " to help the people of Kandahar to recover the entire city to be able to put it to the use and the benefit of the people of Kandahar " .
Also speaking on Thursday , Gen Stanley McChrystal , the top US and Nato commander in Afghanistan , said it would be months before the success or failure of the operation could be judged .
He said many Afghans remain to be convinced they should support the Karzai government .
Mr Karzai is visiting the US in an effort to repair the rocky relations between Kabul and Washington .
President Barack Obama has said he backed Mr Karzai 's plans to " open the door " to Taliban militants who renounce violence and cut ties with al - Qaeda .
But militants who lay down their arms " must respect women 's rights , " Mrs Clinton said .
It was " essential that women 's rights and women 's opportunities are not sacrificed or trampled on in the reconciliation process , " she said earlier on Thursday to three senior female Afghan officials travelling with Mr Karzai .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Germany stepped up its fight against speculators with a ban on some financial trades on Wednesday , triggering big market falls and wrong footing European governments that said they were not consulted .
European Central Bank ( ECB ) President Jean - Claude Trichet speaks during the foundation stone laying ceremony for the new ECB premises in Frankfurt May 19 , 2010 .

Berlin ’s unilateral action suggested Europe remained unable to form a united front in addressing its debt crisis .
It worried investors by increasing uncertainty over market regulation in the region .
Chancellor Angela Merkel told German lawmakers European Union leaders had to ensure markets could not “ extort ” the state as she described steps to curb short selling of German bank shares and euro zone government bonds .
Merkel ’s decision appeared to shatter a consensus on cautious regulatory reform which had been building within the EU and across the globe .
Analysts saw the move as a political gesture to placate German public opinion after her party lost a regional election this month .
“ It again suggests that the Germans are no closer to understanding that the markets are not the problem here .
The markets are right to be uncertain about the sustainability of the euro zone in its current form , ” said Simon Tilford , chief economist At the Centre for European Reform .
“ What is specific to Germany is a readiness to make unilateral announcements on things that would only be doable if they were done collectively ...
It ’s pretty populist stuff . ”
Some analysts speculated Germany ’s ban might be an attempt to reduce market volatility before further negative developments in the euro zone debt crisis -- conceivably even a restructuring of Greek debt .
SECRETS AND RUMOURS
After the euro zone and the International Monetary Fund devised a 110 billion euro ( 94 billion pound ) bailout of Greece this month , governments are likely to do their utmost to avoid a restructuring and give time for Greek austerity steps to work .
But this prospect did little to reassure jittery markets on Monday .
“ If there is a secret here , it ca n’t possibly be a positive one , ” Rabobank said in a research note .
The euro hit a fresh four - year low against the dollar , but later rebounded , notching its best one - day gain in a year against the greenback on speculation European monetary officials might do more to support it .
Talk of potential meetings or action by the European Central Bank pushed the euro higher from its lowest level since April 2006 .
PRESSURE ON MERKEL
Germany banned naked short - selling of shares in its 10 top financial institutions , naked short sales of euro zone government bonds , and naked transactions in credit default swaps ( CDS ) , which are used to insure against debt defaults .
In naked short - selling , a trader sells an instrument short , betting its price will fall , without first borrowing the instrument or ensuring it can be borrowed , as would be done in a conventional short sale .
Naked trade in CDS does not hedge an underlying asset .
Germany ’s financial regulator , Bafin , said the ban was “ due to the extraordinary volatility in government bonds in the euro zone . ”
Massive short - selling could have endangered the stability of the financial system , it said .

Merkel has been under huge pressure from within her conservative party to act .
The Greek bailout and a $ 1 trillion safety net for vulnerable euro zone states , to which Berlin is a major contributor , are deeply unpopular with German voters .
The German parliament is due to vote on the safety net on Friday and the opposition Social Democrats have conditioned their support on pledges to impose a tax on financial markets .
“ The room for manoeuvre that Mrs Merkel has is not as big as many people think , ” said Gerd Langguth , a political scientist at Bonn University and a Merkel biographer .
Many analysts doubt Germany ’s unilateral ban will have much impact on restricting trade in financial markets which stretch across national borders .
Jean - Pierre Jouyet , head of French markets regulator AMF , told Reuters Berlin ’s action could actually weaken the euro :
“ It will not be in danger as long as there is an orderly governance and therefore any confusion will help more to weaken the euro than to strengthen it . ”
A clearly irritated Christine Lagarde , the French economy minister , said Paris had no intention of following suit : “ It seems to me that one ought to at least seek the advice of the other member states concerned by this measure .
EU finance ministers will discuss the German ban on Friday , said EU President Herman van Rompuy , who is to chair meetings on toughening EU budget rules and improving economic governance .
In the United States , where the bulk of credit default swap trading is done , stocks slipped on uncertainty about implications of the ban .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner told CNBC television the history of trading restrictions was “ not good . ”
Tightening the euro zone ’s fiscal rules , to prevent countries from running up huge debts , could help restore investor confidence in the euro over the long term .
In her speech to lawmakers , Merkel demanded tough action against “ notorious deficit sinners ” in the euro zone , such as loss of voting rights , to create an incentive for budget rigour .
“ Above all , what ’s necessary is to develop a process for an orderly state insolvency , ” she said , though she did not refer to any country by name .
A German government document showed on Wednesday Berlin would press these proposals at Friday ’s meeting of EU finance ministers .
The controversy over its financial regulatory initiative could make agreement more difficult .
In the United States ’ regulatory reform debate was a setback for the Obama administration .
Senate Democrats failed to muster enough support on Wednesday to end debate on the biggest overhaul of financial regulation since the 1930s , delaying a vote on passage .
Analysts still expect the legislation eventually to pass .
More debate on amendments was likely , with banks on alert for changes that could threaten their profits .
Washington ( CNN ) --
They 're angry at the government and are demonstrating in the Washington area against what they see as the trampling of the Constitution .
Their specific fear : Americans ' right to bear arms under the Second Amendment will be taken away .
" We 're in a war .
The other side knows they are at war , because they started it , " said Larry Pratt , president of the Gun Owners of America .
" They are coming for our freedom , for our money , for our kids , for our property .
They are coming for everything because they are a bunch of socialists . "
Pratt was one of the speakers at the Second Amendment March in Washington on Monday .
The crowd -- made up almost entirely of men -- used language about war and fighting .
But when pressed , they were quick to point out they do n't mean actual armed violence .
Pratt said they 'll be able to get rid of their opponents and " get some fighters , " election fighters .
" That 's why we have some primaries this year , and we need to send them a message that we are coming for the Republican RINOS [ Republicans In Name Only ] , not just the Democrats ... that 's the second event in November , " he said , referring to midterm elections .
Rep. Paul Broun , R - Georgia , said " we must declare war against oppression and against socialism , and you are the people to do that . "
Cathy McNickle of Virginia said it was important to take time off of work to " listen to these people and support the cause . "
For those rallying , it 's not just fear of losing their Second Amendment rights , but also dissatisfaction with the political climate in Washington .
" I 'm not real happy with the direction the government 's going in right now , and I believe that our Second Amendment rights are in trouble , with the political atmosphere that 's in Washington right now , " said Alan Addington of North Carolina .
Across the Potomac River , in Virginia , another group of protesters are defending the Second Amendment with a show of arms -- holding an " Open Carry Rally . "
Signs in the crowd pointed to the role of government , with one reading , " My rights come from God , not from the government . "
Protesters had large rifles and other weapons strapped to their bodies .
Restore the Constitution Rally event organizers said they chose certain areas in Virginia -- like Gravelly Point Park and Fort Hunt Park -- because they are " firearms carry - legal [ locations ] as close to D.C. as possible . "
In Virginia , it is legal to openly carry certain weapons .
But it is illegal to openly carry a weapon in the District of Columbia .
Opponents say that gun rights advocates ' worries are unfounded ; that there are no proposals coming from the White House or Democratic leaders in Congress for new major gun control laws .
Monday 's events come on the anniversary of the battles at Lexington and Concord in the Revolutionary War , when the British moved to seize colonists ' supplies .
It 's a point protesters say is the impetus for their call to action .
" This was one of the first displays of American spirit as the colonists united to defend their way of life , " according to the Second Amendment March Web site .
April 19 also is the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing .
It 's a connection one speaker was adamant to get away from .
" They want to make this about [ convicted Oklahoma City bomber ] Timothy McVeigh , which really pissed me off , " radio personality Erich " Mancow " Muller said at the Washington rally .
" How about mentioning that this is patriot 's day ? "
The anger at the government -- and specifically the Obama administration -- has been rising over the past year , and has been visible in the rise of the Tea Party movement , at health care reform rallies and with other protesters .
One group , Oath Keepers , said its allegiance is to the Constitution and not the president .
The group 's founder , Stewart Rhodes , a former Army paratrooper and staffer for GOP Rep .
Ron Paul , said his members recite a revised version of the oath that 's used for enlistment in the armed services .
However , they exclude the phrase , " I will obey the orders of the president of the United States . "
" Our role is not to be obedient to who happens to be the leader , " he said .
" Our role is to defend the Constitution and the republic . "
The Oath Keepers call on members to disobey any orders , as they put it , " to disarm the American people " or " to force citizens into detention camps . "
It 's a pledge Rhodes recites in an anti-Obama DVD called " Fall of the Republic . "
Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center said the Oath Keepers are exploiting false rumors found on fringe Web sites .
" Many of the Oath Keepers are people who believe that martial law is about to be imposed at any moment .
It is right around the corner , " he said .
But Rhodes said his group is not anti-government and not anti-Obama .
So , who 's talking about taking guns away ?
" So , we have to wait until someone talks about it before we can say we wo n't do it ? " he said .
CNN 's Jim Acosta and Paul Courson contributed to this report .
A former president of security contractor Blackwater and four other company officials have been indicted on federal weapons charges , the Associated Press reports .
Federal prosecutors indicted Gary Jackson , who was president of Blackwater until last year , on Friday in a case that stemmed from a raid on Blackwater ’s North Carolina headquarters in 2008 , which turned up 22 automatic weapons , including 17 Russian - made AK - 47s .
ADVERTISEMENT
Along with Jackson , the other Blackwater officials charged include the company ’s former lawyer , Andrew Howell , former vice president Bill Matthews and two employees tasked with overseeing Blackwater ’s armory and documentation having to so with its status as an arms dealer .
The AP reports :
The charges open a new front of the government ’s oversight of the sullied security company .
Several of the company ’s contractors have previously been charged with federal crimes for their actions in war zones , but the company ’s executives have so far weathered a range of investigations … .
The latest case stems from a raid conducted by federal agents in 2008 that seized 22 weapons , including 17 AK - 47s .
Blackwater signed agreements in 2005 in which the company financed the purchase of 34 automatic weapons for the Camden County sheriff ’s office .
Sheriff Tony
Perry became the official owner of the weapons , but Blackwater was allowed to keep most of the guns at its armory .
Federal law prohibits private parties from buying fully automatic weapons registered after 1986 , but does let law enforcement agencies have them .
In February , the Senate Armed Services Committee found “ reckless ” use of weapons by Blackwater employees in Afghanistan , and found Blackwater staffers had removed weapons from US military facilities without proper authorization .
In one instance , a Blackwater employee signed out military weapons under the name “ Eric Cartman , ” a character in TV’s South Park .
ADVERTISEMENT
Blackwater changed its name to Xe Services last year , as part of an effort to rebrand itself in the wake of the notorious 2007 shooting in Baghdad ’s Nisour Square , in which Blackwater guards opened fire on civilians , killing 17 people .
Late last year , a federal judge threw out charges against Blackwater employees in a case related to the shooting .
The US government has promised to review the matter .

From The Washington Post
KABUL --
A blizzard of bank notes is flying out of Afghanistan -- often in full view of customs officers at the Kabul airport -- as part of a cash exodus that is confounding U.S. officials and raising concerns about the money 's origin .
The cash , estimated to total well over $ 1 billion a year , flows mostly to the Persian Gulf emirate of Dubai , where many wealthy Afghans now park their families and funds , according to U.S. and Afghan officials .
So long as departing cash is declared at the airport here , its transfer is legal .
But at a time when the United States and its allies are spending billions of dollars to prop up the fragile government of President Hamid Karzai , the volume of the outflow has stirred concerns that funds have been diverted from aid .
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , for its part , is trying to figure out whether some of the money comes from Afghanistan 's thriving opium trade .
And officials in neighboring Pakistan think that at least some of the cash leaving Kabul has been smuggled overland from Pakistan .
" All this money magically appears from nowhere , " said a U.S. official who monitors Afghanistan 's growing role as a hub for cash transfers to Dubai , which has six flights a day to and from Kabul .
Meanwhile , the United States is stepping up efforts to stop money flow in the other direction -- into Afghanistan and Pakistan in support of al - Qaeda and the Taliban .
Senior Treasury Department officials visited Kabul this month to discuss the cash flows and other issues relating to this country 's infant , often chaotic financial sector .
Tracking Afghan exchanges has long been made difficult by the widespread use of traditional money - moving outfits , known as " hawalas , " which keep few records .
The Afghan central bank , supported by U.S. Treasury advisers , is trying to get a grip on them by licensing their operations .
In the meantime , the money continues to flow .
Cash declaration forms filed at Kabul International Airport and reviewed by The Washington Post show that Afghan passengers took more than $ 180 million to Dubai during a two - month period starting in July .
If that rate held for the entire year , the amount of cash that left Afghanistan in 2009 would have far exceeded the country 's annual tax and other domestic revenue of about $ 875 million .
The declaration forms highlight the prominent and often opaque role played by hawalas .
Asked to identify the " source of funds " in forms issued by the Afghan central bank , cash couriers frequently put down the name of the same Kabul hawala , an outfit called New Ansari Exchange .
Early last month , Afghan police and intelligence officers raided New Ansari 's office in Kabul 's bazaar district , carting away documents and computers , said Afghan bankers familiar with the operation .
U.S. officials declined to comment on what prompted the raid .
New Ansari Exchange , which is affiliated with a licensed Afghan bank , closed for a day or so but was soon up and running again .
The total volume of departing cash is almost certainly much higher than the declared amount .
A Chinese man , for instance , was arrested recently at the Kabul airport carrying 800,000 undeclared euros ( about $ 1.1 million ) .
Cash also can be moved easily through a VIP section at the airport , from which Afghan officials generally leave without being searched .
American officials said that they have repeatedly raised the issue of special treatment for VIPs at the Kabul airport with the Afghan government but that they have made no headway .
One U.S. official said he had been told by a senior Dubai police officer that an Afghan diplomat flew into the emirate 's airport last year with more than $ 2 million worth of euros in undeclared cash .
The Afghan consul general in Dubai , Haji Rashoudin Mohammadi , said in a telephone interview that he was not aware of any such incident .
The high volume of cash passing through Kabul 's airport first came to light last summer when British company Global Strategies Group , which has an airport security contract , started filing reports on the money transfers at the request of Afghanistan 's National Directorate of Security , the domestic intelligence agency .
The country 's notoriously corrupt police force , however , complained about this arrangement , and Global stopped its reporting in September , according to someone familiar with the matter .
Afghan bankers interviewed in Kabul said that much of the money that does get declared belongs to traders who want to buy goods in Dubai but want to avoid the fees , delays and paperwork that result from conventional wire transfers .
The cash flown out of Kabul includes a wide range of foreign currencies .
Most is in U.S. dollars , euros and -- to the bafflement of officials -- Saudi Arabian riyals , a currency not widely used in Afghanistan .
Last month , a well - dressed Afghan man en route to Dubai was found carrying three briefcases stuffed with $ 3 million in U.S. currency and $ 2 million in Saudi currency , according to an American official who was present when the notes were counted .
A few days later , the same man was back at the Kabul airport , en route to Dubai again , with about $ 5 million in U.S. and Saudi bank notes .
One theory is that some of the Arab nation 's cash might come from Saudi donations that were supposed to go to mosques and other projects in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
But , the American official said , " we do n't really know what is going on . "
Efforts to figure out just how much money is leaving Afghanistan and why have been hampered by a lack of cooperation from Dubai , complained Afghan and U.S. officials , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
Dubai 's financial problems , said a U.S. official , had left the emirate eager for foreign cash , and " they do n't seem to care where it comes from . "
Dubai authorities declined to comment .
BCG is considered by many as the holy grail among games torrent trackers .
This veteran private torrent site ( which by the way is over 7 years old ) has a lot of PC , console and mobile video games along with a large , dedicated user base who keep these torrents alive .
However , BCG is not the easiest tracker to get into , especially if you are a newcomer to the BitTorrent scene .
Open signups almost never happen on this tracker and you can only become a member either through a referral from an existing member ( referrals are BCG ’s alternative to the invites system commonly found on private trackers ) or via an official recruitment thread on select BitTorrent forums .
If you still are n’t a member of this tracker , good news is that thanks to stoi ( BCG SysOP ) we now have at our disposal 500 referral codes to be given away to FILEnetworks Blog readers .
UPDATE : We have received well over 500 requests .
As we commented earlier , please do not send any more emails – this giveaway has now concluded .
Referrals will be sent to selected emails in the coming days .
BCG crew seem to be in a mode of expansion right now and they ’ve just given 10 referrals each to most of their existing members .
According to stoi there are now 187,225 free referrals ‘ out there ’ in the system .
If you are an existing BCG user , now would be a good time to check your account – you may have received them as well .
Although BCG is n’t really short of members , new blood is always welcome in a private tracker .
Their user base currently hovers somewhere around the 27000 - 30000 mark and the plan is to recruit several thousand new members within the next month .
When it comes to content , BCG has games for almost every platform there is on the planet .
From the popular DOS / Windows PC section to PS3 , XBOX360 , Wii console games sections , BCG tracks over 12000 active torrents which include latest titles ( scene and non scene releases ) , retro games and exclusive BCG member creations .
Recently they have expanded to cover mobile platforms and now games for Android , iPhone etc are also available on this tracker .
In addition to individual releases , lots of games packs & collections have been uploaded – some of these can be seen in the screenshot below :
One thing you should know about BCG is that it ’s functionality in some areas is drastically different from the average private tracker .
For example on BCG there are no invites – these have been replaced by referrals .
Same goes for the Seed Points mod – it ’s an advanced system that essentially replaces the seed bonus system on most private trackers .
We strongly recommend everyone to check the site ’s Rules and FAQ pages first thing you login – without reading these your stay on BCG will be short lived .
You can also find many helpful tutorials on this forum section of the site .
Anyways it ’s time to get back to the invite giveaway :)

Get David Beckham !
West Ham bid to bring England legend back home from Los Angeles Galaxy
West Ham ’s audacious transfer policy has seen them make an offer to Joe Cole and reveal an ambition to sign David Beckham .
Co-owner David Sullivan , looking to rebuild the team after a traumatic season that resulted in the sacking of Gianfranco Zola , says he has asked Cole to ‘ name his price ’ to rejoin the club where he started his career .
The Chelsea forward turned down the offer .
Come Beck : West Ham want the England legend to return to the Premier League
Undeterred , Sullivan says of Beckham in an Sportsmail exclusive interview : ‘ I ’d love David Beckham .
He has massive cult status in east London and still has a house near Bishop ’s Stortford , not far from our training ground .
He ’s from Chingford , which is our heartland .
We are the club of east London and Essex .
' If AC Milan did n’t want him in January and if he still wanted to do it , I ’d love to have him .
He seems a remarkable professional .
Hammer blow : Former West ham idol Joe Cole has rejected a ' name your price ' offer to return to the club
‘ When I was a kid , Stanley Matthews went back to Stoke at the age of 46 .
He lifted the gates like you would n’t believe and got them promoted when everyone thought they were finished . ’
Cole , out of contract at Chelsea , has so far rejected West Ham ’s overtures .
‘ We ’ve asked Joe to name a price but he said no , ’ said Sullivan .
Humans exist in perfect freedom .
Obedience is a choice .
Government is therefore an illusion .
The evidence is n't hard to gather , and it requires no special twist of language , no cognitive somersault .
Just pick up the telephone and summon a policeman to attend a crime in progress ( robbery , rape , murder , kidnapping ) .
Good luck getting help in time .
Nor is it clever to claim that the state 's protection exists in a more diffuse , but efficacious realm beyond the average response time of emergency services .
In any public street , the law is observed by its citizenry without police .
Los Angeles has 7,000 cops and 7 million citizens .
The LAPD are garbage collectors in fancy uniforms , picking up the dead and praying that the rest of us will argue quietly .
Our dwellings are rendered safe from fire by homeowners and tenants , employing nothing more coercive than an individual desire to survive .
All instrumentalities of community protection and public welfare existed first as private , voluntary organizations ( constabularies , fire brigades , libraries , schools , hospitals ) before dilettantes and ward - healers proposed that a bureaucracy should monopolize and run them badly .
The historical origins of governments were neither rational nor provident .
In every instance , ancient and modern , sovereigns were created by plunder and a fairy tale of divine right ( British Empire ) , a crackpot theory of destiny ( USSR ) , or a bad bargain improvised under duress ( U.S.A . )
Any student of the U.S. Constitution can see through the myth of glory : the Virginia Plan was a recipe for Civil War .
Noam Chomsky wants government to thwart evil predators .
Robert Nozick fears competition .
Hobbes , von Mises , and Ayn Rand hail the state as a champion of the weak , a bulwark of liberty .
Burke sighs that the established order of ermine and tithes is comfortable ; all innovation a threat .
Phooey !
Their theoretical defense of an illusion makes no donut disappear from a cop 's mouth , no soldier more likely to question his orders , no real evil less vicious .
Government is the sole , permanent source of repression and waste .
It does not exist of necessity , but rather by virtue of a tragic , almost comical combination of klutzy , opportunistic terrorism against sitting ducks whom it pretends to shelter , plus our childish phobia of responsibility , praying to be exempted from the hard reality of life on life 's terms .
It is daft to moan about crime .
Government cannot stop a thief , a lunatic , or a kid playing with matches .
It took the Nazis twenty years to flatter and frighten the German nation into collective obedience -- and still someone shoved a bomb under the Fuhrer 's conference table .
The state does not and cannot triumph by coercion .
Ayn Rand was correct : Evil requires the sanction of the victim .
During the war , German factory owners wheedled endlessly to avoid losing skilled Jewish workers .
Twenty percent of all Nazi munitions were duds , sabotaged on the assembly line .
The greatest tragedy of the Holocaust was the role of Jewish Councils , who collaborated with and made possible the systematic transportation of innocents .
In 1935 , SS troops only numbered in the hundreds , not tens of thousands .
Jews were ordered to emigrate from Nazi Germany .
It is an uncomfortable fact , but the state at its worst and most triumphal was incapable of genocide without the passive compliance of its intended victims .
In Soviet Russia , the only tyrant was not Stalin ; it was millions of citizens who chanted slogans and perished as a consequence of their own folly .
Thirty million British trade unionists , doctors , butchers , bakers and candlestick makers democratically cut their own economic throats in the 1970s with the same Marxist slogans .
Harold Wilson did not force them into penury , and Margaret Thatcher did not force the British to wake up and smell the bank statements .
We the people do these things to and for ourselves .
In fact and in reality , we are ungoverned and ungovernable .
I defy anyone to name a single instance of governmental action that succeeded in achieving its intended outcome .
Above all , please do n't tell me that you filed an honest tax return , or that you know someone who did .
No public work was raised without delay , confusion , cost overrun , graft , or outright disaster as a final consequence .
Every morning , the state mangles reason and justice to perform simple tasks that private actors ( a ) would not undertake because the project is stupid ; or ( b ) could do faster , cheaper , and better than government ; or ( c ) are implicitly required to do anyway , since the state has no competence except that which is supplied by private contractors .
All the U.S. politicians and bureaucrats combined could not repair a flush toilet .
I become bored with discussing the state 's incompetence , so obvious a fact .
The worst toxic waste sites are government property .
The Soviet Union wrought environmental catastrophe , because wanton misery and economic folly are proportionate to the size of government .
They never learn , never fail to make stupid decisions .
Boris Yeltsin spent $ 3.5 billion of IMF cash trying ( and failing ) to defend the rouble , precisely reproducing Black Wednesday , when Britain emptied her purse trying ( and failing ) to defend the pound 's membership in the Exchange Rate Mechanism .
Bad protection drives out good , Alan Greenspan used to say , condemning the ludicrous spectacle of government conducted by morons .
If the peace and prosperity of the entire world rests on Bill Clinton 's shoulders , how does the Commander - In - Chief have time to masturbate in the Oval Office during office hours ?
Answer : Peace and prosperity do n't .
Clinton 's leadership is an illusion .
Politicians have nothing of consequence to do , say , or decide .
They are physiocratic windup toys , floating in a bubble bath of lukewarm hysteria , reciting platitudes written by schoolboys .
We prosper to the extent that government does nothing .
Clinton feels our pain , did n't inhale , whimpers for forgiveness .
If there is any justification for this carnival of hot air , it must be discerned from an abstract principle , because none of the empirical data suggest any tangible benefit produced by these sterile public employments .
What Good is the State ?
Supposedly , there exist important services , such as national defense , which benefit people whether they pay for them or not .
The result is that selfish agents refuse to contribute , leading to disaster .
The only way to solve this problem is to coerce the beneficiaries to raise the funds to supply the needed good .
In order for this coercion to work , it needs to be monopolized by a single agency , the state .
Public goods arguments have been made not only for national defense , but for police , roads , education , R&D , scientific research , and many other goods and services .
The essential definitional feature of public goods is ' non-excludability ' ; because the benefits cannot be limited to contributors , there is no incentive to contribute .
Prof. Bryan Caplan's Anarchy FAQ
How this justifies Kosovo , the Vietnam War , or the defense of Kuwait is impossible to guess .
So , let 's suppose that it 's 1939 and our national security problem is Adolph Hitler .
Selfish plutocrats are weary of throwing good U.S. savings after bad , rescuing England .
Jewish Americans raise funds to help their kinfolk in Poland , and German - Americans parade through Wisconsin waving swastikas .
These are historical facts .
It is undeniably true that , at any moment in history , the community will be divided into rival interest groups , each demanding that all the others contribute to some public good .
See The Federalist Papers , No. X .
I am not an infantile individualist , demanding the right to be let alone by my neighbors or by whichever dominant faction has control of the elephantine mousetrap of state .
Nor is David Friedman 's example of housetrailers in France a solution .
We do not live in housetrailers .
Our lives and fortunes are deeply rooted in geographical community .
Try building a factory or a nuclear power station on a housetrailer !
Even in some micro-agrarian society , where the population is geographically dispersed and scatters farther into the hills at the first whiff of trouble , like the peasants of Corsovo , the penalty for isolation is deprivation , and ultimately you run out of room to run .
Kropotkin 's sensible dictates of [ Polish ] tribal conscience are a joke , when the problem is a ruthless neighbor like Adolph Hitler , mobilizing twenty Panzer divisions with absolute air supremacy .
The solution is here at ground zero , the foundation of society .
If the American government had been disbanded in 1910 ( to pick a date when it might have been historically feasible ) , the problem of Adolph Hitler would never have arisen .
The mass suicide of World War I would have ended without Wilson 's mismanagement , and there would have been no Great Depression to bankrupt postwar Europe .
The American society of 1933 , sans Franklin Roosevelt , would have been free of Keynesian doctrine , trading in hard currency and guided by a consortium of wealthy private bankers and industrialists -- a vastly different regime than Kropotkin 's tribal conscience .
American military adventures in Europe and Asia have always been pointless and unprofitable , from a strictly commercial perspective .
War is an irrational waste of resources that no business would dare undertake .
Consequently , the capitalist policy of national defense is to : ( a ) maximize industrial output ; ( b ) maintain a strategic intelligence network ; and ( c ) when necessary , call upon the whole community for men and munitions to meet any clear and present danger , providing capital and moral support to those who volunteer to fight .
If this seems preposterously simple , then you have not read the history of the American Revolution .
Most people are not mercenaries ; they will not fight for money alone , unless they perceive that their communities and their loved ones are in real peril , a natural counterweight to reckless abuse of policy .
The only difference between a coercive state and a consortium of leading citizens is competence .
In the economic crisis that brought Hitler to power , leading citizens refused to participate .
They stupidly entrusted the mechanism of state to Hindenburg , Hoover , and Chamberlain , who preferred National Socialism to Marxism .
It is no surprise that German democracy ended badly in 1933 .
Politicians routinely proffer disaster , since their social contribution consists of flattery , fantasy , hatred and fear .
If roads are needed , communities have local bankers , landlords , and employers to determine and pay for local development .
Ditto schools and hospitals .
Every example of American philanthropy was an Andrew Carnegie or Sam Walton rags - to - riches story .
My proposal is very simple .
Do not let these men ( or anyone else ) compel obedience via legislation .
Make the law of society de jure anarchy and promulgate the idea that some will govern more than others , not by virtue of piecrust campaign promises and balloon drops at a party meeting , but as a consequence of diligence , effort , savings , and sobriety .
Inequality , Legal Fictions & Legal Rights
It is silly to cry fascism ! as an objection to my proposal .
The operative feature of fascism was direction of industry by government .
I would hope that critics have enough sense to say that an elite banking consortium constitutes an oligarchy -- i.e. , rule by a few -- and is hence undemocratic .
Quite so .
Yet democracy is a disaster .
Nothing you can say will convince me that your vote is equal to mine , or that the two of us together have a legal right to silence one of our economic or intellectual betters , or that someone 's childish whims deserve to be given a free microphone in aid of the public good .
I am not in favor of free speech by morons and children .
Nor do I believe that free speech exists in contemporary society .
Speech is the weapon of broadcasters .
These are trifling side - issues , but it wo n't hurt to sweep them aside .
I am a media exile .
My works do n't have a hope in hell of publication .
As far as I 'm concerned , CBS is a predatory force and their New York headquarters should be short - listed for a surgical strike .
The society in which we live is neither democratic nor fair .
Take away their Federal license to print money , and CBS falls tomorrow .
We can not be rid of them too soon .
Their agenda of glib vacuity , opinion polls , blandishments , and flashy manure is anesthetizing our society .
Sport is next on my hit list .
If I were a religious man , I 'd fall on my knees and beg God to turn the NFL into thirty pillars of salt , ending one of the vainest vulgarities in human history .
I hope I have demonstrated a core proposition : that your vote and mine are incompatible and cancel one another .
If you comfort yourself with the knowledge that a majority agree with your preference , I hereby denounce your brainless majority as de facto fascism and blame you for wrecking the American economy .
Forty - four percent of GDP is government outlays .
When the market crashes , do n't look for oligarchic villains on Wall Street , or State Street , or in Grand Cayman .
The next Depression will be of your own majoritarian making , because you pretended that political wishes were horses and beggars could ride , if enough of them wanted to .
Ayn Rand had the right idea .
The guiltiest of men are the natural oligarchs , who abdicated their leadership of an anarcho - capitalist revolution .
Instead of giving Harry Truman the atomic bomb , it could have and should have been developed in a laboratory at Galt 's Gulch .
This is the moral meaning of inequality .
When the men of brains collaborate with a mob of dullards , it 's unfair to blame the resultant calamity on a crowd of pickpockets and cheerleaders .
Sadly , a moral principle never reaches beyond itself .
Its ethical arms are too short , extending no farther than one man 's soul , one man 's purpose and lifespan .
We have to look elsewhere for political guidance , because the thing at issue is a nation of laws and not of men .
I deal in very simple ideas .
The rotten timber is a fiction , so let 's blast the fictions .
In reality , there are living human beings whose freedom and interest are the subject of this debate .
There is no divine right of incorporation , whether as a government , or a Subchapter S tax dodge , or a family trust that never dies like a natural person .
I hereby propose that the law abolish all corporations .
Let each parcel of land , each railroad and airline , every road and factory be the property of some individual ( or partnership of individuals ) .
Legal cases shall be A vs B , two natural persons .
I do n't care if embryos , animals , and plants qualify for legal standing .
Fine .
Whatever .
But no more fictitious , disembodied , immortal corporate persons like the United States of America , or CBS Inc .
Let 's get the bullshit out of the way and call some real defendants in court , to explain their guilt or innocence .
I am not impressed by the need to combine capital for big projects .
The laws of banking and agency are sufficiently imaginative for any requisite venture .
When J.P. Morgan owned J.P. Morgan , there was no legal limit to his activities or scope of responsibility as proprietor .
He bailed out the Federal Government twice ( the damn fool ) .
When a natural person dies , his fortune can be willed to anyone he chooses , but not to a charitable ghost .
All religious groups and trade unions are hereby dissolved .
Associate as you please , go where you like , and sing your heart out in the choir -- but legal ownership of property pertains to real persons from now on .
God owns nothing , unless he shows up in court and speaks for Himself .
The Initiation of Force
There is certainly one truth in anarchistic beliefs :
Every large organization contains an element of veiled or open force , and every kind of force is an evil , if we consider its effects on the human character .
But is it not the lesser evil ?
Can we dispense with force ?
When this question is clearly put , the case for anarchism seems extremely weak .
It is true , that the experiment of an entirely forceless society have never been made .
But such evidence as we have does not indicate that ill intentions will cease to exist if repressive force disappears , and it is clear enough that one ill - intentioned person can upset a large part of society if there is no repressive force .
The fact that some intelligent and highly idealistic men and women have believed and still believe in anarchism shows that there is a type of sectarianism which accepts a belief in spite of , or perhaps because of , its apparent absurdity .
( Landauer , quoted in Prof. Bryan Caplan's Anarchy FAQ )
Every kind of force is an evil ?
Does that include Toyotas and Beamers , screeching past me as I attempt to cross an intersection ?
The way Landauer talks , you 'd think that anarchists have to foreswear use of pesticides and cash registers .
Lord - amighty ! --
I might economically force someone to act differently by bribing her , or threatening to withhold a job promotion .
( Sound familiar ? )
Does Landauer expect all anarchists to be Buddhist monks , or what ?
Let 's put this on a sensible basis .
Force is good .
I like force .
I wish I had more of it at my disposal , and that I was able to wave a battalion or two at my enemies .
However , being a hothead by nature , some years ago I made a moral decision not to carry a handgun -- mainly because I was tempted to shoot two or three people a day .
If I began to indulge the habit of shooting people , it was unclear to me how I might ever wean myself from the practice .
So , I decided to Just Say No to homicide .
Do n't laugh .
This is serious business .
When I got held up at gunpoint in Beverly Hills , had I been armed , there would 've been at least two dead and several injured .
I passionately hate being threatened at gunpoint .
The rule in current law , as I understand it , is that initiation of force is not an issue .
( Attention , all Objectivists .
Initiation of force is irrelevant . )
The crime of assault is the threat of violence .
Victims can take whatever actions seem reasonable under the circumstances .
It is a complete justification for killing someone , if you can prove in the context of the situation that you had reason to believe that your life or the life of another was in jeopardy .
If you kill somebody by mistake ( wrongly believing that he meant to kill you ) it still is n't murder -- just manslaughter .
You could be paroled in two years , assuming that you had n't killed anybody before and you were genuinely sorry for killing an innocent person by mistake .
That 's the law .
Where does that leave us ?
Clearly , the government intends to hunt us down if we refuse to pay taxes .
If we resist , like Randy Weaver or the Branch Davidians , the FBI will use lethal force .
That 's their whole game plan , eerily reminiscent of Hitler .
Obey or die .
Having resisted the Federal Government by nonviolent means ( in court ) , I suggest that their intermediate weapon of coercion ( imprisonment ) is just as deadly .
My life was in jeopardy on numerous occasions while in custody , and I witnessed several deaths .
The practical enterprise of coercive government is to take life , liberty , and property for the enrichment and satisfaction of government officials .
Motives are another story .
Tyrants always think well of themselves and explain their activities as some kind of public service .
Hitler certainly did .
But the law is quite firm on this point .
You do not have to understand an assailant 's motive .
All you have to do is reasonably interpret his behavior as a clear threat to your life or the life of another , and you are legally justified in launching a preemptive strike .
Of course , the law grants special immunity to government employees .
You are never justified in disobeying or impeding the actions of a sovereign -- not even when he aims a gun at you , or drops napalm on your village , or regulates your employer out of existence , or orders your child to die as a conscript , thus sparing Bill Clinton the inconvenience of interrupting his political career .
I admit that I am sometimes overwhelmed with bitterness , because Jefferson 's Declaration of Independence is never far from my heart .
No sovereign has the right to take life , liberty , or property .
The historical cost is numbered in hundreds of millions killed , two billion enslaved by Communism , five billion denied an example of liberty -- largely because America chickened out in 1787 .
The Framers lost the courage to say that all men were created equal .
Randolph of Virginia was not a fool , Benjamin Franklin no devil .
I 'm sure that Madison hoped for the best , and Hamilton thought that the survival of the Republic mattered more than technical issues of justice .
Washington admitted that he was a simple man , unable to understand what ought to be done or why .
Few imagined that the Constitution would survive more than a few decades , and Jefferson expected a revolution every 20 years or so .
No one believed we would fight a Civil War .
No one wanted it .
They did everything possible to avoid it -- and yet , it was implicit from the first signature in Philadelphia .
I have made the point elsewhere , but it bears repeating , that the Civil War was fought as a result of protectionist trade tariffs .
It was the government 's sole source of revenue at its inception .
When the South was denied a voice in the Senate , saw her economic prospects sinking , and knew that Randolph's Compromise was being eclipsed by westward expansion , the Constitution was finished .
Until the moment of secession , the Federal Government never exerted substantial coercion against anyone , neither private citizen nor state nor foreign power .
( I am not discussing Native Americans : the topic is not germane to my present thesis . )
Hamilton 's doctrine of implied powers sat on the shelf , disused .
For the umpteenth time , President Andrew Jackson vetoed the construction of the Cumberland Road , saying that the Federal Government had no lawful power to promote the general welfare .
Banking and commerce were still in the hands of private individuals .
There were few corporations .
America was not a world power .
If Murray Rothbard felt free to argue natural law , he inherited a tradition that skipped twice into the American Experiment and died at the Ford Theater .
Jefferson 's inspiration became Lincoln 's epitaph : that all men are created equal .
I spent a long time studying Lincoln 's claim ( If A may enslave B , why not B steal the same argument and enslave A? ) because his was a beautiful eulogy of American common law , on the occasion of its eclipse by hardship and chicanery , paper greenbacks and Federal land grants -- the desperate acts of an embattled , failing leadership .
When the Supreme Court reconvened , after a million Americans had been sacrificed in battle against one another , the American Experiment was legally ended .
In the Legal Tender Cases , common law was buried by the will of the sovereign .
Graft and power politics took over .
Henceforth , the only thing that mattered were votes .
So , I find it somewhat remote and nostalgic , to discuss initiation of force and common law assault .
The notion of justice survives because we live in constructive , actual liberty .
We are self - governing in daily life , and we use justice to regulate our private intercourse .
But it is no longer operative in law .
The will of the state is our master , and We The People are servants , unequal as a matter of legal principle .
If you are a government official , you are exempt from personal liability -- in fact , you are n't even present in court ; you are a manifestation of the immortal , disembodied , corporate Sovereign ( local , state or federal , it does n't matter ) .
So long as government employees execute the will of the sovereign , they are immune from prosecution , like the guards at Auschwitz who were only following orders .
Oliver North was able to take this another step farther , claiming that he served his country by intuition , without asking for embarrassing orders .
His conscience was clear .
It was his duty to shred documents .
As a citizen , you are guilty with nothing to say in your defense , if you refuse to obey or to provide such information as the state may demand .
The state has first claim on your property , perpetual title to your liberty .
In tax matters , you are presumed guilty until proven innocent .
If you refuse to speak , you can be jailed without trial .
In antitrust , trade and consumer protection law , you are guilty without knowing what might constitute a crime .
In immigration law , you are guilty by reason of your place of birth .
At the moment , none of this matters to the American people .
Unemployment is low , inflation a distant memory .
The stock market quadrupled in value in ten years .
Life is good .
Television is amusing and familiar , like an old family friend .
What could possibly go wrong ?
The Right of Revolution
The basic argument of the advocates of ' propaganda by the deed ' was that anarchist terrorism would provoke governments -- even avowedly liberal and democratic governments -- to resort to increasingly harsh measures to restore order .
As governments ' ruthlessness increased , their ' true colors ' would appear for all to see , leading to more immediate results than mere education and theorizing .
As E.V. Zenker notes in his Anarchism : A Criticism and History of the Anarchist Theory , a number of Western governments were driven to adopt anti-terrorist laws as a result of anarchist terrorism .
( Zenker goes on to note that Great Britain remained true to its liberal heritage by refusing to punish individuals merely for espousing anarchist ideas . )
But as one might expect , contrary to the terrorists ' hopes , it was the reputation of anarchism -- peaceful and violent alike -- which suffered rather than the reputation of the state .
Prof. Bryan Caplan's Anarchy FAQ
It is difficult to understand how the reputation of the state was enhanced by the Unabomber , inasmuch as he remained 100 percent invisible to the FBI for a decade until his mother turned him in .
Nor is the arrest and prosecution of Timothy McVeigh quite the same thing as preventing Timothy McVeigh from blowing up a Federal office building .
Had the attack taken place at night , with no one killed except DEA and ATF agents , our national reaction would have been different .
I lived through an interesting period in American history .
I was in Madison when the Army Math Research Center was blown up .
I was in Milwaukee when an anarchist was shot dead as he attempted to firebomb a supermarket .
I was in Washington when half a million students fought a U.S. Marine Corps division , hoping to stop the Vietnam War .
The revolutionary cell had guns , explosives , and a medical team .
We were at war .
People died .
With other survivors of that struggle , I concluded that the enemy was not Richard Nixon or Dow Chemical .
It was the American majority -- an overfed , self - satisfied , obedient bourgeoisie .
To the majority it is a matter of indifference whether their salaries are paid by Lockheed or IBM or the Dept of Paperwork .
Their moral sense is superglued to their stomachs .
We cannot expect acts of revolutionary sacrifice to play in Peoria , where folks applaud Bill and Hillary .
Ayn Rand said it best :
It 's earlier than we think .
Revolutions are , of necessity , occasioned by hardship and oppression .
We simply have to wait for a 21st - century Stamp Tax .
Those of us in the vanguard have plenty to do in the meantime .
Idle libertarians can concentrate on agitprop activities , such as :
Publicize the declining private sector share of GDP and growth of government .
Practice the virtue of speaking the truth .
Identify religion for the sewer it is .
Defend the rights of children .
Boycott compulsory public education .
But we can not win without direct action .
Real revolutionaries must implement John Galt 's strategy , persuading American industrialists to shut their factories , American bankers to quit .
It does n't matter whether this happens by accident or design , but it is vital to strip as much competence as possible from the economy , to hasten and deepen the inevitable crash .
Minor Matters
In answer to Murray Rothbard , there is no such thing as natural law or human rights .
All that exists are natural persons and human interaction .
In answer to David Friedman , invisible hand utilitarianism is impossible to test or measure , because historical data are incomplete , and because the greatest good is conjecture .
I do n't care what happened in medieval Iceland .
In answer to Karl Marx , property rights are created and maintained by general consent .
If the anarcho - capitalist oligarchy imposes a tyranny , the downtrodden will revolt .
The masses will not accept a paradigm shift until their majoritarian welfare state hits an economic brick wall , creating an opportunity to rally them behind a new set of Founding Fathers .
I think we need to rewrite the common law definition of property to defeat Marxist liberals like Ralph Nader .
Should there be restitution for crime ?
No . I favor an Old West Nevada approach to crime .
In previous writing , I suggested deportation of unwanted criminals to Upper Michigan .
Public prosecution is not part of my scenario .
All court cases are A vs B .
Nor do I see the courts as a beehive of activity .
Anarchy means conducting your affairs in propria persona , choosing good partners , consulting mentors as needed , and taking risks .
Pareto - optimal calculations are lost on me .
It all sounds like Garrett Hardin's The Tragedy of the Commons and an excuse for environmentalists to join the debate as intellectual equals , which they are not .
Conclusion
I have suggested above that mankind exist in perfect freedom , and that government is a choreographed ritual , nothing more than a public parade , or a secularized religion of quack faith - healers .
We can increase or decrease the size of government at will .
In a totalitarian state , the parades are bigger , there are more people in uniform , and they have less to eat .
There is only one way to end tyranny : from within .
Hitler was not defeated by Churchill or Eisenhower .
He was defeated by stupidity and disobedience .
Tyrants exude the former and inspire the latter .
My theory does not rely on a moral code .
I view morality as a personal choice .
Perhaps that makes me an emotive anarchist .
Because government does nothing and alters nothing , I am far more concerned with personal choice and private action .
Hitler could not have come to power without the support of his intellectual superiors , who wrongly assumed that they could control him like a puppet .
This is also the tragic legacy of American political history since the Civil War .
So long as scientists and businessmen support the majoritarian fable , average Americans have no choice but to admire the Emperor 's New Clothes with embarrassment and concealed terror .
They know that something is wrong with our country , despite reports of a strong economy and everyone 's best efforts to parade in cheerful rhythm .
But the figures tell a different story , and I name Alan Greenspan as the guiltiest man in America for withholding the bottom line .
Public debt as a percent of M2 has risen to wartime levels .
Public spending will exceed 50 percent of GDP in FY2015 .
When it does , the IMF can not rescue us .
We are the IMF , boys and girls .
How each person chooses to cope with this unfolding disaster is unimportant .
I cannot say that survivalists have it wrong , nor the whores led by Rupert Murdoch , nor the vultures led by George Soros .
But I speak the truth as I understand it , and I accept the risk of public humiliation , rather than wait in silence for another , smarter person to someday speak for me and proclaim :
All government is theft .
From The Laissez Faire City Times , Vol 3 , No 16 , April 19 , 1999
Wolf DeVoon archive
A few days ago , I had the urge to break the routine of my recent unemployment laziness and build something .
After a little bit of thought , With nothing specific in mind , I decided that I wanted to build some type of musical instrument , with the goal of building it entirely from trash I find laying around the neighborhoods of Atlanta .
I have no income right now , so I set my budget at $ 0 for this project , no exceptions .
I hopped on my bike , and began scavenging .
I found some old clay pots , a broken sink , and several other things that seemed promising , but I just could n’t visualize a finished project with them .
Eventually I came across a discarded piece of wood , perhaps from a porch , or mailbox .
One end of it was already cut into a wavy shape , and I immediately thought , “ lap steel ! ” .
I grabbed the long piece of wood , and shoved it in my bag , then sat down at a bench and sketched out the idea .
With a giant block of wood slapping me in the head , I rode home and began searching for something to construct the nut , bridge , and tuners out of .
I experimented with a couple pieces of ceramic from the broken sink and some broken beer bottle necks , but neither worked too well .
Eventually , I settled on a long piece of aluminum that came from a broken screen window ( thanks to some guy trying to evade the police pursuing him through our backyard ) .
I cut the aluminum into two even pieces and screwed them to the board .
Next , I drilled holes for the strings to pass through the body ( secured in the back ) .
The next step proved to be the most difficult : the tuners .
I originally planned on carving out tuning pegs , similar to those on a violin / cello .
I found a nice , dried - out hardwood stick and set to widdlin ’ the evening away .
I carved out 6 nicely shaped pegs , drilled a 1 /16 ″ hole in each ( to pass the string through ) , and drilled 6 holes in the instrument .
At first , the pegs fit firmly , and I had high hopes .
However , through multiple attempts and adjustments , I found that the tension of the strings was simply too great .
I tried some bow rosin in the holes ; I tried putting the pegs on the underside of the instrument in hopes that the tension would pull the pegs deeper , tightening them .
None of this even pretended to work .
Stumped , I called it a night .
The next day , I awoke with visions of a billion complex tuning contraptions .
I tried a couple of them , but all failed .
As I brainstormed possible solutions , I could just see my dad repeating his usual philosophy for these situations : Keep it Simple , Stupid ( KISS ) .
I walked over to an old IKEA desk that my roommate threw away the day before , removed 6 of the little Swedish screw things , drilled a 1/16 ″ hole through each of them , and screwed them into the board .
Worked perfectly .
Now , all that was left was the pickup , and strings .
I originally planned on constructing a pickup from scratch , but that would ’ve broken my $ 0 budget , so I ( with the help of Anthony C. ) just cut out a notch to recess an acoustic guitar pickup I had laying around .
While stringing the instrument , the height of the tuning pegs was causing some issues , so a stick was added above the nut to lower the strings ( props to Anthony for this too ) .
With stick in place , strings were added , stretched , and tuned up to Open G .
With the exceptions of a few aesthetic details , my new lap steel is complete !
I need to add fret markers , and would like to stain ( or at least clean ) the wood , but it is definitely a joy to play as - is .
The thickness of the old wood adds a nice , deep resonance , and the sustain is pretty impressive considering the hollow - aluminum nut and bridge .
I achieved my goal of not spending a dime , and had a good time in the process .
Now I just need to learn to play it !
Here are photos / video of the ( mostly ) final product so you can hear how she sounds .
Let me know what you think !

Justicia que “ se vende al mejor postor ”
Martes 18 de mayo de 2010
En la jerga del derecho , es un clásico que “ la justicia es ciega , sorda y tonta ” ; y que “ se vende al mejor postor ” .
Definición que embona “ como anillo al dedo ” en al caso de Celia Lora , quien alcoholizada ocasionó un choque que derivó en la muerte de un trabajador .
Luego del escándalo inicial , poco se ha sabido del “ borrachazo ” de la niña Lora , ya que el reflector se movió en dirección a los “ sabotajes ” a instalaciones eléctricas , al crimen de José Guajardo , candidato del PAN a la alcaldía de Valle Hermoso en Tamaulipas , y hacia la desaparición de Diego Fernández de Cevallos .
La memoria colectiva parece olvidar que morir a causa de una borracha — sea o no hija de famoso roquero — , es un tema que nadie puede pasar por alto .
Y es que un ataque de amnesia colectiva resultaría , por lo menos , la confirmación de que la justicia es ciega , sorda y tonta .
Pero además , el olvido en ese tema sería igual a ratificar que “ para los ricos y famosos ” existen corrupción y comprensión , mientras que para los pobres , injusticia a secas .
Vamos al origen .
¿ Qué fue lo que pasó ?
Que Celia Lora salió de un antro — por ahí de las 4 de la mañana — , absolutamente borracha .
Que nadie fue capaz de impedir que condujera su automóvil en ese estado , por lo que fue inevitable el choque contra una camioneta , en la lateral del Periférico .
El golpe lanzó la camioneta contra un trabajador que , horas después , murió .
Está claro que en el origen está el exceso de alcohol y la imprudencia de manejar completamente alcoholizada .
Bien , pues resulta que por razones que sólo explican la complicidad y la corrupción , el Ministerio Público del Distrito Federal dejó en libertad “ a la niña ” , que borracha no podía siquiera sostenerse en pie , a quien un médico legista sordo , ciego y corrupto , sólo detectó “ aliento alcohólico ” .
El escándalo detonó y la Procuraduría General de Justicia del Distrito Federal intentó corregir , al señalar que “ siempre sí ” la niña estaba borracha .
Por eso debe comparecer ante un juez .
Entonces se hizo el milagro .
Es decir , que no pocos medios , periodistas de espectáculos y otros —y no pocos amigos de Lora — , se contagiaron de la ceguera , sordera y tontera de la justicia , y empujaron lo que pareció una campaña mediática a favor de la niña Lora .
La víctima mortal ya no era el trabajador Pedro Corona , sus hijos huérfanos y su viuda , sino la víctima era “ la niña ” .
Pobre , todos la persiguen , no se dan cuenta del daño que le causan .
¿ Por qué la persiguen ?
“ Porque cometió el pecado de llamarse Lora ” , según dijo su padre .
Pero no fue el único ciego , sordo y descocado .
Por ejemplo , a Paty Chapoy y su claque de zafios — en Ventaneando — , poco les faltó para acusar de imprudente al hombre muerto , por cometer la torpeza de estar en el lugar y el momento equivocados ; por “ morirse ” a causa del choque de “ la niña ” .
Tontín como siempre , Daniel Bisogno se aventó la puntada de regañar a los que piden justicia , porque no saben el daño que le ocasionan a “ la niña ” .
¿ Cómo se atreven a acusarla de un crimen .
En todo caso , que acusen al dueño de la camioneta que mató a Pedro Corona ?
Es decir , que según el ñoño Bisogno , no importa quién provocó el choque y con ello el crimen .
Lo que importa es exonerar a “ la pobre niña ” .
¿ Cuántos de los que ven “ la tragedia de los Lora ” , sobre la tragedia del trabajador , su viuda y sus hijos huérfanos , han imaginado un escenario en sentido contrario ?
— en donde la víctima fuera la niña Lora — ; ¿ Cuántos han volteado el dedo para ponerse en el lugar de la viuda , los huérfanos , los padres y hermanos de Pedro Corona ?
Pareciera que para Chapoy y otros periodistas de espectáculos y amigos de Lora , es más valiosa la libertad de la niña — a pesar de que cometió un delito — , que la vida de Pedro Corona .
¿ Por qué no le preguntan a los padres , hermanos , hijos … de los ocho mil muertos anuales a causa de conductores borrachos en México ?
Sin duda los Lora viven una tragedia .
Pero lo es debido a la irresponsabilidad de Celia , por conducir borracha un automóvil ; igual que manejar en estado de ebriedad cualquier arma mortal .
Pero el asunto es más grave .
El accidente , la muerte de Pedro Corona , la corrupción del Ministerio Público , la impunidad por fama , el intento de solapar a “ la niña ” y todas las tragedias colaterales , tienen un origen común ; el consumo excesivo de alcohol en un antro y , claro , conducir borracha un automóvil .
Todo , luego de que la Asamblea del DF aprobó que los antros cierren a las cinco de la mañana , “ bajo reglas estrictas ” , que nunca se cumplieron en el caso de “ la niña ” .
¿ Y quien ha dicho “ esta boca es mía ” ?
Celia debe ser castigada con todo el peso de la ley , más allá de la impunidad mediática que sus amigos le regalan ..
EN EL CAMINO
En el caso Diego , avanza la hipótesis de la venganza de cercanos .
Al tiempo .
Once upon a time
When I was new to PHP I wanted to make a bbcode parser , so I started looking for ways to find a specific string and replace each occurrences of it with appropriate strings or tags , for example replace the smiley symbol : ) with < img src= ’ Images / smile.jpg ’>.
That ’s when I came across something called regular expression , the first look at it sent chills down my spine , I mean look at it .
<? php
$ text= " < a href= " www.wordpress.com " >
Wordpress </a>
preg_match_all ( " < a href= [ ' | \ " ] ( http:\/\/www\..*\.[a-z ] { 1,4} ) [ ' | \ " ] ) >.*<\/a>/i " , $ text , $matches ) ;
echo " Found matches " ;
foreach ( $ matches [ 1 ] as $ mach ) echo $ match . "
" ;
?>
And they lived happily ever after .
Now do n’t worry if you do n’t understand it , everyone does n’t the first time , its really easy .
In case you ’re wondering what the above line does , it gets every http link from the text in $ text and stores it in the form of an array in $ matches .
I know I know , I should be starting from the basics here , sorry I got a little ahead here , just wanted to show you whats in store for you here , I ’ll explain everything I know about regular expression now .
The beast
We ’ve been hearing a lot of regular expressions or regexps as its easy to type .
But wth is a regexp ?
Well think of it as a “ find a word ” function , it looks for specific patterns or pattern of words matches them and if you ask it to store the resulting matches to a variable , it does so .
In even simpler words if you want to find out if there ’s a word “ foo ” present in “ foobar ” , it does just that for you .
Its a very useful function of PHP or other languages like Perl , but we ’ll focus on PHP for now .
What good is it ?
Well , there are a lot of applications and cool uses for regular expression .
Some of them are .
1. Like I said before you can use it to parse smileys and bbcodes .
2 . You can use it to find out the number of occurrence of a word or letter in a string or text file .
3 . You can use it to process the results returned by your cURL google search script .
4 . Get links and image urls from webpages that you scrape .
5 . Find and replace words , use it as a word filterer .
6. Validate form data like email address or data of birth checking for a specified pattern .
Prerequisite
The only prerequisite to understand or make use of this article is that you should know that basics of PHP .
Now for some coding
Alright , enough talk , how in the name of everything holy do we use regexps and do some cool stuff with it ?
Well , to begin with we need to learn 3 functions .
1. preg_match :
It should be obvious that its the function used to match a “ pattern ” in a string .
Now whats a pattern ?
In short if you look at the first example /< a href= .
*( http:\/\/www\..*\..*)>.*<\/a>/i , this stuff is called a pattern .
It tells preg_match what you want it to , match .
You might be thinking wth do we need all those weird looking symbols and characters for .
Well , you do n’t really , all those symbols and stuff are for complex pattern matching .
If you just want to match a word “ foo ” in a string “ foobar ” , your pattern could look like this .
" / foo / "
Delimiters
And what are those two unholy “ / ” symbols doing at both ends of our pattern ?
Those are called “ delimiter ” , they mark the beginning and end of our pattern , it does n’t really need be the “ / ” , you can use any symbol you want as long as you use the same one to mark the beginning and end of the pattern .
That brings us to our next question , why do we need to mark beginning and end of the pattern ?
We need them so that we can use something called “ pattern modifiers ” .
Pattern Modifiers
Yay more new terms :D. Modifiers are kind of advance features that helps us make advanced kind of searches on texts .
Stuff like if you want to make the search case insensitive greedy or ungreedy , do extra analysis , ignore newlines and treat the whole string as one line .
I know some of this may look strange to you but it ’ll make sense sooner .
Modifiers come immediately after the end delimiter like this “ / pattern / i ” i is the modifier here which makes the search case less , so Pattern and pattern looks the same to it .
Some of the modifiers are .
i : This modifiers sets case less searching so that preg_match
does case insensitive matching .
s : If this modifier is set the “ . ” metacharacter matches all the characters .
The “ . ” metacharacter , we ’ll talk about
metacharacters next , matches everything excluding the “
” character .
Using this will make the dot character match it too .
x : This modifier makes the preg_match ignore white spaces unless its specified inside character class , I ’ve been talking about a lot of terms that I ’ve n’t explained .
Please humor me for a moment here .
I ’ll explain it all after this section .
U : Its also called the ungreedy modifier .
The thing widh preg_match is that if you make a pattern like this / [ b ] (.*) [ /b ] / to match all the text between the bold bbcode , it ’ll match everything in between the first occurrence of [ b ] and the last occurrence of [ b ] .
So something like [ b ] bold text one [ b ] something else [ b ] bold text two [ / b ] after parsing would look like bold text one something else bold text two because it matched everything in between the first [ b ] and the sencond [ / b ] .
So we put the U modifier so that it matches each [ b ] text separately .
Metacharacters
Did you notice all the “ . [ ] {}\( ) * ” characters ?
Well , turns out they ’re called metacharacters .
What they do is that they help us make our patterns even more specific .
Lets say for example we want to check if a line ends with foo .
We can do it using the “ $ ” metacharacter which tells the function to match the word at the end of the string .
The most commonly used metacharacters are .
$- : This meta - character helps us specify characters in the end of pattern we want to match .
For example :
/ end / matches words like blend , will send , and end .
^-:
The circumflex symbol sets the characters at the beginning of the pattern to be matched .
For example :
/ start / matches words like started , startle , and start the engine .
. :
The dot character matches any character with exception to the “
” or new line by default unless you set the m modifier .
\ : Is an escape character .
We can use it to escape special characters like $ , [ , ] , { , } , * , . , ( , ) , and ^ in case we use them in our pattern .
For example if we want to check if a text contains $ sign , we could do this .
See what happened up there ?
The $ character is escaped using a \ .
If you do n’t this this the compiler will return an error .
We can also use it to escape the delimiter if we use it .
Like this .
/s\/ash/
Character Class
Just what we need , more terms : P. Character classes are like baskets or menus or lists in which we can specify a range of characters we want preg_match to match .
For example if we want a [ b ] bb tag to match only letters and not numbers our pattern could look like this .
/\[ b\ ] ( [ a - zA - Z ] ) { 1, }\[\/ b\ ] /.
Aha two new signs .
Those two signs are called minimum and maximum quantifiers .
The “ - ” character marks the range of characters for example “ 0 - 9 ” , or “ a - b , a-z ” .
Quantifiers
Holy cow , whats that ?
Nah , do n’t worry its not as complex as its name sounds .
There ’s only two kind of quantifiers , minimum and maximum .
They set the limit to how many characters we want the pattern to match in a characters class .
Its used like this , {min quant , max quant} where min quant and max quant specifies the minimum and number of characters .
For example .
{ 1,2} Means that we want to match a minimum of 1 and a maximum of two characters .
{ 1 , } Means that we want the function to match any number of characters from 1 to any :P .
preg_match ( “ / [ a-z ] {1, } / ” ) : Matches text like abc , cde , and thingislong
preg_match ( “ / [ a- z ] { 1,2}[0-9 ] {1, } / ” ) : Matches text like ab123 , ab1 , and jk123123123
Another thing about character classes is that the “ ^ ” symbol signifies the characters we want to exclude from the search or the characters that the matching pattern should n’t contain .
For example .
preg_match ( “ / [ a -z^0 - 9 ] /i ” ) :
Matches words like abce , and word and does n’t match word like abc123 .
The ^ meta - character outside the [ and ] characters of the character class is not the same as the one inside it , both of them have different meanings .
More quantifiers
Just when you thought you wo n’t hear from the quantifiers any more .
There are two more quantifiers we need to know about .
The first one is “ * ” or the 0 or more quantifier , it matches one or more characters specified in the character class or character that precedes it .
And “ + ” or the 1 or more quantifier matches one or more characters .
For example .
preg_match ( “ /\w{1,} .*/ ” ) : Matches w , wo1 , wo % and pretty much any one word followed by 0 or more characters other than
or newline .
preg_match ( “ /\W\w + / ” ) : Matches one or more of any character .
SubPatterns
SubPatterns are like , well , sub patterns , suppose you want to match a smiley : D in a text “ yay : D ” so that you can parse it to replace it with appropriate image .
If we do it using a pattern like this .
preg_match ( “ /.*: D / ” , $ text , $match )
It ’ll return an array with the whole text , thats the reason we need sub patterns .
The start and end of a sub pattern can be marked with “ ( ” and “ ) ” characters .
Now if we do this .
preg_match ( “ /.*( : D ) / ” , $ text , $match ) ;
We ’ll get an array with a collection of arrays in it which has the sub pattern or the “ : D ” we want .
We can use this to replace it with appropriate image tag and source .
In this case the matching sub pattern will be in $ match [ 1 ] and if we add more sub patterns just increase the index number like $ match [ 2 ] , $ match [ 3 ] and so on .
Alright now that we ’ve covered the basics of syntax and preg_match lets move on to the other two functions .
Woohoo , more fun :P .
preg_match_all :
preg_match_all ’s a function almost like preg_match with exception for the fact that it matches all the words that matches the pattern in the string or text .
The thing with preg_match is that it stops once it finds the first match , it can only be used to find a single match or to check if a text matches a particular pattern .
If you wanna do some text collection , preg_match_all ’s the function you ’re looking for .
You can use it like this .
preg_match_all( “ / pa[t ] { 2}ern / ” , ” text for the pattern to match ” , $matchStoringVariable ) ;
You ’ll see some sample applications for this at the end of this article .
preg_replace :
Now for the last function , preg_replace .
We can use it to replace strings that match a particular pattern .
For example if we want to replace words with two p’s in it in a text with just one p we can do it like this .
preg_replace ( “ / [ p ] { 2}/i ” , ” p ” , $ text ) ;
Or we can replace an array of patterns with an array of replacements .
$ smilies=array ( “ / :\ ) / , ” : D ” , ” : p ” , ” : ( “ ) ;
$ replace=array ( “ images/smile.png ” , ” images/lau.png ” , ” images/ton.png ” , ” images/sa.png ” ) ;
preg_replace ( $smilies , $replace , $text ) ;
Or if we want to get some matches from a string and replace some parts of the text along with the text we got from the match function we can do this .
$ bbcode=array ( “ / \[ b\ ] ( .*) \[ \/ b\ ] / Ui ” , ” \[ i\ ] ( .*) \[ \/i\ ] / Ui ” ) ;
$ replace=array ( “ < strong > $ 1 <\/ strong > ” , ” < em > $ 1 < \/em > ” ) ;
preg_replace ( $ bbcode , $replace , $text ) ;
You must have noticed the $ 1 up there .
That ’s the sub pattern match text we got from the preg_match function .
If we want more sub patterns we just need to increase the number near the “ $ ” sign like $ 2 , $ 3 and so on .
Its that easy .
Special characters
There are some special non-printable characters and characters than can be represented using a backslash , they can help you make your patterns more precise .
Some of them are .
\a Alarm or the BEL character , its usage usually outputs a sounds when the script is run on terminal console .
\f Formfeed
\t Tab
Newline
\r Carriage return , similar to newline
\d Digits
\D Non decimal digits
\h and \v Horizontal and vertical whitespace
\ H and \V Any character that is not a horizontal or vertical whitespace
\s Any whitespace character
\S Any character that is not a whitespace
\w Any word character .
\ W Any nonword character .
\b Word boundary
\B Not a word boundary
\G First matching position in a pattern or string
\ A Start of a string or line
\Z End of a line or string
The characters have not been sorted on the basis of anything .
I just wrote it down :P .
And they regexp ’ ed happily ever after
I think I ’ve explained about everything or almost everything I know about regular expressions in PHP .
If you ’d like to , please take a look at the sample code .
They ’re not much , but I ’ll add more as I make them .
Sample functions
Do XSS filtering
<? php
function XSSFilter ( $str ) {
$ unsafe=array ( " / / ” , ” /\ ” / ” ) ;
$ safe=array ( “ < “ , ” > ” , ” " ” ) ;
$ str=preg_replace ( $ unsafe , $safe , $str ) ;
return $ str ;
}
?>
Check if mail address is valid
Check if a field has only numbers or if a field has only letters
<? php
function onlyNum ( $str ) {
$ ret=false ;
if (!preg_match ( " / [ ^0 - 9 ] / " ) ) $ ret=true ;
return $ ret ;
}
function onlyLet ( $str ) {
$ ret=false ;
if (!preg_match ( " / [ ^a - zA - Z ] / " ) ) $ ret=true ;
return $ ret ;
}
BBCode parser
function bbCode ( $str ) {
$ bbcodes=array ( “ / \[ b\ ] ( .*) \[ \/ b\ ] ” ) ; // Add more bbcodes here
$ replace=array ( “ < strong > $ 1<\/strong > ” ) ; // Add the replacement texts or tags here
$ str=preg_replace ( $ bbcode , $replace , $str ) ;
return $ str ;
}
?>
I ’ll add more later : P. Sorry I could n’t do it now .
Pieces of the city are forming , like islands [ Image : " Shopping mall parking lot , Dubai , " ( 2009 ) by Bas Princen ] .
Photographer Bas Princen has a fantastic new exhibition , called " Refuge , " up at
Storefront describes the show as a " photographic fiction " :
Although it is the result of extensive travels and research in five cities of the Middle East and Turkey — Istanbul , Beirut , Amman , Cairo and Dubai — it could just as easily pass as the pictorial record of a dérive through a single , imaginary city : a city without a center , populated by extraordinary and at times implausible architectural artefacts ; an urban laboratory whose physical traits are defined by migratory flows , spatial transformation and geopolitical flux on a continental scale .
[ Image : " Cooling plant , Dubai , " ( 2009 ) by Bas Princen ] .
As part of a poster published in tandem with the exhibition , former Storefront director Joseph Grima interviewed Princen about his work , starting off with an inquiry into how Princen 's own background in architectural studies might have affected his photographic approach to the built and natural environments ( the interview is also available at
[ Image : " Sand ridge , Amman , " ( 2009 ) by Bas Princen ] .
Princen remarks that , for him , " the camera [ is ] a tool to construct ideas on space or places , or ideas on architecture and landscape . "
For " Refuge , " in particular , he explains that :
My main objective with this project was to create a series of photographs in which Amman , Beirut , Cairo , Dubai and Istanbul disappear as individual cities and as specific places , dissolving instead into a new kind of city , an imaginary urban entity in formation .
This premise directed me to specific places in the periphery where pieces of the city are forming , almost like islands , and this accounts for my interest in the refugee camps and gated communities .
Zeroing in specifically on the architecture , Grima then asks him about " the ubiquity of the modernist reinforced - concrete slab - and - column structure , " a construction technique clearly visible in the photographs reproduced here .
[ Images : " Former sugarcane field , Cairo , " ( 2009 ) and " Ringroad , Cairo , " ( 2009 ) by Bas Princen ] .
Grima suggests that , as a tactic for assembling buildings , this construction technique is " strongly reminiscent of Le Corbusier 's
It is fascinating that Maison Domino , the quintessential modernist prototype conceived as a universal answer to the housing problem , has in the end inspired the method of choice for informal construction , with or without the help of architects .
The many interpretations of the famous Maison Domino prototype I 've seen are a clear indication that is has become the most universally successful type of construction , but nothing prepared me for Cairo , where this structural system is really pushed to the limits — not only because these buildings in red - brick - and - concrete grids rise to 16 or 17 floors , but also because three quarters of the city is constructed in this way .
It is a mesmerizing fictional experience : driving on an elevated highway through this city of red brick towers , trying to imagine who is actually living there .
This latter remark — Princen 's difficulty in imagining these sorts of landscape humanly inhabited — sets the stage for a remark , later in the interview , when Princen mentions that he attempts to maintain a human presence in his photographs — in other words , they are not anthropologically empty landscapes .
[ Images : " Mokkatam Ridge ( garbage recycling city ) , Cairo , " ( 2009 ) by Bas Princen ] .
He adds that " the so - called ' middle distance ' " — the scale inhabited by humans — " has not been used much in recent architectural photography , " an industry that tends now to focus on one of two extremes : " the architectural object on the one hand and the cityscape on the other . "
But " it is exactly in this middle distance , " Princen counters , " that the human figure becomes an interesting element : it can not be shown as the main subject , but will always be defined by the relationship with its surroundings , to put an extra meaning or layer on the landscape or object that is photographed . "
As a result , Princen 's photos show us diminutive humans , stranded amidst incomprehensible architectural forms and massive landscapes , neither urban nor rural , pursuing admirably self - directed goals through which to give themselves meaning or , depending on how you look at it , utterly vacuous tasks that they refuse to admit should be abandoned .
[ Images : Spreads from " Refuge " by Bas Princen ] .
Princen has rapidly become one of my favorite photographers ; his earlier work , for instance , collected in the stunning
What this means , more concretely , is that the book documents transitional landscapes scattered here and there around the Netherlands : " future suburbs , " highway overpass construction sites deep in forested housing estates , thickets planted for no ecological reason other than to block the sounds of a nearby airfield — landscapes that are at once highly abstract , yet ingeniously colonized by the local residents who have turned them into 4x4 race tracks , kite - flying grounds , fishing ponds , sites for paintball tournaments , and more .
They are also landscapes that have been generated , as if unconsciously , by industrial processes seated and operating elsewhere ; as such , Princen shows us clay and sand depots , harbor excavation sites , and dumping grounds for contaminated silt and soil .
But then , there , on top of those strange landforms , built on no recognizable human scale , there are weekend nature enthusiasts with their cameras out , stalking rare insects and birds that have settled these disrupted terrains .

It 's the small humanist flips , however , that interest me so much ; a sand dyke , for example , built ostensibly for the same purpose as above , " to shield a new housing estate from the noise of a military airfield , " but that has since been transformed into a communal meeting place where " residents gather on the sand dyke to watch the planes . "

These makeshift , highly unexpected communities — such as model - airplane enthusiasts hanging out together in remote hardware store parking lots — are rampant throughout Artificial Arcadia and , indeed , Bas Princen 's work altogether .
One of the most intriguing examples of this is the site of a new highway being constructed through forested suburbs ; far from the paving stage , however , it is simply a muddy scar through the trees , looking more like a landslide , with no actual sense that the construction crews are even coming back to finish it .
It is , Princen explains , " a 30 - km long highway construction site , cutting through forests and farmlands , skirting villages , " that has since become " a gathering place , " like a piazza or churchyard .
The back of the book states that Princen is interested in documenting " the complex qualities that construct contemporary landscape , such as accessibility , wind direction , water currents and communication networks .
In addition the use of certain products , such as kites , mountain bikes and GPS monitors , has a bearing on the way in which landscape is understood . "
The landscape is instrumentalized , we might say , distilled through dense layers of technological abstraction to become , once again , a place inhabitable by human activity , however pathetic or impressively persistent it might be .

In any case , the exhibition opening tonight , May 11 , at Photographer Bas Princen has a fantastic new exhibition , called " Refuge , " up at Storefront for Art and Architecture .
Tonight , Tuesday , May 11 , Princen will be at the gallery for a public event and opening , and it's well worth checking out .
Storefront describes the show as a " photographic fiction " :
As part of a poster published in tandem with the exhibition , former Storefront director Joseph Grima interviewed Princen about his work , starting off with an inquiry into how Princen 's own background in architectural studies might have affected his photographic approach to the built and natural environments ( the interview is also available at Domus ) .
Princen remarks that , for him , " the camera [ is ] a tool to construct ideas on space or places , or ideas on architecture and landscape . "
For " Refuge , " in particular , he explains that : Zeroing in specifically on the architecture , Grima then asks him about " the ubiquity of the modernist reinforced - concrete slab - and - column structure , " a construction technique clearly visible in the photographs reproduced here .
Grima suggests that , as a tactic for assembling buildings , this construction technique is " strongly reminiscent of Le Corbusier 's Maison Domino . "
Princen 's response is brilliant , and worth quoting at length :
This latter remark — Princen 's difficulty in imagining these sorts of landscape humanly inhabited — sets the stage for a remark , later in the interview , when Princen mentions that he attempts to maintain a human presence in his photographs — in other words , they are not anthropologically empty landscapes .
He adds that " the so - called ' middle distance ' " — the scale inhabited by humans — " has not been used much in recent architectural photography , " an industry that tends now to focus on one of two extremes : " the architectural object on the one hand and the cityscape on the other . "

Princen has rapidly become one of my favorite photographers ; his earlier work , for instance , collected in the stunning Artificial Arcadia , shows , in Grima 's words , " the contemporary landscape as something invariably artificial , even when there is no sign of human intervention .
" What this means , more concretely , is that the book documents transitional landscapes scattered here and there around the Netherlands : " future suburbs , " highway overpass construction sites deep in forested housing estates , thickets planted for no ecological reason other than to block the sounds of a nearby airfield — landscapes that are at once highly abstract , yet ingeniously colonized by the local residents who have turned them into 4x4 race tracks , kite - flying grounds , fishing ponds , sites for paintball tournaments , and more .
They are also landscapes that have been generated , as if unconsciously , by industrial processes seated and operating elsewhere ; as such , Princen shows us clay and sand depots , harbor excavation sites , and dumping grounds for contaminated silt and soil .
But then , there , on top of those strange landforms , built on no recognizable human scale , there are weekend nature enthusiasts with their cameras out , stalking rare insects and birds that have settled these disrupted terrains .
The book , frankly , is pretty incredible .
Take the " acoustic forest " : as mentioned above , it is a landscape " maintained to cushion the noise of a military base and airfield , " showing us an artificial ecosystem as military - sonic camouflage , like something out of Nick Sowers 's research .
It 's the small humanist flips , however , that interest me so much ; a sand dyke , for example , built ostensibly for the same purpose as above , " to shield a new housing estate from the noise of a military airfield , " but that has since been transformed into a communal meeting place where " residents gather on the sand dyke to watch the planes .

In any case , the exhibition opening tonight , May 11 , at Storefront for Art and Architecture — where Bas Princen will be present in the gallery to kick things off and answer questions — features only his work for " Refuge , " but it promises to be one of the more compelling photography shows in New York this year .

The change to AMS should increase the amount of time it can spend in space
An anti-matter detector to be installed on the space station is to have a key component changed in order to help it spend longer in space .
Scientists plan to replace the liquid helium - cooled heart of the detector with a long - life magnet that already has spent time in orbit .
Modifying the device should increase the time it can operate in space from three years to as long as 18 years .
The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer will be brought up on the space shuttle .
AMS is designed to look for anti-matter particles and markers of dark matter , among other experiments .
With more than 300,000 data channels , the detector generates too much information to radio it all to Earth , so it includes a supercomputer to crunch the data in orbit .
I began to realize that we'd have a museum piece
Professor Samuel Ting , MIT
The computer pushes AMS power requirements to 2.5 kilowatts , far beyond what a typical satellite 's solar panels can produce , but well within the station 's 100 - kilowatt power supply .
Nobel laureate Samuel Ting , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) physicist , is overseeing a 500 - member , multinational team of scientists involved in the $ 1.5 bn project .
" We began thinking about this at the end of last year and the beginning of January when people were talking about the space station going to 2020 and beyond , " Professor Ting told BBC News .
" I began to realize that we'd have a museum piece . "
US President Barack Obama has proposed to extend the life of the space station for at least five years beyond 2015 , with a budget of about $ 3bn a year .
Sensitivity factor Unlike ground - based particle accelerators , AMS samples high - energy particles directly from deep space .
It can detect particles with vastly higher energies than what can be produced in particle accelerators .
The Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) at Cern , for example , can smash particles with a combined energy of about 7 tera - electronvolts , or TeV .
A cosmic ray , by comparison , can have energies greater than 100 million TeV .
" The sensitivity of AMS is a factor of 100 to 1,000 times more than previous instruments and the fact that you can stay in space for 10 to 18 years makes it even more sensitive , " Ting said .
The AMS is shown attached to the ISS ( far left ) in this artist 's impression
" This really is the very first very , very precise particle physics detector , " he said .
" You enter into a totally new domain .
It 's very hard to predict what you 'll find . "
Dumping AMS ' cryogenic superconducting magnet cuts the power of its magnetic field to bend the path of charged cosmic particles as they pass through five different types of detectors .
But Ting says the addition of spare detectors and the extra years in orbit more than compensate for the diminished field strength .
The replacement magnet was part of a prototype AMS that flew on a 1998 space shuttle mission .
It was recently taken out of clean room storage in Germany and tested .
It is due to arrive at Cern , where AMS is being assembled , this week .
Modifying AMS would delay the space shuttles ' planned 30 September retirement to later in the year .
It had been slated to launch in July on Nasa 's next - to - last space shuttle mission .

Underwater robots , containment domes , top hats , hot taps , junk shots … the potential fixes to the Gulf Oil Spill sound like they come straight from a cringeworthy disaster flick ( or a PR think tank ) .
But what if the solution is right under our noses ?
What if it ’s already sitting in the Gulf ?
John Hofmeister , the former president of Shell Oil , and Nick Pozzi , a former pipeline engineering and operations project manager for Saudi Aramco , think it might be .
According to Hofmeister , oil supertankers could be used to suck up massive amounts of oil–possibly millions of barrels at a time .
In an interview with FastCompany.com , Hofmeister explained that a little - known Saudi oil spill from an offshore platform in the early 1990s dumped more crude into the sea than any spill in U.S. history ( think hundreds of millions of gallons ) .
But the government and local press kept it quiet .
And that ’s why one of the big fixes in the Saudi oil spill –the oil - skimming supertanker –has n’t been publicized .
“ [ They ] figured out how to deploy supertankers that had the ability to
both intake and discharge liquids in vast quantities with huge pumps , ” Hofmeister explained .
“ The supertankers could
simply suck in seawater and oil simultaneously –they can hold millions of
barrels–and when full , they could discharge oil at a port into tanks where they
could separate oil from water .
The idea is novel in that you can get massive of oil amounts quickly . ”
Once the supertankers make it to to the port , water can be treated and discharged , and oil can either be used or destroyed .
Pozzi saw the technique used in the Middle East , where it recovered 85 % of the oil from the Saudi spill .
And he thinks it could work in the Gulf of Mexico .
“ The only downside is that you tie up oil tankers .
That ’s why we think that BP wo n’t listen to us .
They do n’t want to spend that extra money . ”
After learning about the supertanker technique a few weeks ago , Hofmeister decided to bring it to the government ’s attention .
“ I ’ve been trying to connect engineers with decision - makers at the Coast Guard and in the interior department , ” he said .
On our way back home from Black Hat Europe in Barcelona , Thomas and I were brainstorming about the most important changes to the field of binary code reverse engineering in the last 10 years .
What has changed since then ?
What made the biggest impact ?
Remember : Back in the dark days of 2000 , W32 Dasm and Turbo Debugger were considered good reverse engineering tools .
If you had a self - written tracer that logged the execution of conditional jumps you were basically a king .
Anyway , we came up with several trends and technologies we believe have changed the job of reverse engineers tremendously since 2000 .
Here they are :
Visual flow graphs for assembly code
First introduced in IDA Pro 4.17 ( June 2001 ) , the ability to view disassembled assembly code in graph form made the job of reverse engineers much easier .
In essence , using visual flow graphs during reverse engineering raises the level of abstraction and understanding of code while at the same time lowering the required time and effort one has to invest .
Before we had graphs we had to reconstruct control - flow structures like loops and if - else statements from linearly listed assembly instructions .
With visual flow graphs we can just look at the graph and understand the control flow pretty much immediately .
In the following years other tools ( such as BinNavi ) were built around the idea of interacting with flowgraphs .
Shortly thereafter , the graph engine of IDA Pro was improved ( especially in IDA Pro 5.0 , March 2006 ) to provide interactive graphing out of the box .
Python as a scripting language
Back in 2000 , most reverse engineering tools were primitive and barely extensible .
For disassemblers your best bet was a clumsy IDC implementation in IDA Pro 4 .
For debuggers the situation looked even bleaker .
This all changed with the growing popularity of the scripting language Python and SWIG , a technology which allows programs to easily add a Python interpreter and expose a Python - based API .
The first major step forward I can remember was the creation of the IDAPython plugin for IDA Pro which added a way to access the IDA API from Python ( Gergely Erdelyi , 2004 ) .
Later we had tools like Pedram Amini ’s PyDbg or Ero Carrera ’s pefile that helped popularize the Python language in reverse engineering .
Today , Python is the de-facto scripting language of reverse engineering and many tools from IDA Pro to Immunity Debugger or BinNavi support Python scripting .
Dynamic Instrumentation
Even though the technology is not brand - new ( the first publications describing ‘ Dynamo ’ go back to 2000 ) , the widespread use of dynamic instrumentation tools like DynamoRIO and Pin for reverse engineering certainly is .
Using these frameworks you can build very powerful dynamic analysis tools that allow the monitoring and manipulation of instruction streams in a very transparent and highly efficient way .
If you have never used either of these tools , you can imagine them like a way to efficiently receive a callback to a C/ C++ program after every instruction .
Using these , you can directly control every aspect of the targeted program , while incurring small overhead .
If you are looking for a new reverse engineering tool to do some research with , dynamic instrumentation might be for you :
Working on actual program traces removes a lot of complication in comparison to the static case , and the many different productive uses of dynamic instrumentation are still far from exhausted .
While relatively fresh and untapped , dynamic instrumentation tools are definitely a topic people talk about at IT security conferences and elsewhere .
BinDiff-ing
Many years ago , some smart people had a brilliant idea :
If you compare an unpatched version of a file to a patched version of the same file , you can easily find what code was changed by the patch and use this information to quickly find vulnerabilities that were patched by the patch .
Soon it became evident that new tools were needed that make the process of comparing two versions of the same file as quick and easy as possible .
Our own BinDiff tool is maybe the most popular diffing engine for binary code today .
However , the idea of comparing files is so popular that a number of free competitors have sprung up over the years .
In general , these tools all work in the same way :
Once the two input files are disassembled , the functions in file A are matched to the functions in file B and local changes to the matched functions are found and shown to the user .
BinDiff - style tools are now part of the standard toolbox of many reverse engineers , from vulnerability researchers to malware analysts and there is hardly another technology that rose as spectacularly as this one since 2000 .
The end of SoftICE
Back in the days there was just one debugger everybody used for reverse engineering : SoftICE .
SoftICE was a wonderful debugger originally written by a company called NuMega from New Hampshire .
It was a debugger that allowed you to debug user - land programs as well as kernel - land programs on your blog .
zynamics.com machine without the need for any complicated setup .
Later , NuMega was bought by Compuware and SoftICE was discontinued in April 2006 .
Of course , newer debuggers have replaced SoftICE today .
Microsoft ’s own WinDbg , while not nearly as pretty as SoftICE , is the new powerful and popular debugger on the block .
The arrival of the Hex - Rays decompiler
Back in 2000 , decompilers sucked .
Today , there is Hex - Rays .
Back in 2007 the team behind IDA Pro released the first decompiler I am aware of that is actually useful .
Since then they have continued to improve the decompiler and they are already showcasing support for ARM decompilation .
While not many people seem to use Hex - Rays yet , this product is definitely one to keep an eye on .
Collaborative Reverse Engineering
Back in 2000 , collaborative reverse engineering was unheard of as it was really difficult to exchange reverse engineered information between two databases created by the same program , let alone between different programs .
In recent years the situation changed a bit , probably mostly out of necessity .
Software today is much more complex than it was ten years ago and very often teams of reverse engineers have to collaborate on the same project .
While still in their infancy , collaborative reverse engineering tools are here to stay and will probably become even more popular in the future .
Reverse engineers will pick tools like Chris Eagle ’s CollabREate for IDA Pro or our own BinCrowd to share their results with friends and colleagues .
Academic Approaches
Another trend of the last few years is that major universities research topics related to binary code reverse engineering .
Among others , there are the University of Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University which have done really impressive work in the last few years .
At the same time , reverse engineers in the industry have begun to take note of academic approaches to reverse engineering .
While academic approaches to reverse engineering are not yet in common use in the industry , we know many people and companies that are beginning to look into more formalized ways to reverse engineering .
The popularity of the Reverse Engineering Reddit , maybe the primary resource for formalized reverse engineering on the internet , speaks volumes .
So , that ’s our opinion .
Maybe your opinion is different .
Do you disagree with any of those advances or did we miss anything significant ?
Can you think of any technology that was supposed to be the future but then bombed spectacularly in practice ?
Let us know . 🙂
Text to speech in MacOS X - automatically
MacOS
X has a wonderfully crafted new synthetic voice , Alex .
It sounds remarkably natural and non-Tron - like .
Given a text file foo.
txt , this is how you would convert it into speech in a sound file foo. aiff :
say - v alex -o foo.aiff -f foo.txt
I do a good fraction of my “ reading ” ( especially long articles on the web ) by converting them into speech like this , and dropping them into my iPod .
You can go a step further to automate this : use folder actions with an AppleScript so that text files dropped into a given folder are automatically converted into speech files .
The script goes like this :
(* add - new item say This Folder Action handler is triggered whenever items are added to the attached folder .
The script will convert the item added into a .aiff sound file , containing the contents of the added item spoken out loud , using the " Alex " voice . *) property dialog_timeout : 10 -- set the amount of time before dialogs auto - answer .
on adding folder items to this_folder after receiving added_items try repeat with current_item in added_items (*
Get just the name , without the full path , of the current item *) tell application " Finder " set the current_name to the name of current_item end tell (*
The sound file is created one level up *) set the sound_file to POSIX path of this_folder & " /../ " & current_name & " .aiff " (*
The shell invocation for converting to speech *) set the say_script to " cd " & POSIX path of this_folder & " ; /usr / bin / say - v alex -o " & sound_file & " -f " & POSIX path of current_item do shell script say_script end repeat (*
One notification when all the conversions are done *) set the alert_message to " Speaking done ! " display dialog the alert_message buttons { " OK " } default button 1 with icon 1 giving up after dialog_timeout end try end adding folder items to
The increasingly troubled , cobra - heart - eating , self - loathing Anthony Bourdain has been passing around galleys for his new book Medium Raw .
In it , he goes out of his way to spill his own reptilian venom on targets in every corner of the food world .
The chapter in which he disgorges his scatological phlegm , entitled " Heroes and Villains , " he describes as " the most vicious , hateful , and angry single chapter of my life . "
Yet however concocted most of his accusations are ( do n't publishers pass authors ' trash by libel lawyers anymore ? ) , what is most disturbing is that Bourdain , who showed his gifts as a writer when he penned the post - druggie , post - boozy story of his sordid past in Kitchen Confidential , seems to have lost all ability to construct a single paragraph without using the words " douche bag , " " asshole , " and " fuck , " which you expect from illiterate , ever - anonymous food bloggers but not from the once - stylish Bourdain .
You could see it coming :
When he published Anthony Bourdain 's Les Halles Cookbook ( 2004 ) , he needed two co-authors to cobble the thing together , telling the reader , " if , from time to time , I refer to you as a ' useless screwhead , ' I will expect you to understand — and not take it personally " and then going on an Abby Hoffman - like tear in the voice of a real sixties kinda - guy : " The enjoyment of a long lunch — at table with good friends , tearing into the good stuff made with love and pride — that , arguably is in the blood , or at least in your cultural heritage .
But you 've got that already , right ?
Otherwise you would n't be here .
You would n't have forked over thirty - five bucks to some publishing conglomerate for this book .
Would you ?
Well ?
Would you ?
Speak up !
I CAN'T HEAR YOU ! " Down , boy .
Things got worse after that .
Last year in an interview he said of himself , " I 'll live with ' celebrity chef , ' or ' television personality , ' but in my heart of hearts , I 'd put it on the same level as lighting director on porn film , habitual masturbator , or aspiring arsonist . "
Sadly , that 's about the sum total of what Bourdain has become .
Which is too bad , really .
He once had a novel voice , an iconoclast 's passion , but now he has spiraled down to the level of the foul - mouthed bloggers who idolize him .
Once he was a valuable demolisher of culinary pretension ; now he is a fanatic seeking to shore up his own sick TV persona .
And as Santayana observed , " Fanaticism consists of redoubling your effort when you have forgotten your aim . "

The Sounders will host Boca Juniors on May May 26th and Celtic on July 18thRENTON , Wash . - The Seattle Sounders FC announced today they will host Argentina 's Boca Juniors , on May 26 and Scotland 's Celtic on July 18 on the Xbox Pitch at Qwest Field .
" We promised our fans a diverse flavor of international soccer and are thrilled to bring Boca and Celtic to the Pacific Northwest , " said Sounders FC Owner and General Manager Adrian Hanauer .
" These two storied clubs have secured their place as elite franchises during the last century . "
Celtic is making its fourth trip to Seattle and its third to Qwest Field .
Winners of a record 34 Scottish cups and 42 league championships , the " Bhoys " from Glasgow boast a huge worldwide fan base .
They are instantly recognizable for their green - and - white hooped jerseys .
Celtic was the first British club to win a European championship in 1967 .
It met the NASL Sounders in 1981 , and returned to face Manchester United in 2003 and Chelsea in 2004 .
Sources say HP was not happy with the overall performance of Windows 7 on their unreleased tablet , saying the OS was too power - hungry .
Additionally , a Windows 7 license will bring up the price of any final Slate product , and now that HP owns WebOS , the move makes sense .
says also that HP is set to drop the Intel processor used in the tablet , which would completely kill off any chance of Windows 7 being used .
The Slate , in its original state , would have run on Windows 7 , would have been $ 549 at its cheapest , and had an 8.9 - inch 1024x600 multi - touch screen .
Additionally , the tablet had a 1.6GHz Atom Z530 processor , 1GB RAM SDHC slot ( with support up to 128GB ) , two cameras , a USB port , a SIM card slot , and five - hour battery life .

In the world of education , it was the equivalent of the cool kids ’ table in the cafeteria .
Executives from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , McKinsey consultants and scholars from Stanford and Harvard mingled at an invitation - only meeting of the New Schools Venture Fund at a luxury hotel in Pasadena , Calif .
Founded by investors who helped start Google and Amazon , this philanthropy seeks to raise the academic achievement of poor black and Hispanic students , largely through charter schools .
Many of those at the meeting last May had worried that the Obama administration would reflect the general hostility of teachers ’ unions toward charters , publicly financed schools that are independently run and free to experiment in classrooms .
But all doubts were dispelled when the image of Arne Duncan , the new education secretary , filled a large video screen from Washington .
He pledged to combine “ your ideas with our dollars ” from the federal government .
“ What you have created , ” he said , “ is a real movement . ”
That movement includes a crowded clique of alpha girls and boys , including New York hedge fund managers , a Hollywood agent or two and the singers John Legend and Sting , who performed at a fund - raiser for Harlem charter schools last Wednesday at Lincoln Center .
Charters have also become a pet cause of what one education historian calls a billionaires ’ club of philanthropists , including Mr. Gates , Eli Broad of Los Angeles and the Walton family of Wal - Mart .
But for all their support and cultural cachet , the majority of the 5,000 or so charter schools nationwide appear to be no better , and in many cases worse , than local public schools when measured by achievement on standardized tests , according to experts citing years of research .
Last year one of the most comprehensive studies , by researchers from Stanford University , found that fewer than one - fifth of charter schools nationally offered a better education than comparable local schools , almost half offered an equivalent education and more than a third , 37 percent , were “ significantly worse . ”
In light of Google ’s big announcements this past week ( Froyo , Google TV ) , many were quick to jump out and hop on the Google bandwagon .
Putting aside , for a moment , issues of whether or not Google ’s new initiatives will give Apple a run for its money , a MacRumors reader named Bryan Webster emailed the big cheese himself and asked if Apple has any WWDC announcements that will blow Google “ out of the water ” .
Jobs responded , “ You wo n’t be disappointed . ”
Which is quite a tease given that we ’re already quite familiar with the upcoming iPhone 4G , at least in terms of its hardware , so the mere fact that Jobs responded seems to suggest that Apple has a trick up its sleeve .
i Phone coming to Verizon , perhaps ?
An iPhone with an integrated RFID reader ?
An iPhone with unbelievable battery life , a’la the iPad ?
And for all you skeptics out there , Bryan has posted headers .

[ '@ Play ' is a monthly column by John Harris which discusses the history , present and future of the Roguelike dungeon exploring genre .
This time - an interview with Rodain Joubert about the buzzed about Desktop Dungeons . ]
Desktop Dungeons is a quick - play freeware PC dungeon exploration game that has been enjoying tremendous popularity over the last few months .
Each game involves a single screen of a dungeon , and is typically less than thirty minutes to complete .
Yet it provides an abundance of races and classes to play as , and special dungeon types to explore , that endlessly remix its small number of basic elements into completely new challenges each time .
As comments in blog posts about it tend to point out , Desktop Dungeons is not technically a roguelike game .
It does n't have tactical combat , has no identification features , and it 's simulation of time is fairly simplistic .
And yet , it has some fairly strong ties to roguelikes that definitely brings it into the purview of a roguelike column .
It is a game , ultimately , about gaining levels and making good use of limited resources , it 's quite difficult and yet also has a strong sense of balance , where a decision made half the game ago can suddenly be what pushes you over the edge at the end .
Also , live or die , each game is usually less than thirty minutes , so bad decisions do n't drag you down .
If it turns out you can't win , you just retire and try again .
Really good players can tackle one of the challenge dungeons , or even participate in ranked games the scores of which get uploaded to an online scoreboard .
The game seems to be pretty popular on the gaming blogs right now .
In this interview with South African creator Rodain Joubert , alias " Nandrew , " we discuss the game 's creation , its great , sudden popularity , its inspiration in Dungeon Crawl , and a little bit about goats and orcs .
[ Note : I forgot I had Derek Yu's custom tileset for the game installed when I took a couple of the screenshots .
I 'm leaving them in , however , because his set is great .
Not that the originals are a slouch mind you ....]
JH : First off , if you 'd like to introduce yourself to our readers ?
RJ : I 'm Rodain " Nandrew " Joubert , a South African freelance journalist and indie game developer .
I 'm also a fedora wearer and proud of it .
JH : How long have you been developing games ?
RJ : I 've been developing games for at least ten years .
Though a great chunk of that period would better be labelled as " screwing around and making stuff move on a screen . "
My game development career started gathering more steam when I joined up with South Africa 's Game .
Dev community and started enjoying the support and camaraderie of a local community :)
I 've been with that group for about four years now .
They 're awesome and stuff .
JH : Ah !
A local community can help provide a lot of support , technically , morally , and with resources .
Which , like , sounds like the most obvious thing in the world when I say it .
RJ : Definitely !
I write frequent articles aimed at game development newbies , and one of the points I advocate is getting involved with a good community .
( JH 's note : Links at the end of the interview . )
Dungeon Crawl and Desktop Dungeons
JH : Let 's talk a bit about Desktop Dungeons , then .
How did you come up with the idea for the game ?
RJ : In a sentence , I 'd describe the idea as stemming from my love of Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup married with an inability to commit myself to long sessions of roguelike gaming .
I 'm a big fan of the idea that you can get a lot of gaming value out of much shorter sessions and " casual " experiences .
JH : It is true that most of the major roguelikes tend to be fairly long games .
RJ : I was also suitably inspired by Edmund McMillen 's article on game development do's and don'ts at the time , and decided that I 'd really just create the sort of game I 'd love to play , using a lot of the lessons outlined in the DCSS philosophy .
Of course , it turned out to be barely anything like the game I claim inspiration from , but I reckon it's the thought that counts . :P
JH : The philosophy , correct me if I 'm wrong as this is just an educated guess , would be to reduce or eliminate unnecessary variables , keep things as simple as possible without reducing complexity , and to eliminate grinding behavior ?
It 's both not like Crawl ( in that it 's not even a roguelike technically ) and it is like Crawl ( in that there are tradeoffs to a lot of player decisions ) .
And Crawl is just generally inspiring too , its elements come together very well .
RJ : Yep .
DCSS took EVERYTHING and made it a meaningful decision , and I wanted that to carry through to Desktop Dungeons .
I ended up taking that idea to the extent that the very act of dungeon exploration became its own resource , and every monster encounter , movement , spell cast and item pickup could tip the balance subtly , yet significantly .
All of the game 's elements did their best to interact with one another in as many ways as possible .
I reckon it's far from perfect in this sense , but I like to think that I gave it a jolly good shot .
Crawl is astounding , not least because it was n't afraid to knock convention .
I mean , it takes real guts to develop a game to rival a dinosaur like Nethack while explicitly disagreeing with parts of its design
JH : I think you did an excellent job at that .
Probably Desktop Dungeons does it a little better , in fact , than Crawl , because it 's a lot more , um , " elemental " is the word I think I 'll use .
Because there are fewer variables and it's a " simpler " game , the parts that are there take on greater import .
RJ : Elemental is a cool word . :P
I was also inspired by researching and writing about game design minimalism , and the idea of distilling a genre as great and expansive as a Roguelike to its core -- and almost puzzle - like -- elements , was simultaneously daunting and ... well , juicy !
JH : There are a few other games that Desktop Dungeons reminds me of , that take those limited elements and give them profound , and sometimes unexpected , uses .
MULE is like that , and Rampart , and , not coincidentally , Rogue .
It seems to have worked out very well , although I have to admit being a little intrigued with the idea of where you could go with it from here .
RJ : The original rogue probably did it best in a lot of ways .
It did n't need any fluff to justify its own existence .
Platforms and Implementation
RJ : With regards to where it goes from here :
I 'm currently working for a South African indie studio , QCF Design , and the crew there have some pretty big plans lined up for a good and proper version of Desktop Dungeons with a nicer name , nicer graphics and more polished design in general .
You know , the sort of stuff that people may actually be willing to pay for .
We have n't decided on a final platform just yet , though we have some ideas .
At the same time , I 'll be looking to improve the freeware version that 's currently being developed in Game Maker .
JH : I think if you took the game just as it is and put it on the iPhone you might find yourself with a hit .
And it seems to me like the game is really made for the iPhone interface .
RJ : iPhone is one possibility !
We 're already keen to see how 100 Rogues does on release .
JH : ( Nice plug for 100 Rogues .
I 'm sure Keith Burgun wo n't mind at all , heh . )
JH : Ah !
I spot a segue opportunity !
( ahem )
Would you like to tell us about how Desktop Dungeons is implemented ?
The language you use to develop ?
Or whatever the heck Game Maker is ?
Did you find it to be limiting ?
RJ : Ahhh. well , a lot of people will probably know about Game Maker already .
It 's quite popular nowadays , and is the driving force behind some really great contemporary indie projects including Derek Yu's Spelunky ( which , lo and behold , is also a tribute to roguelikes ! ) .
Basically , it 's a rapid game creation framework which utilises a drag - n - drop system backed up by code scripting and the like .
It 's actually remarkably flexible for an " easy game creation " tool , especially since it follows good programming practice at its heart .
JH : It does seem to be used for more and more things lately .
RJ : It 's an object - oriented , event - driven environment that anybody experienced with code should be able to recognize .
RJ : I 've been using Game Maker almost exclusively for several years now : it allows me to focus on the design of a game instead of its technical implementation , which is a bit of a godsend after hacking through years of Pascal , Java and C ++.
In my opinion , a lot of developers focus on art and programming without recognizing good design as a skill of its own .
Design Process , Commercial Viability and Promotion
JH : Here 's some more questions for you :
How did you design it ?
All at once , or did it sort of accrue like a snowball over time ?
And do you have a final goal in sight , or at least in mind ?
RJ : I have a personal rule that I like to follow , and encourage everybody I know to follow : if you sit down with a game design and fail to make something fun , engaging and relatively " complete " within a week , it 's not an idea worth pursuing .
My original version of Desktop Dungeons was made in about six days , and it was a far cry from what it is even now ( still at a tentative version 0.051 ) , but it was something that could stand up on its own legs and provide people with some fun .
I did n't have any plans beyond , say , another version or two before I moved on to another project , but people kinda got excited about it rather quickly .
So I guess I just shrugged my shoulders and kept going :P
JH : So you have a pretty good idea where to go from here ?
RJ : Definitely .
I want to do more work on the freeware to incorporate all of the exciting ideas that began forming after the game started garnering some popularity .
It sort of doubles as further service to the people who are enjoying it right now , and an excellent testing ground for concepts that could make its commercially worthy successor .
As of the beginning of April , we 'll also be starting work full - time on the main DD project .
JH : Although for various reasons I like open source and freeware games ( after all , most roguelikes fall into that category ) , I think there is an opportunity to make a go of this one commercially .
Good luck with it !
RJ : Thanks a bunch !
I hope that people continue to enjoy the game . :)
JH : When you say " full time , " then , you 're still working on the freeware version " part time " so to speak , right ?
RJ : Yeah , actually , when I mention " full time " on DD , I mean that we 'll not be bogged down with the mobile advergame projects that QCF has been adopting to build up capital with .
They 're not the most inspiring jobs , but they put food on the proverbial table and allow us to start self - funding projects like DD for reasonable durations
JH : It sounds like a good strategy for getting it off the ground .
RJ : It 's solid , but we 're still kinda poor in the bigger scheme of things :P
Such is the lot of an indie , I 'd reckon .
JH : Hey , the indie field is home to , by far , the most interesting game development AND game projects right now .
Of course I may be a little biased , as most roguelikes would be considered to be " indie " by some measure .
RJ : Definitely interesting .
But when I mention " poor " , I 'm talking about it in a very literal , financial sense . ;) QCF
Design are small fish , even in the indie pond .
JH : If you have a company name , then you 're already at least half up the ladder .
Many indie developers are just one or two people .
2D Boy is two guys .
Well , such is my opinion , heh .
RJ : A fair point .
And that 's not to say that QCF wo n't do its gosh - darn best and whatnot !
I just think it 's important to keep things in perspective .
JH : Let 's talk for a moment about the fan community around the game , and the word - of - mouth publicity .
When did Desktop Dungeons get it 's big " break " publicity - wise ?
Was it a mention on a specific blog ?
Or did it just sort of grow , spreading from person to person .
I was a little surprised when two completely unrelated people mentioned the game to me within a couple of days of each other !
RJ : For quite a few of my recent projects ( and other projects found within the Game .
Dev community ) , I 'd have to give credit to the IndieGames blog for that initial kick of popularity .
That site is run by a pretty swell crew , and I tip my hat to those folks .
Too many people treat gaming journalists with a certain degree of derision while forgetting just how important a role they play in the industry .
It 's what helps silly little people like me get their games out to a broader populace .
It 's what allows cool stuff like interviews to take place .
I can also give credit to some indie community folks I know , and in particular the tireless efforts of one DukeOFPrunes .
He knows who he is , and he totally kicks ass .
DukeOFPrunes is one of the Game .
Dev community members .
He 's an all - round cool guy :P
JH : ( The Management appreciates the compliment , regarding " cool stuff " )
RJ : Funnily , though , I think that I was the weakest link in my own marketing chain .
The word - of - mouth on this game really took a life of its own , and despite the fact that I 've written about game marketing myself from time to time , I absolutely failed to take any action of my own on this thing .
The fact that I 've enjoyed this much attention is nothing short of amazing .
I think it 's the sort of story that would make the folks at Wolfire slap me .
JH : It is gratifying to see .
A lot of indie developers sort of languish in obscurity , but every so often one goes nova .
RJ : But yeah , I really do n't deserve this much attention for the game .
I 've broken every rule in the marketing book :P
Difficulty And Humor
JH : That 's most of the general things .
Would you like to take a few minutes now to discuss some elements of the design ?
Or would you consider that as being something of a spoiler ?
RJ : There was a matter about the difficulty .
( JH 's note :
The original question was an aside halfway back in the interview and was edited out . )
JH : Ah , by all means go ahead .
RJ : The game is hard by necessity , yes , though I feel the difficulty helps make the experience more REWARDING rather than less challenging .
It boils down to the matter of meaningful decisions .
One way of making a decision meaningful is to attach permanence , as most roguelikes would do .
You make a choice , and you can't undo it , so make it a wise one .
JH : Right .
This is related to permadeath .
RJ : However , a decision 's impact is also affected by the impact of its consequences , and in a difficult game this can mean the difference between a narrow escape and said horrible perma-death .
If roguelikes ( and by loose extension , DD ) were any easier , this impact would be lost , because there would be comparatively little consequence for your decisions .
An easy game slaps you on the wrist and gives you a gold medal instead of a platinum one , so to speak .
Not really something that can scare , motivate or involve a player .
When there 's more at stake , it 's more emotionally engaging
JH : It does seem that there are a lot of games out there that nearly fall over themselves to tell the player what a great job he 's doing .
RJ : I doubt that anybody really likes steamrolling a game .
Oh ho no .
they like to win by that proverbial " one click " ...
JH : A button marked " Win the game . "
RJ : ... and in the long term , that builds up a false sense of achievement .
It 's great once in a while , and I have no problem with playing easy games .
But I also know how satisfying overcoming a genuine challenge can be .
In DD , the difference between a new player and a veteran becomes obvious .
Although there 's a reasonable element of luck involved , some parts of the game are highly deterministic and the average win rate of a vet is significantly higher than that of a beginner .
It 's all about the advanced tricks and tactics that emerge from creative application of the rules .
I 'd like to stress that there 's nothing wrong with easy games .
They 're pretty fun too .
It 's just that there 's a time and a place for those , and not every game has to roll over and let you scratch its belly
JH : One such trick is how , when you gain a level , your health and magic get refilled .
That makes monsters themselves into a resource .
RJ : Exactly , it 's a sneaky tactic whose value is n't immediately understood , but becomes an indispensable part of play once figured out .
JH : Everything in Desktop Dungeons is a resource in * some * way .
Even , for one of the classes , those bloodstains left on the ground .
I was rather surprised to see that .
RJ : Yep , that 's DD 's interpretation of Dungeon Crawl 's idea that an enemy 's dead body can be put to good use !
There 's actually a few nods to DCSS in DD which a savvy player may just pick up .
Heck , I wanna find a way to throw Sigmund into the mix at some point .
Sigmund would totally rock .
JH : Sigmund would be awesome .
For the uninitiated , Sigmund is a deadly early unique opponent in Dungeon Crawl .
He 's sort of the game 's mascot .
RJ : I also make a few cheeky indie references here and there related to other games .
JH : Some ( boring ) players may disagree with me , but I think joke monsters are generally awesome .
I still get a kick out of Desktop Dungeons ' Goo Balls .
It had me looking around for a cameo by the Sign Painter .
RJ : The goo balls and the meat men are , in some ways , some of my favourite monsters , simply due to their presence being completely tongue - in - cheek .
Funnily enough , a lot of people lose the goo reference .
Because while the description suggests World of Goo , it 's actually drawn like the Gish tarball .
Dunno why I did that .
JH : The name of the Goo Ball boss makes the connection obvious though , as does the boss intro message .
One of my favorite things about roguelikes ( and Desktop Dungeons too , which I 'm including here as a kind of honorary roguelike ) is how they do n't take themselves too seriously .
RJ : I truly appreciate that sentiment .
:P
Desktop Dungeons started out not taking itself seriously , and I want it to stay that way even if it starts making money and all that other boring stuff .
Heck , our mascot is a damn goat !
Goats are the antithesis of serious business .
JH : Goats are awesome .
Goats are beyond awesome .
RJ : They also make for great fan art .
JH : Goat Bosses , however , are serious business .
Ouch .
RJ : Very nasty for warriors to run into .
JH : Roguelike games could stand to have more goats in them .
RJ : If I recall correctly , actually , the goat was loosely inspired by Crawl 's presence of those Yaks of bloody doom and death .
Half of my characters wound up getting killed by yaks .
It was rather embarrassing .
JH : The descriptions of yaks in that game are great .
" The common dungeon yak . "
RJ : Like that time my character starved to death while levitating over some food .
JH : The next adventure finds a skeleton floating in the air , upside down , its bony arm outstretched towards a food ration on the ground .
RJ : Those descriptions are great , but nothing beats the messages from your personal Orc army when worshipping Beogh .
JH : Never gonna give you up !
Never gonna let you down !
RJ : That was the best part !
JH : It 's like shepherding a horde of preschoolers through the dungeon !
RJ : Especially since some of them take the time to smile and wave at you when you 're fighting off legions of monsters .
Kinda like , " Hey !
Hi !
How goes it , buddy ? :D "
JH : Eventually one of them graduates to First Grade and gains the ability to summon demons .
RJ : You know , that was the great thing about the orc army .
You 'd form attachments .
Especially if you 've carried one guy all the way from lowly orc to Warlord .
Epic stuff .
JH : Yeah , it is a little saddening when one of your named guys kicks the bucket .
Especially if it 's a warlord .
Then it 's doubly sad .
Links Relating To The Developer
RJ : Oh , by the way , you wanted some links ?

But when Miramax jumped ship and put the film in turnaround , Duffy 's overnight success soon starts to crash and burn .

Earth Day : Participating in the Green Economy
When we think about Earth Day , we often consider what we can do for the planet .
This is n’t a bad thing , and there are many relatively painless ways to go green , helping the earth .
But Earth
Day does n’t have to be all you figuring out how to help the planet .
Going green can be good for your financial situation as well – if you are prepared to participate in the green economy .
There is speculation that a new green economy is coming .
This economy will be based around industries that provide green friendly and sustainable products .
We have already seen signs of its emergence to this point , but in the next 10 years , the green economy is expected to really take off .
If you want to participate in the green economy – and use it to improve your personal economy – there are opportunities available .
Looking for Green Jobs
If you are looking for a job in the green economy , there are up and coming careers in the following areas :
Environmental Law
Government Planning ( Land Use )
Waste Management and Recycling
Green and Renewable Energy Development
Green Construction
E : The Environmental Magazine offers a look at hot jobs in the areas of eco-tourism , complementary care ( alternative medicine combined with traditional Western medicine ) , green technology ( IT ) , eco-educators , and green consulting ( for companies ) .
Indeed , if you have skills in a particular area , you might be able to find a job in the green economy .
You can even look at some of the job requirements for different green jobs , and then get a little education to help you develop skills that are marketable in a green economy .
Some jobs sites that offer green job listings include :
Investing in Green Companies
Another way that you can participate in the green economy is to invest in companies that are related to the environment , renewable energy or that are environmentally friendly .
Google ( GOOG ) routinely makes the list of sustainable companies , even though it is n’t directly involved in producing green products .
Starbucks ( SBUX ) also makes such lists , for its support of organically grown coffee and fair trade .
You can also engage in more direct involvement when you invest in renewable energy companies like First Solar ( FSLR ) .
There are mutual funds , index funds and ETFs that allow you to invest in a variety of green companies at once .
There are funds devoted clean energy , alternative energy , sustainable companies and even green real estate .
You can look for socially responsible funds , individual stocks and more when you look for the right opportunities .
If you get in now , before the green economy really heats up , there is a chance that you could see large gains in the coming years .
Of course , due to the nature of the market , and the fact that many green investments are new and untested , there is also the risk of loss .
If you back a company that ultimately fails , you could find yourself in trouble .
The opportunities are there .
Being green can not only help Earth ; if you look for the right chances , you can participate in the green economy and help the planet while you make your own green .

* Portugal to boost income tax , taxes on large companies
* VAT hike , salary cuts for public managers , politicians
* Main opposition party vows support for measures
( Adds opposition party ’s support , union statement )
By Sergio Goncalves
LISBON , May 13 ( Reuters ) - Portugal will raise taxes and cut wages of top public servants , it said on Thursday , following on the heels of similar austerity moves in Spain and a $ 1 trillion European safety net meant to reassure rattled credit markets .
Portugal now plans to cut its 2011 fiscal gap by two percentage points from its earlier target to 4.6 percent of GDP , worth about 2 billion euros according to a source .
Prime Minister Jose Socrates said Portugal would impose extraordinary income taxes of up to 1.5 percent , hike value - added tax by 1 percentage point to 21 percent and raise a 2.5 percent tax on large companies ’ profits .
The government will also cut the salaries of top - level public sector workers and politicians by 5 percent in an effort to cut the 2010 budget deficit to 7.3 percent of GDP , lower than the 8.3 percent target , or 14 billion euros , budgeted for 2010 .
The measures will be in force until the end of 2011 .
( For a FACTBOX on measures , see : [ ID : nLDE64C1KZ ] )
“ I ask all my compatriots for us to make this effort to defend the country , to defend the euro and Europe , ” Socrates , a Socialist , told a news briefing following a cabinet meeting to approve the measures , which were agreed with the opposition PSD party in order to secure support for the moves in parliament .
Pedro Passos Coelho , the leader of the largest opposition party , the centre - right Social Democrats ( PSD ) said his party will support the strategy in parliament .
“ What we are committing ourselves to is to stabilise the economic situation and to give our vote so that the measures that were approved today at the cabinet meeting are approved in parliament , ” he told reporters .
He added that it was important that the announced tax hikes were temporary , but spending cuts will be permanent and said his party would closely monitor the government ’s execution of the programme in the public sector .
The Socialists need the support of the opposition to pass bills in parliament .
Together , the two parties have more than two - thirds of parliament seats .
The Socialists can pass any bill even with PSD ’s abstention .
LESS VOLATILE
Portugal ’s moves topped a dramatic week for the euro zone , starting with a $ 1 trillion package announced by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund to prop up weaker euro zone states .
The Portuguese government has said it does not need to resort to the lending mechanism .
On Wednesday , Spain announced 15 billion euros worth of cuts , including a 5 - percent wage cut for most public employees , and a 15 - percent cut for higher paid workers .
[ ID: nLDE64B0F9 ]
Diego Iscaro , an economist at IHS Global Insight in London , said the measures “ should help to restore markets ’ confidence in Portugal ’s ability to deal with its deteriorating public finances ” , but added that higher taxes had a sting in the tail .
“ The risk I see is that these austerity measures will weigh on economic activity - which was seen as sluggish anyway - thus making fiscal consolidation more difficult . ”
Giada Giani , an economist at Citi , said in a research note that “ the overall fiscal effort is now quite large , although still well below that of Greece or Ireland ” .
But she added : “ Additional fiscal consolidation is likely to become necessary in the next few years and we reckon the country risk premium is likely to remain elevated . ”
Debt - stricken Greece has also had to implement severe additional austerity measures after resorting to a 110 billion euro bailout package from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund earlier in May .
Unlike Greece , where the measures have been met with often violent protests , analysts say Portugal is less prone to social unrest and expect the measures to stir less trouble .
“ There will be some social polarisation ...
But the levels of social conflict in Portugal are relatively low , ” said political scientist Antonio Costa Pinto .
The UGT umbrella union , Portugal ’s second - biggest , issued a statement on Thursday saying the measures “ worsen the social situation , growth and employment ” , but stopped short of vowing any concrete protests .
Portuguese bond spreads were calm on Thursday at around 175 basis points over German bunds , but less than half last Friday ’s levels , which then hit euro lifetime record on market jitters about peripheral euro zone countries ’ creditworthiness .

David Kumaritashvili , the father of Georgian luge competitor Nodar Kumaritashvili , mourns during a funeral at his home in Bakuriani , some 160 km ( 100 miles ) west of Tbilisi , February 20 , 2010 .
REUTERS / David Mdzinarishvili
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Olympic officials have started studying an International Luge Federation ( FIL ) report into the death of Georgian athlete Nodar Kumaritashvili , who was killed during a training run at the Vancouver Olympics .
“ We have received the report ( from the FIL ) this morning and are looking into the findings , ” an IOC official told Reuters on Monday .
The official did not give any details on the content of the FIL ’s final report or what were identified as the reasons for the fatal crash , the first in the sport since 1975 .
“ We will not be making a full response until the report is published next Monday , ” the official said .
Kumaritashvili slammed into an exposed steel pillar during his last training run at the Whistler Sliding Center on February 12 , hours before the Games ’ opening ceremony .
An initial FIL report a day after the crash put the blame on human error by the 21 - year - old and the Olympic competitions went ahead , although the starting spot was lowered to reduce the speed of the fast track and a wall was erected to cover the pillars .
The IOC has said it had a moral responsibility but not a legal one , with the federation and organizers responsible for the construction of the track and the staging of competitions .
A third - grader in a small Fort Bend school district has received a week - long suspension because of a rogue Jolly Rancher consumed at lunch , KHOU reported .
The parents are upset , and the incident seems to stem from confusion over state nutrition guidelines .
We 're sure it will all get settled .
But our question is -- what the hell is up with Jolly Ranchers and despicable criminal acts ?
Last month we reported on someone trying to smuggle Meth , pot , Ecstasy -- and Jolly Ranchers -- into a state prison .
A TDCJ spokeswoman told us a Death Row inmate once requested Jolly Ranchers as a last meal .
Is there something we do n't know about Jolly Ranchers ?
Besides that they suck , for the most part ?
1 . They 're made in CANADA , but America .
Sure , you thought they were American .
And they were for a long time ; they originally were made in Colorado .
But after the company was sold a number of times ( it 's now owned by Hershey ) , the manufacturing is done in that alien country to the north , and the candies are apparently smuggled across the border by coyotes .
( Although Wiki could be wrong ; this seems to indicate the plant up north is closed .
It 's a mystery , just like Jolly Ranchers themselves . )
2 . The official " serving size " is three pieces .
Leighann Adair , the outlaw who had the contraband in Fort Bend , only possessed one piece .
The feds say a full serving of Jolly Ranchers consists of three pieces .
That will give you 70 wholesome calories and 10 milligrams of sodium .
3. Flavors include " Blue Raspberry . "
Nothing that includes such a monstrosity should be trusted .
We can only hope authorities all over Texas continue with their recent campaign of confiscating this gateway drug .
A radiologist studies mammograms American scientists say they have developed a vaccine which has prevented breast cancer from developing in mice .
The researchers - whose findings are published in the journal , Nature Medicine - are now planning to conduct trials of the drug in humans .
But they warn that it could be some years before the vaccine is widely available .
The immunologist who led the research says the vaccine targets a protein found in most breast tumours .
Vincent Tuohy , from the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute , said : " We believe that this vaccine will someday be used to prevent breast cancer in adult women in the same way that vaccines have prevented many childhood diseases .
Unique challenge " If it works in humans the way it works in mice , this will be monumental .
We could eliminate breast cancer . "
In the study , genetically cancer - prone mice were vaccinated - half with a vaccine containing á- lactalbumin and half with a vaccine that did not contain the antigen .
None of the mice vaccinated with á- lactalbumin developed breast cancer , while all of the other mice did .
The US has approved two cancer - prevention vaccines , one against cervical cancer and one against liver cancer .
However , these vaccines target viruses - the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) and the Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) - not cancer formation itself .
We look forward to seeing the results of large - scale clinical trials to find out if this vaccine would be safe
Caitlin Palframan , Breakthrough Breast Cancer
In terms of developing a preventive vaccine , cancer presents problems not posed by viruses - while viruses are recognised as foreign invaders by the immune system , cancer is not .
Cancer is an over - development of the body 's own cells .
Trying to vaccinate against this cell over - growth would effectively be vaccinating against the recipient 's own body , destroying healthy tissue .
Caitlin Palframan , of charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer , said : " This research could have important implications for how we might prevent breast cancer in the future .
" However , this is an early stage study , and we look forward to seeing the results of large - scale clinical trials to find out if this vaccine would be safe and effective in humans . "
She added there were already steps women could take to reduce the risk of breast cancer , including reducing alcohol consumption , maintaining a healthy weight and taking regular exercise .
Cancer Research UK 's professor of oncology , Robert Hawkins , said : " This very early study describes an interesting approach to the prevention of breast cancer .
" It will be several years before this vaccine can be tested fully to assess its safety and effectiveness as a way to stop the disease developing in women . "
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK , affecting more than 45,500 women every year .

If you ’ve been following along , you ’re probably aware that I collect cookbooks .
Specifically , cookbooks created by New England civic organizations between 1950 and 1980 for fundraising purposes .
With yard sale season in full swing , I find myself solvent with new recipe ideas , among them one I found in this vandalized and water - damaged collection .
The picture on the cover somewhat suggests the architecture of Calvary Baptist Church in Easthampton , but I bought the book in Millbury and it has no date ( I ’ve never been to that Church , I just tried to do some due diligence in my googling ) .
Nevertheless , it * does * include a chocolate cake recipe with a secret ingredient : ice cream .
And hey , no cake flour or fancy measuring required , because we ’re using cake mix .
I let my ice cream soften by scooping it up into small chunks and letting it sit a few minutes .
At teaspoon size , your mixer will take care of any further softening required right quick .
The recipe calls for greasing & flouring a tube pan .
Since I ’m making chocolate cake , I dusted with cocoa powder instead of flour so my cake wo n’t look dusty .
In fact you can do this with any chocolate cake , with the added bonus of a little extra kick of chocolate , and hey , that ’s the name of the game , right ?
After 4 minutes of beating , the batter kinda just looks like . . . well , melted ice cream .
This is one of those situations where a process shot gives a much clearer picture of the character of the dish than the final picture can .
Connie Aubuchon , the contributor of this recipe , assures that the cake is “ very moist , rich and chocolatey . ”
She was right .
This is about as moist as a cake gets without being outright wet , and it even has this spongy noise as you cut into it .
In short , it is the most delicious chocolate cake you ever had .
I wanted to see just how chocolatey I could make this , so I stayed true and made a chocolate cake mix with chocolate ice cream .
But I was * thisclose * to trying chocolate cake with mint or ginger ice cream , and other combos that come immediately to mind are vanilla mix with mango ice cream , yellow cake mix with strawberry ice cream , and funfetti with pretty much any ice cream .
What combo would you make ?
Chocolate Ice Cream Cake ( but not like you think )
with thanks to Connie Aubuchon
1 box chocolate cake mix ( or any other flavour )
1 pint chocolate ice cream , softened ( again , any other flavour )
3 eggs
1 c water
Preheat oven to 350o .
Grease a tube or bundt pan , then dust with cocoa powder .
Beat all ingredients together for 4 minutes , pour into pan and bake 45 minutes .
Serve with a dusting of confectioner ’s sugar , a thin icing , whipped cream or the frosting of your choice .

Pirelli is on the verge of being confirmed as Formula 1's official tyre supplier , AUTOSPORT has learned , as teams close in on signing a deal with the Italian company .
Following weeks of discussions between teams about their preferred route for 2011 , the last days have been spent evaluating a straight head - to - head choice between Michelin and Pirelli .
And after a number of conference calls involving members of the Formula One Teams ' Association ( FOTA ) , it is understood that Pirelli has emerged as the preferred option for next year .
Although a final contract has not yet been agreed - with commercial terms and confirmation from the FIA and Formula One Management still needed to be settled - it is understood the situation is far enough agreed for an announcement to be made as early as this weekend .
Pirelli chairman Marco Tronchetti Provera told Gazzetta dello Sport : " We 'll see , there is this hypothesis .
By Friday we should know something . "
The confirmation of Pirelli will at least ensure teams can begin designing their 2011 cars with some knowledge of what tyres they will be running , as well as give Pirelli the green light to start development of F1 rubber .
As part of the deal with the teams , Pirelli will supply 13 - inch tyres for at least the next two years , and it is likely it will receive guarantees that there will be no tyre war until 2013 at the earliest .
Pirelli's racing manager Mario Isola told AUTOSPORT earlier this month that he was confident about his company 's bid - even though it has not been involved in F1 since 1991 .
" I think that Pirelli has a very big tradition in motorsport , " he said .
" We have been involved in motorsport for more than 100 years .
In all our story , we showed that we have the technical ability to build motorsport tyres - also in the past with F1 , with WRC recently as the sole supplier contract .
" In that case , it was not easy because there were some teams that had never used our tyres , they started in an unknown situation so we showed that we were able to build and develop a tyre that was consistent and reliable .
I think the teams recognise that we have the ability to do it . "
Just in case you are worried that all those gold coins you have buried in your back yard will never be accepted as ( il ) legal tender , here comes Abu Dhabi with a gold ATM machine , making gold - based " currency " transactions one step closer .
This is a harbinger of things to come , as people increasingly demand to transact in non-daily violatable pieces of paper .
This is also the nightmare scenario for all central banks , which have to be seeing developments in the precious metal space , and finally realizing that in the absence of prudent monetary policy , the people , as we noted yesterday , will take ( non-dilutable ) matters into their own hands .
The Fed dilemma : recognition that the fiat " race to the bottom " has to be contained ( unlikely ) or confiscation of precious metals ( see Roosevelt executive order 6102 ) .

Details of a dream safari holiday enjoyed by the Van Assouw family before the fatal plane crash that killed all 103 passengers except nine - year - old Ruben van Assouw emerged today in his father 's travel blog .
Ruben is recovering in hospital , surrounded by flowers with a stuffed orange Tigger under his arm , not knowing his parents and brother died in the disaster on Wednesday as the family returned to the Netherlands from South Africa .
Ruben has spoken briefly to his aunt and uncle , who flew to his bedside after he was found , still strapped to his seat , semiconscious and bleeding from wounds to his legs , about half a mile from the tail section of the Afriqiyah Airways Airbus 330-200 which came down short of the runway in Tripoli , the Libyan capital .
" He 's awake .
He 's talking .
He is listening , " a Dutch foreign ministry official , Ed Kronenburg , told Associated Press after visiting the boy .
" Of course he also sleeps quite a lot because he got anaesthesia and is still a bit dizzy . "
Ruben and his 11 - year - old brother , Enzo , had travelled with their parents , Trudy and Patrick , who were celebrating their 12 - and - a - half - year wedding anniversary , a Dutch tradition .
Patrick van Assouw , 40 , set up his blog before the family holiday began .
" The boys have been counting the days and minutes and can't wait .
Just three more nights ' sleep , boys ! , " he wrote in an entry dated 23 April .
The trip began on a rough note .
Ruben was sick on the plane to South Africa , and on the first day of the safari he " puked the car full " , Patrick wrote on his blog .
But the family soon made their way through South Africa , across the border into Swaziland , and finally into the mountainous nation of Lesotho before they turned for home .
" We ran into a very large number of impalas , which we nicknamed deers , " Patrick wrote .
" Enzo 's second find was the elephant .
Also saw buffalo , gnu , fox , zebra , more deer , ostrich , a lot of birds , turtle , giraffe , apes , boar , more deer . "
The family also encountered two rhinoceroses and the day before they boarded the ill - fated return flight Patrick wrote that they had seen a hippopotamus .
After changing a flat tyre at a desolate spot near Sani Pass , which connects South Africa and Lesotho , the family stood on a remote bluff overlooking a stunning panorama of Lesotho .
It was 9 May , the final day of the safari .
" Beautiful Mother 's Day gift , " Patrick wrote in his final entry .
Ruben is said to be recovering well after four and a half hours of surgery to repair multiple fractures to his legs .
Dutch officials said he could be flown back to the Netherlands this weekend .
A bouquet of white flowers wrapped in pink tissue was propped against the door of the Van Assouw 's home in Tilburg , south of Amsterdam .
At the crash site , the debris included a romance novel , Zoete Tranen – or Sweet Tears – open at page 225 , a charred boot , a black high - heeled shoe and a motorcycle jacket with Marlboro and Ferrari logos .
Dutch officials helping to identify victims of the crash say 70 of their citizens are among the dead .
Two Britons with dual nationality are known to have died .
One was Nigel Peter , a senior manager with AirQuarius Aviation , a Johannesburg - based charter company , who was married with one son .
The other has not been identified .
A third UK casualty , Priscilla Collick , a 52 - year - old mother of two from Swansea who had lived in Britain for nearly 30 years , is reported to have been a South African national .
In my 28 years of public service , I have made a lot of tough calls .
But with a federal government unwilling to secure our border for years and years , Arizona is left with little choice .
Imagine a sporting event in which rules have been agreed to for 70 years , but the umpires refuse to enforce those rules .
It makes no sense .
Although I recognize that Arizona Senate Bill 1070 , as amended , is not the entire solution to our illegal immigration problem in Arizona , most people are united in the hope that it will finally inspire the politicians in Washington , D.C. , to stop talking and to start action now .
By now , sports fans everywhere have heard something about the passage of Senate Bill 1070 , a measure I signed into law .
It has resulted in protests outside ballparks hosting our Arizona Diamondbacks and has led to calls on Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig to strip the City of Phoenix 's opportunity to host baseball 's Midsummer Classic in July 2011 .
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer took in the Diamondbacks - Phillies game a couple of days after she signed SB 1070 into law .

Urging Major League Baseball to take away next year 's All - Star Game from Phoenix is the wrong play .
In Arizona , both proponents and opponents of Senate Bill 1070 have stated that economic boycotts are an inappropriate and misguided response to an issue that is clearly worthy of proper public debate and discourse .
Put simply , history shows that boycotts backfire and harm innocent people .
Boycotts are just more politics and manipulation by out - of - state interests .
As a border state , Arizona has already paid a heavy price for the federal government 's failure -- hundreds of millions , if not billions , of dollars in unreimbursed costs -- and its citizens should not be punished further .
It is critically important that all Americans understand the impetus for this new law and have a clear understanding of the law itself .
Our neighbor to the south , Mexico , is in a massive battle with well - organized drug cartels .
Because of Washington 's failure to secure our southern border , Arizona has become the superhighway of illegal drug and human smuggling activity .
In December 2008 , the U.S. Justice Department said that Mexican gangs are the " biggest organized crime threat to the United States . "
In 2009 , Phoenix had 316 kidnapping cases , turning the city into our nation 's kidnapping capital .
Almost all of the persons kidnapped were illegal immigrants or linked to the drug trade .
Essentially , our border leaks like a team with a last - place defense .
The very same week that I signed the new law , a major drug ring was broken up and Mexican cartel operatives suspected of running 40,000 pounds of marijuana through southern Arizona were indicted .
While drug smuggling is the principal cause of our massive border - violence problem , many of the same criminal organizations also smuggle people .
Busts of drop houses , where illegal immigrants are often held for ransom or otherwise severely abused , are not uncommon occurrences in Arizona neighborhoods .
Today , Arizona has approximately 6,000 prison inmates who are foreign nationals , representing a cost to our state of roughly $ 150 million per year .
Arizona taxpayers are paying for a vast majority of these incarceration expenses because the federal government refuses to pay what it owes .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , as governor of Arizona , sent numerous requests to the federal government to pay for these prisoners -- only to be given the same answer she and President Barack Obama are now giving Arizona :
They will not pay the bill .

Emacs & the birth of the GPL
by Richard Hillesley
" Do n't get set into one form , adapt it and build your own , and let it grow , be like Emacs .
Empty your mind , be formless , shapeless - like Emacs .
If you put Emacs in a cup it becomes the cup , if you put into a bottle it becomes the bottle .
You put Emacs into a teapot it becomes the teapot .
Now , Emacs can flow or it can crash .
Be Emacs , my friend " - a hacker koan found on the Emacs wiki
Emacs is not so much a text editor , more a way of life - an " extensible , customisable self - documenting real time display editor " with thousands of ready made extensions that take you way beyond its original remit as a text editor , some of which can be found at the Emacs wiki or on the Emacs Lisp list .
You can spend the whole of your keyboard life inside Emacs and many programmers do .
You can read your mail , read the news , write and debug your code , send it out to the world , play a game or browse the web ( less so now than once you could ) , and never leave the slightly alien ( to those brought up on a click and point interface ) and strangely comfortable world of Emacs .
For many the old aphorism that " Emacs is my operating system , and Linux its device driver " still holds true .
Extensibility is everything
Emacs opening display Emacs has become emblematic of Lisp , Unix and free software , but was originally written by Richard Stallman , with contributions from Guy Steele , Dave Moon , Richard Greenblatt and Charles Frankston , as an extension to the TECO editor on MIT 's AI Lab Incompatible Timesharing System ( ITS ) which ran on PDP - 6 and PDP - 10 machines , somewhere around 1974 .
The extensibility which is everything to Emacs would seem to run counter to the file - based modular approach of Unix where every program has a unique task and every task has a unique program , and probably gave rise to the vi programmers ' retort that " Emacs is n't a bad operating system .
It just lacks a good text editor . "
As Stallman tells it :
" The original Emacs did not have Lisp in it .
The lower level language , the non-interpreted language — was PDP - 10 Assembler .
The interpreter we wrote in that actually was n't written for Emacs , it was written for TECO .
It was our text editor , and was an extremely ugly programming language , as ugly as could possibly be . "
GNU Emacs was written in C , and the use of the Lisp interpreter that became Emacs Lisp evolved from Bernie Greenberg 's use of Maclisp in Multics Emacs , and James Gosling 's MockLisp extensions to Gosling Emacs .
Emacs was a breakthrough in the history of text editors and its novelty was that it gave the programmer the ability to add his or her extensions , macros , commands and instructions dynamically , transforming the text editor into an extremely flexible and expressive framework for programmers .
Extensibility lay at the heart of Emacs - and the idea that any programmer could take a macro created by another programmer and extend it to create new functionality lay at the heart of the philosophy of free software as it evolved during the following years .
The commands of Emacs are written in the same language as the programmer extensions , Emacs Lisp , and the code is viewable by the programmer , so a programmer can remodel the commands to suit his or her own needs , and Emacs can be remade on the fly .
Eyes on stalks
Stallman 's original hack on TECO was to make the screen commands redefinable , and " People would pass them around and improve them , making them more powerful and more general .
The collections of redefinitions gradually became system programs in their own right " until TECO became less an editor than " a programming language for writing editors . "
Emacs became legendary among programmers because of its endless extensibility , easy reconfigurability and infinite adaptability , and was soon widely used among academic and software circles .
A culture developed around Stallman 's one condition for its use :
" - that they give back all extensions they made so as to help Emacs improve .
I called this arrangement ' the Emacs commune .
As I shared , it was their duty to share ; to work with each other rather than against . "
Within this model can be seen the germ of Stallman 's later hack on copyright law , which became copyleft and the GPL , and the makings of the free software movement in the years to follow - since which time Emacs has evolved " tentacles , glow - in - the - dark eyes on stalks , tail fins , chrome bumpers , a full endocrine system , telepathy , altruism , feathers , webbed feet , radiation shielding , a nictitating membrane and valved nostrils .

MIPTV 2010 – CANNES .
New York based Jumpwire Media has announced the launch of its content monitoring system , called Torrent Tracker Reports .
“ Downloading content from the internet is a mass - market reality , ” the company claims and “ Torrent Tracker Reports reveals what content is most popular online ; acting as a market signal for all types of media . ”
Jumpwire Media ’s Deep Torrent
Tracker software provides its television clients the opportunity to use this data to better understand their global audiences and monetise their content .
Torrent Tracker Reports has been accumulating television user trend data for every TV show in the world since June 2008 .
“ Most television distribution companies see piracy as a loss instead of a gain , but we feel that piracy is a market signal that shows us where the demand is and where the opportunities are .
There are more than 50 million users on BitTorrent each day and consumers are becoming their own programmers finding the content they want to watch , when they want to watch it .
This trend is rapidly changing the TV environment and challenging how traditional broadcasters and advertisers go about capturing a greater market share , ” said Gavin McGarry , president of Jumpwire Media , in a statement .
“ By identifying key user trends including geographical locators we can signal potential new markets for programming and empower media and entertainment companies to meet the needs of their audiences . ”
North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has vowed during a visit to China to try to revive stalled nuclear disarmament talks , Beijing media said in its first confirmation of the secretive trip .
" Kim said that the DPRK [ North Korea ] will work with China to create favourable conditions for restarting the six - party talks , " Xinhua news agency reported , without saying whether he had made a firm commitment to return to dialogue .
Mr Kim 's five - day visit , which ended on Friday , was shrouded in secrecy but was widely seen as an attempt to secure aid to shore up his country 's crumbling economy .
China , which hosts the nuclear negotiations , was expected in return to press its ally to come back without preconditions to the talks which Pyongyang angrily abandoned in April 2009 .
Xinhua , reporting Mr Kim 's meeting with President Hu Jintao , said they agreed that " relevant parties " in the negotiations " should demonstrate sincerity and make positive efforts for pushing forward the six - party talks " .
Pyongyang 's official media separately confirmed that Kim had ended his visit but made no mention of the meeting with Mr Hu or nuclear issues .
" Party and state leaders and people of China accorded with utmost sincerity warm welcome and cordial hospitality [ to Kim ] , " the Korean Central News Agency ( KCNA ) said .
In a separate statement carried on KCNA , Mr Kim sent a personal message of thanks to Mr Hu , describing China as a " friendly neighbour " .
" It is my belief that the DPRK - China friendship deeply enshrined by the peoples of the two countries would grow stronger and develop generation after generation , " he said .
A month after quitting the nuclear negotiations , the hardline communist North staged its second atomic weapons test - incurring toughened UN sanctions which further damaged its economy .
It is desperate to improve living standards and ease serious food shortages - worsened by a bungled currency revaluation - in advance of a possible power handover .
Mr Kim , who suffered a stroke in August 2008 , is widely thought to be preparing for an eventual transfer of power to his youngest son .
Chinese state television broadcast footage of the Kim - Hu meeting , showing the 68 - year - old North Korean leader looking frail and elderly with thinning hair .
South Korea 's food aid to its neighbour has largely halted amid the nuclear standoff .
But the North has said it wants a lifting of UN sanctions and a US commitment to discuss a formal peace treaty before it returns to the talks grouping the two Koreas , Russia , China , Japan and the United States .
Prospects of negotiations have been further clouded by the sinking of a South Korean warship near the disputed border with the North on March 26 .
Suspicions are growing that a North Korean torpedo downed the ship with the loss of 46 lives .
South Korean and US officials say Seoul 's investigation into the sinking must be wrapped up before any moves to restart nuclear dialogue .
Koh Yu - Hwan of Seoul 's Dongguk University said the trip came at a diplomatically sensitive time .
" The resumption of talks depends on the outcome of the investigation into the sinking , " Koh told AFP .
" But I believe North Korea is saying it is ready to return to the six - party forum any time . "
China has given South Korea a detailed briefing on Kim 's trip , a Seoul official said without elaborating .
Xinhua 's report made no mention of new aid pledges , saying only that Chinese leaders promised to continue supporting North Korea economically .

I hate Tories .
Not the people who vote for them .
But the people they vote for .
I make no great claims for that as a political position .
But as an electoral category it is crucial .
For I 'm sure I 'm not alone and it's pretty much the only thing keeping Labour going right now .
It 's certainly the only thing that could get me to the polls on Thursday .
I do n't have a phobia about Tories .
That would suggest an irrational response .
I hate them for a reason .
For lots of reasons , actually .
For the miners , apartheid , Bobby Sands , Greenham Common , selling council houses , Section 28 , lining the pockets of the rich and hammering the poor – to name but a few .
I hate them because they hate people I care about .
As a young man Cameron looked out on the social carnage of pit closures and mass unemployment , looked at Margaret Thatcher 's government and thought , these are my people .
When all the debating is done , that is really all I need to know .
But it 's not rationality that drives my disdain , it 's a negative tribalism .
Tories , like Labour , exist only as a political and electoral category .
I was raised in the Labour tribe .
But over the last 15 years that tribe left me , or rather showed such disdain for me that I felt I had to leave .
They did terrible things I did not want to be associated with .
I grew to loathe them , too .
But there was lament in my loathing .
I wanted them to be better .
I thought they could be better .
I never had much time for the Liberals .
By which I mean I never gave them much thought .
I did n't want a new tribe , and somehow they never seemed tribal enough .
I wanted my old tribe back .
This isolation came with regret .
Labour left me tribeless .
The only way I could define myself electorally was by what I was not .
And I am not a Tory .
I do n't hate them because they 're rich .
I grew up among working - class people and now know a fair number of rich ones , too .
I see no more inherent moral quality among those who have little money than those who have lots .
The fact that Cameron went to Eton is irrelevant .
He had no choice in the matter .
I hate him because he supports the rich and wants people who go to Eton to enjoy even more breaks than they already have .
Philosophically this is an impotent rage .
I also hate them because for a long time they kept winning , and were able to convince more people than we could by appealing to their most base instincts .
Because they managed to change the country in a terrible way and reconfigure the political conversation so that some of the more outrageous things they did are now orthodox .
The memory of them and the prospect of them make me want to retch .
I would not dignify this as a political sentiment .
It 's a gastro - intestinal and emotional response .
But it 's electorally potent .
Because unlike others who have written on these pages I can't think of a single morally compelling reason to vote Labour .
I have resisted that call for many elections .
I can think of a few reasons one might vote Liberal Democrat – an amnesty for immigrants , proportional representation , getting rid of Trident .
Voting is always a balance between the moral and the strategic .
What do I want , what can I get and what do I feel comfortable endorsing to get it .
In the past the strategic case was weak , because there was no chance of the Tories winning and the moral case was weaker , given Labour 's record .
That 's not true this time .
Indeed the only thing that is really holding my interest at this stage : the one thing that would really make my Friday morning would be to see Cameron crushed and Osborne despondent .
To see them miss this own goal and descend into bitter recrimination .
To think that however bad things have become , they have n't got so bad that we would make that mistake again .
This may be the worst reason for voting .
But right now , after watching them all in the debates , it also feels like the only reason in much of the country ( apart from where there are good Labour and Liberal MPs ) .
These feelings are crude .
But their object is subtle .
The Tories wo n't lose by accident on Thursday .
They 'll be defeated by people making careful choices on the basis of what is going in their constituency .
Take a look at your constituency , and work it out .
I do n't think those who refuse to vote tactically are precious .
But I do think they 're mistaken .
Given the challenges of the post-election period I 'm not convinced it matters much who wins .
But for reasons that are rooted more in emotion , vengeance and resentment than political analysis , I 'm equally convinced it matters who loses .

At last we know why female argonaut octopuses have a shell , and what use they put them to .
Previously , scientists thought the females used them to keep their delicate eggs safe .
Now , by capturing argonauts and releasing them at different depths , Julian Finn and Mark Norman of Museum Victoria in Melbourne , Australia , have established that they use the shells to capture and compress air for buoyancy control .
In this picture the octopus has headed to the surface to scoop in some air with her shell .

Soon after getting hired at my current job , my boss sent me a script ( which I think was based on this article ) about Python and a certain text - to - speech module called pyTTS .
This was right after Python 2.5 had released .
Anyway , it ’s basically a nice wrapper over the win32 com module which can communicate with the Microsoft Speech API ( SAPI ) .
I wo n’t go over everything about pyTTS since that article I linked to above already does that , but I will give you a quick introduction to it .
If you go to the author ’s website you ’ll find that he ’s moved on to Screen Reading technology and has created a program called Clique .
I ’m not sure if that is written in Python or not though .
I went digging on the site to find out where you could download the software and finally found this :
http://sourceforge.net/projects/uncassist/files/
From what I can tell , he only officially support Python 2.3- 2.5 .
However , since pyTTS basically just wraps the win32 com calls to SAPI and the PyWin32 module supports Python 2.x - 3.x , I think it would be fairly easy to make pyTTS work with the newer versions .
Note :
You will need the Microsoft SAPI 5.1 redistributable , extra MS voices and PyWin32 .
Let ’s take a quick look at how we use this module :
import pyTTS tts = pyTTS.Create ( ) tts.SetVoiceByName(' MSSam ') tts. Speak ( " Hello , fellow Python programmer " )
You do n’t have to set the voice as I think the default it MSMary , but it ’s fun to do .
The Speak method accepts various flags for its second argument .
One example is pyTTS. tts_async , which puts the speaking in asynchronous mode .
You can also mess with the volume by doing this : tts .
Volume = 50 .
You can choose anywhere from 0 -100 % .
If you look at this article , it will teach you how to make pyTTS pronounce the words you feed it .
Here is how you would do most of the example above using PyWin32 :
from win32 com.client import constants import win32com.client speaker = win32com.client.Dispatch ( " SAPI.SpVoice " , constants .
SVSFlagsAsync ) speaker .
Speak ( " Hello , fellow Python programmer " )
While researching this article , I noticed that the developer (s ) behind pyTTS had also put together a cross - platform text - to - speech module called pyttsx .
I have n’t used it , but I encourage you to give it a try .
Other modules worth a look are pySpeech and this cool recipe that allows Python to recognize speech : http://www.surguy.net/articles/speechrecognition.xml
Well , this ended up being more of a survey of the cool speech - related modules in Python than about code .
Still , I hope this will prove helpful to you in your endeavors .
Candy shop owner Jose Martinez shows an official Spanish 1 Euro coin with the face of Spanish King Juan Carlos ( L ) and another one altered to look like a face of cartoon character Homer Simpson in the northern Spanish town of Avile August 8 , 2008 .
Martinez found the Homer Simpson coin in his shop 's cash register while counting the days ' transactions last week .
REUTERS / Eloy Alonso
MADRID ( Reuters ) - A one euro coin has turned up in Spain bearing the face of cartoon couch potato Homer Simpson instead of that of the country ’s king , a sweetshop owner told Reuters on Friday .
Jose Martinez was counting the cash in his till in the city of Aviles , northern Spain , when he came across the coin where Homer ’s bald head , big eyes and big nose had replaced the serious features of King Juan Carlos .
“ The coin must have been done by a professional , the work is impressive , ” he told Reuters .
The comical carver had not taken his tools to the other side of the coin displaying the map of Europe .
So far , no other coins of the hapless , beer - swilling oaf have been found in circulation .
“ I ’ve been offered 20 euros for it , ” said Martinez .

Marilyn Manson just posted a painting on his Facebook page of John Locke , one of the show ’s central characters ( played by Terry O’Quinn ) , around whom much of the show ’s final scenes will likely revolve .
You can see the painting below .
On Facebook , Manson explained that he made the painting for his bandmate Twiggy Ramirez , who may be — like millions of viewers worldwide — obsessed with Lost .
What do you think of Manson ’s piece ?

A federal judge retained her position that it is unconstitutional for Congress to prevent funding for the activist group ACORN after a government request that she reconsider .
U.S. District Judge Nina Gershon cemented her earlier decision in December and made the injunction against government intervention permanent , asking all federal agencies to spread the word that money to ACORN be allowed without delay .
ADVERTISEMENT
The judge wrote that it was “ unmistakable that Congress determined ACORN ’s guilt before defunding it . ”
Congress may investigate ACORN but cannot “ rely on the negative results of a congressional or executive report as a rationale to impose a broad , punitive funding ban on a specific , named organization . ”
The Center for Constitutional Rights had charged Congress in last year ’s case of violating the group ’s constitutional protections .
“ This is why the Constitution contains a prohibition against Congress enacting a bill of attainder – to prevent Congress from acting as judge jury and executioner , ” said Jules Lobel , a cooperating attorney with the center .
Bill Quigley , legal director for the center , was equally pleased by the outcome .
“ We are pleased with the ruling made by Judge Nina Gershon today , ” Quigley said .
“ That Congress passed a budget , signed by President Obama , days after federal judge ruled bills of attainder unconstitutional shows just how intent these lawmakers are to target this one organization while violating their right to due process and freedom of association by targeting affiliated and allied organizations , as well .
This is a rebuke of the smear tactics of the far right . ”
ACORN , or the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , describes itself as an advocate for low - income and minority home buyers and residents .

Critics of the group say it has engaged in voter registration fraud and embezzlement and has violated the tax - exempt status of some of its affiliates by engaging in partisan political activities .
The criticism turned to public outrage after reports seemed to suggest a young conservative operative named James O’Keefe filmed himself dressed as a pimp while accompanying a woman posing as a prostitute and visited a number of ACORN offices asking for advice on how to hide his “ business ” in prostitution .
Of course , it turns out the tape was edited to produce the intended outcry : a Brooklyn District Attorney ’s Office found no criminal acts were committed by the ACORN employees .

At his blog , Brad Friedman has lambasted the media for not noting that “ O’ Keefe never dressed as a pimp in the offices of ACORN . ”
Although accused of poor leadership , ACORN never merited what The Nation called “ a rightwing witch hunt ” reminiscent of a New McCarthyism .

Last week , Rush Limbaugh said the eruption of the volcano in Iceland was “ God speaking ” in response to the passage of health care reform .
But John
Hagee has a different explanation , saying it was God ’s response to the decision by Britain ’s Advertising Standards Authority that the Western Wall could not appear in tourism ads :
Television and radio evangelist Pastor John Hagee believes the recent eruption of the volcano in Iceland stems from Britain breaking God ’s covenant .
The day after Britain ’s Advertising Standards Authority said the Western Wall in Jerusalem could not be used in Israeli tourism ads in Britain because it is considered occupied territory , Hagee said , the volcano erupted , shutting down Britain ’s economy in one day .
“ That ’s coincidence , like the flood was a coincidence .
That ’s coincidence , like the Red Sea was coincidence .
That ’s coincidence , like the earthquake and the Resurrection was coincidence , ” Hagee told about 3,200 people at Lancaster County Convention Center on Thursday night as part of John Hagee Ministries ’ Rally and Prophecy Seminar .
Hagee went on to warn President Obama for his treatment of Israel , saying “ any country who tries to change [ God ’s covenant with Abraham ] will get the judgment of God .
It ’s like sticking your finger in the eye of God . ”
Peering down 148 metres from the top of the latest addition to London ’s skyline at the traffic - clogged Elephant and Castle roundabout below and its notorious neighbour , the Heygate estate , feel an unlikely location for a world first .
But next week , this new skyscraper , nicknamed “ the Razor ” , will take a crucial step towards becoming the world ’s first building with wind turbines built into its fabric .
While wind speeds in the concrete jungle at the tower ’s base would render a wind turbine pointless , at 42 storeys up they are capable of 35 mph gusts – a serious challenge for the workers who created the complex steel structure – and are projected to generate 8 % of the building ’s electricity needs .
The building – officially called the Strata tower – is a £ 113 m milestone in the £ 1.5 bn project to regenerate the Elephant and Castle area .
The Strata development , which comprises the tower and a smaller “ Pavillion ” building , is a statement of the new demographic Southwark council hopes the area will attract – its 408 apartments range from £ 230,000 to £ 2.5 m .
But the tower also marks an innovation for the building sector , which under government regulations will have to make all new buildings zero- carbon by 2019 .
Justin Black , director for Brookfield , the developer , said the decision to choose wind was a “ conscious decision to experiment ” .
He pointed out that the entire southern facade of the building would have had to be covered in solar photovoltaics to generate the same amount of energy .
“ The brief we gave to Hamilton ’s Architects was we wanted a statement , we wanted to create benchmarks for sustainability and urban living .
We wanted something bold , we wanted remarkable .
It ’s what I term Marmite architecture – you either love it or you hate it , there ’s no in between , ” Black said .
Next week the blades for the 9m - diameter turbines arrive on site and will be winched on to the roof for installation in early April , before the building is opened by London major Boris Johnson – circumstances permitting – on 1 July .
The 19 kW turbines , which were made bespoke for the project , will have five blades rather than the usual three to reduce noise .
Vibrations to the rest of the building should be eliminated by a five - tonne base fitted with four anti-vibration dampeners .
Unlike a conventional turbine standing in a field , the three in the Strata tower are expected to use the Venturi effect — think of wind being forced between two large buildings — to suck wind in from many angles and accelerate it through the tubes .
As well as generating a predicted 50 MWh annually , the turbines will also generate money – an estimated £ 16,000 - £ 17,000 annually – through the government ’s new and controversial feed - in - tariff , which starts on 1 April .
Other attempts have been made to minimise the tower ’s environmental footprint , which is 6 % above the energy efficiency required under building regulations .
For example it uses a natural ventilation system and there is no air - conditioning .
A wholly glazed building was ruled out to increase insulation and reduce noise .
Paul King , chief executive of UK Green Building Council , hailed the building as pioneering but warned that wind power was unlikely to become widespread in skyscrapers :
“ You ’ve got to take your hat off to the design team for delivering a building that clearly captures the imagination .
I doubt whether wind power will become a common feature in high - rise inner-city projects – but without this type of bold innovation , how would we ever know ?
Let ’s see how it works and learn from the real performance data that is gathered . ”
Strata is not alone among efforts to build wind - powered “ cities in the sky ” .
The Bahrain World Trade Centre already has wind turbines slung between its two towers , China has plans for high - rise buildings with turbines built into their fabric , and the Lighthouse tower in Paris ’ La Defense district should be topped by turbines when it ’s completed in 2015 .
Not all such wind towers have met with success though : Dubai ’s Anara Tower was cancelled , while New York ’s Freedom Tower , which was to replace the World Trade Centre , lost its proposed turbines in a redesign .
From Africa to the Himalayas , everyone ’s worried about global warming ’s potential to drive world conflict .
But what about the disputes it will solve ?
A long - running argument between India and Bangladesh over a small island in the Bay of Bengal has just been resolved : the island ’s not there anymore :
New Moore Island [ also known as South Talpatti ] in the Sunderbans has been completely submerged , said oceanographer Sugata Hazra , a professor at Jadavpur University in Calcutta .
Its disappearance has been confirmed by satellite imagery and sea patrols , he said .
“ What these two countries could not achieve from years of talking , has been resolved by global warming , ” said Hazra .
Jewish World Review May 18 , 2010 / 5 Sivan 5770  Enough Money  By Thomas Sowell
http://www.JewishWorldReview.com |
One of the many shallow statements that sound good -- if you do n't stop and think about it -- is that " at some point , you have made enough money . "
The key word in this statement , made by President Barack Obama recently , is " you . "
There is nothing wrong with my deciding how much money is enough for me or your deciding how much money is enough for you , but when politicians think that they should be deciding how much money is enough for other people , that is starting down a very slippery slope .
Politicians with the power to determine each citizen 's income are no longer public servants .
They are public masters .
Are we really so eaten up with envy , or so mesmerized by rhetoric , that we are willing to sacrifice our own freedom by giving politicians the power to decide how much money anybody can make or keep ?
Of course , that will start only with " the rich , " but surely history tells us that it will not end there .
The French Revolution began arbitrary executions among the hereditary aristocracy , but ended up arbitrarily executing all sorts of other people , including eventually even leaders of the Revolution itself , such as Robespierre .
Very similar patterns appeared in the Bolshevik Revolution , in the rise of the Nazis and in numerous other times and places , where expanded and arbitrary powers were put into the hands of politicians -- and were used against the population as a whole .
Once you buy the argument that some segment of the citizenry should lose their rights , just because they are envied or resented , you are putting your own rights in jeopardy -- quite aside from undermining any moral basis for respecting anybody 's rights .
You are opening the floodgates to arbitrary power .
And once you open the floodgates , you can't tell the water where to go .

The moral bankruptcy of the notion that third parties can decide when somebody else has " enough " money is matched by its economic illiteracy .
The rest of the country is not poorer by the amount of Bill Gates ' fortune today and was not poorer by the amount of John D. Rockefeller 's fortune a century ago .
Both men were selling a product that others were also selling , but more people chose to buy theirs .
Those people would not have voluntarily continued to pay their hard - earned money for Rockefeller 's oil or Gates ' software if what they received was not worth more to them than what they paid .
The fortunes that the sellers amassed were not a deduction from the buyers ' wealth .
Buyers and sellers both gained from these transactions or the transactions would n't have continued .
Ida Tarbell 's famous muckraking book , " History of the Standard Oil Company , " said that Rockefeller " should have been satisfied " with the money he had acquired by 1870 , implying greed in his continued efforts to increase the size and profitability of Standard Oil .
But would the public have been better off or worse off if Rockefeller had retired in 1870 ?
One of the crucial facts left out of Ida Tarbell 's book was that Rockefeller 's improvements in the oil industry brought down the price of oil to a fraction of what it had been before .
As just one example , oil was first shipped in barrels , which is why we still measure oil in terms of the number of barrels today , even though oil is seldom -- if ever -- actually shipped in barrels any more .
John D. Rockefeller shipped his oil in railroad tank cars , reducing transportation costs , among other costs that he found ways of reducing .
Would the public have been better off if older and more costly methods of producing , processing and shipping oil had continued to be used , leading to prices far higher than necessary ?
Apparently Rockefeller himself decided at some point that he had enough money , and then donated enough of it to create a world - class university from day one -- the University of Chicago -- as well as donating to innumerable other philanthropic projects .
But that is wholly different from having politicians make such decisions for other people .
Politicians who take on that role stifle economic progress and drain away other people 's money , in order to hand out goodies that will help get themselves re-elected .
Some people call that " social justice , " even when it is anti-social politics .

News Feature
Systems neuroscientists are pushing aside their electrophysiology rigs to make room for the tools of ' optogenetics ' .
Lizzie Buchen reports from a field in the process of reinvention .
The centrifuge tube was the first that neuroscientist Philip Sabes had held in his hand for 15 years .
The small , polypropylene container , no larger than a AAA battery , held a few drops of liquid at its base .
It looked like water but , Sabes had been told by his collaborators , it contained a high concentration of viruses — and he had to get them into the brain of a monkey .
" Honestly , I really felt like I did n't know what I was doing , " says Sabes , of his work last November at the Keck Center for Integrative Neuroscience at the University of California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) .
" I basically knew nothing about molecular biology .
This was way outside my area of expertise . "
Sabes 's training was in physics , machine learning and human perception , and his lab has been working with humans and non-human primates to develop models of how the brain turns perceptions into actions ; for example , seeing a fly and swatting it away .
He 's not alone in his molecular - biology naivety at the Keck Center — there is no cell - culture facility , no PCR machine and no bench - top centrifuge .
The centre 's one ice machine spits out large cubes instead of the crushed ice routinely used for chilling reagents — it was ordered by mistake , and no one has cared enough to fix the situation .
Sabes and his colleagues have had no need for such apparatus .
Researchers in their field of ' systems neuroscience ' try to understand how networks of neurons process sensations and control behaviours such as learning and decision - making .
And up to this point , much of their progress has been made using electrophysiology , stimulating and recording from the brains of animals as they perform a task or develop a new skill .
Now though , advances in a five - year - old field called optogenetics are convincing these scientists to crack open molecular - biology textbooks .
Using a hybrid of genetics , virology and optics , the techniques involved enable researchers to instantaneously activate or silence specific groups of neurons within circuits with a precision that electrophysiology and other standard methods do not allow .
Systems neuroscientists have longed for such an advance , which allows them their first real opportunity to pick apart the labyrinthine jumble of cell types in a circuit and test what each one does .
" It has revolutionized my approach to science , " says Antonello Bonci , a neurophysiologist at the UCSF Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center in Emeryville who began using the technique in 2007 .
" It can clarify unequivocally the role of specific classes of cells , and solve controversies that have been going on for many , many years . "
Among the clarifications sought is the precise function of ' place ' cells , hippocampal neurons that fire only when an animal finds itself in a specific location ; another is the function of complex activity patterns observed when an animal is paying attention or executing a movement .
“ Optogenetics can solve controversies that have been going on for many , many years . ”
A field 's evolution
The transition phase is n't easy .
Optogenetic tools were first used in cell cultures and mice , which are amenable to genetic manipulation .
Now systems neuroscientists must adapt them to function in organisms they traditionally study such as rats , birds and primates .
With the technical challenge comes a personal one , as researchers leave their experimental comfort zone for a new field .
Most , however , anticipate that any discomfort will be worthwhile .
" This is God 's gift to neurophysiologists , " says Robert Desimone , director of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in Cambridge , who has been using electrophysiology for more than 30 years .
" Molecular techniques were always beyond us , so this is our first opportunity .
It 's a revolution .
But we 're catching up to the revolution that had been going on for the rest of the world . "
Optogenetics started out in 2005 , when a team at Stanford University in California led by Karl Deisseroth and his then - postdoc Ed Boyden inserted a light - sensitive channel from green algae , called channelrhodopsin - 2 ( ChR2 ) , into neurons growing in a dish .
Exposed to a pulse of blue light , the channels opened and a flood of positive ions poured into the neurons , making them fire1 .
Within a year , 30 labs had contacted Deisseroth to ask for the technology .
By March 2010 , Deisseroth had sent protocols or genetic constructs to more than 500 labs around the world , and Boyden , now at MIT , had sent them to in excess of 250 .
Click for a larger version .
The technique has been refined greatly in the past five years , but the basic steps are the same ( see ' Six steps to optogenetics ' ) .
First , researchers create a genetic construct containing the ChR2 gene or another ' opsin ' gene , along with genetic elements that control its expression — for example , a specific ' promoter ' sequence .
Then , they package up the construct in a virus .
When the virus is injected into an animal 's brain , it widely infects neurons and delivers the construct , but the opsin is expressed in only a subgroup of cells with the necessary machinery to activate its promoter .
The opsin proteins sit in the membrane of those neurons , and researchers trigger them with light of a specific wavelength , typically delivered through an optic fibre threaded through an animal 's skull .
Deisseroth and Boyden have discovered or engineered many other opsins that allow neurons to be manipulated in different ways , including neural silencers .
The technique is popular , but complex .
The fastest adopters were those who work with cells grown in vitro and animals such as flies , worms and mice , for which they could take advantage of established genetic tools and well - characterized animal lines .
" The number of tangible results are still of the order of half a dozen or so .
But we 're on the rising phase of the exponential , " says Karel Svoboda , a neuroscientist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute 's Janelia Farm research campus in Ashburn , Virginia , who last year started mapping mouse cortical circuits using optogenetics2 .
From the start , these developments sent quivers through the systems - neuroscience community .
" When I first saw this stuff , at a meeting where Karl was presenting some of the earliest results , I thought , ' Oh God , finally ' , " says Loren Frank , another neuroscientist at the Keck Center .
" And then I thought , oh great .
Here I was , I 'd gotten pretty good at the stuff I thought I needed to do , and now I have to learn an entirely new field . "
Frank — who says he has " always had a bit of molecular - biology envy " — began collaborating with Deisseroth to use optogenetics on rats just over three years ago , for his studies of place cells and hippocampal circuits .
Silencing or activating specific cells could help show whether or how they help an animal explore a new location or recognize a familiar one .
" If you want to actually understand the system , you have to start trying to get control of the system and actually dissect the circuit , " says Frank .
Standard techniques have not allowed that type of dissection .
Electrodes inserted into an animal 's brain typically stimulate hundreds of thousands of cells ; using lesions or drugs also hits circuits like a hammer .
Optogenetics could be a scalpel , turning particular neurons in a circuit on or off within milliseconds .
From brain to behaviour
By April 2009 , Frank was making progress in rats , achieving ChR2 expression in a discrete set of hippocampal neurons and getting them to fire .
And down the hall , Sabes was ready to try the technique in primates as part of his efforts to understand circuits involved in hand - eye coordination .
" I knew optogenetics was on the horizon , and it was potentially exciting , but realistically , I just did n't know anything about this stuff , " he says .
Sabes and two songbird researchers at the Keck Center , Michael Brainard and Allison Doupe , teamed up with Frank , Deisseroth and another colleague , Linda Wilbrecht , a neuroscientist at the Gallo Center .
The group , one of the first big collaborations aiming to apply optogenetics to rats , birds and primates , received a US $ 1.6 - million National Institutes of Health grant in September 2009 through the financial stimulus .
The neuroscientists describe what they 'd like to do — in Sabes 's case , for example , alter patterns of activity that occur in the parietal lobe when an animal reaches for something , and work out which patterns are important for planning , initiating or adjusting the movement .
Wilbrecht 's lab leads efforts to generate the appropriate constructs and select the best viruses , and Deisseroth tries to build new viral and optogenetic tools that they need .
One huge advantage for mouse researchers has been the ready - made bank of animal lines engineered to express an enzyme called Cre recombinase in subsets of neurons , such as all dopaminergic ones , which they can use in combination with specially designed genetic constructs to achieve the cellular specificity they want .
In other animals , a promoter must be found that will only be turned on in dopaminergic neurons .
Some promoters and viruses that work in mice do not work in rats or primates , meaning that researchers have to start from scratch .
Progress has been faster in rats because the animals are relatively easy to breed and are similar enough to mice for methods to be transferable .
In March 2009 , Deisseroth was the first to publish a rat optogenetic study , in which he manipulated circuit components in a rat model of Parkinson 's disease to work out which parts might account for the relief afforded by deep - brain stimulation3 .
An additional complication for primate researchers is that primate brains are larger than those of rodents , making it difficult to ensure the injected virus and the activating light penetrate deep enough .
And troubleshooting in monkeys will take much longer than in rats , given the long lifetime and high value — experimental , financial and ethical — of the animals .
But in April 2009 , Desimone and his colleagues worked with Boyden to publish the first experiment showing that viruses can be used to insert opsin channels and control neural activity in a macaque4 .
“ It felt like garage - development days , cutting stuff up to see what works . ”
By November 2009 , Sabes could be found holding his tube of virus , trying to get a similar primate system going in his lab .
This was a pilot experiment : he was simply trying to see if he could get some of the virus into neurons at all .
After bending and breaking a few needles , he successfully injected the tube 's contents into a monkey 's brain .
He and two graduate students then hacked together an ' optrode ' by gluing together a fibre - optic cable and an electrode .
They fed the wires through a head fixture normally used for electrophysiology , and rigged half of a syringe as a support .
" It felt very much like garage - development days , cutting stuff up to see what works , " says Sabes .
In January , with the optrode inserted into the region where the virus had been injected two months earlier , Sabes flipped on a blue laser and watched a screen showing electrical readout from the optrode .
Yellow waveforms flashed across the screen , paired with a flurry of clicking noises : spikes of neural activity .
Experts on hand
Like Sabes , the few other electrophysiologists starting to tackle primate optogenetics are keeping experts in the technique close by to avoid making a novice 's mistakes ( see ' Opto school ' ) .
" It 's critical that at least the initial phase is collaborative , " says Krishna Shenoy , a primate electrophysiologist at Stanford University who has been working closely with Deisseroth for two years to explore how neurons in the brain 's motor cortex control arm movements .
Boyden 's paper is still the only optogenetics publication on primates , and the technique is some way from generating new discoveries .
It 's still not known whether the opsins will be expressed consistently for the year or two required to train monkeys in sophisticated behaviours and then record from neurons repeatedly .
" If it only expresses at the right level for a few months and then dies off or expresses too much , it 's just untenable , " says Shenoy .
All these questions take time and money to answer , and not every lab has an appetite for the work .
" It 's probably going to have a big impact , and I 'm definitely interested , " says Tirin Moore , a neurobiologist at Stanford .
" But I 'm less interested in pioneering the approach in monkeys and more interested in using the tools once it 's clear that they work . "
Meanwhile , Boyden and Deisseroth are hammering out some of the problems .
Last month , Deisseroth reported a system in mice that could make detailed knowledge of promoters unnecessary : two viruses containing separate genetic constructs are injected into two connected brain regions .
Only neurons that run between the two regions will receive doses of both constructs , which then interact to express the opsin5 .
Boyden is designing a light source that would weigh a fraction of a gram so that animals can walk around freely rather than being tethered to a fibre - optic cable .
" Soon enough , this is going to be standard technology , " says Sabes .
" The hardware will be there , the viruses will be there , there will be a handful of constructs that everyone agrees works reasonably well . "
That aim is likely to be furthered by a two - year , $ 14.9 - million grant from the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in Arlington , Virginia , that Sabes , Deisseroth and six other labs , led by Shenoy , won in April .
The team will attempt to use primate optogenetics to explore brain repair after injury , including possible light - based neural prosthetics , devices that might stimulate appropriate patterns of activity in the surviving neurons .

For now , Sabes is still trying to analyse the results of his first monkey experiment .
He has sent the animal 's brain to a friend competent in histology , who will slice it , paper thin , onto slides .
Then Sabes will have to grapple with a fluorescent microscope for the first time , trying to work out where and how well the opsin was actually expressed .
" I 'm sure it 's not that hard , " says Sabes , " but I 've never done it " .

Here 's the thing about a homosexual relationship between Holmes and Watson : you are never going to prove it .
It just is n't in the books , explicitly .
It would be rad if it was but it 's not so now we are going to have arguments with no end because , maybe maybe maybe maybe .
They are like James Buchanan and Willian Rufus King , who I always picture going grocery shopping together because they looked like they were the cutest little old couple , but who is to say for sure ?
Aside from Andrew Jackson , who had lots to say .
Eventually the idea that these two were hookin ' up between the pages gets so popular that people who never read the books will argue , " yeah man of course they were ! '
That 's popular culture for you !

There is an interesting move underway by the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) to more precisely define the meaning of certain asset backed securities ( like the now infamous mortgage - backed securities that were central to the recent crash ) .
The NY times has covered the story from a high level , but what of particular interest to me is the proposal to specify the meaning of the bonds in Python .
This is a step is the right direction but Python is not the answer .
The core problem here is to give a clear and unambiguous meaning to a bond .
This requires the language in which it is written is precisely defined .
Python is not precisely defined .
There is only a prose definition of the language , which is inadequate in the same way that the prose definitions of bonds are inadequate , and of course there are differences between various versions and implementation of Python .
Since Python is not precisely defined the only meaning one can give to a program in Python is whatever the particular implementation one uses does with that program .
In contrast there are languages that are formally defined , suchStandard ML and Scheme .
These would make a sound basis for the formal definition of bonds .
In turns out that functional languages also make a good ( meaning expressive and convenient ) basis for the formal definition of bonds .
There is a great paper on expressing contracts in Haskell and at least one company has implemented this idea in a commercial system ( in O’Caml , I believe ) .
So my advice to the SEC : use an appropriate subset of Scheme or Standard ML , or hire someone to create a formally defined DSL , but do n’t use a language without a formal definition if precision is your goal .
A senior figure in the Church of Scientology has been accused of trying to cover up the sexual assault of an 11 - year - old girl in Sydney .
In an exclusive interview for ABC1's Lateline program , a former member of the Church of Scientology says she was coached by a senior figure in the church to lie to police about the abuse at the hands of her stepfather .
Carmen Rainer 's mother Phoebe was a member of the Church of Scientology and went to the organisation for advice when she learnt her daughter was being sexually abused .
Police are now investigating claims Jan Eastgate , who was in charge of a church - founded organisation at the time , told both mother and daughter to lie to police and community services about the abuse .
Ms Rainer also says the church told her the abuse , at the hands of her then - stepfather Robert Kerr , was her own fault .
" They told me it was my fault because I 'd been bad in a past life - I 'd probably done something bad in a past life so I pulled it in , " she said .
" I believed them .
As a child I believed them .
I was 11 .
That 's what I knew .
I grew up believing what they believed . "
At the time , Ms Eastgate was head of the Citizen 's Commission on Human Rights ( CCHR ) in Australia - an organisation founded by the Church of Scientology that campaigns against psychiatry .
She is now the international head of the CCHR , which is based in Los Angeles .
Ms Eastgate is accused of interfering with a police investigation by coaching Ms Rainer on what to tell police and community services .
Ms Rainer says Ms Eastgate told her to tell police she did not want her stepfather to go to jail and to tell community services he had not touched her genitals .
" ' Just say no ' , she kept repeating that .
' You remember that you can't tell them . '
Do n't say yes because otherwise you will be taken away from your parents and you 'll never see your family again because [ Department of Community Services ] will take me and my brother away from my mum and that I needed to just say no , " she said .
Ms Rainer 's mother also says Ms Eastgate told her to lie to police .
" Jan Eastgate coached both of us actually and she came with us to DoCS - they were n't called DoCS back then - but she came with us to the interview and she basically told me what to say and Carmen what to say and she also told Carmen to lie to the police and I lied to the police as well because of that , " she said .
Ms Eastgate declined to talk to Lateline either on the phone or on camera .
In an email to Lateline she described the allegations by Carmen and Phoebe Rainer as " egregiously false " .
" The family asked for my help to attend their meeting with Youth and Community Services specifically because they did not want anyone involved to be forced to undergo psychiatric treatment , " she said .
" It had nothing to do with the merit of potential criminal charges . "
Ms Eastgate and the Church of Scientology say Mr Kerr went to the police in 1999 at the church 's insistence .
But Phoebe Rainer says Mr Kerr was told by senior scientologists he had to go to the police only after she threatened the church with legal action 13 years after the original allegations were made .
Ms Rainer says it was indoctrination that led her to agree to protect the Church of Scientology instead of her daughter - an act that has lead to a strained relationship .
" It would be hard for an outsider to understand why it would be done , but you are so totally brainwashed by their beliefs and then you get told that if you go this particular way you will lose everything , you will lose your future , " she said .
Carmen Rainer has now made a statement to police outlining the allegations against Ms Eastgate and police are investigating the matter .
The Church of Scientology said in a statement the allegations were untrue and defamatory .
Arguably , the best multiplayer game ever created .
Team Fortress 2 is the award - winning , critically acclaimed sequel to the Quake mod , Team Fortress .
Team Fortress 2 ditches the realistic , war - torn style of the original and goes with a cartoon look resembling a Pixar movie .
The reason VALVe went with this look is because they stated that having a realistic game presented too many issues of gameplay restrictions and it resembled Counter - Strike too much .
They went for their very own distinct style and many people agree it's much better than what was shown earlier than in development .
The RED team has bright colors to match the rural , woodworking side of the map while the BLU team sports cool , soothing colors to match their industrial side of the map .
The art design in general is extremely well done , both aesthetically and to help make everything extremely distinguishable .
Team Fortress 2 was originally slated for release back in 1999 , but it was delayed for 8 years and years after silence from Valve the game was officially labeled as vaporware .
Finally , Valve presented Team Fortress 2 in all it 's cartoon glory at E3 2006 .
The reception was overwhelming positive .
Fans were awe struck at the great graphics and animations the game sported , along with a distinct personality , hilarious voiceovers and backstory for each class to help bring the game to life .
Each class was specifically designed to be so unique that you could pick them out with ease in a silhouette lineup .
Valve also was focusing on the casual gamers this time around , simplifying aspects like removing unnecessary sidearms and grenades ( thank the lord for this ) .
Each class has a unique primary weapon , a sidearm ( usually a pistol or shotgun ) , and a unique melee weapon .
This time around , VALVe made sure to focus the player on teamwork rather than fancy jumptricks and grenade spam .
The game was finally released in October 2007 alongside the Orange Box , with unanimous praise from just about every gaming review site / magazine in existence .
Team Fortress 2 may seem overwhelming at first due to the sheer chaos of the game and the distinct play styles of each class , but you will get used to all of it within a few hours .
The pace of the game is slower than the first to help the newbies out .
The gameplay is pretty simple once you work out the mechanics .
As of now there are 6 gameplay modes .
There 's your standard capture the flag .
There 's Capture Point which is basically to Capture designated points on the map as specified .
Then there is Territory Control which is basically Capture Point but the map changes around depending on who wins .
There 's also the popular Payload mode which is the BLU team has to push a bomb on wheels into the RED team 's base , while the RED team does everything it can to stop the bomb .
There is Double Payload which is just Payload but the teams are racing each other .
Finally there is Arena mode , which is basically like Counter - Strike where you try to eliminate the opposing team in a single - round .
Team Fortress 2 contains 9 unique classes all designed with specific strengths and weaknesses .
They are split into categories : Offense contains the Scout , Soldier , and Pyro. Defense contains the Demoman , Heavy and Engineer .
Special contains the Medic , Sniper and Spy .
The 9 years of development really payed off for this game , as it's constant emphasis of teamwork and balance truly make this one of the best multiplayer games of all time .
Teamwork is the only way to succeed in this game , and solo play is generally frowned upon .
The ease of the game combined with the almost unlimited depth make this appeal to everyone , whether you play once a week or 8 hours a day , you are sure to enjoy yourself without getting frustrated , as the game was designed for those exact reasons .
There is also a huge amount of ongoing support from VALVe , overhauling each class one at a time with new weapons , new voice lines , new achievements and new maps all for free .
As of this definition , 6 of the 9 classes have been overhauled .
The game also sports an extensive modding community with over a thousand custom maps so far .
*I 'm going to wrap this up now since it 's getting long and I could go on and on forever about this game but I will leave you with this ; every self - respecting gamer should own this game .
It really is that damn good .
*The above is only specific to the PC version .

The new planes will fly under the United Airlines name
US - based United Airlines and Continental Airlines have agreed a deal to merge , creating the world 's biggest carrier .
The loss - making companies said they expected the deal , worth $ 3.2 bn ( £ 2.1 bn ) , to deliver savings of more than $ 1bn a year .
The combined group will be named United Airlines .
But new branding will combine the current Continental colours with the United Airlines name .
After the deal was announced shares of both firms rose in morning trading in New York .
United 's parent UAL Corporation saw its shares rise by 51 cents , or 2.37 % , to close in New York at $ 22.11 , while Continental shares were up 51 cents , or 2.28 % , to $ 22.86 .
Although United is seen as the dominant partner , the merger was described as " a merger of equals " .
Together United and Continental currently fly to 370 destinations worldwide , flying 144 million passengers a year .
Combining the two companies will create the world 's biggest airline , based on the total number of passenger - miles flown .
Continental 's boss Jeff Smisek will be chief executive of the new company based in Chicago , while United Airlines ' Glenn Tilton will serve as the non-executive chairman .
Mr Tilton called the deal " great ... for our customers , our employees , our shareholders and our communities " .

Are mergers the answer ?
" We are creating a stronger , more efficient airline , both operationally and financially , better positioned to succeed in a dynamic and highly competitive global aviation industry , " he said .
The companies did not give any details on potential job cuts , but said they expected front - line employees to be " minimally affected by the merger " , with staff reductions coming from retirements and voluntary redundancy .
The two companies currently employ a total of 86,000 people .
Analysts expect redundancies to form part of the merger , with airlines anxious to cut costs following a recent collapse in profits within the industry .
Chief executive Jeff Sismek said some cost - savings would come from getting the most out of aircraft and sharing IT services .
They also hope that the better choice of routes will be attractive to sought - after business customers .
' Oversupply '
Both companies are full - service airlines and have faced intense competition from low - cost operators .
United Airlines ' parent company UAL reported a loss of $ 82 m for the first three months of the year , after reporting a $ 1.1 bn loss for 2009 .
Continental reported net losses of $ 282 m last year .
" This airline deal is expected to bring much - needed consolidation to the US airline industry as it suffers chronic oversupply , " commented Saj Ahmad , airline analyst at FBE Aerospace .
" This announcement puts other players like American Airlines and US Airways on watch for who makes the next move . "
Last month British Airways and Iberia followed the consolidation trend , merging to create one of Europe 's largest carriers .
The United - Continental merger still has be approved by shareholders and competition regulators and will need the agreement of unions .
They hope to complete the deal by the end of the year .
Hector Quinones did n’t amount to much in life , but he managed in death to make a powerful fashion statement .
The statement boiled down to this :
Do n’t be a jerk like me .
Not nearly enough people seem to be taking his lesson to heart .
Back in December , Mr. Quinones killed three men in an apartment on the Upper West Side , a bloodbath described by the police as drug - related .
Mr. Quinones was intent on shooting more people , they said , only he was forced to flee .
He ran to the fire escape .
But the low - slung pants he was wearing fell down , the police said .
He tripped over them , took a tumble and landed with a thud in the building ’s backyard .
There you had it : death by trousers .
Could there be a better argument for hitching up one ’s pants ?
And yet countless young men continue to parade about the streets in their own boxer rebellion , wearing trousers so low that their shorts — and sometimes more than that — are on display .
“ I was on a subway train , and there was this young man , ” State Senator Eric Adams of Brooklyn said .
“ His behind was showing , literally .
He had underwear , but even the underwear was sagging .
All the passengers were looking at each other in disgust , but nobody was saying anything . ”
So I was pissed off first thing this morning .
I ran into an article written a few days ago on Cnet which quoted IBM Developer Sam Ruby saying the following about cellphones :
“ It ’s killing the landline ; it ’s killing watches ; it ’s changing the camera business ; it ’s changing the TV industry , the music industry , ” Ruby said Monday at the New Paradigms for Using Computers ( NPUC ) 2006 workshop at the IBM Almaden Research Center here .
“ It ’s destroying the pay - phone industry .
It ’s hurting the hotel industry and putting the squeeze on universities , ” he said during a talk titled “ Teenagers on the Go . ”
Wait a fucking minute , I thought .
Did n’t I say that ?
Verbatim .
I put on my Che Guevara shirt and seethed .
Then realized I was acting like a fucking idiot .
We live in the knowledge age .
And this generation probably has more obsolete knowledge in it ’s collective head than any other time in history .
99 % of what matters lies outside our own head .
And smart people suck up the ideas of others and remix them in a way that makes sense to them and their audience .
... So yeah I sampled your voice , you was usin it wrong
You made it a hot line , I made it a hot song ...
-- Jay -Z ( the Takeover )
Earlier today I linked to an article by a Yale professor about how copyright judges should look at copyright the same way economist look at the environment .
The environment is a complex system and so are copyrights .
But some of us ( even me sometimes ) want to look at things as if they are simple .
One of the hallmarks of this age is complexity .
Look at sports .
Think about how many people are employed by the typical baseball team .
The game has n’t really changed in 100 years but few would argue it ’s not more complex .
Multiply that by everything .
And that will give you a sense of how much more complex the world is today .
In a complex system , like the internet , or life in general , if you did n’t soak up or was anyway effected by the stuff around you could n’t be part of the system anyway .
In other words , if I did n’t want my thoughts remixed why did I post them on my blog in the first place ?
