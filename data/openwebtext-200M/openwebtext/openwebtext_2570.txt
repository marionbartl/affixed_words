The Obama administration fell in line with the Bush administration Thursday when it urged a federal judge to set aside a ruling in a closely watched spy case weighing whether a U.S. president may bypass Congress and establish a program of eavesdropping on Americans without warrants .
In a filing in San Francisco federal court , President Barack Obama adopted the same position as his predecessor .
With just hours left in office , President George W. Bush late Monday asked U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker to stay enforcement of an important Jan. 5 ruling admitting key evidence into the case .
Thursday 's filing by the Obama administration marked the first time it officially lodged a court document in the lawsuit asking the courts to rule on the constitutionality of the Bush administration 's warrantless - eavesdropping program .
The former president approved the wiretaps in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks .
" The Government 's position remains that this case should be stayed , " the Obama administration wrote ( .pdf ) in a filing that for the first time made clear the new president was on board with the Bush administration 's reasoning in this case .
The government wants to appeal Walker 's decision to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco , a legal maneuver requiring Judge Walker 's approval .
A hearing in Walker 's courtroom is set for Friday .
The legal brouhaha concerns Walker 's decision to admit as evidence a classified document allegedly showing that two American lawyers for a now - defunct Saudi charity were electronically eavesdropped on without warrants by the Bush administration in 2004 .
The lawyers — Wendell Belew and Asim Ghafoo — sued the Bush administration after the U.S. Treasury Department accidentally released the Top Secret memo to them .
At one point , the courts had ordered the document , which has never been made public , returned and removed from the case .
The document 's admission to the case is central for the two former lawyers of the Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation charity to acquire legal standing so they may challenge the constitutionality of the warrantless - eavesdropping program Bush publicly acknowledged in 2005 .
The Friday hearing is needed , because disputes with pretrial decisions generally require the trial judge to permit an appeal .
The Obama administration is also siding with the former administration in its legal defense of July legislation that immunizes the nation 's telecommunications companies from lawsuits accusing them of complicitity in Bush 's eavesdropping program , according to testimony last week by incoming Attorney General Eric Holder .
That immunity legislation , which Obama voted for when he was a U.S. senator from Illinois , was included in a broader spy package that granted the government wide - ranging , warrantless eavesdropping powers on Americans ' electronic communications .
A decision on the constitutionality of the immunity legislation is pending before Judge Walker in a separate case brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation .

The Internal Revenue Service said Tuesday that it would allow victims of Bernard L. Madoff ’s huge investment fraud to claim a tax deduction related to the bulk of their losses .
The plan represents the first time the I.R.S. has come forward with a policy on the treatment of Mr. Madoff ’s victims , who include Elie Wiesel , the Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate ; Steven Spielberg , the filmmaker ; and John Malkovich , the actor , among scores of other individuals , charities and universities .
The matter has been a point of debate and anxiety for the victims and their accountants , given the lack of clarity in the tax code about how it should be handled .
The plan , which applies to victims of all Ponzi schemes , is likely to provide major relief to victims of Mr. Madoff , who pleaded guilty last week to orchestrating what prosecutors say is the largest Ponzi scheme  one that exceeded $ 50 billion and involved 13,000 investors .
It is also likely to provide clarity for victims as they prepare to file federal income tax returns by the April 15 deadline , and help the I.R.S. avoid an unwanted avalanche of amended returns from victims .

Ruby 1.9 についていろいろと書いてきて( The Well - Grounded Rubyist は 2〜3ヶ月のうちに出る予定だ ) ，Ruby 1.8 から Ruby 1.9 に移行する際に気をつけるべき個人的な見解を共有しようと思い立った．これは変更点のリストではない．これは
Ruby 1.8 のコードを Ruby 1.9 で動くようにするために必要な変更点であり，知らなければひどい目にあいそうな事項のリストである．
String はもはや Enumerable ではない String はそれに類するもので string .
each という具合に実行することはできない．これは例えば
Rack インターフェイスにおいては衝撃的で，以前は戻り配列の3番目の要素が each に対応する必要があったためだ ．
ブロック文法 これは大きな変更でありトピック．特筆すべき点は，たとえば次のようなとき array.
each {| x | ... } ブロックパラメータのリストは，普通のメソッドパラメータリストのように扱われる．1.8 ではブロック の
||内の変数のスコープは，ブロックよりも大きい*1なので，@
と使うと @x= のように変数代入が可能になる．これは 1.8 で， array.each {|@ x | ... } や array. each {| self .
attr | ... } のように書くことができた理由である．これは 1.9 ではできなくなる．パラメータは assignment semantics ではなく ，method - argument semantics を使って変数に束縛される．ブロックパラメータは，ブロックローカルになる．たとえば次のコードを考える． x = 1 [ 2 , 3 ] .each {| x | ... } 1.8 では，実行後の x は 3 になる*2．1.9 で は2つの x は同じではなく，ブロック外部では x は 1 のままである． しかし既に存在してい る( a) か，ブロックパラメータでない場合(b)は，ブロックローカルではない．たとえば次のコードでは， x = 1 [ 2 , 3 ] . each {| y | x = y } x は 3 になる．もしブロックローカルな変数を他に使いたいときには，ブロック変数に変数宣言をセミコロンで追加すればいい． x = 1 [ 2 , 3 ] . each {| y ; x | x = y } こうすると x は 1 のままになる ．
メソッド引数の文法 メソッド引数もいくつか新しくなる．特に， def my_method ( a , *b , c ) のよう に， * b のあとに c という引数を指定できるようになる． ただこんな風に使う状況は多くないだろう．* 演算子は次のようになる． 1.8 では， >> a = [ 1 , 2 ] => [ 1 , 2 ] >> *b = a => [ [ 1 , 2 ] ] >> b => [ [ 1 , 2 ] ] 1.9 では >> a = [ 1 , 2 ] => [ 1 , 2 ] >> *b = a => [ 1 , 2 ] >> b => [ 1 , 2 ] 私はいつも * 演算子を次のように解釈していた． *x は 配列 x の中身リストとしてを表している 1.8 では * b = [ 1 , 2 ] は ， [ 1 , 2 ] が配列 b の内容を意味するので，*b が 1 , 2 となる ．1.9 ではこのようには振る舞わない．* に対する一般法則がどうなっているか，もしくは一般法則があると言うのが間違っていたかは確信はない．
Hash が順序を持つ これは別に問題にならないだろうけど，あなたのコードや他のコードにあったときに気をつけおこう．ハッシュ( Hash ) は挿入順を保存するようになる．キーを上書きしても順序は変更されない．
メソッド名は Symbol で返る 1.9 では obj.method や klass.instance_methods が，String ではなく Symbol を返すようになる．も し String で欲しいなら，to_s しなければならない．でもねぇ．．． ．
Symbol が String のように Symbol が String のようになる．正規表現や upcase / swapcase，その size を得ることができる．この目的が何なのかわからない．完全に
String のようになるのでなければ，これ以上 Symbol を String のようにしたくない ．
load - path にある Gem は自動的呼び出せるようになる Ruby / irb を実行したとき，load - path ( $ : ) はシステム上のすべて の
Gem のディレクトリを含む必要がある．これ は
Gem を require するときに，rubygems を最初に require する必要がないということである．gem メソッドの version 毎に load - path を操作できる ．
The good news at a conference hosted Tuesday by the San Francisco Convention & Visitors Bureau , as one keen observer put it , is that February is almost over - so we 're making progress at putting 2009 behind us .
The Northern California Visitor Outlook Conference was the fourth of its kind , its tone diverging remarkably from three previous years of upbeat forecasts .
The gathering was offered as a reality check for an industry feeling the consequences of a take - no - prisoners recession .
During this rocky patch , " It 's all about reducing cost , " Jeff Eastman , the chief executive officer of the TAP Report ( Trends Analysis Projections ) , a consulting group in Kansas City , told those gathered at the San Francisco Hilton .
" Is the business you have on the books real ?
Is it going to hold ?
Are the corporate cancellations done yet ?
It 's just scary .
Nobody really knows where it is going to end up , " Eastman said .
Visitors to California spent $ 96.7 million in 2007 , and while the 2008 final figure is not yet in , it is expected to be roughly the same , said Dan Mishell , research director of the nonprofit California Travel & Tourism Commission , which seeks to plant the image of California in minds of potential visitors across the country .
The usually glass - is - half - full commission anticipates there will be a decline of 8 percent in tourist spending in 2009 , said Mishell .

Tom Callahan , the co-president and chief executive officer of the San Francisco office of PKF Consulting , a hotel consultancy , said he expects revenue per available room among the 44,000 hotels rooms in San Francisco , San Mateo and Marin counties will be down 10.3 percent in 2009 .
Joe D'Alessandro , president and chief executive officer of the San Francisco Convention & Visitors Bureau , said of 2009 , " There are so many unknowns about where consumer confidence will be , about what international travel will be like this summer , about business travel and corporate travel . "
He said the single bright spot is San Francisco 's convention calendar this year - although there have been two cancellations .
San Jose 's Cisco Systems scrapped a session that would have brought in 52,000 people , said D'Alessandro , who said the cancellation was done for business reasons .
A Cisco representative did not respond to a message seeking comment .
The second cancellation was for a meeting to be hosted by NetApp , a Sunnyvale storage and data management company , that D'Alessandro said was to draw 15,000 people .
Elisa Steele , senior vice president of marketing at NetApp , said there was more customer interest than was anticipated , but she added , " Those same customers told us their travel budgets were being cut and it was difficult to commit in today 's climate of economic uncertainty . "
D'Alessandro said there were 992,000 room nights from 2008 conventions in San Francisco , meaning a hotel night booked by a convention delegate .
Thus far this year , there are 830,000 room nights booked , according to the bureau .
San Francisco has averaged about 900,000 room nights for each of the past five years , said D'Alessandro , " and for that reason we are encouraged . "
San Francisco 's visitor mix is roughly 40 percent leisure traveler , 33 percent meeting - and convention - goers and the rest a blend of transient business travelers .
Business travelers are " possibly the one we are most worried about , " said D'Alessandro , " because there is no way to stimulate that .
Companies will travel or they wo n't . "
Andy Card says that the public was plagued by misconceptions about the former president .
Card : Bush term mischaracterized
Andy Card , the former chief of staff to President George W. Bush , said Thursday that the public was plagued by misconceptions about the former president , particularly in regards to his intelligence and openness to information .
“ First off , President Bush does know how to read .
He is very well - read , ” Card said .
“ And he received information from a lot of people , not just Dick Cheney . ”

Card made the remarks as part of panel discussion on presidential transitions sponsored by Georgetown University and Politico .
In addition to Card , the speakers included Obama Transition Director John Podesta , former Clinton Chief of Staff Thomas “ Mack ” McClarty and Dina Habib Powell , the director of presidential personnel under Bush .
Each panel member addressed the challenges faced by incoming administrations when transitioning from campaigning to governing .
Podesta credited the Bush White House for easing the Obama team ’s transition to power .
“ The people in the White House were terrific , ” he said .
“ There were a few occasions where access to information was blocked at the agency level , but we would just call the White House and they would get it fixed . ”
McClarty confirmed Podesta ’s account , saying that from his perspective it seemed that “ President Bush and [ Chief of Staff ] Josh Bolton were really focused on the transition . ”
“ It ’s an excruciatingly short period of time , ” he said , comparing it to a major corporation swapping its entire executive structure .
Card added that while the switch in staff is difficult , the pivot a president must make from campaigner to executive can be even more taxing .
“ When you ’re running , you ’re running as a love magnet , ” he said .
“ But the job itself is a lonely responsibility . ”
Card and McClarty both wished current White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel luck and expressed confidence in his ability to handle the job .
“ Rahm is one of the smartest people I have worked with , ” McClarty said .
“ He can message better than anyone I have been around . ”
While all spoke highly of their time in the White House , each also expressed some relief that it was over .
Looking back on his time as Bush ’s top aide , Card said his old office “ looks better from the outside than it does from the inside . ”

Are you thinking about sprucing up your website ?
Before your mind wanders to colours and design , determine what you want and need from your website .
Here 's a few steps :
This is extremely important and often the step people miss .
What do you want from the website ?
What sort of goals do you have ?
Figuring out the specific return on investment needed ( whether it be money raised or awareness ) is important .
In the past , websites were considered to be online brochures , now they need to have much more .
This ties in with the first step .
What do you need the website to do for you ?
Do you want x number of donors , are you promoting an event ?
Perhaps it 's multiple reasons .
Whatever the need is , figuring it out will make it easier on both you and the web designer .
Who will be looking at the site ?
Is it your client , donors , prospects , or all ?
Determine what their needs are and how you are going to fulfill them on your site .
This is also extremely important , especially when it comes to the navigation of your site .
What do you want your audience to do ?
If it 's donate , then the donate button should be visible on all pages .
If it 's click on a certain campaign , then that campaign needs to be highlighted .
One of my web pet peeves is people who think that a website is all about design .
In fact , the most important part of the website is the content .
The design should complement the content , not overpower it .
Create a strong message that that will resonate with your audience .
So before you even look at a design or layout , answer these questions !
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama on Tuesday vowed to invest the resources needed to address the threat posed by drug traffickers in Mexico .
A police convoy moves in Ciudad Juarez , Mexico , last month , across the U.S. border from El Paso , Texas .
" We are going to continue to monitor the situation , and if the steps we have taken do not get the job done , then we will do more , " he told reporters Tuesday night .
He praised the efforts of Mexican President Felipe Calderon to counter drug cartels , which " have gotten completely out of hand , " but said the United States must take further steps , such as ensuring that illegal guns and cash do not flow from north of the Rio Grande to the cartels in Mexico .
" That 's what makes them so dangerous , " he said .
Obama 's remarks came hours after Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced that the United States is sending hundreds of federal agents and crime - fighting equipment to the border .
The renewed push for stronger law - enforcement presence along the border comes as the administration tries to help the Mexican government break up drug cartels blamed for killing some 6,500 people in Mexico last year , Napolitano said .
" Our role is to assist in this battle because we have our own security interests in its success , " Napolitano said at the White House .
In an interview with CNN later Tuesday , she said , " It 's all about border safety and security and making sure that spillover violence does not erupt in our own country . "
The new federal plan , developed by the departments of Justice and Homeland Security , calls for doubling the number of border security task force teams and moving a significant number of other federal agents , equipment and resources to the border .
It also involves greater intelligence sharing aimed at cracking down on the flow of money and weapons into Mexico that helps fuel the drug trade , senior administration officials said .
The plan commits $ 700 million to bolster Mexican law enforcement and crime prevention efforts .
The funds will provide , among other things , five new helicopters to increase mobility for the Mexican army and air force as well as new surveillance aircraft for the Mexican navy .
The funds also will support enhanced communications technology for Mexican prosecutors , law enforcement and immigration officials .
The $ 700 million allocation , meant to assist what administration officials described as an " anti- smuggling effort , " will complement ongoing U.S. aid to Mexico under the Merida initiative : a three - year , $ 1.4 billion package aimed at helping Mexico fight the drug cartels with law enforcement training , military equipment and improved intelligence cooperation .
The money was allocated last year , but Tuesday 's announcement brought the first details of how some of that money will be spent .
On the U.S. side of the border , more funding will support " prosecutor - led , intelligence - based task forces " that bring together the Department of Justice , the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies to dismantle drug cartels through investigation and extradition and the seizure and forfeiture of assets , Deputy Attorney General David Ogden said .
" As we 've found with other large criminal groups , if you take their money and lock up their leaders , you can loosen their grip on the vast organizations that are used to carry out their criminal activities . "
To help strengthen the U.S. side of the border further , the administration also plans to triple the number of Department of Homeland Security intelligence analysts dedicated to stopping Mexican - related violence .
It also will increase the number of immigration officials working in Mexico , double the number of " violent criminal alien " teams on the border , strengthen the presence of border canine units and quadruple the number of border liaison officers working with Mexican law enforcement .
It also will make an additional $ 59 million in federal funds available to support state , local and tribal border law enforcement operations .
At the same time , more agents from the FBI , Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives will be deployed to the border region .
The agents will be given updated equipment and surveillance technology to help track the movement of cash , drugs and weapons .
At a congressional hearing in Washington on Tuesday , Phoenix , Arizona , Mayor Phil Gordon called the administration 's initiative " a great first step , " but added , " it 's a drop in the bucket in terms of what is needed . "
Phoenix finds itself at the center of a " perfect storm " of drug runners and human smugglers , he said .
While most traditional crimes are down , crimes such as drug - related kidnappings and torturing are overwhelming Gordon 's police department .
" Most nights we have over 60 Phoenix police officers ( and ) some federal agents rushing to rescue those on a reactive basis , " Gordon said .
Texas Gov. Rick Perry has also sought additional help for his state .
Last month , Perry said he asked Napolitano for aviation assistance and " 1,000 more troops that we can commit to different parts of the border . "
Perry said it did n't matter to him what kind of troops came .
" As long as they are boots on the ground that are properly trained to deal with the border region , I do n't care whether they are military troops , or National Guard troops or whether they are customs agents . "
Last week , a Perry spokeswoman said that federal border protection had been underfunded for some time and that the 1,000 extra troops
Perry requested would fill in gaps that state and local agencies have been covering .
The announcement comes shortly ahead of planned trips by three Cabinet secretaries to Mexico before Obama visits there next month .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton goes to Mexico City this week , to be followed next week by Napolitano and Attorney General Eric Holder .
Watch as the plan is unveiled ahead of Clinton 's visit to Mexico »
Napolitano and Deputy Secretary of State Jim Steinberg both emphasized the cooperation and " courage " of Calderon during the news conference announcing the policy changes .
Calderon has been pushing back against U.S. criticism of drug cartel - related violence lately , arguing that the U.S. needs to take more responsibility for the outbreaks .
In his speeches and other public remarks , Calderon repeatedly has pointed out that much of the demand for drugs and most of the weapons used by narco - traffickers comes from the United States .
A prominent Washington - based gun control advocacy group released a report Tuesday backing Calderon 's assertions regarding weapons trafficking .
The report from the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence asserts that Mexican drug gangs have exploited weak American gun laws and corrupt gun dealers " to amass arsenals of high - powered guns that have killed thousands and pose an increasingly grave security threat to Mexico and the U.S. , " according to a statement from the organization .
CNN 's Elise Labott contributed to this report .

Some cities have decided the best way to use their federal stimulus funds is to barter with other municipalities , prompting a warning Tuesday that some of these transactions are prohibited .
At least three Southland cities are proposing to swap their anticipated share of federal money earmarked for highway improvements for funds that they could use as they see fit .
For example , city staff in Sierra Madre planned to ask the City Council on Tuesday for permission to trade $ 500,000 in stimulus funds for $ 500,000 in Measure R transportation funds from La Canada Flintridge .
Officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , which is responsible for distributing federal highway and transit stimulus funds to agencies in Los Angeles County , said they had no objection to this kind of exchange provided the projects that are to receive stimulus funds meet the federal criteria .
But officials sent a letter to city managers and others Tuesday saying that efforts by more municipalities to take the bartering process a step further will not be allowed .

The tiny town of Bradbury , for example , has entered into a memorandum of understanding with Torrance to trade its $ 500,000 in stimulus money for $ 315,000 in cash for its operating budget .
Officials in La Habra Heights and Irwindale said they are hoping to enter into similar arrangements with Westlake Village .
Both sides described the arrangements as a “ win-win ” proposition .
“ We did n’t have a project that would qualify , so we traded it rather than just ending up with nothing , ” said Shauna Clark , La Habra Heights ’ city manager .
“ Although it sounds like a loss , it actually gives us flexible funding we can use for projects that we feel need to be done rather than . . . just federal highway projects . ”
Carol Inge , the MTA ’s planing officer , said the agency understood the predicament of cities that are too small to have qualifying projects or can’t meet the tight federal deadlines to get a project shovel - ready .
That is why , she said , the MTA board decided Feb. 26 to allow dollar - for - dollar exchanges of federal highway stimulus money for less restricted Measure R funds approved by county voters in November for transportation improvements .
But she said the board did not approve any other types of arrangements .

Although details of the federal allocations are still being worked out in Sacramento and Washington , MTA officials expect to receive about $ 800 million in stimulus funds for the county ’s transportation projects , including at least $ 215 million for highway improvements , Inge said .
At least one analyst questioned why the MTA did not spend the money on its own projects instead of allocating it to cities that ca n’t use it .
“ What this is all doing is dodging the intent of the [ federal ] legislation , ” said Douglas Johnson , a fellow with the Rose Institute of State and Local Government at Claremont McKenna College .
Even if Bradbury ’s $ 500,000 share of stimulus funds ends up being used for a qualified project in Torrance , “ Why should Torrance have to pay $ 315,000 to get that money ? ” he asked .
Torrance plans to use the money on a project to ease congestion along Crenshaw Boulevard , City Manager LeRoy Jackson said .
( Torrance ’s deal with Bradbury and other exchanges were first reported in the Pasadena Star - News ) .

Inge said the MTA board did not want to exclude cities , because they have been “ great partners in getting funds out quickly to large parts of the county . ”
But she said the MTA was given just 150 days to allocate the money , which was not enough time to consider the merits of the projects submitted by 88 cities .
So the board decided to allocate the money to cities based on their population , with a minimum of $ 500,000 for each .
Officials in some of the smaller cities said they had been doing these kinds of exchanges for years , particularly with federal allocations that frequently come with conditions they cannot meet .
When the MTA published a list last week of cities that had not submitted sufficient qualifying projects , La Habra Heights started hearing from cities with projects of their own to fund , Clark said .
“ They call you or e-mail you and they offer you a trade , ” she said .
She described the discussions as a bartering process , but said the going rate was 62 cents to 65 cents on the dollar .

Irwindale City Manager Robert Griego said his office was contacted by six local cities .
His town decided to work with Westlake Village because it offered the best deal .
“ It also allows Westlake Village to complete an important project , ” he added , “ and that ’s what the stimulus money is for . ”

Computer architecture is presently taught " hands - on " only when adequate VLSI design tools are available .
The PISC is a processor constructed from discrete TTL logic , which illustrates the operation of both hardwired and microcoded CPUs .
An efficient stack machine is easy to implement , and simple hardware modifications demonstrate interrupts , memory segmentation , microsequencers , parallelism , and pipelining .
A standalone PISC board should be an economical and effective tool for teaching processor design .
Introduction
The study of computer architecture is often an abstract , paper exercise .
Students cannot probe the inner workings of a single - chip microprocessor , and few discrete - logic machines are open to student inspection .
Only universities that have VLSI design tools can give hands - on experience in processor design and implementation .
Less fortunate institutions can only offer their students " book learning . "
The Pathetic Instruction Set Computer is a model processor constructed entirely of discrete logic , illustrating the principles of both hardwired and microprogrammed CPUs .
Requiring only 22 standard TTL chips ( excluding memory ) , it is well within the ability of a student to construct and understand .
Its writeable microprogram store uses inexpensive EPROM and RAM .
Being fully static , it can be run at slow clock speeds or manually single - stepped for observation .
Simple extensions demonstrate interrupts , split instruction and data spaces , microsequencers , parallelism , and pipelining .
The Basic Processor
The PISC - 1a processor ( Fig. 1 ) is designed to achieve a maximum of functionality with a minimum of logic .
It is remarkable for having only 16 internal control signals , and thus a horizontal ( unencoded ) microinstruction only 16 bits long !
The ALU comprises four 74181s , which can perform the arithmetic operations of add , subtract , increment , and decrement , plus all logical operations , on 16 - bit numbers .
A programmable status latch and a 4 - way multiplexer for the carry input complete the ALU logic .
Eight 74172s provide eight 16 - bit registers in a three - port register file .
This file may simultaneously write one register ( " A " ) , read a second ( " B " ) , and read or write a third ( " C " ) .
In a single clock cycle , the following occurs :
a ) one register is output to the Address bus and the ALU 's A input ;
b1 ) another register may be output to the Data bus and the ALU 's B input ; or
b2 ) data from memory may be input to another register ;
c ) an ALU function is applied to A ( and perhaps B ) and the result is stored in the first ( address ) register .
There is no dedicated microsequencer ; its functions are performed by the ALU and register file .
Every microinstruction has two phases : fetch and execute .
During the fetch phase ( illustrated in Fig. 1 ) a hardwired " pseudo - instruction " is executed :
a ) output R7 ( the program counter ) to the Address bus and the ALU 's A input ;
b ) read data from memory ;
c ) apply the function A+1 and store the result back in R7 ( at the trailing edge of the clock ) .
Dedicated logic causes the memory data to be stored in the Instruction Register ( IR ) rather than in the register file .
During the execute phase , this instruction is performed and the fetch instruction is reloaded into the IR .
Thus every microinstruction requires two clock cycles .
The control logic for this ( not shown ) involves only two flip - flops and a NAND gate .
Microprogram store and main program store are one and the same .
Indeed , the PISC has characteristics of both a hardwired CPU and a microcoded CPU .
PISC as a Hardwired CPU
The PISC may be viewed as a conventional CPU with a hardwired control unit , a register - register architecture [ 3 ] , and a badly encoded instruction set vaguely reminiscent of the PDP - 11 .
ALU operations are one - or two - operand , and include register - register move , add , add with carry , subtract , subtract with borrow , increment , decrement , left shift , and all logical functions .
There is no multiply , divide , or right shift .
Memory operations are load and store , and have three addressing modes : register indirect , register indirect with postincrement , or register indirect with postdecrement .
Postincrement addressing on R7 ( the program counter ) yields immediate addressing .
Control instructions are ALU operations on the program counter .
Register indirect jump ( absolute or relative ) and conditional skip can be done in a single instruction .
Other jumps and branches , and subroutine call / return , must be explicitly coded .
PISC as a Microprogrammed CPU
The PISC instruction word actuates physical control signals , and one can view the PISC as a microprogrammed CPU .
The basic PISC implements a conventional machine inefficiently , since it lacks the logic to separate and decode the fields of a macroinstruction .
But the PISC excels as a zero - operand architecture , i.e. , a stack machine .
The fastest implementation uses threaded code [ 1 ] and a 16 - bit macroinstruction .
This reduces the microinterpreter to one microinstruction :
MRD PC , IP, A+1 ; mem( IP ) ->PC , IP+1->IP
One register is dedicated as the macro Instruction Pointer , and one or two others as stack pointers .
Some flexibility can be gained by adding one microinstruction to the interpreter to use indirect threaded code [ 2 ] .
Logically , the microprogram store should be separate from the macroprogram memory .
But a unified macro- and micro-program store allows the programmer to write microcode and add new macroinstructions -- a valuable educational tool .
Such an " extensible instruction set " in a stack machine is evocative of the programming language Forth , and this concept has been anticipated by several dedicated Forth processors [ 4 ] .
Glaring Deficiencies
Many weaknesses of the PISC become evident after a short period of use , including :
a ) no conditional branch microinstruction -- an important need [ 6 ] ;
b ) no provision for literal values in the microinstruction ;
c ) no ALU logic for multiply , divide , and right shift ;
d ) no logic for decoding of macroinstructions ;
e ) no provision for interrupts ;
f ) sparse coding of the ALU function select ; and
g ) two clocks required per microinstruction .
It can be argued that the PISC is a valuable educational tool because these faults , and several potential solutions , are painfully obvious .
Some faults cannot be rectified without substantial added logic , or an expansion of the microinstruction word .
But several improvements are trivial .
ALU Operation Decoding
Seven bits of the 16 - bit microinstruction ( including the carry input select ) select the ALU function .
Fewer than 32 of the 128 codes are actually useful , however .
A " nanocode " memory [ 3 ] , or combinational logic , could reduce the ALU field (s ) from seven to five bits .
Alternatively , unused function codes can be decoded to generate auxiliary control signals .
For example , the carry input select ( IR6:5 ) is a " don't - care " for logic operations ( IR4=1 ) .
Thus 48 of the 64 logic function codes can be used for other purposes .
A single 74138 can provide eight supplementary control signals , such as interrupt enable and disable .
Additional logic can prevent the ALU output from being written to a register , if desired .
Conditional ALU Operations
A simple conditional microinstruction modifies the ALU function according to the carry status .
Two modifications are useful :
a ) if carry set , change ALU operation from " A " to " B " ( conditional jump )
b ) if carry set , change ALU operation from " A " to " A+B " ( conditional branch )
Unused ALU functions can be decoded for these operations , and suitable logic added to alter the ALU function select inputs .
This does , however , add delay to the critical timing path of the CPU .
Interrupts
Two kinds of interrupts can be added easily to the PISC .
Microinterrupts can be implemented by having the interrupt set a flip - flop , changing the program counter in the fetch pseudo - instruction from R7 to R6 .
R6 must be dedicated as an interrupt service register , and an additional control signal must be decoded to reset the flip - flop .
( The RCA 1802 used a similar interrupt scheme . )
Macrointerrupts can be recognized by the microinterpreter by adding a conditional skip and an interrupt service routine to the microinterpreter .
The interrupt input is connected to the carry input multiplexer , replacing the little - used A=B input .
The interpreter is slowed by only one microinstruction .
In either case , registers and the status latch must be saved and restored by microcode .
Logic to disable the interrupt inputs is desirable .
Multiple Memory Spaces
Many processors , such as the PDP - 11 , enforce a division of instruction and data space .
Since the bits that select the PISC address register are available , and R7 is the program counter , a three - input NAND gate can produce an " instruction space " enable signal .
This signal is correctly asserted for immediate addressing mode .
Further segmentation of the memory space depends upon the register assignment for the macro machine .
One 2 - to - 4 decoder can identify microcode , macrocode , stack , and data spaces in the threaded stack machine .
( This is suggestive of the 80x86 . )
Parallelism
If the microcode memory space is separate from main memory , the fetch and execute phases can occur in parallel , and each microinstruction can execute in one clock cycle ( Fig. 2 ) .
A 12 - bit ( optionally 16 - bit ) counter serves as a rudimentary microsequencer .
This liberates the ALU from its sequencer role , and eliminates the need for the fetch pseudo - instruction .
Each clock cycle fetches a microinstruction from the microprogram ROM .
Absolute jumps are still possible by loading the counter from the ALU or Data bus .
But ALU operations on the program counter are no longer permitted , eliminating the relative branch , conditional skip , and immediate addressing capabilities .
Microinterrupts are also lost ; macrointerrupts become impractical .
Since each microinstruction is executed one clock cycle after it is fetched ( Fig. 2 ) , a jump instruction will experience a one - clock - cycle delay , and the instruction following a jump will always be executed .
This is the " delayed branch " seen in most microprogrammed machines and some pipelined RISC machines .
With this configuration , a main memory access need not complete in one clock cycle .
The limiting factors in clock speed are the ALU path and the microinstruction ROM .
Preliminary studies indicate that the clock speed of the PISC can be doubled , with two clock cycles required for a main memory reference .
Load / Store ( RISC - like ) Operation
A further modification ( Fig. 3 ) re-unifies the microcode and macrocode memories .
During ALU operations the address buffer is disabled , and fetch and execution remain simultaneous .
But during a memory load or store , the output of the PC is tri-stated and the address buffer enabled , allowing the ALU to address the main memory ( PROM ' and RAM ' ) .
The count input of the PC is also disabled , and the IR is loaded with a " dummy " instruction ( NOP ) .
After the memory access is complete , the dummy instruction executes and the PC fetches the next instruction .
In this configuration the PISC can be viewed as a load / store architecture [ 3 ] .
Like a RISC machine , all instructions execute in one clock cycle , except for memory references which require two .
If the address buffer is bidirectional , the PC can be routed to the ALU .
This restores the relative branch , conditional skip , and immediate addressing capabilities .
The " Mutable PISC "
It would be unreasonable to hand students " a bag of parts " and a wirewrap tool , and expect them to construct the PISC as a class exercise .
More attractive to the student , and perhaps less attractive to the experimenter , would be a printed - circuit - board of the basic PISC and its simpler enhancements .
This is envisioned as the PISC - 2 ( Fig. 3 ) .
The PISC - 2 will use the Am29705 register file instead of the obsolescent and scarce 74172 .
This will require the addition of a 16 - bit Data latch , and a few more control signals .
Rather than expand the microinstruction word , a minimal function decoder will be added .
By judicious insertion and removal of components , the PISC - 2 can be configured as a PISC - 1 ( two - clock instructions ) , a separate microprogram machine , or a load / store machine .
Program development in the " unified memory " configurations could be via keypad and display , or an RS - 232 serial port , using an on - board monitor program .
Conclusions
An educational drawback of the PISC is its abysmal implementation of " conventional " ( 1- or 2 - operand ) macromachines .
This is a consequence of the PISC 's original " mission " : a stack processor using a minimum of standard TTL logic ( 2100 gates ) .
But the PISC - 1 vividly teaches that power does not necessarily imply complexity .
Compare the speed of a 5 MHz PISC - 1a to a 5 MHz 8086 , when executing eForth primitives ( given as number of 200 nsec clock cycles ) :

President Obama could n't have been clearer about his take on the so - called war on drugs .
In 2004 , he called decades of get - tough law enforcement " an utter failure . "
So it does n't come as much of a surprise that the new attorney general , Eric Holder , hinted this month that the new administration will take a radically new approach to one drug issue in particular — medical marijuana .
" What [ President Obama ] said during the campaign is now American policy , " Holder told a news conference this week .
Despite Obama 's well - known views , federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents raided a few pot dispensaries in California two days after his inauguration , despite a state law permitting limited use and sale of medical marijuana .
The raid came before Holder 's confirmation , and it seems that no one in the new administration told the DEA to stop raiding some of the state 's storefront dispensaries .
The DEA has hit a few dozen every year since they began appearing in 2003 .
This time , the agency was continuing on autopilot under Michele Leonhart , a holdover from the Bush years who remains in charge of DEA until a successor is picked .
The White House moved quickly to quiet the nervous uproar from the outraged left .
" Federal resources should not be used to circumvent state laws , " says Nick Shapiro , an Obama spokesman .
Holder 's latest remarks appear to signal that the raids will end .
The approach to states ' rights in this case , however , is a notable departure from the one used to desegregate schools , close military bases , prosecute civil rights abuses , and link a drinking age to federal highway funds .
" Frankly , it 's extremely rare for the federal government to allow the states to say that something is legal when the federal law says the opposite , " says Paul Rothstein , a law professor at Georgetown University .
Not enforcing federal law in this instance is perhaps just a more politically palatable way of acknowledging how the political landscape of marijuana has changed in the past few years , says Bill Piper , director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance , which pushes for more lenient drug laws .
Legal experts say whether Obama continues the DEA raids against the dispensaries — which now seems highly unlikely — is beside the point .
A dozen states now have laws similar to California 's , although often less permissive , and surveys show that the public generally supports some limited relaxation of drug laws for medical marijuana .
States with swollen , costly prison populations are rethinking their sentencing policies for all kinds of nonviolent drug offenders .
The New York State Legislature is considering revamping the most famous of these codes , the Rockefeller laws , which would be the first such move by the state in a generation .
Meanwhile , advocates of revamping the nation 's drug laws encourage Obama to take a page from Franklin Roosevelt , who spent his first few days in office fixing the crippled banking industry before overturning Prohibition .
They wave economic studies , arguing that ending marijuana prohibition would create billions in tax revenue and allow cops to focus on more serious offenses .
Repealing the 18th Amendment sent millions of dollars into government coffers by 1934 when breweries turned on the taps .
" We 're not there yet , but ending these punitive DEA raids is a very encouraging step , " says Piper .
But with a vice president who helped create the position of White House drug czar , Obama seems unlikely to take radical steps .
Throughout the campaign , he stated clearly that he was not in favor of legalizing marijuana .
Yet incremental moves can be powerful .
This article just highlights how out of touch the Limbaugh National Committee really are :
Nationally syndicated conservative radio talk show host Mike Gallagher lamented this morning that his failure to sell his own house , that he recently placed on the market , was due to the psychological effects burdening the wealthy resulting from the class warfare propagated by President Barack Obama and Congressional Democrats .
Gallagher was attempting to make the case that the economic policies of Democrats in D.C. have driven fear into the rich , which has translated into the wealthy being too scared to spend their money .
As a result , wealth is not having the ‘ trickle down effect ’ on the nation ’s working class who rely on the nation 's upper class for jobs .
--
" I decided to put my house on the market .
Three weeks .
And it ’s a house – and I ’m not bragging – it ’s a house with a ‘ wow factor . ’
You walk into the house and you go , ‘ Wow . ’
It ’s got all the nice little bells and whistles , it ’s got the electric shades that go up and down , and the sound system , and the beautiful pool .
I ’m a lucky guy .
Three weeks – not a single phone call . "
As long as I have been a scientist , I have lived with my colleagues ’ view that one cannot promote the acceptance of evolution in this country without catering to the faithful .
This comes from the idea that many religious people who would otherwise accept evolution wo n’t do so if they think it undermines their faith , promoting atheism or immoral behavior .
Thus various organizations promoting the teaching of evolution , including the National Academy of Sciences and the National Center for Science Education , have published booklets or websites that explicitly say that faith and science are compatible .
In other words , that is their official position .
In contrast , the view of many other scientists that faith and science ( or reason ) are incompatible is ignored or disparaged .
As evidence for the compatibility , these organizations incessantly repeat that many scientists are religious and that many of the faithful accept evolution .
While this proves compatibility in the trivial sense , it does n’t show , as I ’ve pointed out elsewhere , that the two views are philosophically compatible .
As an example of the “ official position ” of some groups on compatibility , an alert reader sent me the URL of a site at The University of California at Berkeley , Understanding Science 101 , that discusses the nature of science and how it ’s done .
There are a lot of good resources at this site , but perusing it I found , to my dismay , a sub - site that pushes the compatibility between science and faith :
With the loud protests of a small number of religious groups over teaching scientific concepts like evolution and the Big Bang in public schools , and the equally loud proclamations of a few scientists with personal , anti-religious philosophies , it can sometimes seem as though science and religion are at war .
News outlets offer plenty of reports of school board meetings , congressional sessions , and Sunday sermons in which scientists and religious leaders launch attacks at one another .
But just how representative are such conflicts ?
Not very .
The attention given to such clashes glosses over the far more numerous cases in which science and religion harmoniously , and even synergistically , coexist .
In fact , people of many different faiths and levels of scientific expertise see no contradiction at all between science and religion .
Many simply acknowledge that the two institutions deal with different realms of human experience .
Science investigates the natural world , while religion deals with the spiritual and supernatural — hence , the two can be complementary .
Many religious organizations have issued statements declaring that there need not be any conflict between religious faith and the scientific perspective on evolution .
Furthermore , contrary to stereotype , one certainly does n’t have to be an atheist in order to become a scientist .
A 2005 survey of scientists at top research universities found that more than 48 % had a religious affiliation and more than 75 % believe that religions convey important truths .
2
Some scientists — like Francis Collins , former director of the National Human Genome Research Institute , and George Coyne , astronomer and priest — have been outspoken about the satisfaction they find in viewing the world through both a scientific lens and one of personal faith .
It seems to me that we can defend evolution without having to cater to the faithful at the same time .
Why not just show that evolution is TRUE and its alternatives are not ?
Why kowtow to those whose beliefs many of us find unpalatable , just to sell our discipline ?
There are , in fact , two disadvantages to the “ cater - to - religion ” stance .
1 . By trotting out those “ religious scientists ” , like Ken Miller , or those “ scientific theologians , ” like John Haught , we are tacitly putting our imprimatur on their beliefs , including beliefs that God acts in the world today ( theism ) , suspending natural laws .
For example , I do n’t subscribe to Miller ’s belief that God acts immanently in the world , perhaps by influencing events on the quantum level , or that God created the laws of physics so that human - containing planets could evolve .
I do not agree with John Haught ’s theology .
I do not consider any faith that touts God ’s intervention in the world ( even in the past ) as compatible with science .
Do my colleagues at the NAS or the NCSE disagree ?
2 . The statement that learning evolution does not influence one ’s religious belief is palpably false .
There are plenty of statistics that show otherwise , including the negative correlation of scientific achievement with religious belief and the negative correlation among nations in degree of belief in God with degree of acceptance of evolution .
All of us know this , but we pretend otherwise .
( In my book I note that “ enlightened ” religion can be compatible with science , but by “ englightened ” I meant a complete , hands - off deism . )
I think it is hypocrisy to pretend that learning evolution will not affect either the nature or degree of one ’s faith .
It does n’t always , but it does more often than we admit , and there are obvious reasons why ( I wo n’t belabor these ) .
I hate to see my colleagues pretending that faith and science live in nonoverlapping magisteria .
They know better .
Because of this , I think that organizations promoting the teaching of evolution should do just that , and that alone .
Leave religion and its compatibility with faith to the theologians .
That ’s not our job .
Our job is to show that evolution is true and creationism and ID are n’t .
End of story .
In 25 years of effort , these organizations do n’t seem to have had much effect on influencing public opinion about evolution .
I think that this may mean that our nation will have to become a lot less religious before acceptance of evolution increases appreciably .
Android Community has learned that Archos is working on a Mobile Internet Device that will run Android , have phone functionality and use the TI OMAP 3 processor ( same as the Palm Pre ) .

The device was revealed by Texas Instruments in a press release for the OMAP 3 chip , but revolved around fairly vague details .
What is known is that the device will have a five - inch screen , support HD playback , have a 10 mm thickness and support Flash .
What is n't clear is why the press release keeps making a distinctions between the phone and mobile internet tablet functionalities , instead of just calling it a smartphone .
But until we know the specifics , we 'll just have to go along with it .

Even in today ’s environmentally - aware times , many scoff at solar powered cars as an impractical fantasy with no hope of real - world success .
And it ’s true that solar energy wont be replacing gasoline in the immediate ( 1 - 5 year ) future .
However , that has n’t stopped some of the best and brightest minds in automotive engineering from trying .
As proof , here are 12 solar powered concept cars that might be turning heads on the world ’s roads and highways in years to come !
The Koenigsegg Quant
( Image via Wired )
If you have n’t already heard of Koenigsegg , expect to soon .
The Swedish supercar firm has developed a concept car called the Quant utilizing a most unlikely combination of power sources : solar energy and pyrite , otherwise known as fool ’s gold .
A company spokesperson at the Geneva Motor Show was quoted as saying the Quant will have a 300 mile range and take just 20 minutes to fully recharge .
The Peugeot Shoo
( Images via iGreenSpot , DeviceDaily )
One of the more futuristic - looking solar concept cars , the Peugeot Shoo utilizes a triangular design and a solar paneled roof to power the engine .
According to DeviceDaily , the design was inspired by a boat and much of the car ’s aerodynamism is due to that .
The Italdesign Giugiaro Quaranta
The Quaranta is one of the most sleek and dynamic solar concept cars currently in existence .
Its batteries are powered completely by solar energy , which is collected via panels positioned on the roof and front end of the vehicle .
While the bulk of the Quaranta was designed by Italdesign Giugiaro , Toyota contributed its expertise to the sophisticated electronics .
The Mercedes - Benz Formula Zero
( Images via DeviceDaily , VHXN )
Mercedez - Benz made its name in luxury , not eco-friendliness , so it might come as a surprise that the company is now placing its hat in the solar - powered car ring .
Pictured above is the Formula Zero , a concept car that was entered into 2008 ’s Design Los Angeles Challenge .
It is propelled by electric motors on each of its 4 wheels and batteries that draw their power from an aero-efficient solar layer .
The Antro Solo

The Hungarian - built Astro Solo and its one - of - a- kind design get an astounding 150MPG , using a combination of solar and gas-electric power .
During good weather , the solar panels on the roof are sufficient to power the car on brief 15 - 25 kilometer trips .
When the skies are overcast , the Astro Solo defaults to a small electric engine or – get this – the foot pedaling of the three passengers !
The 1987 GM Sunraycer
( Image via GeekWithLaptop )
Solar concept cars are not an entirely new development .
One of the more eye - catching and intriguing throwbacks is the 1987 GM Sunraycer , a concept car built for Australia ’s World Solar Competition and never put into mass production .
The Sunraycer ’s 8,800 on - board solar cells generated about 1,500 watts of power , propelling this bad boy to top speeds of 68MPH and easily winning the competition .
The SEAT Brisa
If it looks more like a leisurely bicycle for two than an automobile , this was precisely the creator ’s intention .
As CarDailyNews says , the SEAT Brisa “ was not designed for a non -stop trip from Madrid to Barcelona , but as a recreational , fun vehicle . ”
Unlike many solar powered cars that have the panels plainly visible on the roof , the solar apperatus of the Brisa is hidden beneath the translucent body .
The Mindset Six50
The Six50 ( on pace for a scheduled 2009 unveiling ) can go 100 KM on a single battery charge , drawing its power from roof - mounted solar panels .
One major advantage of the Six50 is its price : although not currently in production , it has been estimated that Mindset will offer the Six50 for as little as 31,000 Euros , a pittance compared to many newer hybrids .
The Lotus Eco Elise
Unveiled at the 2008 British Motor Show , the Lotus Eco Elise has marched boldly into new territory – eco-friendly sports cars .
And while the Eco Elise is still somewhat of a gas guzzler , one appreciates the embrace of energy saving technology like the solar panels that power the car ’s electrical system ( including its iPod / MP3 compatible stereo ! )
The Enigma
( Image via Lostinasupermarket )
This slick solar - powered vehicle was one of the winners at the Royal College of Art ’s Green Concept Car competition .
It was designed by Paul Howse and relies upon electric , solar - powered motors for propulsion .
Unfortunately , seeing as this was only designed for a competition , it ’s unclear whether this car will ever actually go into production .
The Solar - Powered Volvo
Volvo made its name in safety , not solar , but that has n’t stopped them from developing this eco-friendly monster !
Created in anticipation of the 2015 Dakar Rally , the vehicle combines solar energy and fuel cells to support its diesel engine .
Thus far , it might qualify as the biggest and baddest solar concept car around !
The Eve

The Eve , pictured here , utilizes a specially coated windshield enabling it to harness solar rays and convert them into usable energy that powers the car .
The rest of Eve ’s energy comes from its body , made from a mixture of polymers that uses the friction of its turning wheels to generate electricity .
Man shooting pellets at pigeons prompts school lockdowns
Two schools in Henderson went on lockdown this morning after police received a report of a man with a gun in the neighborhood .
David Erbach , principal at Mannion Middle School , said the school was told by CCSD Police to enter lockdown mode about 7:45 a.m .
All doors were locked and the school ’s 1,630 students stayed in their classrooms .
Smalley Elementary School and its 800 students also went on lockdown , Erbach said .
Henderson Police responded to the area of Greenway Road and Du Fort Avenue about 7:45 a.m. after receiving a 911 call about a person with a gun .
Officers found a man with a pellet gun who was shooting at pigeons , said Henderson Police spokesman Keith Paul .
A report was taken but no arrests were made .
The lockdown was lifted at 8:02 a.m. and both schools resumed their normal activities .

To quote Ed the Sock : “ If you do n’t have anything good to say , say it often . ”
This might explain why the word tax appears more than 1,000 times in last month ’s federal budget , while overstretched and out - of - work Canadians receive little meaningful support .
In fact , Stephen Harper ’s budget calls for more than $ 20 billion in “ new tax relief ” , including “ reducing corporate income taxes so that Canada will have the lowest statutory corporate tax rate in the G7 by 2012 . ”
Responsible governments pay for necessities first .
And the budget — apart from promising $ 500 million to digitize health records — does nothing to improve the quality of our lives through readily accessible , quality health care .
South of the border , Americans are learning the hard way about the long - term costs of neglecting health care .
Last December , after eight years of deep - reaching tax cuts , the congressional budget office reported : “ The rising costs of health care and health insurance pose a serious threat to the future fiscal condition of the United States . ”
It concluded that without government action , spending on health care would increase to 25 percent of the country ’s gross domestic product by 2025 , up from 16 percent in 2007 .
A December 18 New York Times article on the proposed U.S. stimulus package underscored the scale of the problem : “ About a fifth of the [up to $ 1 trillion ] Obama package could go toward health care ”
¦The biggest piece would be up to $ 100 billion to subsidize the states ’ growing Medicaid caseloads of the poor . ”
Unfortunately , Canada is on the same trajectory .
From 1993 to 2005 , Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin systematically underfunded our public - health - care system .
The resulting declines in service created a market for private care where none existed before .
Private , for - profit clinics like Vancouver ’s Cambie Surgery Centre emerged and began drawing much - needed nurses and doctors away from the public system .
Now , with Liberal backing , the Harper government is pushing us closer to the health - care brink .
And neither party is listening to Canadians .
A January 14 Nanos poll asked Canadians how important it was for the government to increase investment in public services such as health care and education during an economic downturn .
Of those who responded , 70 percent ranked it important ( 25.3 percent ) or very important ( 44.5 percent ) .
Nine percent felt it was unimportant .
These results prompted James Clancy , president of the National Union of Public and General Employees ( which commissioned the poll ) to say in a release : “ It ’s not all about tax cuts and bailouts in the minds of Canadians .
It ’s about people , jobs , and protecting our social safety net during tough times . ”
Investments in health care would constitute an economic stimulus , creating jobs while protecting those without employment .
As Kathleen Connors , chair of the Canadian Health Coalition , pointed out in a January 13 release : “ More than one in 10 Canadians work in this third - largest sector of the economy , and our public health - care system protects Canadians from one of the most devastating consequences of economic downturn in the United States , the loss of health care . ”
Connors also opposed the turn toward private health care , noting that “ Privatized , for - profit health care has become an increasingly serious threat that forces people to pay more ” ¦ and receive less . ”
In the United States , a family of four lucky enough to have access to an employer - supported health plan pays more than $ 12,000 per year for coverage .
Many millions of less fortunate Americans are uninsured .
It ’s a terrible model to emulate , and yet the Canadian Independent Medical Clinics Association has just launched a suit in B.C. Supreme Court asking to have patient - access restrictions at their private , for - profit clinics struck down .
The clinics —led by the ubiquitous Dr. Brian Day — base their argument on a 2005 Canadian Supreme Court judgment known as Chaoulli v. Québec ( Attorney General ) .
That court held that a Quebec ban on private insurance for medically necessary services violated the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms because long wait times in the public system endangered life and personal security .
The argument would fail if the public system were adequately funded .
Adequate funding would also save money by creating a healthier , happier , more productive population .
The market might be good at some short - term decisions , but — as the economic crisis has demonstrated — it cannot be trusted with long - term public policy .
Privatizing health care divides societies into those who can and cannot pay .
It undermines communities by promoting selfishness and inequality .
Nobody should have to choose between putting food on the table and accessing quality , timely health care .
As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said : “ Of all the forms of inequality , injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane . ”
Harper ’s tax cuts are the wrong prescription for Canada .
Let ’s build up the country instead of running it down .
Enlarge Wieck ' Consumer Reports ' magazine said the 2009 Toyota Prius Touring edition offers the best value for a new car .
JOIN THE DISCUSSION JOIN THE DISCUSSION
Talk about cars at USA TODAY 's Auto Forum : Discuss all things automotive in our new car forum with reporter Jayne O'Donnell .
Today : Will Ford avoid a financial crisis ?
Consumer Reports magazine 's new automaker for reliability , even as the pair seek billions more in federal loans to stay afloat .
Chrysler and General Motors ( GM ) took the bottom two spots , respectively , inmagazine 's new automaker for reliability , even as the pair seek billions more in federal loans to stay afloat .
The third of Detroit 's Big 3 automakers , Ford Motor , fared better at fourth from the bottom , also beating Suzuki .
First place went to Honda ( HMC ) for the third - consecutive year , followed by Subaru , Toyota ( TM ) and Mazda .
Next came a tie by Mercedes - Benz , Nissan , Volkswagen and BMW , among the 15 makers rated .
They were followed by Hyundai , Volvo and Mitsubishi .
AUTOS FORUM : Do you think GM should be allowed to fail ?
The rankings are based on a combination of the magazine 's cumulative tests on automakers ' models and predicted reliability based on readers ' responses on their 1.4 million cars .
It is a widely watched measure in the auto industry because of the non-profit 's reputation for independence .
" Chrysler is a sad story , " says David Champion , the magazine 's auto testing chief .
" The new models have missed the mark in terms of our testing and consumer appeal . "
While GM received critical acclaim for its Buick Enclave crossover and Cadillac CTS sedan , only the Chevy Malibu sedan achieved better - than - average reliability in the ratings , Champion said .
While a Honda Accord may lack pizazz , it 's so reliable , " It will save you money in the long run , " Champion said .
Chrysler issued a statement saying that it has reduced its warranty claims by 30 % , so that it expects to see an improvement in the rankings next year .
GM has lots of older models in the lineup that bring down the results , spokeswoman Janine Fruehan says .
The magazine recognized improved quality in some of GM's new vehicles , " but we have work to do on the reliability front , " Fruehan says .
In December , GM and Chrysler were granted a total of $ 17.4 billion in federal loans to keep operating through the recession .
GM is seeking another $ 16.6 billion in loans , while Chrysler wants another $ 5 billion .

All of Fiction Costs $ 125 Million
As we all know , Google recently bought all out - of - print fiction from the " Author 's Guild " for $ 125 million dollars .
This laughable , ludicrously small price is the kind of price that somebody would only offer for something that they did n't actually own .
You know , like Napoleon selling Louisiana to America in order to pay for his war in Europe .
And then America sends Louis and Clark out to explore , and it turns out there are all these dirty fucking NATIVES there .
Luckily , they need blankets .
Anyway , Gawker recently leaked the memo that the " Author 's Guild " sent out to writers and publishers who will be receiving the payments that the " Author 's Guild " negotiated on their behalf .
Note : writers and publishers will be receiving $ 45 million of the settlement , which is ( I 'm not a mathematician ) less than half of the agreed - upon $ 125 million dollar payout .
The rest of the money will be going to lawyers and ( I guess ) the " Authors Guild " to help fund their next act of heroism .
The " Author 's Guild " memo contains instructions for " claiming your book " from Google .
Here is instruction number one : " 1 . If you file your claim by January 5 , 2010 , and a book in which you have a copyright interest [ THAT YOU WROTE ] is scanned by Google before May 5 , 2009 , you will be entitled to a small share ( at least $ 60 per book , but up to $ 300 , depending on the number of claims [ DON'T GET GREEDY ] )
" So , the verdict is in , and the settlement to writers is that they will each receive less than $ 300 bucks for their stolen books .
Here 's a short history : writers got mad that GOOGLE WAS STEALING THEIR BOOKS BY SCANNING THEM WITHOUT ASKING AND MAKING THEM AVAILABLE ONLINE , writers appealed to the " Author 's Guild " for help , the " Author 's Guild " settled with Google for $ 125 million instead of taking the claim to trial and declaring Google 's practice illegal , and now each writer gets almost enough money to buy a handgun at Wal - Mart to blow their brains out .
Here 's Robert Darnton writing about " Google and the Future of Books " for the " New York Review of Books " : " As an unintended consequence , Google will enjoy what can only be called a monopoly -- a monopoly of a new kind , not of railroads or steel but of access to information .
Google has no serious competitors .
Microsoft dropped its major program to digitize books several months ago , and other enterprises like the Open Knowledge Commons ( formerly the Open Content Alliance ) and the Internet Archive are minute and ineffective in comparison with Google .
Google alone has the wealth to digitize on a massive scale .
And having settled with the authors and publishers , it can exploit its financial power from within a protective legal barrier ; for the class action suit covers the entire class of authors and publishers .
No new entrepreneurs will be able to digitize books within that fenced - off territory , even if they could afford it , because they would have to fight the copyright battles all over again .
If the settlement is upheld by the court , only Google will be protected from copyright liability .
" Google 's record suggests that it will not abuse its double - barreled fiscal - legal power .
But what will happen if its current leaders sell the company or retire ?
The public will discover the answer from the prices that the future Google charges , especially the price of the institutional subscription licenses .
The settlement leaves Google free to negotiate deals with each of its clients , although it announces two guiding principles : " ( 1 ) the realization of revenue at market rates for each Book and license on behalf of the Rightsholders and ( 2 ) the realization of broad access to the Books by the public , including institutions of higher education . " " Apart from Wikipedia , Google already controls the means of access to information online for most Americans , whether they want to find out about people , goods , places , or almost anything .
In addition to the original " Big Google , " we have Google Earth , Google Maps , Google Images , Google Labs , Google Finance , Google Arts , Google Food , Google Sports , Google Health , Google Checkout , Google Alerts , and many more Google enterprises on the way .
Now Google Book Search promises to create the largest library and the largest book business that have ever existed .
" Whether or not I have understood the settlement correctly , its terms are locked together so tightly that they can not be pried apart .
At this point , neither Google , nor the authors , nor the publishers , nor the district court is likely to modify the settlement substantially .
Yet this is also a tipping point in the development of what we call the information society .
If we get the balance wrong at this moment , private interests may outweigh the public good for the foreseeable future , and the Enlightenment dream may be as elusive as ever .
" I 'm not as paranoid as Darnton .
What Google can steal from writers , hackers can steal from Google .
But how to make it pay ?
How to make it good ?
How to keep fiction writers fed ?
Scanning text and making it available online does not sell fiction or add value to stories .
I believe that the future " publishers " are coders , video game developers , and zine punks who know the value of layout , DIY , and clear , brilliant images .
I believe that in the hands of the right people -- people sufficiently lubricated with investment cash -- ebooks could be beautiful .
So beautiful that people would pay to read them .
So beautiful that people would pay to collect them , even though they could read them for free someplace else .
Let Google be today 's modern , private mercantile library system .
Soon they will be competing with the first nation - state ( China ? Sweden ? ) to steal everything from Google , nationalize it , and let the world drink it for free .
And then will come the monks to illuminate the electronic texts .
Forever , gloriously , without end .
A Strong Start for Obama – But Hardly a Bipartisan One Still , 56 % think the country is in " a serious long - term decline . "
Feb. 23 , 2009  -- Barack Obama 's month - old presidency is off to a strong start , marked by the largest lead over the opposition party in trust to handle the economy for a president in polls dating back nearly 20 years .
But the post - partisanship he 's championed looks as elusive as ever .
What Grade Would You Give President Obama On His First Month in Office ?
Tell ABC News .
Among the challenges , Obama 's ratings , while high overall , are marked by the sharp political divisions he 's struggled to overcome .
Backing for his economic stimulus is more broad than deep , with somewhat muted expectations for its success .
And concerns about the federal budget deficit are running high .
Click here for PDF with charts and full questionnaire .
Nonetheless Obama clearly holds the upper hand , both in overall approval and on the dominant issue of the day .
He leads the Republicans in Congress by 61 - 26 percent in trust to handle the economy , the biggest such lead for a president in ABC News / Washington Post polls since late 1991 .
( Bill Clinton came close at the start of his first term . )
More broadly , 68 percent of Americans approve of Obama 's job performance to date , not atypical for an incoming president ( it precisely matches Ronald Reagan 's first - month rating , and trails George H.W. Bush 's ) but a striking counterpoint to George W. Bush 's departing 33 percent approval last month .
Bush had n't seen a 68 in five and a half years .
Partisanship , though , seems inescapable : Obama 's approval rating , 90 percent among Democrats , dives to 37 percent among Republicans – a rating equally as partisan ( in the other direction ) as Bush 's initial approval after the disputed election of 2000 .
Support for Obama 's stimulus plan , similarly , is 64 percent overall , but half that , 32 percent , among Republicans .
Reasons include their sharply lower confidence that the plan will work , their sharply higher concern about the federal budget deficit – and broad concerns about adequate oversight of all that federal spending .
If Obama 's hopes for a post - partisan presidency are falling short , he does get credit for trying – another area in which he far outpoints the opposition .
Seventy - three percent of Americans say he 's been trying to compromise with Republican leaders in Congress on important issues .
Fewer than half as many , 34 percent , say the Republicans are trying to compromise with him .
In a related rating , 68 percent say Obama is " bringing needed change to Washington , " the campaign promise he rode to Washington through the primaries and the general election alike .
Again , though , Republicans are less than half as likely as Democrats to say so .
Deficit Worries and Partisan Politics
There 's also been a dramatic advance – if still highly partisan – in views that the nation is headed in the right direction , up from 8 percent in October ( a low in 35 years of polls ) to 31 percent today .
That change has occurred entirely among Democrats and Democratic - leaning independents , up from 4 percent " right direction " in October to 43 percent now .
Among leaned Republicans it 's been flat , 13 percent then , 15 percent now .
Obama addresses a joint session of Congress tomorrow night .
DEFICIT – The deficit , on which Obama was holding a White House summit today , is a rare issue of broad agreement : Eighty - seven percent of Americans say they 're concerned about it , including more than eight in 10 Democrats , Republicans and independents alike .
But the number who are " very concerned " about the deficit has risen by 10 points since mid-December , the increase occurring exclusively among Republicans and Republican - leaning independents - from 47 percent " very concerned " in December to 73 percent now .
( And among people who strongly oppose the stimulus plan – chiefly Republicans – even more , 81 percent , are highly concerned about the deficit . )
The agenda for Obama 's summit included Social Security and Medicare , two critical programs whose financial integrity is in broad doubt .
Just 39 percent of Americans are confident Social Security will be able to pay them their full benefits throughout their retirement ; about the same number , 37 percent , think they 'll get adequate health coverage from Medicare .
Far fewer are " very confident " of these – 11 and 8 percent , respectively .
PARTISANS and POLITICS –
If tenacious partisanship is a disappointment to Obama , it may be a bigger bummer for the Republicans , whose party remains greatly weakened after the long - unpopular Bush presidency .
Three results tell the story :
• The Democratic Party leads the Republicans by 56 - 30 percent in trust to handle the country 's main problems .
That has slightly improved from 56 - 23 percent in December , as congressional Republicans found a unified voice in opposition to the stimulus .
But the December number was the Republicans ' worst in ABC / Post polls since 1982 ; they still have far to climb .
• Fifty percent of Americans approve of the way the Democrats in Congress are doing their jobs , while 44 percent disapprove – if hardly a barn - burner , still the Democrats ' best in two years , since April 2007 , just after they regained control of Congress .
And their Republican counterparts are a good deal weaker : 38 percent approve , 56 percent disapprove .
( Democratic gains have come mainly in two groups : among Democrats themselves , and among liberals .
Seventy - seven percent of Democrats now approve of their own party ; just 55 percent of Republicans feel the same about theirs . )
Obama Handling Economy , Stimulus
• The Democrats are holding the edge in partisan affiliation they 've built since 2004 , when the public soured on the Iraq war and the Bush presidency in turn .
Thirty - six percent in this poll identify themselves as Democrats , just 24 percent as Republicans .
On average in 2003 , by contrast , the parties were at parity , 31 percent apiece .
Ask independents how they lean and the split goes to 54 - 37 percent Democratic – a substantial advantage for Obama and his party even within the bounds of partisan preferences .
OBAMA / ECONOMY – Obama 's approval rating for handling the economy , 60 percent , is a bit lower than his rating overall , but not bad given the economy 's condition ; indeed , 56 percent think the country 's not in a normal downturn but something more threatening - " a serious long - term decline . "
That 's a level of gloom unseen since 1992 .
Obama 's approval rating on the economy , moreover , is 36 points higher than Bush 's departing rating on the same issue .
But the partisan gap here is especially large : Eighty - three percent of Democrats approve of Obama 's economic work .
Twenty - four percent of Republicans agree .
In another area , 64 percent approve of Obama 's handling of appointments to his Cabinet and other key government positions – despite some flubs , notably in his selections to lead the Health and Human Services and Commerce departments .
STIMULUS – While , as noted , 64 percent in this poll support the stimulus package , " strong " support is lower , 34 percent , and down 9 points from January .
It 's declined by 16 points among independents , 11 among Republicans .
The deficit is not the only concern .
While 58 percent are confident the stimulus will make the recession less severe , just 13 percent are " very confident " of it .
And 63 percent think more economic stimulus ultimately will be needed .
Also , while 62 percent think the stimulus will help their local economy , fewer , 46 percent , expect it to improve their own personal financial situation .
Nonetheless , that 's 15 points more than said so about Clinton 's economic package in February 1993 .
There 's another red flag :
Fewer than half of Americans , 46 percent , are confident the federal government will put in place adequate controls to oversee the stimulus spending ; 52 percent think not .
That 's better than the views of Bush 's controls on TARP spending – 69 percent saw those as inadequate .
But it 's hardly a ringing endorsement of the controls Obama 's pledged to put in place .
Differences by Age and Income
There are areas beyond the stimulus spending for which Obama has support .
Seventy - six percent favor stricter regulations of banks and financial institutions , and 64 percent favor Obama 's $ 75 billion plan to provide mortgage refinance assistance .
But the Detroit automakers are another issue : Sixty - eight percent of Americans oppose providing them with the additional federal loans they 've requested , even if needed to stave off bankruptcy – another of the relatively few issues on which substantial majorities of Democrats , independents and Republicans agree .
GROUPS – Beyond partisanship there are some notable differences across groups .
Young people were a core support group for Obama in the election , and remain so ; among adults under age 30 his overall approval rating peaks at a startling 84 percent , compared with 59 percent in his weakest age group , seniors .
Preference for Obama over the Republicans to handle to economy similarly peaks among young people , at 71 percent ; among middle - aged Americans that drops to 49 percent .
There are income gaps here as well ; among people with incomes less than $ 50,000 , 66 percent approve of Obama 's handling of the economy ; among those in $ 100,000 + households , this drops to half .
Two possible reasons : Better - off Americans are more apt to be Republicans .
And they 're in Obama 's crosshairs on taxes .
METHODOLOGY – This ABC News / Washington
Post poll was conducted by telephone Feb. 19 - 22 , 2009 , among a random national sample of 1,001 adults including both landline and cell phone - only respondents .

If Microsoft releases Internet Explorer 8 this week — as expected — then the company will likely be congratulated by many for doing the right thing and finally adding support for web standards to its browser .
For years , Microsoft has gone its own way online with its own IE rendering engine .
That 's forced web developers to either build one version of their web sites for IE and another for all those other browsers that do implement HTML and CSS in a broadly consistent way or simply to target IE and get to the others later — or never .
That 's distorted the market .
When IE 8 does arrive , though , whatever standards support it offers is n't going to satisfy the browser company whose complaint over lack of web standards support and bundling of IE with Windows spurred the European Union into investigating Microsoft last year .
That case has now attracted the backing of browser competitors Google and Mozilla .
Opera Software chief executive Jon von Tetzchner told The Reg that while Microsoft is headed in the right direction , IE continues to undermine open standards on the web .
The fundamental problem is Microsoft 's decision to allow users to continue to view billions of old pages optimized for non-compliant IE 6 and 7 that would otherwise be scrambled in IE 8 .
As far as von Tetzchner is concerned , that 's not just bad for companies like Opera that must continue wasting time and money simply updating sites built for IE 6 and 7 to work with their browsers .
It also means that Microsoft continues to exert undue and damaging influence over the web .
" We want to see there 's competition and a referee — to make sure everybody follows the rules and ensure there 's competition in the market , " von Tetzchner said .
Von Tetzchner has little truck with the dual rendering approach Microsoft 's taken on IE , and he clearly believes Microsoft could have leveraged its size to kill the issue once and for all with IE 8 .
" Microsoft has a unique position — the fact is , as soon as they have a browser out there they get massive volumes , people are going to code for them .
It 's only a matter of time .
It 's a lot more difficult for the competition , " he said .
But the company 's size and presence has a negative side .
Von Tetzchner is worried that after Microsoft 's hiatus on browser development in the early 2000s , the company is back in the game and that it can crush the competition by pumping out IE through Windows desktops .
This raises the further risk that the web becomes distorted , as innovation will be dictated at the pace Microsoft chooses to move at and on technologies that it favors .
It 's noteworthy that while Microsoft has adopted the World Wide Web Consortium 's ( W3C's ) HTML 5 and CSS 2.1 in IE 8 , it has not employed Scalable Vector Graphics ( SVG ) that has been employed by Mozilla , Google , and Opera and is also from the W3C stable .
" The risk we are seeing is Microsoft is back and now working on the browser and the fact they did n't work on the browser gave room for the competition … if Microsoft provides a better product you might see a reversal of the trend — it 's a dangerous thing for the internet , " he said .
Recruiting God's Army Marysville Church Seeks Converts at Public Schools
Mark Kaufman
A church in Marysville has crossed the line from volunteering at local public schools to recruiting kids into a " cult , " says the mother of one of the students .
The Turning Point Church sends roughly a dozen adult " youth leaders " to six schools north of Everett , including Totem Middle School in Marysville , once a week , where they hang out during lunch hours , chat with students , and join in sports games .
" We can be someone in their life to say everything is going to be okay and God is still good , " says Emily Masten , one of the youth staff leaders and a receptionist for the church .
The youth leaders from Turning Point Church , which proposed the lunchtime visits , were allowed on campus to " increase adult presence at lunchtime " in the wake of chronic classroom disruptions , says Gail Miller , assistant superintendent of the Marysville School District .
The Washington State constitution prohibits " sectarian control or influence " in public schools .
But it 's unclear whether the church 's actions cross that line .
Doug Honig , a spokesman for the ACLU of Washington , says the intersection of religion and government must be taken on a case - by - case basis .
However , he notes , " public schools cannot sponsor or promote religious activities .
People who are invited onto school grounds by school officials are not permitted to proselytize students . "
In Marysville , problems arose in late February when an adult female church delegate sent a MySpace message to Totem parent Rianne Olver 's 11 - year - daughter , inviting her to an evening church meeting .
The church maintains a youth group called 180 and a subset group called 628 ( for kids from sixth through eighth grades ) .
" Hey , 628 tonight !
" 6 o clock , free espresso for visitors .
Super rad games and activities .
" Hang out with cool people .
Plus you are really cool so it would just make it that much cooler .
" Are you going to be there ?
If you need a ride , I can hook it up : ) "
" She even offered to come to my house and pick up my daughter without me knowing about it , " Olver says .
" I wonder how many other kids got this message and were so excited that an older person thinks they 're cool and wants to buy them espresso . "
The nondenominational church , which holds Sunday services at Totem Middle School , is unusual in other ways , too .
In one sermon , available on the church 's website , Pastor Mike Villamor says " Christians should be sex - perts . "
In YouTube videos , Villamor refers to elders in the congregation as " saints " and churchgoers refer to him as an " apostle . "
Villamor did not return repeated calls for comment .
Rick Ross , a court witness on " destructive religious groups , " runs a national online forum on organizations engaged in cultlike behavior .
The forum has a rich thread dedicated to the Turning Point Church , where former members and others express concern that the church is targeting children without telling their parents .
" In my experience , that leads to a breakdown in the family — a conflict between a child enthralled with the church organization and a parent who says , ' That is not my belief , ' " says Ross .
" The idea that any church would try to circumvent parents without notifying [ them ] in advance is shocking to me because the right of parents to decide the religious affiliation of their children is sacrosanct . "
Masten , the youth staff leader , dismisses the charge that the church is a " cult " .
" If people do n't understand something , there are two reactions :
You make fun of it or you get scared of it , " she says .
Masten confirms that youth leaders discuss the church and God with students on school property , but she says they do so only when asked .
However , she acknowledges that if students provide contact information , youth leaders invite them to evening meetings .
" Most youth leaders will do bulk texting to students they have met once or twice , " says Masten .
" It 's just like , ' Hey do you want to come over and hang out at my house ? ' " says Masten .
( Basically , adults directly soliciting social engagements from 11 - year - old children . )
Youth leaders may neglect to contact parents because it is " something that they are not really mindful of yet , " she says .
It 's something they will become mindful of soon .
After hearing Olver 's complaints , the Marysville School District called Turning Point Church to tell them they must cease lunchtime visits to Totem Middle School .
Miller , the assistant superintendent , says , " They can't proselytize and they cannot solicit individual students ' contact information . "
She adds : " We are doing an investigation because , if [ Olver ] is correct in that this is what is happening , that is inappropriate .
If students ask them questions , they can answer matter - of - factly , but they cannot seek them out . "
Students ' issues with the Turning Point Church are n't new .
More than four years ago , church delegates were on public school campuses during school hours , says one former student .
" People of various ages , [ in their ] 20s and older , were going around handing out these Bibles and saying that we should all go to Turning Point Church because it's a cool place to be , " says Nick Poling , 18 , who attended Totem Middle School a few years ago .
The school has open - air hallways , and the youth leaders would hang out between the buildings .
" They were out there waiting for us when we came out for the buses . "
" There were teachers around and it's not like they tried to stop them , " he says .
" Back then , I just was kind of confused as to why the administration would let them do that . "
Although Turning Point Church has been barred from lunches at the middle school , outreach workers continue to communicate with students at five other schools , including Marysville Pilchuck High School and Marysville Middle School .

PORT HARCOURT , Nigeria ( CNN ) --
Trash litters its cities .
Electricity is sporadic at best .
There is no clean water .
Medical and educational services are limited .
Basic infrastructure is severely lacking .
" Planet in Peril " met in a secret location with members of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta .
These are not conditions that should plague one of the richest oil states in the world .
Hundreds of billions of dollars has been made from the Niger Delta 's oil reserves and many people have gotten very rich .
Conversely , the average Nigerian has suffered as a result of the country 's oil prosperity .
The United States Agency for International Development says more than 70 percent of the country lives on less than a dollar a day -- the population is among the 20 poorest in the world .
Oil companies are only part of the equation .
The other is the Nigerian government .
Transparency International , a global organization intent on stamping out corruption , has consistently rated Nigeria 's government one of the most corrupt in the world .
Nigeria 's federal government and oil companies split oil profits roughly 60 - 40 .
The money is then supposed to make its way down to the local governments to fund various projects .
Somehow , little money actually reaches its intended destination .
Nigeria 's own corruption agency estimates between $ 300 billion to $ 400 billion has been stolen or wasted over the last 50 years .
Lisa Ling travels to secret location to meet notorious Nigerian militant group »
Gov. Rotimi Amaechi of Rivers state , one of the largest oil producers of Nigeria 's 36 states , acknowledges past problems with corruption , but thinks progress is being made .
" There 's a lot of improvement , " Amaechi said .
" The work being done by the corruption agency and the federal government has somehow been able to control the level of corruption in government . "
Over the last few years , a culture of militancy and violence has arisen in the absence of jobs and services .
Kidnappings for ransom , robberies and even murder happen with regularity .
The biggest and most powerful armed group is the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta , or MEND .
They say they are at war against the Nigerian military and the oil companies operating there .
MEND , formed in 2005 , said it has more than 30 camps throughout Nigeria .
Members are armed with high - tech weaponry they said was obtained from " foreign sources . "
Hundreds of people have been killed on both sides and countless oil workers have been kidnapped .
Over the years , MEND 's attacks on oil pipelines have halted oil production and , therefore , raised the price of oil around the world .
They demand oil profits be distributed to average Nigerians of the Niger Delta and said they will not stop their attacks until their objectives have been fulfilled .
See environmental battle lines for " Planet in Peril " »
The battle is over oil -- one of the world 's most valuable resources .
But to most Nigerians -- oil is a curse .
It has provoked an environmental disaster of monstrous proportions .
Since the 1970s , the United Nations estimates there have been more than 6,000 oil spills in the Niger Delta -- that is equal to more than 10 times the amount spilled from the Exxon Valdez in 1989 .
Yet , there is no international outcry and rarely are the spills reported , even to most Nigerians .
They are still happening and the consequences are nothing short of devastating .
Communities along the Niger Delta have lived off subsistence fishing and agriculture for decades .
Collecting food becomes impossible when a spill happens , like one that occurred in August .
The waterways and mangroves are blanketed in thick brown oil sludge that goes on for miles .
Toxicity overpowers the air and a sense of lifelessness pervades the landscape .
Many say it will take 10 - 15 years for the area to be free of contamination -- if the cleanup effort commences in a timely manner .
The August spill was a result of a leak from an old pipeline that had corroded .
It took the oil company three months to clamp the leak , but the company said it was n't reported for a full month after it began .
Once the leak was reported , the company said it was denied access to the site by the community .
Leaders of the village deny that , and the finger - pointing between the two sides is nothing new -- there is no love lost here .
Who is telling the truth ?
Who knows ?
Either way , the creeks are blackened .
This is life in the Niger Delta .

The Fulton Market area of Chicago where I work is filled with food wholesale companies – fish , meat , eggs , butter , … and ( xoxo ) bacon .
This week I walked into Meadow Brook Egg Company and walked out with a twelve - pound box of premier restaurant quality bacon .
I ’ve been dreaming about trying Megan ’s famous bacon cups since Shane passed along the link last spring .
Megan creatively made her cups in the oven using upside down muffin pans covered in foil .
While they turned out lovely , Megan reported some smoking and fat burning by using the oven so I decided to see if I could make them 100 % in the microwave .
And as a tip of the hat to Shane ’s 2007 Mac and Cheese Cooking Championship victory , I filled the cups with mac and cheese .
Supplies :
I tried two variations of cups in the microwave : solid bacon cups and open bacon cup .
Method 1 : Solid bacon cup using glass prep bowls
This method creates a tighter , more solid cup that ’s great for holding mac and cheese .
First line your Pyrex baking dish with a bunch of paper towels .
Set your glass prep bowl in the middle of the dish .
Fold one paper towel into quarters and set on top of the glass bowl to help catch some of the grease and make it easier to remove the finished cup from the bowl .
Drape three strips of bacon across the top .
Now weave strips over and under the three core strips , covering the entire glass prep bowl and overlapping slices so to ensure it cooks with few holes in the cup .
Cover with more paper towel and microwave for up to 4 minutes .
Check it midway to see how it ’s doing .
When it ’s ready , slip the bacon cup off of the glass prep bowl .
Peel back the grease - soaked paper towel while it ’s still warm and pliable .
Fill with mac and cheese .
Method 2 : Open bacon cups “ baskets ” using 10 - oz ceramic ramekins
This method ended up creating large open spaces which look really cute when filled with fresh green salad .
I did n’t overlap the pieces on this try and used fattier pieces of bacon which shrunk up more and created larger spaces in the cup .
Line your Pyrex baking dish with a bunch of paper towels .
Then take two sheets and fold in half or thirds depending on the size of your ramekins , joining to make a single long rectangle .
Wrap it around the ramekin and tuck under the paper towel on the open edge .
Set it back in your baking dish , open end down , on top of the paper towels .
Put two pieces of bacon across the top with one piece perpendicular .
Next , wrap the bacon around in a basket weave , over under the three pieces .
Cover and microwave for up to 4 minutes .
Gently lift the cup off of the ramekin and peel back the paper towel .
Thanks again to Megan for the original oven - baked inspiration !
So what about my 12 pounds of bacon ?
Well , I used about 1 pound making cups , froze 6 pounds for later and gave three pounds away which leaves 2 more pound sitting in my refrigerator … I ’ll be trying more bacon - centric recipes soon .
Viva la bacon !

I had about 13000 karma points before I started my anti-Obama campaign .
Losing them steadily , but not as quickly as I thought .
My comment karma was never very high , but I had my fun driving it even lower .
Part of the trick is to delete your comments once your target has been hit , so they can't keep pounding them with downvotes .
If I had n't deleted them , I 'd probably have a million negative comment karma points .
I have for weeks been telling them that McPalin is going to eat Obama bin Biden 's lunch .
I really believe that is about to happen , and I want to rub their noses in it !
Gifted youths already know what they want to be when they grow up .
They usually choose to study applied sciences , but when they are asked why they made their choices , they are not able to explain .
" Society identifies the gifted child with high intelligence and is often hasty to identify this intelligence with specific subjects , especially exact or prestigious sciences .
The maturing children are quick to adopt this identity , renouncing the process of building self - identity , " said Dr. Inbal Shani of the University of Haifa , who carried out this study under the supervision of Prof.
Moshe Zeidner .
The study surveyed 800 gifted and non -gifted high - school students and examined the differences in self - concept and other psychological variables between the two groups .
The study also observed the ways in which maturing gifted students form their identity .
The results showed that while gifted youths have higher self - esteem in their educational achievements , they have lower self - esteem in social and physical aspects .
The researchers pointed out that as soon as students are defined as gifted , they are entered into special educational programs .
This process causes them to feel that they excel in the academic field and therefore they strive to meet the expectations set for them in the programs built specially for them .
This is particularly prominent in those classes that participate in intensive daily programs fostering gifted children .
" Maturing gifted students know from a very young age what their life 's course will be – usually in the applied sciences .
Most of them demonstrate neither deliberation nor interest in other fields , and they speak of studying in academic or military - academic tracks . . . which is of much significance in the process of self - exploration , " Dr. Shani noted .
She added that it is likely that applied science tracks are adjusted for the maturing gifted , and it could be that many of these youths would have chosen them regardless of the social labeling ; but the problem is that they do primarily tend to choose their professional identity based on the social expectations .
" It is a paradox :
It is the gifted - who are often multi-talented - who tend to limit the realization of those very talents into specific fields .
Instead of selecting from many options open to them , they limit themselves to applied or prestigious subjects , " she said .
Dr. Shani added that gifted youths frequently report social difficulties and the feeling that other children keep distant from them because of the gifted label , and therefore it is important to enable them – in the process of forming an identity – to relate to emotional and social characteristics , such as motivation , self - concept , and external pressures , and not only to those characteristics related to cognitive aptitude .

Victor Anichebe said in a statement he was embarrassed and humiliated Cheshire Police have apologised to Premier League striker Victor Anichebe after officers challenged him as he looked in a jeweller 's shop window .
The Everton player was window - shopping with a friend in Knutsford , Cheshire , when officers confronted the pair , eventually handcuffing his friend .
Police said they were acting after a spate of robberies but admitted it was a " less than proportionate reaction " .
Mr Anichebe , 20 , said the incident was " embarrassing and totally humiliating " .
He said in a statement : " Whilst I do fully understand Cheshire Police 's desire to tackle the problem of robberies on jewellery shops in the Knutsford area , I remain deeply upset and very angry about the treatment which was meted out to myself and a friend yesterday [ Wednesday ] .
I asked the officers if they would have taken the action they did had I been white rather than black
Victor Anichebe
" It was not only totally ridiculous but also highly embarrassing and totally humiliating .
" Simply because we stood our ground and insisted that we had done absolutely nothing wrong , they decided to place my friend in handcuffs .
" I am currently having to use crutches to walk as I recently underwent surgery on a knee injury and - astonishingly - one of the officers even tried to grab the crutches in order to prevent me from ' escaping ' . "
He added : " After what seemed like an eternity the police officers seemed to realise that they had made a mistake , acknowledging that I was a footballer with a Premiership club and not someone who was preparing to commit a crime .
" At the time , I asked the officers if they would have taken the action they did had I been white rather than black . "
' Acting suspiciously ' A police spokesman said : " It is only right and proper that the police act expeditiously in protecting vulnerable premises such as jewellery shops .
" We seek in all cases to ask for co-operation from the public in respect of not only reporting suspicious activity in or around such areas , but also their co-operation if an officer feels it is necessary and appropriate to make inquiries into such matters . "
He added : " Having now reviewed in detail what occurred between the officers and the two men whom they believed to have been acting suspiciously , it is now apparent that , while the situation was heated , the actions of the police officer in applying handcuffs to one of the men was less than a proportionate reaction to the requirements of the situation .
" The officer has been advised regarding this , and an offer of apology extended to the two men . "
Responding to Mr Anichebe 's comments about race , the police spokesman added : " The robust response to this incident was influenced by a history of violent robberies that have recently occurred at jewellery shops across Cheshire and was most certainly not related to race .
" Cheshire Police has publically apologised to Mr Anichebe and his friend about the treatment they received from officers involved , and we will be writing to Mr Anichebe 's Football Club reiterating this apology .
" We can confirm we will be pleased to personally meet with Mr Anichebe to resolve any further concerns he may have . "

Jared Leto tells Rock Sound that the new 30 Seconds To Mars album might be given away free .
30 Seconds To Mars frontman Jared Leto has spoken to Rock Sound about the release plans for the band 's third album .
The group are currently recording in Los Angeles with British producer Flood despite an ongoing $ 30 million dollar lawsuit with their former record label .
'' Anything can happen , you never know what the future will hold , '' Leto admits to Rock Sound as the band 's plans remains clouded by the ongoing legal conflict .
'' Maybe we will just throw our new album on the internet and see if anybody wants to take it .
We have never made a penny from selling a record anyway so why would it matter to us ? ''
Rock Sound can also confirm that two new songs have been titled ' Kings And Queens ' and ' Hurricane ' .

A Hubble Space Telescope image of the Red Rectangle , approximately 2,300 light years from Earth in the constellation Monoceros .
What appears to be the central star is actually a pair of closely orbiting stars .
Particle outflow from the stars interacts with a surrounding disk of dust , possibly accounting for the X shape .
This image spans approximately a third of a light year at the distance of the Red Rectangle .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Space dust annoys astronomers just as much as the household variety when it interferes with their observations of distant stars .
And yet space dust also poses one of the great mysteries of astronomy .
" We not only do not know what the stuff is , but we do not know where it is made or how it gets into space , " said Donald York , the Horace B. Horton Professor in Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Chicago .
But now York , the University of Toledo 's Adolf Witt and their collaborators have observed a double - star system that displays all the characteristics that astronomers suspect are associated with dust production .
The Astrophysical Journal will publish a paper reporting their discovery in March .
The double star system , designated HD 44179 , sits within what astronomers call the Red Rectangle , an interstellar cloud of gas and dust ( nebula ) located approximately 2,300 light years from Earth .
An artist ’s rendition of the possible appearance of the double star system in the Red Rectangle nebula .
The details of the image follow the observations that a team of astronomers at the University of Toledo and the University of Chicago has made using the 3.5 - meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico .
The image spans a distance of approximately 1 astronomical unit ( 93 million miles , the average distance between the Earth and sun ) .

One of the double stars is of a type that astronomers regard as a likely source of dust .
These stars , unlike the sun , have already burned all the hydrogen in their cores .
Labeled post - AGB ( post - asymptotic giant branch ) stars , these objects collapsed after burning their initial hydrogen , until they could generate enough heat to burn a new fuel , helium .
Dust in the solar wind
During this transition , which takes place over tens of thousands of years , these stars lose an outer layer of their atmosphere .
Dust may form in this cooling layer , which radiation pressure coming from the star 's interior pushes out the dust away from the star , along with a fair amount of gas .
In double - star systems , a disk of material from the post - AGB star may form around the second smaller , more slowly evolving star .
" When disks form in astronomy , they often form jets that blow part of the material out of the original system , distributing the material in space , " York explained .
This seems to be the phenomenon that Witt 's team observed in the Red Rectangle , probably the best example so far discovered .
The discovery has wide - ranging implications , because dust is critical to scientific theories about how stars form .
" If a cloud of gas and dust collapses under its own gravity , it immediately gets hotter and starts to evaporate , " York said .
Something , possibly dust , must immediately cool the cloud to prevent it from reheating .
The giant star sitting in the Red Rectangle is among those that are far too hot to allow dust condensation within their atmospheres .
And yet a giant ring of dusty gas encircles it .
Witt 's team made approximately 15 hours of observations on the double star over a seven - year period with the 3.5 - meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico .
" Our observations have shown that it is most likely the gravitational or tidal interaction between our Red Rectangle giant star and a close sun-like companion star that causes material to leave the envelope of the giant , " said Witt , an emeritus distinguished university professor of astronomy .
Some of this material ends up in a disk of accumulating dust that surrounds that smaller companion star .
Gradually , over a period of approximately 500 years , the material spirals into the smaller star .
Bipolar behavior
Just before this happens , the smaller star ejects a small fraction of the accumulated matter in opposite directions via two gaseous jets , called " bipolar jets . "
Other quantities of the matter pulled from the envelope of the giant end up in a disk that skirts both stars , where it cools .
" The heavy elements like iron , nickel , silicon , calcium and carbon condense out into solid grains , which we see as interstellar dust , once they leave the system , " Witt explained .
Cosmic dust production has eluded telescopic detection because it only lasts for perhaps 10,000 years — a brief period in the lifetime of a star .
Astronomers have observed other objects similar to the Red Rectangle in Earth 's neighborhood of the Milky Way .
This suggests that the process
Witt 's team has observed is quite common when viewed over the lifetime of the galaxy .
" Processes very similar to what we are observing in the Red Rectangle nebula have happened maybe hundreds of millions of times since the formation of the Milky Way , " said Witt , who teamed up with longtime friends at Chicago for the study .
Witt ( Ph.D. , '67 ) and York ( Ph.D. , '71 ) first met in graduate school at Chicago 's Yerkes Observatory , where Lew Hobbs , now Professor Emeritus in Astronomy & Astrophysics , had just joined the University faculty .
Other co-authors include Julie Thorburn of Yerkes Observatory ; Uma Vijh , University of Toledo ; and Jason Aufdenberg , Embry - Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida .
The team had set out to achieve a relatively modest goal : find the Red Rectangle 's source of far - ultraviolet radiation .
The Red Rectangle displays several phenomena that require far - ultraviolet radiation as a power source .
" The trouble is that the very luminous central star in the Red Rectangle is not hot enough to produce the required UV radiation , " Witt said , so he and his colleagues set out to find it .
It turned out neither star in the binary system is the source of the UV radiation , but rather the hot , inner region of the disk swirling around the secondary , which reaches temperatures near 20,000 degrees .
Their observations ,
Witt said , " have been greatly more productive than we could have imagined in our wildest dreams . "

John Kenneth Schiefer , 27 , from Los Angeles , has been sentenced by a federal court to four years in prison and the payment of $ 22,500 in damages and fines for infecting some one quarter million computers with information - stealing malware .
The hacker has been working for the past several months as a technician for Mahalo.com , the company failing to check his background when employing him .
Schiefer , going by the online nickname of " acidstorm , " used to work as an IT security consultant for a firm called 3G Communications .
However , in his spare time , the rogue security professional engaged in illegal activities , which involved raising an army of zombie computers by infecting them with malware , stealing money from compromised accounts , and launching denial of service attacks .
The cyber -criminal entered a guilty plea agreement 16 months ago , but while awaiting his sentencing , he continued to look for work in the industry .
Eventually , around five months ago , he was extended a job offer from Mahalo.com , a company running a search engine that relies on human - decisions .
The interesting fact is that the firm 's management only found out about Schiefer 's history and story recently and , despite this fact , it decided to keep him employed .
The mistake was apparently made by Mahalo's CTO , Mark Jeffrey , who failed to do a simple Google search before hiring him .
" After really a lot of careful deliberation and looking at exactly what damage he could do here and how he was being supervised , we made a compassionate decision to let him work up to the day that he goes to prison , " Mahalo CEO Jason Calacanis commented for The Register .
Meanwhile , Mark Jeffrey vouched in favor of the soon - to - be incarcerated bot runner .
" In the time that I 've known John , he has been a model employee , and indeed , a model human being .
I would hire him again in a second , " he said .
In a post on his blog , Jason Calacanis made a note to Mahalo users , assuring them that " John ’s work is well - supervised .
Mahalo follows strict security policies and we do n’t store any sensitive data anyway . "
He further explained that " Even if one of our employees did go off the deep end , the most they would have access to would be your questions and answers on Mahalo Answers–not much damage can be done there since they ’re all public anyway . "
According to the judge 's decision , Schiefer has 90 days to turn himself in to prison officials and start serving his sentence and only time will tell if his story is just another example of a former - hacker switching sides .
A lot of well known IT professionals today engaged in questionable activities when they were young , and some of them even served time in jail .
We have recently reported about a Romanian hacker who is undergoing a three - year - sentence in Italy for identity theft .
After amazing his professors from the Polytechnic University of Milano and the Italian media with his intelligence and skills in the field of informatics , authorities are considering changing his sentence into house arrest and hiring him to help them prosecute and prevent online crime .

The science of tree - building took a significant step forward in the late 1900s .
Biologists set up standard rules for comparing species and figuring out who was most closely related to whom .
Once they were all speaking the same scientific language , they could test each other ’s hypotheses with new evidence .
They also began to get new kinds evidence for their trees .
It became possible to compare not just the skeleton or color patterns of species , but also their proteins and genes .
At first biologists could draw only small trees , typically with a dozen branches at most .
They were held back by the fact that a group of species may possibly be related in many different ways .
If a biologist adds more species to a group , the possibilities explode .
“ For 25 species , there are more possible trees than there are stars in the known universe , ” Dr. Westneat said .
“ For 80 species , there are more trees than there are atoms in the known universe . ”
Simply comparing every single tree would be impossible .
Fortunately , mathematicians developed statistical methods for searching quickly through potential trees to find the ones that do the best job of explaining all the evidence .
Computers could do millions of calculations for biologists and store a growing database of information on Web sites .
Trees grew hundreds of new branches , then thousands .
“ We ’re overwhelmed with information , ” Dr. Hillis said .
Today trees with thousands of branches , sometimes called “ supertrees ” or “ megatrees , ” are starting to appear in scientific literature .
Their branches reveal patterns in evolution that were missed in smaller studies .
In 2007 , for example , Olaf Bininda - Edmonds , a biologist at Carl von Ossietzky University in Germany , and his colleagues published a tree of 4,500 mammals  in other words , just about every known mammal species .
The tree allowed researchers to estimate the rate at which mammals have evolved into new lineages .
For decades , many researchers have argued that most major groups of living mammals evolved after the dinosaurs became extinct 65 million years ago .
Based on their mammal supertree , Dr. Bininda - Emonds and his colleagues argued that mammals were diversifying millions of years earlier .
Less than two years later , the mammal supertree is looking puny .
In a paper to be published in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology , Stephen Smith of the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center in North Carolina and his colleagues have created a tree containing 13,533 species of plants .
Their study shows that ferns  sometimes considered as living fossils that have changed little for hundreds of millions of years  have actually been evolving faster than younger groups of plants , like conifers and flowering plants .
Plants are not just related to one another .
They ’re also related to us animals , fungi , bacteria and all other living things on Earth .
Over the past seven years , the National Science Foundation has been financing a project known as Assembling the Tree of Life , the goal of which is “ to reconstruct the evolutionary origins of all living things , ” according to its Web site .
Research teams are analyzing slices of the tree , while mathematicians and computer scientists work on methods to combine them into a single analysis .
“ You can just imagine how Darwin would have enjoyed it , ” Dr. Kohn said .
" I said Holy mother , and then I said God . "
Then naked Dick stopped !

For while Mr. Obama got more or less what he asked for , he almost certainly did n’t ask for enough .
We ’re probably facing the worst slump since the Great Depression .
The Congressional Budget Office , not usually given to hyperbole , predicts that over the next three years there will be a $ 2.9 trillion gap between what the economy could produce and what it will actually produce .
And $ 800 billion , while it sounds like a lot of money , is n’t nearly enough to bridge that chasm .
Officially , the administration insists that the plan is adequate to the economy ’s need .
But few economists agree .
And it ’s widely believed that political considerations led to a plan that was weaker and contains more tax cuts than it should have  that Mr. Obama compromised in advance in the hope of gaining broad bipartisan support .
We ’ve just seen how well that worked .
Now , the chances that the fiscal stimulus will prove adequate would be higher if it were accompanied by an effective financial rescue , one that would unfreeze the credit markets and get money moving again .
But the long - awaited announcement of the Obama administration ’s plans on that front , which also came this week , landed with a dull thud .
The plan sketched out by Tim Geithner , the Treasury secretary , was n’t bad , exactly .
What it was , instead , was vague .
It left everyone trying to figure out where the administration was really going .
Will those public - private partnerships end up being a covert way to bail out bankers at taxpayers ’ expense ?
Or will the required “ stress test ” act as a back - door route to temporary bank nationalization ( the solution favored by a growing number of economists , myself included ) ?
Nobody knows .
Over all , the effect was to kick the can down the road .
And that ’s not good enough .
So far the Obama administration ’s response to the economic crisis is all too reminiscent of Japan in the 1990s : a fiscal expansion large enough to avert the worst , but not enough to kick - start recovery ; support for the banking system , but a reluctance to force banks to face up to their losses .
It ’s early days yet , but we ’re falling behind the curve .
And I do n’t know about you , but I ’ve got a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach  a feeling that America just is n’t rising to the greatest economic challenge in 70 years .
The best may not lack all conviction , but they seem alarmingly willing to settle for half - measures .
And the worst are , as ever , full of passionate intensity , oblivious to the grotesque failure of their doctrine in practice .
There ’s still time to turn this around .
But Mr. Obama has to be stronger looking forward .
Otherwise , the verdict on this crisis might be that no , we can’t .

Nottingham Rugby Boosts Attendance With Inflatable Fans
Total Pro Sports –
When times are tough and stadiums are empty , teams should follow in the footsteps of the Nottingham Rugby Club .
This past Sunday the Nottingham Rugby team filled their stands with 1000 inflatable dolls provided by Airheads a local company that specializes in enhancing crowd scenes for films , TV , commercials and promotional work .
“ Nottingham Rugby managed to get 1,000 extra “ supporters ” on Sunday when they took on title - chasing Exeter Chiefs at Meadow Lane .
The inflatables added to a crowd of 1,305 at Notts County ’s stadium , who watched Nottingham go down 15 - 14 to the Chiefs . ”
The Inflatable fans are being used at Nottingham ’s games to encourage support of their local teams and the entire sport of rugby .
“ Hopefully it will add to the atmosphere , and inspire people to come back again next week and help the team qualify for the Cup Final by beating Leeds . ”
Hats off to Nottingham ’s great idea and best of luck in their quest to the Twickenham Final .

Wax play is something that many talk about , and few seem to do , this is always a mystery to me as to why , as when it is done correctly it is a wonderful addition to foreplay and indeed it has many deeper meanings as well , I mean who in their right mind will lay still and let another person drip hot wax all over them if they do not 100 % trust them , it can be seen as another step into total submission * this does not mean however that if you do n’t like wax play you are not submissive , as I say all the time , this life is one that allows you to fit it to your specific needs and desires *
The benefits of wax play are mainly for the sub / slave admittedly but at the same time it is something that is just one more added attraction to the BDSM lifestyle , the infliction of controlled pain .
If you hold a flame to your hand you will burn yourself , so why should you think that dripping hot wax on someone will not do the same ?
The secret is in the type of candle used , the distance you hold the candle from the body , and the area you are dripping the wax onto .
There are many sensitive parts on a body , for my purpose I will be referring to a female body , the nipples , the pussy and the navel are amongst the main ones , and if you pour hot wax on any of those areas chances are your sub or slave will be off the table / floor and swearing up a blue storm at the pain of it .
The idea is to hold the candle above the body , and slowly drip the melted wax onto their body , if dripped from a distance of say 12 - 15 inches the wax has time to cool a bit before it hits the skin , thus not burning but leaving a warm feeling , this is especially good for those new to this play .
For extra fun ice can be used to ‘ numb ’ the area you are playing with both before and after , the combination of hot and cold is exhilarating .
If you are new to wax play , try it on yourself first , learn what works for you and then you can move onto your sub or slave , take care when first entering this part of play , it is something that can bring a lot of pleasure but if not done right a lot of pain as well for more advice please read here
The first bones from the grave were unearthed late last year Archaeologists have found a mass grave in Mexico City with at least 49 human skeletons dating from Spain 's conquest of the Aztecs in the 16th Century .
Experts say the site is unusual as the Aztec skeletons are carefully laid out and bear marks of European traditions .
The find was made in the Tlatelolco area of Mexico City , where the Indians made a last stand against the Spanish .
Many died in the fighting and afterwards many others succumbed to disease and epidemics .
" We were completely taken by surprise .
We did n't expect to find this massive funeral complex , " said Salvador Guilliem of the city 's archaeology institute .
Mr Guilliem said he thought the people buried at the site died in the battle against the invading Spanish or fell victim to the disease that wiped out large swathes of the native population after Spain won control of the city in 1521 .
The new find differs from other burial sites in the Tlatelolco area where the bodies have been dumped unceremoniously into pits .
Exacavations are continuing at the site
Those found by Mr Guilliem follow Christian customs , with the bodies laid on their backs with arms crossed over the chest .
They were not placed in coffins , but wrapped in large maguey cactus leaves .
Artefacts lying with the bodies are from a pre-Hispanic era , Mr Guilliem said , indicating that the burials , discovered in late 2008 , were ordered by Spanish overlords but carried out by Aztecs .
The dead , almost exclusively adults , also had many characteristics of warriors .
All but four were young men , most were tall and several showed broken bones that had healed .
Skeletons of two children , a teenager , and an older person wearing a ring possibly signifying an elite status , were also found in the tomb .
The archaeologists say they expect to find at least 50 more skeletons as excavations at the huge Tlatelolco complex continue .
There are some 67 ancient structures in the area , including several massive pyramids .

Doctors have been asked to trace all babies in Britain who have been injected in the past month with the meningitis C vaccine which was recalled on Wednesday after it emerged that it may be contaminated with a microbe that can cause potentially fatal blood poisoning .
The Department of Health also announced it is also going to test unused batches of the vaccine sent from Italy and stored in GP surgeries in the UK to see whether any of them are contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus , the same type of microbe responsible for the hospital - acquired infection MRSA .
The health department said it does not yet know how many of the 17,000 doses of meningitis C vaccine sent to GPs on 22 January and 20 February – but recalled on Wednesday night – have been used as part of the national childhood vaccination programme .
However , it is likely to be in the hundreds or possibly thousands .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" We can , and are going to , track the vaccine to individual GP surgeries .
GPs can then contact the patients who have had the injection .
Although , as we 've said , this is as a precautionary measure and we are not aware of any problems in the UK , " a spokeswoman for the health department said .
" We wo n't know how many doses have already been administered and how many are sitting in GPs ' fridges until we have recalled them all .
The health department has traced all the vaccine and knows where it is .
It will be collected from GP surgeries , " she added .
Novartis , the Swiss pharmaceuticals company , manufactured its Menjugate vaccine for meningitis C at its facility in Italy , and the product destined for Britain had passed all sterility tests required under European Union regulations .
However , Novartis subsequently detected Staphylococcus contamination in samples taken from two batches that had already been sent to Britain by road .
The samples were being used in an experiment to test their vulnerability to pressure changes when shipped by air and they were found to be positive on arrival in the US , a Novartis spokeswoman said .
Novartis informed the British distributor of the problem late on Friday night of last week by email , and the company subsequently telephoned the Department of Health on Monday morning , a spokesman said .
The health department said it checked with the company on Monday morning to make sure it had informed the medicines watchdog , the Medicines Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) but the agency said that it was only told about the problem on Tuesday .
The MHRA recalled the vaccine on Wednesday night several hours after the health department had been approached by The Independent with questions about the possible contamination of the baby vaccine .
Professor Kent Woods , chief executive of the MHRA , said there was currently no evidence that any children have been harmed by the suspect stocks of meningitis C vaccine and there have been no reports of any infections following vaccination .
" Parents should not be concerned over this recall , as there is currently no evidence to show UK children have been put at risk .
Novartis are recalling these two batches as a precautionary measure , " Professor Woods said .
More than 60,000 doses of vaccine formed the two batches sent from Italy .
The Deparment of Health said that more than 21,000 of those had been shipped to GP surgeries but yesterday it revised that figure down to 17,000 .
A spokeswoman for Novartis said the vaccine is transported in vials separated from a liquid solvent in which it is mixed on arrival .
It was the liquid solvent – aluminium hydroxide – that was found to be contaminated .
" The solvent that was transported by road to the UK passed all routine checks but the solvent that was transported by road and air to the US did not , " she said .

If your home business incorporates a particular brand — even if it is you — and you want to control that brand and your image , a trademark can be a valuable tool .
The trademark basically says that you are the only one to have the right to use a particular name brand .
Spelling is n't important with a trademark ; violation of the trademark comes when customers are confused , thinking that something is yours when it is n't .
You can apply for a trademark at the United States Patent and Trademark Office .
The cost is a non-refundable $ 325 fee .
But if you want to be able to protect yourself from other claiming your home business brand — and maybe offering products and services of dubious quality — it might be worth it to trademark your brand .
The Street offers one more piece of advice regarding getting a trademark :
trademark is that you should begin using it immediately , prior to the formal
And keep detailed records regarding the date the mark is first used in
commerce ; this is of critical importance when filing the trademark
application paperwork .

The economically inactive population has surpassed 16 million here , the highest figure ever , and although the country 's unemployment situation is less serious than in other developed countries , the job market is in a worse condition when including these people .
According to the National Statistical Office ( NSO ) , the number of economically inactive people aged 15 years or older totaled 16.23 million in February , or 40.7 percent of the total population in this age bracket , the highest since the statistical office started compiling related data .
The economically inactive population includes those who have decided not to search for jobs , including females doing housework after being laid off , those preparing for licenses or attending training centers for future jobs , and those who have no will to work .
Since they 're not searching for work , they are neither included in the unemployment statistics nor categorized as employed .
Among them , those dedicated to childcare stood at 1.72 million ; not working through choice , 5.79 million ; and 1.57 million said they did n't work due to old age .
Those preparing for future jobs totaled 568,000 , those who gave up looking stood at 169,000 , and those just resting from work for no specific reason recorded 1.75 million .
These people , nearing 2.5 million , are not included in the figure , though they are little different from jobless people .
Economists point out that the country 's unemployment rate could be considered much higher taking into account the huge economically inactive population .
The country marked a 3.3 percent unemployment rate in January , which is the lowest among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) member countries , except for the Netherlands with 2.8 percent .
The OECD average was 6.9 percent , while Spain marked the highest jobless rate of 14.8 percent , and the United States , Belgium , Canada , Finland , France , Germany , and Iceland marked over 5 percent .
The rate was 4.1 percent in Japan .
``Koreans fear losing face , so they are reluctant to define themselves as unemployed , and government support for the unemployed is not as good as in other developed countries , '' a Seoul economist said .
D programming language is a modern , natively - compiled , statically - typed system language .
While being strongly influenced , and keeping a certain level of compatibility with C++ , it tries to avoid many design flaws of its big brother .
One of important aspects of D is that it makes simple things simple .
Among these things are built - in array types , a built - in garbage collector , and a built - in profiler .
To enable profiling of your program you simply add the - profile switch to the DMD ’s command line .
The profiling code is injected directly into the compiled executable .
After the instrumented program finishes executing , two plain text files are created : trace.log and trace .
def .
Running the program several times will update these files and combine the profiling data with the already existing results .
To make an explanation below more illustrative , let ’s profile a simple program , hello.d :
void main ( ) { foo( ) ; bar( ) ; } void foo ( ) { } void bar ( ) { foo( ) ; }
compiled and profiled like this :
dmd hello.d - profile hello
trace.log
This is the main source for performance - related information .
trace.log from the above hello.d should look like this :
------------------ 1 __Dmain _D5hello3barFZv 1 9 8 1 _D5hello3fooFZv
------------------ 1 __Dmain 1 _D5hello3barFZv _D5hello3fooFZv 2 2 2 ------------------
__Dmain 0 25 15 1 _D5hello3fooFZv 1 _D5hello3barFZv ======== Timer Is 3579545 Ticks / Sec , Times are in Microsecs ======== Num Tree Func Per Calls Time Time Call 1 6 4 4 __Dmain 1 2 2 2 _D5hello3barFZv 2 0 0 0 _D5hello3fooFZv
There are two distinct sections in this file : a call graph , and function timings .
The call graph elements are separated by dashed lines .
Each element describes a single function , its callers ( fan in ) and callees ( fan out ) .
Walter explained this nicely in his newsgroup post .
In the trace log above the call graph element for bar ( ) is
1 __Dmain _D5hello3barFZv 1 9 8 1 _D5hello3fooFZv
First , there is fan in consisting of one function , main ( ) .
Number 1 before __Dmain means that main ( ) called the bar ( ) once during the profiling session .
Next , there is the function this element describes .
The line starts with the function name , then there are three numbers : total number of times this function is called , total time spent executing this function and the functions it calls , and total time spent executing this function excluding any functions it calls itself .
Important : the times specified here are in ticks , not any sort of seconds !
In the example above we can see that bar ( ) were called once , spent 9 ticks running , 8 ticks in its own body and 1 tick in other functions .
After the element ’s function there goes fan out .
The format is the same as for fan in but the number before the function name means number of times the corresponding function was called from this element .
Here we see that bar ( ) called foo ( ) once .
The timings section starts with a row of equal signs and is pretty self - explanatory .
The section header establishes connection between ticks mentioned earlier and actual seconds .
Also it states that all times from now on are specified in microseconds which are 1 000 000 per second .
Data in this section is split into 5 columns : number of times the function was called , total time spent in this function and all functions called from it , total time spent in this function only , average time consumed by this function per call , and the function ’s mangled name .
This table is sorted by the 3rd column so that functions with largest pure execution times are at the top .
In our example , the most complex function is main ( ) because it contains two function calls and therefore executes longest .
trace.def
This file , as extension suggests , is a skeleton of a module definition file .
It allows OPTLINK to arrange functions within the executable in the order they actually call each other , reducing number of potential cache misses and long jump instructions .
This file is not readily usable however .
At a minimum , you must add the EXETYPE NT at the start of the file to denote it ’s for a 32 - bit executable .
Now we can use it to build an optimized hello :
dmd hello.d trace.def
Note for Tango users : this method does not work if your Tango installation adds tango - user - dmd.lib to the sc.ini as - L+tango-user-dmd.lib .
This method of Tango installation assumes that the last group of linker options is always a list of libraries .
However , when a .def file is used , another group of options is added to the linker command line so that the tango - user - dmd.lib is treated as a resource , not a library .
I do n’t have a perfect solution for this .
You may want to resort to other methods of linking to tango - user - dmd.lib on Windows .
Afterword
Here I ’ve covered basic technical aspects of profiling with DMD .
But it is also important to know how to use information provided by the profiling process .
In my next post I will profile Blaze , a 2D physics library , and discuss some pitfalls awaiting you on the way of profiling .
First live action movie of individual carbon atoms in action
( Nanowerk News ) Science fiction fans still have another two months of waiting for the new Star Trek movie , but fans of actual science can feast their eyes now on the first movie ever of carbon atoms moving along the edge of a graphene crystal .
Given that graphene  single - layered sheets of carbon atoms arranged like chicken wire  may hold the key to the future of the electronics industry , the audience for this new science movie might also reach blockbuster proportions .
Researchers with the U.S. Department of Energys Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( Berkeley Lab ) , working with TEAM 0.5 , the worlds most powerful transmission electron microscope , have made a movie that shows in real - time carbon atoms repositioning themselves around the edge of a hole that was punched into a graphene sheet .
Viewers can observe how chemical bonds break and form as the suddenly volatile atoms are driven to find a stable configuration .
This is the first ever live recording of the dynamics of carbon atoms in graphene .
This 3D rendering of a graphene hole imaged on TEAM 0.5 shows that the carbon atoms along the edge assume either a zigzag or an armchair configuration .
The zigzag is the more stable configuration and shows promise for future spintronic technologies .
 The atom - by - atom growth or shrinking of crystals is one of the most fundamental problems of solid state physics , but is especially critical for nanoscale systems where the addition or subtraction of even a single atom can have dramatic consequences for mechanical , optical , electronic , thermal and magnetic properties of the material ,  said physicist Alex Zettl who led this research .
 The ability to see individual atoms move around in real time and to see how the atomic configuration evolves and influences system properties is somewhat akin to a biologist being able to watch as cells divide and a higher order structure with complex functionality evolves . 
Zettl holds joint appointments with Berkeley Labs Materials Sciences Division ( MSD ) and the Physics Department at the University of California ( UC ) Berkeley , where he is the director of the Center of Integrated Nanomechanical Systems .
He is the principal author of a paper describing this work which appears in the March 27 , 2009 issue of the journal Science .
The paper is entitled ,  Graphene at the Edge : Stability and Dynamics . 
Co-authoring this paper with Zettl were Ça?lar Girit , Jannik Meyer , Rolf Erni , Marta Rossell , Christian Kisielowski , Li Yang , Cheol - Hwan Park , Michael Crommie , Marvin Cohen and Steven Louie .
This Quick Time movie produced with the TEAM 0.5 microscope shows the growth of a hole and the atomic edge reconstruction in a graphene sheet .
An electron beam focused to a spot on the sheet blows out the exposed carbon atoms to make the hole .
The carbon atoms then reposition themselves to find a stable configuration .
In their paper , the authors credit the unique capabilities of TEAM 0.5 for making their movie possible .
TEAM stands for Transmission Electron Aberration - corrected Microscope .
The newest instrument at Berkeley Labs National Center for Electron Microscopy ( NCEM ) - a DOE national user facility and the countrys premier center for electron microscopy and microcharacterization - TEAM 0.5 is capable of producing images with half angstrom resolution , which is less than the diameter of a single hydrogen atom .
Said NCEM director Ulrich Dahmen of this achievement with TEAM 0.5 ,  The real - time observation of the movements of edge atoms could lead to a new level of understanding and control of nanomaterials .
With further advances in electron - optical correctors and detectors it may become possible to increase the sensitivity and speed of such observations , and begin to see a live view of many other reactions at the atomic scale . 
Rubbing graphene off the end of a pencil tip and suspending the specimen in an observation grid , Zettl and his colleagues used prolonged irradiation from TEAM 0.5 s electron beam ( set at 80 kV ) to introduce a hole into the graphenes pristine hexagonal carbon lattice .
Focusing the beam to a spot on the sheet blows out the exposed carbon atoms to create the hole .
Since atoms at the edge of the hole are continually being ejected from the lattice by electrons from the beam the size of the hole grows .
The researchers used the same TEAM 0.5 electron beam to record for analysis a movie showing the growth of the hole and the rearrangement of the carbon atoms .
 Atoms that lose their neighbors become highly volatile , and move around rapidly , continually repositioning themselves from one metastable configuration to the next ,  said Zettl .
 Although configurations come and go , we found a zigzag configuration to be the most stable .
It occurs more often and over longer length scales along the edge than the other most common configuration , which we called the armchair . 
Understanding which of these atomic configurations is the most stable is one of the keys to predicting and controlling the stability of a device that utilizes graphene edges .
The discovery of strong stability in the zigzag configuration is particularly promising news for the spintronic dreams of the computer industry .
Two years ago , co-authors Cohen and Louie , theorists who hold joint appointments with Berkeley Labs Materials Sciences Division and UC Berkeley , calculated that nanoribbons of graphene can conduct a spin current and could therefore serve as the basis for nanosized spintronic devices .
Spin , a quantum mechanical property arising from the magnetic field of a spinning electron , carries a directional value of either up or down  that can be used to encode data in the 0s and 1s of the binary system .
Spintronic devices promise to be smaller , faster and far more versatile than todays devices because  among other advantages  data storage does not disappear when the electric current stops .
Said Cohen ,  Our calculations showed that zigzag graphene nanoribbons are magnetic and can carry a spin current in the presence of a sufficiently large electric field .
By carefully controlling the electric field , it should be possible to generate , manipulate , and detect electron spins and spin currents in spintronics applications . 
Said Louie ,  If electric fields can be made to produce and manipulate a 100 - percent spin-polarized carrier system through a chosen geometric structure , it will revolutionize spintronics technology . 
The theorists were enthusiastic about actually being able to see their predictions in action .
Said Cohen ,
 This work is an excellent example of the power of attacking a fundamental problem through a combination of theory , experiment and cutting edge instrumentation .
The instrument is one of the worlds best and allows us to see atoms move , the theory allows us to make realistic models , and the experiment was performed through the magic hands of Alex Zettl to ensure that the right measurement was done in the right way . 
Said Louie ,  As the old saying goes - seeing is believing .
The visual verification of the formation and stability of zigzag edges in the live atomic images from TEAM 0.5 is very satisfying .
Furthermore , the ability to simultaneously see atomic structure and perform physical measurements , using the kind of set - up that the Zettl group has at NCEM , should greatly accelerate the cycle of discovery , theoretical understanding , applications and further discovery . 
For Zettl and his movie - making collaborators , next up they will correlate the atomic dynamics in graphene that they can now observe in real time with such properties as electrical conduction , optical response and magnetism .
This will be a major advance towards fully understanding and applying graphene to spintronic technology as well as other electronic and photovoltaic devices .
 While , graphene is particularly exciting , our experimental methods should be applicable to other materials , including other 2 - D systems as well ,  Zettl said .
 We are vigorously pursuing these areas of research in collaboration with the theorists and the staff at NCEM .
Said NCEM principal investigator and co-author of this paper , Kisielowski ,  The ability to observe the dynamics of single carbon atoms is a dream come true that reaches beyond investigations of graphene .
In fact it gets us one step closer to understanding artificial photosynthesis , which is considered to be an ultimate energy technology and is being pursued at Berkeley Lab through the Helios Project . 
Berkeley Lab is a U.S. Department of Energy national laboratory located in Berkeley , California .
It conducts unclassified scientific research and is managed by the University of California .
Alex Zettl , a physicist who holds joint appointments with Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley , led the first live recording of carbon atoms in action at graphene edge .
His previous accomplishments included the first fully functional radio from a single carbon nanotube , and a nanoscale mass sensor that can weigh individual atoms .
More on TEAM
TEAM 0.5 features state - of - the - art technical advances including an extremely bright electron source , ultra-stable electronics to reduce drift and , perhaps most importantly , the ability to provide optical corrections for spherical aberration ( blurring ) .
By making points of light look like disks , spherical aberrations have been the prime limiting factors in the resolution of transmission electron microscopy .
Its ability to correct spherical aberrations makes TEAM 0.5 highly versatile .
It can be used for broad - beam wide - angle  imaging as well as for scanning transmission electron microscopy ( STEM ) , in which the tightly focused electron beam is moved across a sample as a probe .
In the STM mode , TEAM 0.5 is capable of performing spectroscopy on one atom at a time  an ideal way to precisely locate impurities in an otherwise homogeneous sample , such as individual dopant atoms in a semiconductor .
Aberration correction also enables TEAM 0.5 to produce high resolution images at relatively low electron beam energies .
Because of their longer wavelengths , lower energy electrons are more difficult to focus than higher energy electrons .
Aberration correction overcomes this problem .
TEAM 0.5 was designed and constructed through a collaboration led by Berkeley Lab and including DOEs Argonne and Oak Ridge National Laboratories , the Frederick Seitz Materials Laboratory of the University of Illinois , and two private companies specializing in electron microscopy , the FEI Company headquartered in Portland , Oregon , and CEOS of Heidelberg , Germany .

Male camaraderie is elevated to the level of platonic romance in I Love You , Man , a movie that tries to take the guy - power Judd Apatow formula a few steps farther but ca n’t quite play ball on the same level .
It does n’t really seem to understand any of its characters in the way that Apatow ’s films do and spends more time making fun of them ( in pretty unfunny and redundant ways ) and looking down on them while , in turn , asking us to sympathize with them .
The whole movie just does n’t work on any level , really , and I left disappointed .
In theory , I love the concept of this movie and it could ’ve been a great genre satire .
The love shared between a dude and his buddies has been a prevalent feature of the recent outpouring of Apatow - brand and Apatow - inspired R-rated comedies and a lot of them have been damn good , to boot .
I Love You , Man centers around a concept that ’s essentially a straight parody of this idea , playing out a male friendship in the archetype of a romantic comedy .
For the most part , however , writer / director John Hamburg plays it straight — which would be fine if he had the wise humility and comedic Midas Touch that Apatow has .
But he does n’t .
As a result , we wind up laughing at the characters instead of with them and that is where the movie sorely missteps .
Hans already reviewed this film ( and you can read his far more positive review HERE ) , so I ’ll spare you all the gory plot details .
Sufficed to say that it ’s about Peter Klaven ( Paul Rudd ) , a real estate agent who ’s about to get married and realizes he ’s never really had any close male friends , so he sets out on a mission to make some .
After a series of misadventures he meets Sydney ( Jason Segel ) , a somewhat free - spirited man-child , and the two of them hit it off instantly .
From there it plays out its platonic romance , or “ bromance , ” as the newly emerging term coins it .
It ’s sort of a boy - meets - boy , boy - and - boy - hit - it - off , boy - and - boy - start - to - have - problems , boy - and - boy - rekindle kinda thing .
A funny premise , sure , but the movie falters left and right .
I took issue with the movie asking me to care about characters who were n’t so much real people as they were dopey caricatures and broad comedy clichés .
Rudd , who I normally love , is completely wasted here , working from a script that he ’s frankly too good for .
His character in the movie is n’t really all that likable .
It ’s not that he ’s dislikable , it ’s just that he can be such a stupid schmuck and so over - the - top awkward that he ’s hard to root for or connect with at all .
It really seems like this movie sticks to the script a lot more than the improvisational style of most Apatow movies .
It ’s jarring to watch how much omitting said improvisation drains all the characters of their natural humanity and disturbs the tone of the film .
Peter winds up being just like every run -of - the - mill socially inept kind of movie character and brings nothing new to the table .
He ’s just too goofy to achieve the kind of sympathy that the movie wants him to achieve .
Segel is wasted to an even greater extent .
I ’ve loved Segel in his past Apatow work on Freaks and Geeks and in Knocked Up , and I even liked him in his lead role in Forgetting Sarah Marshall , which was a movie I did n’t totally care for on its own .
But here he just feels strange , underdeveloped , and , again , not very likable .
He ’s a mysterious free - spirit phantom , encouraging Rudd to let loose while having very little life of his own .
He ’s sort of the “ bromantic comedy ” equivalent to the character played by Kirsten Dunst in Elizabethtown .
And when he ’s not evoking that character , his problematic aloofness and bizarre outbursts of aggression and violence feel more like Adam Sandler in Reign Over Me .
And that ’s not good at all .
I Love You , Man also would have done a lot better to entirely stick to the “ bromance ” idea .
It ’s always dipping into Peter ’s relationship with his fiancé , Zooey ( Rashida Jones ) , which would be fine–and totally necessary –if she was a real character who had an emotional barometer of some kind all the time–and not just when it is specifically moving the plot forward .
As is , she ’s really just a character that exists in the film out of obligation .
She does n’t serve much of a purpose except to illustrate how Rudd ’s intense friendship with Segel is affecting his relationship with her .
Which is an idea that does n’t serve much of a purpose when your characters are all kinda worthless .
But I guess what bugged me most about this film is that it ’s just not very funny .
It throws so much at the wall and so much of it falls totally flat .
I rarely laughed and when I did it was little more than a light chuckle or a smirk .
They really try to get a whole lot of mileage out of Rudd using awkward nonsensical slang and then apologizing for it .
Damn near every single scene has a moment like that , and after awhile I just started dropping my head in my hands and groaning .
Maybe it ’s just a taste thing , though .
I ’m not a fan of awkward humor at all and this movie uses up a lot of its laughing gas on awkward moments .
It also does a lot of stuff that is n’t particularly clever or fun or interesting , but is just obvious and annoying .
In the sequence in which Peter is spending time with various male acquaintances , it skates through a lot of agonizing stock gags including the inevitable accidental - date - with - a - gay - guy who then tries to kiss him .
I really wish the movie had n’t gone for this joke , but it did , and I ’m kind of ashamed of it for that .
And then we have Peter playing a drinking game with a group full of alpha males which culminates in him projectile vomiting all over Jon Favreau .
This is just not funny to me .
Favreau also had a presence I can’t stand .
He ’s not in much of the movie , but his stuff is just angry asshole humor that is n’t particularly clever or funny to me .
A lot of the supporting cast of the film just plays things up to the cartoonish level that the main cast always seems to be flirting with .
From the Tevin guy that Peter works with to Joe Lo Truglio ’s sporadically squeaky - voiced soccer enthusiast , everyone seems to be going for really broad comedy while the director seems focused on taking things more seriously in an effort to make us really care about these people .
Knocked
Up is a great movie because it plays out like a drama that happens to be about real people who are really funny .
I Love You , Man plays out in straight - forward romantic comedy formula with a cast that ’s unsure of whether or not they ’re supposed to be winking at the camera .
Maybe it ’s just me and my stupid movie - nerd humor , but I thought the funniest stuff in the movie were all the jokes about Chocolat and M. Knight Shyamalan , and there ’s even a brief Back to the Future reference ( see if you can catch it ! ) .
But even the Lou Ferrigno jokes just stopped being funny after awhile .
To be honest , what probably would have been the best material in the film was the scenes with SNL ’s Andy Samberg , but since most of that was used in the trailer and he had minimal screen - time , it ends up being kinda forgettable .
I wanted to like the movi–and I expected to , based on all the great things that I had been hearing ( and despite what I thought was an underwhelming trailer ) .
But at the end of the day , it ’s just not a very well put - together movie , and it ’s not very funny .
I ca n’t believe this film is getting such strong reviews ( and that Duplicity ‘s reviews , while thankfully positive , are generally less enthusiastic ) .
I think people just have Judd Apatow on the brain when they watch it and it enhances the experience a bit .
It ’s understandable I guess , since John Hamburg uses the same cast and the same kinds of themes and ideas as all of Apatow ’s successful films .
But he just does n’t have the honesty , brains , and style .
The finished product is like a K - Mart brand version of an Apatow movie , with a label that says “ Compare to active ingredients in Apatow films , ” but we know it ’s just not the same and not as effective .
Apatow has a means of making juvenile humor that ’s somehow also adult and smart .
Hamburg makes juvenile humor that ’s just juvenile .
And anyone can do that .
Porting a C extension module to Python 3.0
Date : 9 December 2008
Tags : computing , grok , pyephem , python , zope
With several packages already advertising Python 3.0 compatibility , it seemed high time to look into releasing my PyEphem astronomy package in an edition compatible with the new language .
But I hesitated : how difficult is it really , and how many hours of work will it consume , to port a C - language extension module to Python 3.0 ?
The answer is that , while the necessary changes were surprisingly easy , they took lots of time to figure out because I did not find them documented in any one place .
I offer the following notes to assist any other adventurers who want to experiment with porting their extension modules to 3.0 .
These notes might also suggest useful additions to the official documentation .
But , first , I need to issue three cautions .
To develop under 3.0 , you may have to forego several Python tools that you probably thought you could no longer do without .
The world of 3.0 is a windswept and icy landscape from which the glaciers have just receded , and you will find the stone tools rather primitive when compared to the comforts of civilization that you enjoy under Python 2 .
To wit :
I cannot find virtualenv for 3.0 , which is a disaster .
This means that you have to create a separate Python 3.0 install , built with a different -- prefix option to ./ configure , for each development environment you want to create on your box .
option to , for each development environment you want to create on your box .
I cannot find a version of the setuptools available for 3.0 .
This means limiting your setup.py instructions to the primitive vocabulary of the distutils package .
For example , I find myself unable to run the PyEphem test suite at this late hour because I have been running it for so long with : $ python setup .
py test
instructions to the primitive vocabulary of the package .
For example , I find myself unable to run the PyEphem test suite at this late hour because I have been running it for so long with :
Should you succeed in porting your extension module , it is not at all clear how to distribute it .
I had expected either a new PyPI to spring into being — since every package will need an entirely different version under 3.0 — or for a sophisticated scheme to appear for registering one pyephem.tar.gz as the Python 2 version and another pyephem.tar.gz for 3.0 .
But while the most recent version of your package can mark itself as 2 - compatible or 3 - compatible ( or both ) using classifiers , there is no way to have two “ most recent ” versions of a package .
Are we supposed to start distributing a single tar.gz that includes the source code for both Python series , and that selects the right code by detecting the interpreter version at the top of the setup .py file ?
So if you make the effort to port your code right now , you might find that the shiny new version of your module is all dressed up , but has no place to go .
If you experiment with the following steps , though , you will at least be ready when an official distribution channel does appear for releasing your package into the wilds of 3.0 .
Four Steps To 3.0
Yes , four steps were all that were necessary to convert my quite complex extension module to Python 3.0 !
Use PyModule_Create ( ) .
The old mechanism that I had been using to initialize my extension module , the rather clunkily - named Py_InitModule3 ( ) , happily does not even exist in the Python 3.0 header files .
Instead , call the PyModule_Create ( ) function which you can find described in the Module Initialization section of the Extending and Embedding document .
And be sure to keep its return value : unlike in older Pythons , you now have to return the module object it creates as the return value from your module initialization function .
Adjust all Python object headers .
Each type object in my code started with a macro to set up the common fields that all Python objects share .
This was then followed by the ob_size field , which in my code always is always zero , and then the type name : /* For Python 2 */ static PyTypeObject BinaryStarType = { PyObject_HEAD_INIT
( NULL ) 0 , /* ob_size */ " ephem.BinaryStar " , /* tp_name */ ...
Though the Python 3.0 documentation still shows this as the way to create types , this technique will now completely fail .
( The bug indicating that the documentation gets this wrong has , as its most recent comment , the helpful note “ I 'm lowering the priority so it does n't block the release . ” )
Anyway , the solution is simple : the first two lines in the struct shown above simply have to be combined into a single macro call : /* For Python 3.0 */ static PyTypeObject BinaryStarType = { PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT
( NULL , 0 ) " ephem.BinaryStar " , /* tp_name */ ...
With this change , my objects are now operating fine .
Use plain “ static . ”
PyEphem inherits code from an era when it was popular to use variations on the static keyword so that Python could work around problems with various troublesome C compilers .
This filled my code with staticforward declarations like the one you can see at the top of the old Python 2.2 Defining New Types page .
It turns out that for well - behaved compilers these were always simply synonyms for the static keyword , which is what you must replace them with when porting your code to 3.0 .
Upgrade to Unicode .
Python 3.0 makes a clean and sharp distinction between strings , which are sequences of Unicode characters , and byte arrays , which can represent anything .
To reflect this sea change down at the C level , the decision was made to eliminate everything from the C API whose name started with PyString .
The obvious compiler errors that result from this provide a clear signal to programmers that they have to decide , everywhere that they had been using an old - style Python string , whether they should now represent that data with the PyUnicode or the PyBytes type .
This was a brilliant decision ; the transition could have been a nightmare had it remained possible for old code to compile without having been properly converted !
When migrating the PyEphem code base , I found that most of the Unicode transition was very easy .
Everywhere that my code handled or created a string object , I simply changed the prefix of the function to PyUnicode and everything worked : PyString_Check ... becomes ... PyUnicode_Check PyString_FromString ... becomes ... PyUnicode_FromString PyString_FromFormat ... becomes ... PyUnicode_FromFormat
Well , okay , the trick does not work everywhere ; this one was harder to guess : PyString_Size ... becomes ... PyUnicode_GET_SIZE
The situations that require real thought are the places where my code needs to convert a Python string into the sort of simple ASCII character array that the underlying C library can absorb .
At the moment , my code is leaning heavily on a pitiful PyUnicode_AsString ( ) routine that I wrote just to get things working ; in the morning I will have to look into doing this more correctly , including catching the error if a fancy Unicode character is present that cannot properly be converted .
Overall , I am very impressed with how quickly I was able to get my extension module compiling and running under Python 3.0 .
The procedure was simple — I just tried , over and over again , to build the module with :
$ python3 .0 setup .
py build
and then tackled the compiler errors that resulted .
Once every last warning had been addressed , the module started up and operated without a single further complaint .
This calls for celebration !
I 'm going to bed .

If you are a Comcast subscriber that worries about exceeding the 250 GB data cap , I have some good news .
A usage meter is in the works that will help you avoid this problem .

Obviously , the vast majority of subscribers will never have to worry about service suspension or termination because of bandwidth overages , but for those that do , a tool like this is vital .
Up until now , Comcast urged concerned customers to download bandwidth meters online or rely on a meter contained within the McAfee Security Suite to track their usage .
According to DSL reports , this online tool could come as early as January 5th and it will update users on a three hour delay — not in real time .
Not a perfect solution , but at least it will be convenient .

The Perfect Server - Debian Lenny ( Debian 5.0 ) [ ISPConfig 2 ]
Version 1.0
Author : Falko Timme
This tutorial shows how to set up a Debian Lenny ( Debian 5.0 ) server that offers all services needed by ISPs and hosters : Apache web server ( SSL - capable ) , Postfix mail server with SMTP - AUTH and TLS , BIND DNS server , Proftpd FTP server , MySQL server , Courier POP3 / IMAP , Quota , Firewall , etc .
In the end you should have a system that works reliably , and if you like you can install the free webhosting control panel ISPConfig 2 ( i.e. , ISPConfig runs on it out of the box ) .
I will use the following software :
Web Server : Apache 2.2.9 with PHP 5.2.6 , Python , and Ruby
Database Server : MySQL 5.0.51a
Mail Server : Postfix
DNS Server : BIND9
FTP Server : proftpd
POP3 / IMAP : I will use Maildir format and therefore install Courier - POP3 / Courier - IMAP .
Webalizer for web site statistics
Please note that this setup does not work for ISPConfig 3 !
It is valid for ISPConfig 2 only !
I want to say first that this is not the only way of setting up such a system .
There are many ways of achieving this goal but this is the way I take .
I do not issue any guarantee that this will work for you !
1 Requirements
To install such a system you will need the following :
the Debian Lenny network installation CD , available here : http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/5.0.0/i386/iso-cd/debian-500-i386-netinst.iso ( i386 ) or http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/5.0.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-500-amd64-netinst.iso ( x86_64 )
a fast Internet connection .
2 Preliminary Note
In this tutorial I use the hostname server1.example.com with the IP address 192.168.0.100 and the gateway 192.168.0.1 .
These settings might differ for you , so you have to replace them where appropriate .
3 The Base System
Insert your Debian Lenny network installtion CD into your system and boot from it .
Select Install ( this will start the text installer - if you prefer a graphical installer , select Graphical install ) :
Choose your language :
Then select your location :
Choose a keyboard layout :

The installer checks the installation CD , your hardware , and configures the network with DHCP if there is a DHCP server in the network :
Enter the hostname .
In this example , my system is called server1.example.com , so I enter server1 :

Enter your domain name .
In this example , this is example.com :
Now you have to partition your hard disk .
For simplicity 's sake I will create one big partition ( with the mount point /) and a little swap partition so I select Guided - use entire disk ( of course , the partitioning is totally up to you - if you like , you can create more than just one big partition , and you can also use LVM ) :
Select the disk that you want to partition :
Then select the partitioning scheme .
As mentioned before , I select All files in one partition ( recommended for new users ) for simplicity 's sake - it 's up to your likings what you choose here :
When you 're finished , select Finish partitioning and write changes to disk :

For the last five years a small Moscow - based NGO , the SOVA Centre for Information and Analysis , has produced an annual report on radical nationalist activity in Russia and the efforts of state and non-state bodies to counteract it .
This year they 've issued another 24 pages of sober calculation and analysis , opting for the most conservative estimates ( minimum number of ‘ hate murders ' in 2008 - 97 ) and carefully examining the significant , if limited , progress made in combating this activity .
Despite the lack of sensationalism and hyperbole , it is a truly disturbing read .
To calculate the number of individuals attacked , acts of vandalism and other extremist activity , SOVA researchers monitor websites ( including neo - Nazi and anti-fascist web - forums ) , and collate data from reports and statements issued by other NGO activists and by law enforcement bodies such as regional prosecutors ' offices .
However , they mostly rely on media reports for their figures .
Therein lies the rub : the quality of their data relies to a great extent on the efficiency and accuracy of journalists , and the readiness of those bodies dealing with victims and perpetrators to release information to the press .
And as the report repeatedly points out , neither the media nor the authorities can be relied upon to convey accurate , comprehensive and timely information about ultra - right activity .
SOVA researchers are well aware of the limitations of their methodology , and consistently alert their readers to the problems .
They exclude from their statistics any incident where the ‘ hate motive ' is not absolutely certain .
Their figures for violent crime are further reduced , as they point out , because they do not include incidents reported in the Caucasus , as they deem any data available from this area to be too unreliable to analyse .
Nor do they include violence committed against street homeless , on the grounds that motive is almost impossible to ascertain .
Gun crime is also excluded unless the police specifically identify a racist motive .
This latter exclusion tacitly acknowledges the risk of counting contract killings committed for business reasons as racist crimes , simply because the victim is from an ethnic minority .
Problems of data collection
The difficulty SOVA faces is not just that of correctly distinguishing a ‘ hate crime ' from an ‘ ordinary ' crime .
Finding the information at all is the real problem .
Like most EU countries , Russia does not yet have a central mechanism for systematically recording racist incidents .
Victims of racism and religiously - motivated violence ( or , more accurately , violence against individuals on grounds of their perceived religious affiliation ) are often reluctant to approach authorities they perceive as unsympathetic or even hostile .
Under - reporting is an issue in any country .
In Britain , it took the racist killing of Stephen Lawrence in 1993 , and the 1999 report from the inquiry into how the system could have failed to bring his murderers to justice , to prompt improved reporting and recording methods in the UK .
As a result Britain appears to have a far greater problem with racist violence than any other country in the European Community .
Currently , international comparisons tell us more about how countries are tackling the problem of racism than the extent of the problem itself .
Steady increase
SOVA figures over the past five years reveal a steady increase in violent crime , mostly related to neo -Nazi and skinhead activity .
In 2004 , 264 individuals were attacked , of whom 49 died .
In 2006 the figure was 541 , resulting in 55 fatalities .
Last year there were 525 victims , of whom 97 died .
SOVA 's figures tend to adjust slightly over the year as new information becomes available , but the current total number of attacks is slightly lower than last year 's ( 690 , of whom 85 died ) .
They suggest several reasons for this lower figure , but not that there might have been fewer attacks .
The general trend , they argue , reveals a well - organised , increasingly experienced neo -Nazi network , committing increasingly violent crimes .
SOVA suggests that the lower number of reported attacks and increased level of violence are related , arguing that Russian society - and therefore the media - has grown indifferent to racist and extreme nationalist activity .
Incidents are no longer newsworthy unless they are sensational .
As a result , radical nationalists are committing more sensational crimes , and in at least one instance , responding to public statements that crimes are not racist by proving that they are .
In response to an announcement by law enforcement officials that the murder of a Chinese man in September 2008 was an ‘ ordinary ' murder rather than a racist crime , a video was posted on the internet of his death at the hands of skinheads .
The blurring of fantasy violence and real suffering may have been around since human beings could write or even draw , but the mobile phone camera and the internet have ushered in a truly chilling era .
The report also remarks , in a footnote , that on 16 January 2009 , an infamous neo -Nazi was found guilty of faking the execution of a person in the name of the ‘ Russian Ku- Klux - Klan ' , specially filmed at the request of an ATV journalist .
After the revelation that the internet clip of the brutal execution - style murders of a Tajik and Dagestani man in 2007 was genuine footage , this seems almost inconceivably irresponsible journalism .
The SOVA report continually highlights the failings of the Russian media .
There is the self - censorship that results in regional ( and sometimes national ) media ceasing to report racist or ‘ extremist ' crime following announcements by local politicians that such crimes have been eradicated .
There is the careless or malicious dissemination of inflammatory material .
There is the failure to release accurate and timely reports during the mass disturbances which are now labelled ‘ Kondopoga - style ' events , in reference to the riots in the Karelian town of Kondopoga in 2006 .
The Kondopoga scenario
This latter phenomenon merits its own section of SOVA 's report .
The ‘ Kondopoga scenario ' is an opportunity - an ‘ ordinary ' crime , fight or disturbance involving individuals from an ethnic minority - which nationalists seek to exploit for political purposes .
The pattern developed in Kondopoga in 2006 has yet to be replicated with the same degree of success .
But the pattern is that nationalist agitators arrive on the scene to escalate the violence and inflame latent tensions .
They then ‘ help to resolve ' these tensions by calling public meetings and demanding sanctions against ‘ immigrants ' .
SOVA 's evidence suggests that despite the media 's failure to respond appropriately to such ‘ provocations ' , local authorities are now wise to these tactics and better able to deal with them .
Karagai local authority ( in Perm region ) is singled out for particular praise .
The MovementAgainst Illegal Immigration ( better known by its Russian acronym , DPNI ) has been instrumental in manipulating most of these Kondopoga - type scenarios , and indeed can be credited with transforming the face - and the vocabulary - of Russian racism in recent years .
Protesting against the influx of ‘ migrants ' in the rhetoric of the European far right , the DPNI has gathered an alarming degree of popular support and media airtime , despite its close connections with skinheads and other marginal extreme nationalist groups .
The good news
Perhaps the most encouraging news in the report is that the acrimonious fragmentation the DPNI experienced in 2008 has yet to be resolved .
As a result , the ‘ Russian march ' held annually on November 4 since 2005 reflected the divisions that continue to plague the nationalist movement .
In 2008 there were three separate ‘ Russian march ' events in Moscow , two of which were organised by DPNI splinter groups .
In contrast to the first Moscow march , which attracted around 3,000 participants , it seems that less than half that number joined the farcically disorganised Moscow marches in 2008 .
More constructive news is to be found in the section on combating radical nationalism .
After years - along with many other researchers and NGOs - of lamenting contradictory or inadequate legislation , inept investigations and the dearth of prosecutions , SOVA reports that criminal proceedings against racists are increasing both in quality ( with better investigations leading to more convictions ) and in quantity .
There have even been successful prosecutions of racist law enforcement officials - against one police officer who maintained a neo -Nazi blog and another who colluded in a racist attack .
However , those working within the criminal justice system are , like NGOs working in this field , increasingly finding themselves the target of neo -Nazi intimidation .
Judges and prosecutors found themselves included in the latest list of ‘ enemies of the Russian people ' that was published on the internet in early 2008 , along with journalists , members of the Public Chamber and human rights activists .
Unusually , personal details such as home addresses were included on the list - a serious enough issue given the 2004 murder of Nikolai Girenko , for example , an academic and expert witness for the criminal justice system in Petersburg who was shot through his own front door .
Threats , including the mailing of photos of a severed head , have followed .
The fact that the extreme right have lost their political lobby is further good news .
Not only , the report points out , did ultra right groups fail to win any seats in the December 2007 elections , but most of their former allies lost their seats .
With the fracture of the thus - far influential DPNI , and the loss of active nationalist politicians , two major factors for generating and encouraging racism and discriminatory behaviour amongst the ordinary populace - which generally takes a dim view of neo -Nazis and skinhead gangs - are weakened .
Future trends
SOVA identifies another two factors which may take their place , however .
Firstly , the appearance of groups of youths from the Caucasus committing violent retaliatory acts is encouraging the public ( led by a media which describes these new groups as ‘ skinheads from the Caucasus ' ) to perceive nationalist violence as necessary vigilantism .
Secondly , the pro-Kremlin youth groups , most significantlythe Young Guard of United Russia , joined the DPNI 's anti-immigrant band wagon in 2008 with a Russia - wide campaign ‘ Our money to our people ' , which effectively demanded that vacancies be offered to Russian citizens in preference to economic migrants from abroad .
SOVA argue that the participation of ‘ official ' groups in such campaigns legitimizes ‘ ethnically - coloured anti-migrant moods and discriminatory practice . '
Since this sort of protectionism is a growing worldwidetrend in a worsening economic climate , we should probably expect to see more of it .
One can only hope that the racist violence so carefully documented by SOVA does not continue to rise alongside it .
March 29 , 2009
The adage that the more things change , they remain the same , is holding true with the US .
With lot of fanfare about Change and We Can Change , Obama ignited hope not only in his own nation , but all around the world .
Bush warmongering had touched raw nerves all around the world .
America and Bush were the most hated words in world vocabulary .
However , Obama�s public address today over his plans for Afghanistan and Pakistan , have dampened the hope for any change for the better .
Obama asked a question : why US was in Afghanistan ?
His own answer to that simple question was as convincing about the presence of Al Qaida in Afghanistan and Tribal areas of Pakistan as Bush allegation of WMD in Iraq .
Bush was not able to fool the world over his simplistic harangue over Sadaam�s non existent Weapons of Mass Destruction .
Obama himself does not appear to be convinced of the Al Qaida menace , while enunciating his plan to tackle terrorism that ' threatens � US and its allied countries in the world .
The whole warmongering rationale is pat and stale .
When he says : " I want the American people to understand that we have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat the Taliban and al - Qaeda . "
This is like chasing a mirage .
Of course , there are radicals in the targeted area .
But Obama fails to understand that the radicals are radicalized mainly over US presence in the Muslim world and this presence is imperialistic , imposed and apparently unending .
The more Obama will introduce and activate foreign presence in this quagmire , the more he will sink , possibly never to ever come out .
Obama�s cosmetic improvement in his laid out plan , stresses the addition of more reconstructive focus on US efforts to help common people in the region enjoy better living condition , so that they would realise how benevolent and well - meaning US stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan is .
However , the more visual part that affects the psyche of the Afpak people is America�s high - handed hunting of Al Qaida , that not only kills innocent people , but is highly damaging to their self - respect , their pride , their national sovereignty .
The time lag between US aggression and any future development that the measly 1.5 billion per year as promised will bring to the civilians is so pronounced that prima facie , the whole US effort is a non-starter .
Besides , US aggression is planned to sow seeds of civil war in the region .
That has its own dynamics .
The US is digging a new hole to fill up the old hole .
This brings out the un-tenability of Obama�s new plan .
Obama must strive to pacify both countries first .
The more stress is on peace , the more distant will be the days of war on much larger scale .
Obama can and should change both Afghanistan and Pakistan in a new Marshall Plan like grand strategy but it can only be successful , if its forces disappear from the visible horizon and both nation�s national pride is restored .
America�s constant obsession to identify its adversaries in terms of Islam and radicalized Islamism is most counterproductive and must be checked in real - time .
America must make peace with Islam and make it an ally in bringing peace to the region .
Islam is here to stay , and the sooner Obama can convince his adviser to change their strategies that has been focused through neo-con influences on fighting Islam and Islamists , the sooner he will win the hearts and mind of the people of the region .
Obama must change his music sheet .

Company Developing Energy - Efficient Ship that Floats on Air
January 2nd , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Rotterdam - based marine - engineering firm DK Group has been quietly testing one of the strangest - sounding technologies to come along in the recent past — a ship that floats on air .
This past September , the company let loose a 272 foot long cargo vessel in Norway ’s Oslo Fjord .
25 feet below the ship ’s surface , recesses built into the underside of the vessel ’s hull created drag - reducing pockets .
The reduction in drag meant that the ship used 7 percent less oil than it normally would .
It also significantly reduced carbon dioxide emissions .
DK Group estimates that implementing air cavity systems to ships adds only 2 to 3 percent to building costs .
If the company ’s technology is widely adopted , it could be hugely beneficial to the merchant shipping industry , which emits 800 million tons of CO2 annually .
And of course , anything that even begins to wean us off petroleum deserves praise .

WASHINGTON  President Obama 's call to community service is getting a big boost from the recession .
Applications are soaring at government - funded service programs , the stimulus package includes $ 200 million to boost those efforts and Congress is looking for more ways to expand opportunities to help others .
" There 's a convergence of a great need for citizen service and a great appetite by Americans for service , " says Alan Solomont , chairman of the Corporation for National and Community Service , which oversees the main government - funded service programs including AmeriCorps .
That " perfect storm … will do the kinds of things for this generation and this country that military service did for the Greatest Generation . "
Online applications are coming in three times faster than a year ago at AmeriCorps , which was created by former president Bill Clinton in 1993 and strongly supported by former president George W. Bush .
Those who are accepted into the program agree to serve for roughly a year , for an allowance of just $ 11,400 , tutoring needy children , building houses in poor communities , helping the elderly sign up for health care , responding to natural disasters and more .
Obama wants to expand the program to accommodate both the growing need and desire to perform community service .
He is proposing $ 1.13 billion in next year 's budget for the umbrella corporation .
That would be a $ 241 million increase from this year 's budget and it would pave the way for AmeriCorps to expand from 75,000 positions to 250,000 in coming years .
At the Peace Corps , whose volunteers work overseas , applications are up 16 % over last year .
The recession has offered a selling point for recruiters : Serving " strengthens a resume , " says spokeswoman Laura Lartigue .
In Congress , a Senate committee will hold a hearing Tuesday on the Serve America Act , sponsored by Sens. Edward Kennedy , D - Mass. , and Orrin Hatch , R - Utah .
The legislation would increase opportunities for community service in a variety of ways from offering tax incentives for employers who allow workers to take time off for service to setting up funds to help non-profit groups recruit more volunteers .
" As our nation confronts the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression , an enhanced commitment to local and community service is needed now more than ever , " White House budget director Peter Orszag wrote to Kennedy on March 6 , encouraging the committee he heads to approve the legislation .
" As private citizens begin to do more in their communities , " Hatch says , " in the long run , it will mean that the government will have to do less to provide for those in need . "

The judge questioned the juror about his research , which included evidence that the judge had specifically excluded .
Mr. Raben recalls thinking that if the juror had not broadly communicated his information with the rest of the jury , the trial could continue and the eight weeks would not be wasted .
“ We can just kick this juror off and go , ” he said .
But then the judge found that eight other jurors had done the same thing  conducting Google searches on the lawyers and the defendant , looking up news articles about the case , checking definitions on Wikipedia and searching for evidence that had been specifically excluded by the judge .
One juror , asked by the judge about the research , said , “ Well , I was curious , ” according to Mr. Raben .
“ It was a heartbreak , ” Mr. Raben added .
Information flowing out of the jury box can be nearly as much trouble as the information flowing in ; jurors accustomed to posting regular updates on their day - to - day experiences and thoughts can find themselves on a collision course with the law .
In the Arkansas case , Stoam Holdings , the company trying to overturn the $ 12.6 million judgment , said a juror , Johnathan Powell , had sent Twitter messages during the trial .
Mr. Powell ’s messages included “ oh and nobody buy Stoam .
Its bad mojo and they ’ll probably cease to Exist , now that their wallet is 12 m lighter ” and “ So Johnathan , what did you do today ?
Oh nothing really , I just gave away TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS of somebody else ’s money . ”
Mr. Powell , 29 , the manager of a one - hour photo booth at a Wal - Mart in Fayetteville , Ark. , insisted in an interview that he had not sent any substantive messages about the case until the verdict had been delivered and he was released from his obligation not to discuss the case .
“ I was done when I mentioned the trial at all , ” he said .
“ They ’re welcome to pull my phone records . ”
But juror research is a more troublesome issue than sending Twitter messages or blogging , Mr. Keene said , and it raises new issues for judges in giving instructions .
“ It ’s important that they do n’t know what ’s excluded , and it ’s important that they do n’t know why it ’s excluded , ” Mr. Keene said .
The court cannot even give a full explanation to jurors about research  say , to tell them what not to look for  so instructions are usually delivered as blanket admonitions , he said .
The UK says it is still in discussion over Mr Browne 's role Sri Lanka has rejected the British PM 's nomination of a former defence secretary , Des Browne , as his special envoy to the country .
It said the nomination of Mr Browne was " a disrespectful intrusion " .
PM Gordon Brown had said Mr Browne would work closely with the Sri Lankan government and community leaders .
But President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his cabinet said the appointment was " unhelpful " and was made without consulting them .
A foreign ministry statement said the appointment was tantamount to an " intrusion of Sri Lanka 's internal affairs " .
See map of the region " Further , the cabinet perceived that this would be a hindrance in pursuing a sustainable solution to the conflict in terms of a Sri Lankan agenda , " it said .
Sri Lanka 's government says more civilians are fleeing rebel - held areas Correspondents say that Colombo's rejection of Mr Browne is an embarrassment for the British government , especially because Sri Lanka has accused the UK - its former colonial power - of " unilaterally " appointing him .
A Downing Street spokesman told the BBC that dialogue over Mr Browne 's role was still taking place with Sri Lanka and that it still hoped he could work with all sides to secure a peace agreement and alleviate further suffering .
' Complete mess ' But Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama warned of " major repercussions " for relations with Britain over his nomination .
" There is no further discussion with London on the matter , " Mr Bogollagama told the AFP news agency .
The Media Minister Anura Yapa said the government had voiced its " displeasure " to the British High Commission in Colombo .
Des Browne 's new job has also brought criticism from the political opposition in Britain .
Speaking for the Conservatives , Liam Fox , said it was a further example of Gordon Brown 's incompetence as prime minister .
" Having presided over calamitous damage to our economy , " said Mr Fox , " he is now making a complete mess of relations with friendly countries overseas . "
The Liberal Democrats criticised Gordon Brown for not taking tougher action on Sri Lanka , by seeking a ceasefire in through diplomatic channels at the United Nations .
' Influx '
Tens of thousands of civilians are still believed trapped in fighting between the army and Tamil Tiger rebels in the north - east .
The defence ministry has said that hundreds more Tamil civilians have fled the war zone , while others trapped by the fighting are being used as " human shields " by the rebels .
The Tigers have in turn accused the army of shelling civilian areas including hospitals .
About 50,000 soldiers are pressing the Tamil Tigers into a patch of north - eastern jungle after taking the key areas of Kilinochchi , Elephant Pass and Mullaitivu .
The government has rejected international calls for a ceasefire , demanding the rebels lay down their arms .
The Tigers have said they will not do so until they have a " guarantee of living with freedom and dignity and sovereignty " .

The Seiyuu Connection
Many new time anime fans wonder , what exactly is the point of following the voice cast of a particular show ?
Well , most of the time , there is n’t one , except for the whole hearing people talk thing maybe , but if you stick it out and start paying attention to particularly prominent seiyuu across several different shows , you start to notice patterns — hilarious patterns , ironic patterns , and patterns that can only be described as karmic retribution .
Surely , the voice acting industry in Japan is huge compared to in North America , how many connections could a single voice actor have ?
A ridiculously large amount , that ’s how many .
The seiyuu world is a surprisingly small place , and the most hilarious facts about a show are sometimes those that are squarely in the casting .
In all my experience as an anime fan , no other Seiyuu has managed to spring so many of these phenomena in such as short time as the rising star seiyuu with the ultra adorable voice , Kana Hanazawa .
Ignoring the fact that I ’m a huge fan of hers and decidedly incredibly bias towards any show she stars in , let ’s get the ball rolling :
Note :
When in doubt , Kana Hanakawa is the one playing the adorable little sister with the flat chest , well , except for in Kannagi .
That ’s just an adorable little sister with a really dynamic chest .
* huff * * puff *
Phew , I have n’t even gotten around to Getsuman to Heiki Mina , Blassreiter or Shina Dark connections yet ^_^ .
Outside of that though , there could n’t possibly be more connections than that , right … right ?!
Well , looking at the anime line up for 2009 , let ’s put it this way , you know you ’ve broken into the seiyuu industry when you play the youngest of four sisters and all of your older sisters are voiced by people who have a seiyuu history of trying to kill your character at one point or another .

Kaminsky calls for DNSSEC deployment
ARLINGTON , VA . --
Dan Kaminsky 's second act has begun : Pushing the adoption of the DNSSEC security standard for the domain - name system .
So many security frameworks — from password resets via e-mail to SSL certificates — rely on DNS in some way that the protocol has to be secured for Internet security to work , Kaminsky told attendees at the Black Hat DC Security Briefings .
DNSSEC is by far the leading security standard for the domain - name system , and the U.S. government has already committed to deploying the protocol this year .
However , DNSSEC is hard to deploy and maintain and is a political hot potato , because in the simplest case , a single root — administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce — would authenticate the entire domain - name system for the Internet , Kaminsky said .
Yet , other countries can maintain their own root servers for their domains , and as long as the servers are maintained , the DNS system will continue to work , he said .
" Politics is getting in our way more than security , " Kaminsky said .
" It 's time to sign the root and be done with it . "
Last July , Kaminsky and a number of Internet infrastructure companies announced that he had discovered a significant attack on the domain - name system .
The companies issued patches for their products , but within three weeks , online attackers had already started using the flaw to attack some popular domains .
Many DNS servers remain unpatched , he said .
Kaminsky , who is the director of penetration testing for security firm IOActive , has taken two months leave from his work to advocate DNSSEC adoption , he told SecurityFocus .
The researcher also argued for simple implementations of DNSSEC .
While the protocol is fine , DNSSEC systems are not easy to deploy or maintain .
Without automation , administrators will keep putting off deployments , he stressed .

PRINTS , SOURCE FILES , and other Periodic Table of Typeface related goodies are available Large original English version HERE Spanish version HERE Portuguese version HERE PRINTS , SOURCE FILES , and other Periodic Table of Typeface related goodies are available
The Periodic Table of Typefaces is obviously in the style of all the thousands of over - sized Periodic Table of Elements posters hanging in schools and homes around the world .
This particular table lists 100 of the m ost popular , influential and noto rious typefaces today .
As with traditional periodic tables , this table presents the subject matter grouped categorically .
The Table of Typefaces groups by families and classes of typefaces : sans - serif , serif , script , blackletter , glyphic , display , grotesque , realist , didone , garalde , geometric , humanist , slab - serif and mixed .
Each c
nd a ranking of 1 through 100 .
Ranking was determined by statistically sorting and combining lists and opinions from the the sites listed below .
The final overall ranking was achieved depending on how many lists the particular typeface was presented on and it's ranking on the lists ( if the particular source list used a ranking system ; some did not , in which case just the typeface 's presence on the list boosted it 's overall score . )
After averaging the typefaces appearances and rankings a composite score was given and the list was sorted on a spreadsheet then finally given an overall score of 1 through 100 based on its final resting position .
Unfortunately , the typefaces could not be sorted exactly numerically on the table while at the same time keeping them in groups of families and classes .
It had to be one or the other .
Of course it COULD have been done but I would have had to seriously sacrifice aesthetics of the overall design ( i.e. it would n't have come out looking AT ALL like a traditional periodic table . )

U.S. to yield marijuana jurisdiction to states DRUG LAWS
Attorney General Eric Holder addresses the media at the Justice Department in Washington , Wednesday , Feb. 25 , 2009 .

U.S. Attorney General Eric
Holder is sending strong signals that President Obama - who as a candidate said states should be allowed to make their own rules on medical marijuana - will end raids on pot dispensaries in California .
Asked at a Washington news conference Wednesday about Drug Enforcement Administration raids in California since Obama took office last month , Holder said the administration has changed its policy .
" What the president said during the campaign , you 'll be surprised to know , will be consistent with what we 'll be doing here in law enforcement , " he said .
" What he said during the campaign is now American policy . "
Bill Piper , national affairs director of the Drug Policy Alliance , a marijuana advocacy group , said the statement is encouraging .
" I think it definitely signals that Obama is moving in a new direction , that it means what he said on the campaign trail that marijuana should be treated as a health issue rather than a criminal justice issue , " he said .
Piper said Obama has also indicated he will drop the federal government 's long - standing opposition to health officials ' needle - exchange programs for drug users .
During one campaign appearance , Obama recalled that his mother had died of cancer and said he saw no difference between doctor - prescribed morphine and marijuana as pain relievers .
He told an interviewer in March that it was " entirely appropriate " for a state to legalize the medical use of marijuana " with the same controls as other drugs prescribed by doctors . "
After the federal Drug Enforcement Agency raided a marijuana dispensary at South Lake Tahoe on Jan. 22 , two days after Obama 's inauguration , and four others in the Los Angeles area on Feb.
2 , White House spokesman Nick Schapiro responded to advocacy groups ' protests by noting that Obama had not yet appointed his drug policy team .
" The president believes that federal resources should not be used to circumvent state laws " and expects his appointees to follow that policy , Schapiro said .
The federal government has fought state medicinal pot laws since Californians voted in 1996 to repeal criminal penalties for medical use of marijuana .
President Bill Clinton 's administration won a Supreme Court case , originating in Oakland , that allowed federal authorities to shut down nonprofit organizations that supplied medical marijuana to their members .
Clinton 's Justice Department was thwarted by federal courts in an attempt to punish California doctors who recommended marijuana to their patients .
President George W. Bush 's administration went further , raiding medical marijuana growers and clinics , prosecuting suppliers under federal drug laws after winning another Supreme Court case and pressuring commercial property owners to evict marijuana dispensaries by threatening legal action .
The Bush administration also blocked a University of Massachusetts researcher 's attempt to grow marijuana for studies of its medical properties .
Piper , of the Drug Policy Alliance , said he hopes Obama will reverse that position .
" If you removed the obstacles to research , " he said , " in 10 to 15 years , marijuana will be available in pharmacies . "

Laminar Flow Hood - Build a HEPA filter flowhood ( updated : May 29 , 2020 , at 08:42 PM )
dead link reports , comments and suggestions welcome any time
Table of contents
Why you need one
A laminar flow hood is a piece of equipment which makes sterile working procedures in mushroom cultivation easier and reliable .
A flow hood consists of a coarse pre-filter , a blower and a very fine filter ( the so called HEPA ( High Efficiency Particulate Air ) filter which filters particles from the air to a high degree .
This makes the air coming out of the HEPA filter nearly sterile which allows doing transfers in this stream of sterile air without worrying about contaminants entering from the air and contaminating the cultures .
Getting started
You should begin the construction by selecting a HEPA filter and a blower .
The HEPA filter size depends on how big you want to have your working space .
The smallest filter size you can reasonably use ( for home scale cultivation ) is 1ft x 1ft , better though 1ft x 2ft or 2ft x 2ft if you are going to inoculate filter bags .

Match a blower to the filter
Once you decided on the size of the HEPA filter , you have to match a suitable blower to this particular filter .
This is a very important step , so make sure to study the directions thoroughly .
Every filter has a " resistance " when air blows through it at a certain speed , this resistance is called the " static pressure " .
Press your hand against your mouth .
Now try to blow through it .
Dependant on how firm you press it against your mouth , you will have some difficulties blowing air out and you will feel some resistance , this is the static pressure .
Every filter has a different static pressure at the working point .
The working point is where the amount of the air flowing through the filter is sufficient to meet the requirement of the laminar flow .
The static pressure is expressed in inch of water column in the English units , a typical value would be 1 " , the SI unit for pressure is Pa( Pascal ) .
1 " water column is around 250 Pa .
Each filter has a data sheet ( consult the manufacturer if this is not the case with your filter ) where the static pressure at the working point is entered .
Before the air enters the blower it is usually pre-filtered by a furnace filter around 1 " ( 2.5 cm ) thick placed in front of the blower to protect it and the HEPA filter from big particles like dust and hairs .
It can be assumed that the static pressure for this prefilter at the working point is around 0.2 " ( 50 Pa )
According to Stamets ( Paul Stamets and J.S.Chilton : The Mushroom Cultivator p. 347 ff ) the air speed of the air flowing from the filter surface should be ( at least ) 100 feet per minute ( fpm ) .( around 30 meter per minute or 0.5 meter per second ) .
Determining the correct blower for a filter consists of several steps :
1 . Find out the area of your filter by multiplying the width and the hight in feet ( for instance the smallest reasonably usable filter would be 2ft x 1ft )
2ft x 1ft = 2 ft2
2. Multiply the required air speed ( the one Stamets specifies , 100 ft/ min ) with the area of your filter
100 ft/min x 2 ft2 = 200 ft3/min
So 200 ft3 / min( = cfm = " cubic feet per minute " ) is the amount of air your blower must deliver at the sum of the STATIC PRESSURE of the HEPA filter + prefilter .
NOTE : 1 cfm= 1.7m3 /h
So if you use the above filter with 1 " ( 250 Pa ) static pressure and a furnace prefilter with a static pressure of 0.2 " ( 50 Pa ) your blower must deliver 200 cfm ( 340m3/h ) of air at a static pressure of 1.2 " ( 300 Pa ) .
Finding the correct blower
Each blower has a data sheet ( consult the manufacturer if this is not the case with your blower ) where the correlation between the volumetric flow and the static pressure is represented by a graph or table .
Here is such a set of curves for 4 blowers ( numbered 1 - 4 ) .
NOTE : Each model of a blower has his own characteristic curve .
This chart shows the curves for 4 different particular models of axial duct blowers .
What you can clearly see is that the bigger the static pressure the less air the blower delivers , up to the maximum static pressure where the air output is zero .
Sometimes these data are presented in form of a table .
By now you know how much your blower must deliver and at which static pressure .
In our example it was 340 m3/h at 300 Pa .
So what we do now is to go in this chart and find the value of 300 Pa ( =1.2 " ) at the vertical axis .
Then you move to the right until you reach 340m3/h.( =200cfm )
Now , ideally there should be a curve of a blower going exactly trough this point , but this is not always the case .
So we have to choose a blower that best approximates our requirements .
In most cases we should choose a stronger blower , if it 's not too strong .
How strong is too strong ?
I 'd say the blower should n't deliver more that 20 % more air than we calculated , so in our case the strongest acceptable blower would be around 400 m3/h .
In this example we have a blower that delivers 300m3 / h( according to our calculation it should deliver 340 m3/h though ) .
This is a difference of mere 10 % .
The next stronger blower in this chart delivers 530 m3/ h at 300 Pa , which is way too much .
In this case we go for the smaller ( and cheaper ) blower ( Nr.4 ) instead of the much bigger one ( Nr.1 , which delivers 530 m3/h at 300 Pa ) , despite the fact that it 's generally recommended to take a stronger one .
NOTE : This chart is only an example for a set of 4 particular blowers .
The curves of the blowers available to you may look a bit different , but similar .
Usually , if you search long enough , you will be able to find a blower that exactly matches your HEPA .
The design in this pictorial uses an in - line centrifugal fan , another good option ( actually the one most commonly used for flow hoods ) is a squirrel cage blower ( also called shaded pole blower ) .
You can get many blowers at ebay.com , often at much cheaper prices than if you bought them directly .
Ebay offers
It is important to contact the seller in advance and inquire about the exact characteristics of the blower beforehand , so you do n't end up with a too weak blower .
When in doubt , head for the more powerful blower , you can still regulate it down if necessary with a variable speed controller / regulator :

Construction of the hood
After you bought the HEPA filter and a matching blower , you have to get some materials for the construction of the box that will accommodate the above 2 components .
Basically you want to build a box , the front wall of the box will consist of the HEPA filter , and another wall will have the inlet of the blower with the pre-filter mounted .
I had the material for the walls already cut to fit the size of the filter and the blower .
I begin by gluing and screwing the filter to the bottom wall .
Then I add the side walls .... .... and the back wall .
The blower will be mounted so the inlet is at the top .
A hole is cut in the wall at the top to accommodate the blower inlet .
The blower rests on a bar mounted in the box .
The white dots on the bar is some ( already dried ) silicone mass to provide some damping and lessens vibrations .
All the joints are filled with silicone mass so the box is airtight .
The top with the blower is screwed on the box .
The space around the opening and all other cracks in the box are tightened with silicone mass .
A pre filter is mounted atop of the blower .
I use a furnace filter , you can also use other filers , like car air filters , just make sure they are large enough and that they do n't have too much air resistance , otherwise you would need a larger blower .
Detail of the pre-filter .
A net is tackered to the frame of the HEPA filter to prevent touching and harming the delicate filter .
The finished flow hood .
Some pictures of a similar design , the only difference is that the blower is mounted around 10 cm deeper , so the pre filer is in the same level as the rest of the box .
Makes it more visually appealing and more compact this way .
Yet more pictures of the design on the right can be found in the gallery

The greatest man I will ever know :
My father , L. Richard Grigg , holding his grandson , Jefferson Leonidas Grigg ( age 3 at the time ) , circa 2004 .
At some point in each visit we pay to my parents ’ home I find myself pondering a curious object found in their washroom — a small glass cologne dispenser in the shape of a mallard .
The artifact entered my childhood home as a Nixon - era Christmas present to my father , and has survived no fewer than a dozen migrations across three states .
The aromatic toiletry dispensed from it has a pleasant if generic scent vaguely reminiscent of Hai Karate ( a 1960s - era cheapie cologne that was marketed as an Axe- style olfactory aphrodisiac ) .
To this day the decanter appears to be a little less than half full .
The sight of that insipid little cologne bottle has an effect on me akin to that described by the protagonist from Remembrance of Things Past as he consumes his first morsel of tea- soaked Madeleine cake .
I find myself irresistibly transported back to my childhood in a home presided over by loving , thrifty parents whose formative years were indelibly marked by the experiences of the ( last ) Great Depression .
Like tens of millions of Americans , my mother and father lived by the Depression - era credo , “ Use it up , wear it out ; make it do , or do without . ”
They would never buy something new — an appliance , an article of clothing , an automobile , or a piece of farm equipment — when it was possible to extend the lifespan of a suitable item already in our possession .
My parents , like many others of their generation , preferred saving to spending , and self - reliant home production to the typical consumer lifestyle .
We always had a garden , albeit sometimes a very small one , in order to grow our own produce , which was always much better than what we could buy at a grocery store .
Mother always canned whatever we harvested ; she also baked bread ( often from grain we grew ourselves ) , churned butter ( from a cow I often milked by hand ) , and kept our old clothes in good repair .
Dad would only throw something away if he could n’t devise some suitable use for it , and he constantly surprised me by the depth and variety of his imagination .
During the early 1970s , after Nixon definitively de-coupled the dollar from gold and our economy was plunged into a recession , Mom and Dad began to stock up on survival foods of various kinds .
In keeping with the prime directive of food storage — “ store what you eat , and eat what you store ” — our family soon became acquainted with the odd but hardly unpleasant flavor of storable surrogates for more familiar staples , such as carob powder as a replacement for cocoa , and textured vegetable protein ( TVP ) as a substitute for sausage on pizza .
In 1979 , as Carter - era stagflation plagued the national economy , our family relocated from eastern Oregon to southwestern Idaho .
Shortly before our move , my father — a real estate broker — consummated a sale in which the closing costs were paid , in part , by a large quantity of silver in the form of bars as large as 100 ounces apiece .
After we re-settled in Madison County , Dad put the silver in safe storage and tried to establish himself in the local real estate market .
Unfortunately , we arrived just as a reconstruction “ boom ” went bust .
In June 1976 , Idaho ’s Teton Dam failed , resulting in a flood of nearly Katrina - esque proportions .
The Teton Dam was little more than a very large berm , constructed with government - standard indifference according to typically inferior government - standard practices — in other words , through the exercise of minimal competence at maximum expense .
( Ironically , one eyewitness to the disaster was a farmer named Daryl Wayne Grigg , who is — as far as I can tell — no relation . )
The Best of William Norman Grigg
Similar schemes run in the US , Spain and Canada
The government is compiling a database to track and store the international travel records of millions of Britons .
Computerised records of all 250 million journeys made by individuals in and out of the UK each year will be kept for up to 10 years .
The government says the database is essential in the fight against crime , illegal immigration and terrorism .
But opposition MPs and privacy campaigners fear it is a significant step towards a surveillance society .
The intelligence centre will store names , addresses , telephone numbers , seat reservations , travel itineraries and credit card details of travellers .
Big Brother Shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said : " The government seems to be building databases to track more and more of our lives .
" The justification is always about security or personal protection .
But the truth is that we have a government that just can't be trusted over these highly sensitive issues .
We must not allow ourselves to become a Big Brother society . "
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said : " This is another example of an intrusive database without any public debate about safeguards on its use .
" We are sleepwalking into a surveillance state and should remember that George Orwell 's 1984 was a warning , not a blueprint . "
A spokesman for campaign group NO2ID said : " When your travel plans , who you are travelling with , where you are going to and when are being recorded you have to ask yourself just how free is this country ? "
The e-Borders scheme covers flights , ferries and rail journeys and the Home Office says similar schemes run in other countries including the US , Canada , Spain and Australia .
Minister of State for borders and immigration Phil Woolas said the government was determined to ensure the UK 's border remained one of the toughest in the world .
" Our hi-tech electronic borders system will allow us to count all passengers in and out of the UK and [ it ] targets those who are n't willing to play by our rules , " he said .
" Already e-Borders has screened over 75 million passengers against immigration , customs and police watch - lists , leading to over 2,700 arrests for crimes such as murder , rape and assault . "

Blu-ray Disc media are becoming the norm in the United States , and that pattern is set to extend across western Europe and Japan this year , according to Futuresource consulting ( PDF ) .
The firm also says the Blu-ray Disc players are on track for explosive growth in 2009 , and could sell in excess of 100 million units worldwide by year 's end .
Why Blu-ray Will Grow
Futuresource attributes Blu-ray 's projected expansion due to the popularity of HDTVs , as well as steadily dropping prices of Blu-ray players .
This is why -- despite the economic downturn -- Futuresource is betting that Blu-ray discs will have a good year .
2008 : A Rough Start for Blu-ray
But if 2009 is going to be the year of Blu-ray , then 2008 could rightly be called the year of the Blu-ray naysayers .
Despite Sony Blu-ray 's decisive win over Toshiba 's HD - DVD , many critics were not ready to give Blu-ray the high - def crown .
In September , the consensus was that Blu-ray Disc prices were not going to drop any time soon , then in November Blu-ray 's holiday season did not look good .
Blu -ray chugged along , though , and it turned out that Sony 's format had a breakout Christmas season after all .
Then in January , the first portable Blu-ray player hit the market , and just a few days ago Blu-ray disc prices started to drop .
Now it 's not as though last year 's assumptions about Blu-ray products were unfounded .
As Futuresource points out , consumer interest in Blu-ray was not exactly compelling .
According to their numbers , Blu-ray Disc makers churned out 200 million units in 2008 , but only sold around 36 million of them .
Some of that shortfall can be accounted for by multi-disc sets and promotional giveaways , but that still left a lot of discs sitting on store shelves .
Will Blu-ray Be Defunct Before Its Time ?
However , turning over from 2008 to 2009 seems to be making all the difference , and the momentum should just keep building .
By 2012 , Futuresource predicts that 50 percent of U.S. homes and 35 percent of western European households will go Blu-ray .
That seems like a relatively fast jump , considering that a Blu-ray conversion requires both a new TV and a new DVD player for some .
There 's also the question of where movie downloads will be over the next few years .
Do people still want to own an actual disc they can hold in their hands , or is a set - top box that you can use to download movies a preferred alternative ?
I know what my answer would be , but let 's put the question to you :
Are you part of the early Blu-ray majority , or do you plan on keeping your DVD player as long as possible ?
Are you forgoing discs entirely in favor of digital downloads ?
This story , " Blu-ray Discs Becoming the Norm ? " was originally published by PCWorld .

Frank Schubert , president of Schubert - Flint Public Affairs , and Jeff Flint , a partner in the firm , reveal just how they won the battle to pass Proposition 8 , which outlawed gay marriage in California just months after being ruled a “ fundamental right ” by the California Supreme Court .
If you can stifle your seething rage for just a few moments , there ’s quite a few instructive lessons to be learned from their approach .
Schubert ( who , incidentally , has a lesbian sister ) and Flint portray the campaign as a plucky upstart facing a difficult battle in their article in Politics Magazine :
“ A survey released by the Field Institute in mid-September showed that fully 55 percent of likely voters were opposed to Prop 8 , with just 38 percent in favor .
The political elite all but wrote off Proposition 8 as being dead once the Field Poll was published .
To make matters worse for us , less than a week after the Field Poll came out , the No on 8 campaign began its television advertising in the state ’s major media markets . ”
How did they win ?
Rally and engage the base .
Schubert - Flint made sure that those who would naturally support a ban on gay marriage were informed and empowered .
“ We worked hard during this period to urge our supporters to have faith that Prop 8 could still be enacted despite what they saw on the news .
We organized countless meetings and conference calls of pastors and other campaign leaders .
And we restructured our online presence and delivered a stream of messages to supporters designed to keep them informed and engaged . ”
Raise doubts , broaden the implications .
It was important to make gay marriage not just an issue about gays getting married , but about religious freedom , an ‘ activist ’ Court , and the potential threats to children .
The more the water was muddied , the more opportunities voters had to latch onto a rationale for voting for the ban that was n’t purely homophobic .
“ We strongly believed that a campaign in favor of traditional marriage would not be enough to prevail .
We needed to convince voters that gay marriage was not simply “ live and let live ” — that there would be consequences if gay marriage were to be permanently legalized .
But how to raise consequences when gay marriage was so recently legalized and not yet taken hold ?
We made one of the key strategic decisions in the campaign , to apply the principles of running a “ No ” campaign — raising doubts and pointing to potential problems — in seeking a “ Yes ” vote .
As far as we know , this strategic approach has never before been used by a Yes campaign . ”
Engage and use the grassroots .
While grassroots volunteers are not trained campaigners , they have heart and personal messages that they can take to individual voters and by using the Internet to coordinate these efforts , activists had maximum impact .
For ‘ Yes on 8 ’ , this was a big advantage .
“ Our ability to organize a massive volunteer effort through religious denominations gave us a huge advantage , and we set ambitious goals : to conduct a statewide Voter ID canvass of every voter ; to distribute 1.25 million yard signs and an equal number of bumper strips ; to have our volunteers re-contact every undecided , soft yes and soft no voter ; and to have 100,000 volunteers , ?ve per voting precinct , working on Election Day to make sure every identi?ed Yes on 8 voter would vote .
All of these goals , and more , were achieved .
We built a campaign volunteer structure around both time - honored campaign grassroots tactics of organizing in churches , with a ground - up structure of church captains , precinct captains , zip code supervisors and area directors ; and the latest Internet and web - based grassroots tools .
Our campaign website was rebuilt to serve as an incredibly effective organizing tool .
Online volunteer sign - ups were immediately sent electronically to the appropriate ZIP code supervisor for follow up .
We set up a statewide voter ?le with remote access for regional volunteer leaders , which allowed them to input results for canvassing efforts remotely , and then download and print updated voter lists . ”
Money , money , Mormon money .
Not that there was any doubt , but the Yes on 8 campaign freely admits that an infusion of Mormon cash did a great deal in helping to bolster the campaign .
“ By this time , leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints had endorsed Prop 8 and joined the campaign executive committee .
Even though the LDS were the last major denomination to join the campaign , their members were immensely helpful in early fundraising , providing much - needed contributions while we were busy organizing Catholic and Evangelical fundraising efforts .
Ultimately , we raised $ 22 million from July through September with upwards of 40 percent coming from members of the LDS Church .
Our fundraising operation also relied heavily on small contributions from some 60,000 individual donors via an extensive direct mail operation , and an extraordinarily effective online fundraising campaign .
When we ?led our ? nance report electronically with the secretary of state , it was more than 5,000 pages thick and crashed the ?ling system .
We ultimately raised more than $ 5 million online , and $ 3 million from direct mail . ”
Having an ineffective opponent helps , too .
‘ Yes on 8 ’s ’ own internal polling showed that their ability to define the issues gave them an advantage , but that advantage began to evaporate once
No on 8 released an ad calling their tactics “ shameful . ”
Up until then , the moral high - ground belonged to Yes on 8 , but they had already effectively framed the debate .
“ The response to our ads from the No on 8 campaign was slow and ineffectual .
They enlisted their allies in the education system to claim that we were lying .
They held press conferences with education leaders to dismiss our claims .
They got newspaper editorial boards to condemn the ads as false .
What they never did do , because they could n’t do , was contest the accuracy of what had happened in Massachusetts .
Finally , three weeks after the Yes on 8 campaign had introduced education as a message , the No on 8 campaign responded with what would be their best ad of the campaign .
It featured State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O’Connell claiming that Prop 8 had nothing to do with education and that our use of children in our ads was “ shameful . ”
This in - your - face response , much delayed but very effective , foretold the ?nal period of the campaign — it would be largely about education . ”
A Google surge .
You may remember that even gay websites running Google Ads were running ‘ Yes on 8 ’ ads in the final days of the campaign .
That ’s the power of internet advertising dollars at work .
“ As the campaign headed into the final days , we launched a “ Google surge . ”
We spent more than a half - million dollars to place ads on every single website that had advertising controlled by Google .
Whenever anyone in California went online , they saw one of our ads in the ?nal two days of the election . ”
Schubert - Flint sum up their winning plan like this :
“ Prop 8 did n’t win because of the Mormons .
It won because we created superior advertising that denied the issues on our terms ; because we built a diverse coalition ; and , most importantly , because we activated that coalition at the grassroots level in a way that had never before been done .
The Prop 8 victory proves something that readers of Politics magazine know very well : campaigns matter . ”
Sounds about right .
While some ‘ No on 8 ’ leaders still complain that the only reason they did n’t have enough cash , the fact remains that neither did the ‘ Yes on 8 ’ campaign when it started .
Certainly , big donations from churches helped , but by activating and empowering their base , they were able to raise millions of small donations , Obama - style .
With that money , they focused on making a reasoned moral argument for banning gay marriage through advertising , one - on - one canvassing across the whole state and employing a massive grassroots get - out - the - vote effort .
We ’ve said it once and we ’ll say it again : Political campaigns are not about fairness or the inherent righteousness of your cause , they ’re about winning .
Prop 8 .’s fate is now in the hands of the California Supreme Court , but with more than half a dozen gay marriage or civil unions bills making their way through state legislatures everywhere from Hawaii to Maine , the gay community needs to work smarter , not harder to win their equal rights .
You can look at the opponent ’s playbook and scorn it , or you can take it and make it your own .

BREAKING NEWS : Jews Shut Down Israeli Counsulate in Protest of Attack on Gaza ! by Jewish People of Conscience Thursday , Jan. 15 , 2009 at 9:49 AM
Concerned Jewish residents of Los Angeles have shut down the Israeli consulate for the first time ever in a historic protest against the policies of Israel .
An ad - hoc , multi- generational group including members of the recently founded International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network , will send a message to the Israeli government and its US supporters : " Not In Our Name !
We will not be silent !
Jews demand an end to the Israeli siege on Gaza and an end to Israeli apartheid . "
The demonstration will kick off a wave of demonstrations across the United States uniting Palestinians , Jewish people , and other Americans outraged by the siege .
JEWS SHUT DOWN ISRAELI CONSULATE !
10 JEWS CHAIN TOGETHER TO BLOCK DRIVEWAY AND ENTRANCE !
Who : Jewish people of conscience in Los Angeles , including a nurse , a school counselor , a retired school teacher , a retired union representative , and a community organizer .
What : Civil Disobedience to shut down the Israeli consulate , with people risking arrest by chaining themselves to the building , strong visuals condemning Israeli attack on Gaza
Where : Consulate General of Israel , 6380 Wilshire Blvd # 1700 , Los Angeles , CA 90048
When : 8:30 am , January 14 , 2009
Concerned Jewish residents of Los Angeles have shut down the Israeli consulate for the first time ever in a historic protest against the policies of Israel .
An ad - hoc , multi- generational group including members of the recently founded International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network , will send a message to the Israeli government and its US supporters : " Not In Our Name !
We will not be silent !
Jews demand an end to the Israeli siege on Gaza and an end to Israeli apartheid . "
The demonstration will kick off a wave of demonstrations across the United States uniting Palestinians , Jewish people , and other Americans outraged by the siege .
" We are shocked and outraged at Israeli 's latest act of violent aggression against the Palestinian people .
Killing over 950 people , including 250 women and children , bombing schools and mosques and then calling it self - defense — that is the worst kind of hypocrisy .
It also amounts to war crimes , " said Hannah Howard , a local member of the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network .
" We are shutting down the Israeli consulate today because as Jewish people we cannot allow business as usual while violence is being done in our name .
This is a direct betrayal of our Jewish tradition of social justice . "
Action participants will also speak out against the US government 's unconditional support for Israel 's siege and its ongoing war against the Palestinian people .
" While US - funded F16's rain down bombs on the people of Gaza , our elected officials locally and nationally offer unqualified support . " said Marsha Steinberg , a retired union representative .
" Our government must stop sending billions of dollars in military and economic aid to the Israeli war machine while defending Israel in the international community , " Steinberg said .
In the coming week , concerned Americans from all backgrounds will call on the new Presidential administration to make a 180 degree change in policy .
" While the end of the siege on Gaza is our most immediate priority , this is only the latest chapter in Palestinians ' 60 plus year experience of occupation and ethnic cleansing .
Peace and justice in the region will only come when Palestinians have freedom and control their own destiny , " said Lisa Adler , a community organizer in Los Angeles and another member of the International Jewish Solidarity Network .
" Even before the siege began , Israel 's inhumane months - long blockade of Gaza created a major humanitarian crisis .
We must end the siege .
And we are building a nonviolent international movement of boycott , divestment and sanctions that brings an end to Israel 's policies of occupation and apartheid and advances the Palestinian struggle for justice , " said Adler .

A century and a half ago it was at the centre of the Californian gold rush , with hopeful prospectors pitching their tents along the banks of the American River .
Today , tents are once again springing up in the city of Sacramento .
But this time it is for people with no hope and no prospects .
Those who have lost their jobs and homes and have nowhere else to go are constructing makeshift shelters on the site , which covers several acres .
As many as 50 people a week are turning up and the authorities estimate that the tent city is now home to more than 1,200 people .
In a state more known for its fantastic wealth and the glitz and glamour of Hollywood , the images have shocked many Americans .
Conditions are primitive , with no water supply or proper sanitation .
Many residents have to walk up to three miles to buy bottled water from petrol stations or convenience stores .
Good Morning , it 's Depression Tuesday .... I rarely get a chance to watch the national nightly news reports anymore , and after taking them in yesterday I think it is better to abstain .
This is the sort of stuff that is going to simply frighten the masses , creating a self reinforcing pattern .
I do n't know if this is heading for " Depression " ( with modern day safety nets ) but it sure is depressing .
After you look at videos and pictures alone you have to wonder how $ 170 some billion of aid to AIG ( alone ) would help normal people in America .
We were early on this story ( as we normally are ) as we highlighted ( with help from Mish ) the tent cities sprouting up in Southern California last summer [ Jun 19 : Tent Cities Sprout Up Across Southern California ] - those were in the Los Angeles / Ontario airport area .
Now we have reports of this spreading to Sacramento , Reno , Nashville and indeed - even quite well off Seattle .
Poverty has never left the country , it has just been hidden under the covers - but now people who look like " average Joe " are showing up in these situations ( 2 minutes ) A follow up story in The Daily Mail ( UK ) Apparently it took Oprah highlighting it for people to become aware on a national scale ( 7 minutes ) I 'd also like to point out ( again ) just how bad things are getting in Japan .
Each time someone talks about the coming rebound in China , with an economy so dependent on export I mentally list the US , Japan , and Europe as the 3 major trading partners with China and try to figure out how this illusion has come to be ; it is nothing but grasping for straws / thesis in my book .
( 2 minutes ) [ Feb 26 : NYT - When Consumers Cut Back - An Object Lesson from Japan ] [ Oct 27 , 2008 : Japan's Lost Quarter Century ] [ Oct 28 , 2008 : Pooring of Japan Too ? ] [ Nov 17 , 2008 : Poverty , Pension Fears Drive Japan 's Elderly Citizens to Crime
Once more as awful as this is ... and will be , the first part of addressing things is to stop denying them .
We , as a country , have been in denial .
We say we are not Japan and then follow so many of the same steps they took .
We say it 's not a recession , until so many facts overwhelm us that our leadership can no longer deny it .
The social safety net is going to need to be reinforced for what is happening and will happen in the future .
While there is no right to a 3000 sq foot home - there definitely needs to be the basic right to shelter and food in the " richest country on Earth " .
Unfortunately , from this vantage point , 1 year from now we will be in more dire straights on many measures than we are now - so hopefully recognition at the highest levels begins in earnest .

At a time when people are having trouble holding on to their houses , Barack and Michelle Obama have sensibly decided not to use taxpayers ’ money to renovate theirs .
New presidents are allotted $ 100,000 to overhaul the White House residence and the Oval Office , and the Obamas hired Hollywood decorator Michael S. Smith ( known , per his site , for mixing “ Old World classicism with very contemporary settings ” ) .
But the First Couple is n’t spending that money .
They “ are not using public funds or accepting donations of goods for redecorating their private quarters , ” says Camille Johnston , director of communications for the First Lady .
Nor is the couple , who reported $ 4.2 million in household income in 2007 tax returns , using money from the White House Historical Association , a privately funded foundation that paid for a $ 74,000 set of china shortly before Laura Bush left town .
But does this mean they ’re going to spend more than $ 100,000 or less ?
Though Michelle Obama has talked up Pottery Barn , Smith ’s client list includes cost - is - no - object types like Rupert Murdoch , Steven Spielberg , and former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain — for whom he procured that $ 87,783 rug .
“ There ’s no question that he ’ll get it done in the way that it ’s supposed to be done , ” says Smith client and Democratic donor Katherine Chez .
“ But how , I do n’t know . ”
The White House declined to disclose the budget , saying that all expenses would remain private as a result of the Obamas ’ decision to absorb the cost .

In the latest round of financial - fraud allegations to erupt , two money managers have been accused of misappropriating at least $ 553 million , and using it to fund a lifestyle of lavish homes , horses and even an $ 80,000 collectible teddy bear .
The two men , Paul Greenwood , 61 years old , of North Salem , N.Y. , and Stephen Walsh , 64 , of Sands Point , N.Y. , were arrested by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and face criminal charges of conspiracy , securities fraud and wire fraud by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District ...
Politicians are now demanding Sir Fred hand back much of the entitlement .
Alistair Darling told the BBC : " At my request , Lord Myners spoke to Sir Fred last night and quite simply asked whether in the circumstances that the bank is now in did n't you think it was right that you should forgo this ? "
Sir Fred has yet to respond to the request .

Advertisement Pakistani security forces have recaptured a police academy after eight hours of clashes with gunmen who seized the complex during a morning drill .
Military helicopters opened fire on the compound near Lahore as troops entered to confront grenade - throwing militants .
Pakistan 's Interior Ministry said 18 people had been killed , including eight policemen and eight militants .
Other reports put the death toll higher .
Nearly 100 people have been injured , the ministry adds .
The assault comes less than a month after gunmen attacked the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore , killing six policemen .
Those gunmen escaped .
Chaotic scenes
The siege at the Manawan police training school on the outskirts of Lahore ended at around 1600 local time ( 1100 GMT ) after sustained heavy gunfire lasting 10 - 15 minutes .
Jill McGivering reports from outside the academy near Lahore
This was a well - organised attack that will raise concern about the sophistication of the group behind it .
Pakistan is facing a broad insurgency from groups linked to al - Qaeda , the Afghan Taleban and the Pakistani Taleban , as well as from religious extremists and criminals taking advantage of the situation .
It is unclear who was responsible for this attack , but its co-ordinated nature could point to one of the more international groups .
' I saw the attackers '
How attack started In pictures : Lahore siege Analysis : Why attack Lahore ?
Military helicopters swooped low , firing directly into the training school .
As paramilitary forces tried to force their way into the main building , the gunmen retaliated by throwing grenades .
Roads around the site were clogged with vehicles and people .
Paramilitary troops were seen celebrating on the roof of the compound after the siege had ended .
The BBC's Damian Grammaticas , who has since been into the police academy , said rescue teams with masks were carrying out bodies under white sheets .
He described the scene there as chaotic , with broken glass , bullet casings and pieces of human flesh scattered over the floor .
' Planned attack '
The gunmen attacked from four sides , while trainee police were doing their morning drill on the academy 's parade ground , officials and witnesses said .
They threw grenades before opening fire , and at least some of the gunmen were said to be disguised in police uniforms .
Elite troops were called in to retake the area .

Two civilians had died , along with eight policemen and eight militants , and 95 people had been injured , he said .
The military has put the death toll at 27 .
At least two of the attackers are believed to have blown themselves up .
Mr Malik called the assault a " planned , organised , terrorist attack " .
" This shows the extent to which the enemies of our country can go , " he told the local Geo TV station .
But he added : " It is wrong to say that law and order has collapsed in Pakistan .
" We are very near to [ tracing ] the attackers involved in this . "
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack , but it comes days after US President Barack Obama pledged to put Pakistan , along with Afghanistan , at the heart of his fight against al - Qaeda militants .
He said " al - Qaeda and its extremist allies are a cancer that risks killing Pakistan from within . "
US officials have pledged to help Pakistan target so - called " safe havens " for militants in Pakistan 's north - west tribal region bordering Afghanistan .

Two men , aged 17 and 37 , have been arrested by detectives investigating the murder of Constable Stephen Carroll , police said today .
Constable Carroll , 48 , was gunned down last night as he responded to a call for help from a frightened woman who said her house was being attacked .
He was shot from behind as he got out of his car , investigators have revealed today .
The officer was struck in the head by a single bullet that passed through his back window .
It is understood that Constable Carroll was due to retire from the force next year .
Dissident republican group , the Continuity IRA , said they were behind the the murder .
Both of those arrested are being questioned in Antrim police station .
In a coded message , they said the shooting in Craigavon was carried out by their north Armagh battalion .
The message said : " As long as there is British involvement in Ireland , these attacks will continue . "
The killing followed the murder of soldiers Mark Quinsey , 23 , and Patrick Azimkar , 21 , outside the Massareene Barracks in Antrim on Saturday .
Meanwhile , Northern Ireland ’s First and Deputy First Minister today called off their trade mission to America a second time following the Craigavon killing .
Peter Robinson said : “ Our future is n't dependent on the evil of those who seek to destroy our society , but rather it depends on the good that there 's found in those throughout our community who want to build a stable , peaceful and democratic society , ” he told MLAs .
Deputy First Minister McGuinness , a former IRA commander , described the dissidents as " traitors to the island of Ireland . "
He called for the traditional code of silence to be broken and for tips to be passed to police .
" I want to join with Peter Robinson to wholeheartedly appeal to everyone , and anyone , who has any information whatsoever about these killings , to pass that information to the police , north and south , " said McGuinness .
" We need to pledge our support to Hugh Orde . "
Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said there was no support whatsoever in the republican or nationalist communities for what happened and his party would support the apprehension of those involved .
In a show of solidarity , they were supported by the Ulster Unionist , SDLP , Alliance , PUP and Green Party leaders .

The technology specifically targets cancer cells Nanotechnology has been used for the first time to destroy cancer cells with a highly targeted package of " tumour busting " genes .
The technique , which leaves healthy cells unaffected , could potentially offer hope to people with hard - to - treat cancers where surgery is not possible .
Although it has only been tested in mice so far , the researchers hope for human trials in two years .
The UK study is published online by the journal Cancer Research .
We hope this therapy will be used to treat cancer patients in clinical trials in a couple of years
Dr Andreas Schatzlein
School of Pharmacy , London
The genes were wrapped up in microscopic nano - particles which were taken up by cancer cells , but not their healthy neighbours .
Once inside , the genes stimulated production of a protein which destroys the cancer .
The researchers say the technology could potentially be particularly relevant for people with cancers that are inoperable because they are close to vital organs .
They hope it will eventually also be used to treat cancer that has spread .
' Exciting step ' Lead researcher Dr Andreas Schatzlein , from the School of Pharmacy in London , said : " Gene therapy has a great potential to create safe and effective cancer treatments but getting the genes into cancer cells remains one of the big challenges in this area .
" This is the first time that nanoparticles have been shown to target tumours in such a selective way , and this is an exciting step forward in the field .
" Once inside the cell , the gene enclosed in the particle recognises the cancerous environment and switches on .
The result is toxic , but only to the offending cells , leaving healthy tissue unaffected .
" We hope this therapy will be used to treat cancer patients in clinical trials in a couple of years . "
Traditional chemotherapy indiscriminately kills cells in the affected area of the body , which can cause side effects like fatigue , hair loss or nausea .
It is hoped that gene therapy will have fewer associated side effects by targeting cancer cells .
Dr Lesley Walker , of the charity Cancer Research UK , said : " These results are encouraging , and we look forward to seeing if this method can be used to treat cancer in people .
" Gene therapy is an exciting area of research , but targeting genetic changes to cancer cells has been a major challenge .
" This is the first time a solution has been proposed , so it 's exciting news . "

A man dressed as Batman villain the Joker has been shot dead by police in America after pointing a loaded shotgun at them .
The dead man , who was said to be obsessed with the character , was wearing full costume and makeup when he was challenged by officers in a national park in Virginia , according to legal documents .
The FBI named him as army specialist Christopher Lanum , who was wanted as a suspect over the stabbing of a fellow soldier at Fort Eustis , a major army base in the state , several hours before .
Lanum 's girlfriend , Patsy Ann Marie Montowski , who was with him when he was shot , told investigators that the soldier idolised the Joker , played in the most recent Batman film , The Dark Knight , by the late Heath Ledger .
The events began at the base early on Sunday when Lanum become embroiled in an argument with a fellow soldier , Mitchell Stone , allegedly stabbing him and using a stun gun on him .
Lanum and Montowski fled in her van , which was later spotted around 200 miles away inside Shenandoah national park .
Police pursued the pair , who crashed the van after running over a spiked strip laid in the road .
According to the FBI documents , Lanum told Montowski to kill him with the shotgun but she refused .
He then pointed the gun at police , his finger on the trigger , and refused orders to drop it , before being shot several times .
Montowski was also shot and taken to hospital .
Details of the case emerged yesterday after she was charged in connection with the case following treatment .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Alleged swindler Bernard Madoff will plead guilty later this week to 11 counts , including money laundering , perjury and fraud , that could bring a sentence of 150 years in prison , one of Madoff 's attorneys , Ira Lee Sorkin , told CNN .
Prosecutors stressed that there had been no plea deal and that Madoff , 70 , will have to forfeit any proceeds he accrued from the crimes he is accused of committing .
" The government has not entered into any agreement with Mr. Madoff about his plea or sentencing , " said acting U.S. Attorney Lev L. Dassin .
" The filing of these charges does not end the matter .
Our investigation is continuing . "
Earlier , Sorkin and Daniel Horowitz , another Madoff lawyer , told CNN that Madoff was waiving his right to a grand jury indictment and that the defense team had been talking about a plea with government attorneys .
" We obviously have talked to the government , " said Horowitz .
" And we have been professional with each other . "
' No innocent explanation '
Madoff , a former chairman of the Nasdaq stock market and founder of an innovative Wall Street trading firm that electronically matched buy and sell orders , is accused of running a massive fraud in which he allegedly used new investment money from clients to fund for other customers ' apparent gains .
It was , " basically , a giant Ponzi scheme , " Madoff said , according to the government 's criminal complaint .
" There is no innocent explanation , " Madoff told two FBI agents , according to the complaint , which states Madoff expects to go to jail .
Madoff was charged in December with one count of securities fraud , which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison .
He has remained out on $ 10 million bail , but is confined to his luxurious Upper East Side apartment .
In court documents , prosecutors said Madoff had run his scheme " from at least the 1980s until his arrest on December 11 , 2008 , ... by soliciting billions of dollars of funds under false pretenses , failing to invest investors ' funds as promised , and misappropriating and converting investors ' funds to Madoff 's own benefit . "
The charges also say Madoff 's company , Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities ( BLMIS ) , claimed that as of Nov. 30 , 2008 , it held 4,800 client accounts worth about $ 64.8 billion .
" In fact , BLMIS held only a small fraction of that balance on behalf of its clients , " the documents say .
Madoff is scheduled appear at a plea proceeding on Thursday before U.S. District Judge Denny Chin .
Chin also ruled Tuesday that Madoff can keep Sorkin on as his attorney after Madoff said he was satisfied the attorney was representing his interests despite potential conflicts of interest .
Sorkin told the government he invested $ 18,860 with Madoff in the early 1990s through a retirement account that had been set up with his former law firm that was later transferred to another brokerage firm in 1995 .
Also , Sorkin 's late father held an account with Madoff , the proceeds of which were eventually distributed to trust accounts for Sorkin 's two sons .
Sorkin also has represented a Florida accounting firm , Avellino & Bienes , which invested with Madoff .

Today at a speech at Georgetown University , the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , Sen. Patrick Leahy called for a truth commission to investigate the previous eight years of the George W. Bush administration .
Leahy called his proposal a middle ground between prosecuting or letting the Bush administration off of the hook , “ One path to that goal would be a reconciliation process and truth commission .
We could develop and authorize a person or group of people universally recognized as fair minded , and without axes to grind .
Their straightforward mission would be to find the truth .
People would be invited to come forward and share their knowledge and experiences , not for purposes of constructing criminal indictments , but to assemble the facts . ”
Leahy continued , “ If needed , such a process could involve subpoena powers , and even the authority to obtain immunity from prosecutions in order to get to the whole truth .
Congress has already granted immunity , over my objection , to those who facilitated warrantless wiretaps and those who conducted cruel interrogations .
It would be far better to use that authority to learn the truth . ”

He later suggested that a truth commission would help the nation move on , “ Rather than vengeance , we need a fair - minded pursuit of what actually happened .
Sometimes the best way to move forward is getting to the truth , finding out what happened , so we can make sure it does not happen again .
When I came to the Senate , the Church Committee was working to expose the excesses of an earlier era .
Its work helped ensure that in years to come , we did not repeat the mistakes of the past .
We need to think about whether we have arrived at such a time , again .
We need to come to a shared understanding of the failures of the recent past . ”
From the perspective of good governance , this is a wonderful idea , but partisan politics always seems to come ahead of doing what is right .
Outside of Nixon , no presidential administration was as secretive , and operated in as much darkness as that of George W. Bush .
It is important for the nation to know exactly how far the abuses of the Bush administration went .
However , most Democrats would rather let the past be the past .
They do n’t have the stomach for the partisan fight which would ensue .
Democrats still remember well how Republicans were hurt by their attempt to get Bill Clinton out of office .
They do n’t want to create anything that would serve as a distraction for the new administration .
For this reason more than any other , you can be certain that there will not be a truth commission examining the misdeeds , and Democratic complacency , for much of the Bush years .

AUSTIN , Tex . 
In an evenly split vote , the State Board of Education on Thursday upheld teaching evolution as accepted mainstream science .
But social conservatives on the board , using a series of amendments tailored to particular school subjects , succeeded in requiring teachers to evaluate critically a variety of scientific principles like cell formation and the Big Bang .
The debate over new curriculum requirements , to take effect in 2010 , stands to influence educational standards nationwide .
Once every decade , major textbook publishers revise their offerings to match the requirements newly set forth by Texas , which is one of their largest bulk customers .
More than 80 years after the biology teacher John Scopes was tried on charges of illegally teaching evolution in Tennessee , the controversy here has played out with more subtlety , involving political code words and efforts to undermine the theory itself .
The English - language arm of the controversial channel Al - Jazeera is seeking permission to broadcast in Canada , and if it wins approval the station would also open a Canadian news bureau , the managing director of Al - Jazeera English said today .
Tony Burman said the all - news channel , based in Doha , Qatar , hopes to be up and running here by the fall .
He credited the channel 's recent coverage of the Israeli - Gaza war , which included exclusive material from Gaza , with significantly raising its North American profile and fostering a demand for international news .
" That was an important breakthrough for us and a lot of people I think really took notice , " Burman , former editor - in - chief of the CBC , said of the Gaza coverage .
" We know that from our website , there 's ( been ) an incredible jump ( in traffic ) .
A lot of Americans – and Canadians , for that matter – are now aware of Al - Jazeera English when perhaps two months ago they were n't . "
Al - Jazeera English is distinct from the Arabic channel that drew controversy for its news coverage in the days following 9 - 11 .
Often referred to as the " CNN of the Arab world , " Al - Jazeera Arabic frequently obtained exclusive messages and videotaped statements from militants in Iraq and al - Qaida .
It was also often demonized by the U.S. Bush administration for its critical coverage of the West , but Burman said those controversies would not – and should not – affect the English channel 's bid .
" There 's a debate about Al - Jazeera Arabic .
I think the accusations directed to it are nonsense , but it 's a bit of a side issue , " said Burman , drawing an analogy to three British media outlets owned by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp .
" If you look at the Times of London , you do n't focus on Sky News or the Sun newspaper to assess whether or not you like the Times of London . "
Burman said he expected the broadcast application to be submitted this week to the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission .
The review process includes a 30 - day period in which the CRTC must ask Canadians what they think of the proposal .
This is the first time the channel , which launched in November 2006 as the first English - language news channel based in the Middle East , has sought permission to broadcast in Canada .
Ethnic Channels Group , a multi-ethnic broadcaster with 12 channels in Canada , will present the application to the CRTC as sponsor of Al - Jazeera English .
In 2003 , Al - Jazeera Arabic won a Canadian broadcast licence but the conditions imposed were so restrictive that cable companies chose not to carry it , Burman said .
While the Arabic version is focused much more on the Middle East , the English channel includes coverage of Africa , Asia and Latin America .
Burman said Al - Jazeera English has one of the most diverse news services in the world , noting that it and Al - Jazeera Arabic have a total of 69 news bureaus , more than either the BBC or CNN .

" This comes at a time when , for financial reasons , so many news organizations are shutting foreign bureaus and are really cutting back on international resources .
I think in that sense , Al - Jazeera English is trying to fill the vacuum , " he said .
Al - Jazeera English already broadcasts in more than 100 countries , including some cities in the United States .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Michael Gates
Gill was a high - flying , six - figure - earning advertising executive years ago before he was abruptly fired .
He had created huge campaigns for companies like Christian Dior and Ford and lived an even bigger life , with luxury automobiles , lavish vacations and fabulous clothes .
Michael Gates
Gill 's book about how working at Starbucks changed his life became a bestseller .
These days , however , he 's traded his $ 3,000 Brooks Brothers suits for khakis and a green apron ; the big bucks for a $ 10 an hour job as a barista at Starbucks .
But Gill says he could n't be happier .
" Losing my job turned out to be a gift in disguise . "
After 26 years at J. Walter Thompson , a leading advertising agency , the then 63 - year - old Gill was invited to an early breakfast and was told that he was getting the boot .
He made too much money .
Someone younger would work for less , he was told .
" Never go out to breakfast , " he warns before bursting into laughter .
" It 's like the Mafia .
You will never return . "
Watch the happy barista »
He can joke about it now , but Gill says he was devastated by his firing .
" I remember walking outside and bursting into tears , " he says over a steaming cup of coffee at his current place of employment , a Starbucks in Bronxville , New York .
" I was stunned .
I knew that that part of my life was over . "
That was just the start of a terrible reversal of fortune .
In a few short years , Gill , the Yale - educated son of the famed New Yorker writer Brendan Gill , closed the consulting business he started after he was laid off , got divorced and was diagnosed with a brain tumor .
He had hit both the rock and the bottom and was continuing to fall .
A trip to Starbucks would irrevocably change his life , he says .
Unbeknownst to him , the coffee shop was holding a hiring fair the morning he walked in for his daily dose of caffeine .
A manager approached him and asked if he would like to apply for a job .
Without thinking , he said yes .
That was five years ago .
These days , when the divorced father of five is not whipping up a caramel macchiato or perfecting his latte foam , he 's sweeping floors and scrubbing toilets .
" I still have trouble with some of the drinks , " he admits , " but I 'm a good cleaner ....
I can make a toilet shine like a Ferrari . "
If life continues on an upswing for Gill , he may one day be able to purchase a Ferrari .
His memoir , " How Starbucks Saved My Life , " became a New York Times bestseller .
The actor Tom Hanks has plans to produce and star in the film version .
Gus Van Sant has agreed to direct .
" When I lost my job I thought my life was over , " he says .
" I did n't realize it was just the beginning . "
He smiles contentedly and declares , " I may have a part - time job , but I have a full - time life . "
He is also sharing everything he has learned , hitting the lecture tour with his " uplifting tale of personal transformation . "
Home for Gill is now a modest apartment in the attic of an old house about five minutes away from the 25 - room mansion where he was raised .

Politicians have failed to take on board the severe consequences of failing to cut world carbon emissions , according to Nicholas Stern , the economist commissioned by Gordon Brown to analyse the impact of climate change .
His stark warning about the potentially " devastating " consequences of global warming came as scientists issued a desperate plea last night for world leaders to curb greenhouse gas emissions or face an ecological and social disaster .
More than 2,500 climate experts from 80 countries at an emergency summit in Copenhagen said there is now " no excuse " for failing to act on global warming .
A failure to agree strong carbon reduction targets at political negotiations this year could bring " abrupt or irreversible " shifts in climate that " will be very difficult for contemporary societies to cope with " .
In a significant break from the scientific tradition not to comment directly on policy , the experts insisted politicians must stand up to " vested interests that increase emissions " and " build on a growing public desire for governments to act " .
They called for a " shift from ineffective governance and weak institutions to innovative leadership in government , the private sector and civil society " .
Katherine Richardson , a climate scientist at the University of Copenhagen , who organised the three - day summit , said : " We have to act and we have to act now .
We need politicians to realise what a risk it is they are taking on behalf of their own constituents , the world 's societies and , even more importantly , future generations .
All of the signals from the Earth system and the climate system show us we are on a path that will have enormous and unacceptable consequences . "
Speaking after giving a keynote speech , Stern said he feared that politicians had not grasped the seriousness of the crisis .
" Do the politicians understand just how difficult it could be ?
Just how devastating four , five , six degrees centigrade would be ?
I think not yet .
Looking back , the Stern review underestimated the risks and underestimated the damage from inaction . "
This week 's conference was arranged to offer an update on scientific thinking on global warming , and underpin political attempts to agree a new global climate treaty to replace the Kyoto protocol .
Campaigners have called for such a deal to be signed at UN talks in December , also in Copenhagen , though officials have warned the discussions could drag on into next year .
Scientists at the Copenhagen meeting will publish its full findings in June , but last night they issued their conclusions as a strongly worded statement "
" The climate system is already moving beyond the patterns of natural variability within which our society and economy have developed and thrived .
These parameters include global mean surface temperature , sea - level rise , ocean and ice sheet dynamics , ocean acidification , and extreme climatic events .
There is a significant risk that many of the trends will accelerate , leading to an increasing risk of abrupt or irreversible climatic shifts . "
The summary adds : " There is no excuse for inaction .
We already have many tools and approaches - economic , technological , behavioural , management - to deal effectively with the climate change challenge .
But they must be vigorously and widely implemented . "
In the conference centre that will also host the December UN negotiations , experts at this week 's meeting presented a string of new studies that suggested global warming could strike harder and sooner than expected .
They said carbon emissions have risen more in recent years than anyone thought possible , and the world 's natural carbon stores could be losing the ability to soak up human pollution .
The conference also heard that :
· A 4C rise could turn swaths of southern Europe to desert .
· Sea levels will rise twice as fast as official estimates predict .
· Modest warming could unleash a carbon " time bomb " from Arctic soils .
· A failure to cut emissions could render half of the world uninhabitable .
· Rising temperatures could kill off 85 % of the Amazon rainforest .
Several experts at the conference warned that temperatures are likely to soar beyond the 2C target set by European politicians , though they are reluctant to say so publicly .
" The 2C target is gone and 3C is difficult .
I think we 're heading for 4C at least , " one said .
Oxford University yesterday announced that it would hold a conference in September to discuss the implications of a rise of 4C or more .
Kevin Anderson , research director at the UK Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research , said : " The scientists have lost patience with our carefully constructed messages being lost in the political noise .
And we are now prepared to stand up and say enough is enough . "
Peter Cox , a climate expert at Exeter University , said : " People have been saying this individually for a long time .
This is just a much louder and concerted shout from our community . "
Rob Bailey , senior climate adviser for Oxfam said : " The verdict of the world 's top scientists is clear .
The big question now is whether the worlds richest countries , who created the climate crisis , will act before it 's too late .
Our climate is changing fast and if left unchecked its impacts , particularly on the world 's poorest people , will be devastating . "
The Mystic Aquarium ( shout out to the first aquarium I ever visited ! ) is sharing it 's penguin chicks , born February 3 , via the web .
Visitors who can't make it to see the chicks in the " feather " , can see their progress until they are fully fledged ( which means all grown up ! ) online .
MYSTIC , Conn . ( February 3 , 2009 ) – Oh baby – new African penguin chicks just hatched at Mystic Aquarium & Institute for Exploration !
Starting today , people around the world can watch them grow into full fledglings on a live Web cam at www.mysticaquarium.org.
“ The chicks are nesting in an area of the Roger Tory Peterson Penguin Exhibit that is off public view , ” said Dr. Tracy Romano , senior vice president of research and zoological operations at Mystic Aquarium & Institute for Exploration , divisions of Sea Research Foundation , Inc .
“ This Web cam provides us the opportunity to share their fascinating developmental process with the public . ”
During the first 40 days , the little ones are unable to maintain their body heat , so they seek warmth under their parents .
Viewers will see their heads and beaks emerge when they are hungry and when their parents feed them .
Later in this period , the inquisitive chicks will slowly venture on their own into other areas of their room .
Once they are weaned ( around day # 50 ) , people can observe the aquarium ’s trainers teaching the chicks to feed from them .
At 75 to 100 days of age , the chicks will be fully fledged .
Their soft down will be replaced with juvenile plumage , and they will be ready to fend for themselves .
The fledglings will either join the 26 adult African penguins on exhibit at the aquarium or go to other facilities that house the species .
The cam , which can be accessed from the Mystic Aquarium & Institute for Exploration Web site homepage ( www.mysticaquarium.org), will be on daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. , with occasional breaks when the chicks are removed from the room .
Judge Emmet G. Sullivan , who presided over the Stevens trial in Federal District Court here , has called a hearing Friday to consider a request by Mr. Stevens ’s lawyers for a new trial based on Mr. Joy ’s complaint , which was filed with the Justice Department as part of a procedure to obtain whistleblower status , which would protect him against job - related retaliation .
Image An F.B.I. agent has questioned a colleagues relationship with Bill Allen , who testified at the trial of Ted Stevens , above .
Credit ... Brendan Smialowski for The New York Times
Mr. Stevens , an Alaska Republican who lost his campaign for re-election in November , is awaiting sentencing after his conviction on charges involving failure to list on his Senate disclosure form goods and services he obtained from several supporters , but mostly from Mr. Allen , an influential oil - services tycoon in Alaska and a onetime close friend .
Mr. Stevens ’s trial was punctuated by errors by prosecutors , which brought serial scoldings from Judge Sullivan .
At the time , the chief prosecutor , Brenda Morris , repeatedly apologized for the errors , insisting to Judge Sullivan that they were mistakes of inadvertence and negligence but were not purposeful .
Mr. Joy ’s statement , however , directly contradicts Ms. Morris ’s assertions .
“ I have witnessed or learned of serious violations of policy , rules , and procedures as well as possible criminal violations , ” Mr. Joy wrote in the affidavit sent to the Justice Department that is now part of the court file .
For example , a witness for both the government and defense , Rocky Williams , was sent home to Alaska by prosecutors who did not tell defense lawyers , an act that angered Judge Sullivan .
Ms. Morris said the decision was made because Mr. Williams was gravely ill , not because prosecutors , after interviewing him , had decided he might help the defense case .
New U.S. government stats reveal that teen births are up for the second year in a row .
But when Bill Maher , on his show Real Time last Friday , asked his guest panel why that might be the case , or what could be done about it , the trio became suddenly mute .
Only one panel member , Carrie Washington , murmured something about Bristol Palin , Sarah Palin 's not - so - abstinent daughter who is now a teen mother , not finding much success with abstinence - only education .

All they had to do was ask a Canadian .
Despite Canadian and American women aged 15 to 44 declaring that they want the same number of kids ( about 2.2 ) , American women end up having 2.09 and Canadian women have about 1.6 , and 30 per cent of that difference is due to teen births in the U.S. , almost 90 per cent of which are unwanted .
What 's going on ?
Are Canadian teens just more inhibited -- did the girls - gone - wild craze not get this far north ?
Or is it just too much effort to get the parkas off up here ?
It turns out , when it comes to both banking and babies , Canada 's more comprehensive policies might actually be beacons of sustainable light , not dull , lead weights .
Abstinence failing ?
More Abstinence !
First , here 's the situation .
In the U.S. , the overall birth rate for those aged 15 to 19 rose for the second year in a row , from 41.9 births per 1,000 last year to 42.5 this year .
That 's not a huge jump , but it 's still significant because until two years ago , it had declined every year for 14 years .
Predictably , many on the far right like Valerie Huber of the National Abstinence Education Association , are calling for even more abstinence - only education that would " provide skills for teens to avoid sex , " even though scientific study , and Bristol Palin , have both proved that does n't work .
( And I 'm not sure what they teach in abstinence classes that could be characterized as " skills . " )
As Bristol Palin told Greta Von Sustren just a few weeks ago , " I think abstinence is like ... everyone should be abstinent , but it 's not realistic at all ... [ Sex ] is just more and more accepted now among kids my age . "
After a decade and $ 1.5 billion U.S. federal dollars spent on abstinence - only programs , a Congress - authorized , rigorous scientific study reported no real difference in the age at which program participants first had sex , whether they had sex before marriage , or in their number of sexual partners .
I might actually have to use the " duh " word here .
Abstinence - only education is about as effective at decreasing teen pregnancy rates as creationism education is in raising scientific knowledge levels .
Abstinence is a legitimate religious doctrine , and sometimes an individual personal choice , but it 's not sex ed .
C. Everett Koop : more than just a great beard
Some U.S. experts are being quoted this week saying that the funding should be shifted to programs that include educating young people about contraceptives -- efforts that have been shown to be highly effective .
Like those Canada has had for decades , and like some programs that were in place in the U.S. during C. Everett Koop 's tenure as surgeon general ( 1982 -1989 ) , which lead to the 14 - year decline in teen pregnancy .
After the first reported cases of the virus in the early 1980s , Koop promoted HIV education , which led to a big increase in condom use .
Then during the Clinton years , abstinence - only programs started , promoting the virtues of chastity .
And voila , teen births .
This week , Salon interviewed a Texan - chastity - pledge - devotee - turned - sex - ed - youth - advocate Shelby Knox , who said , " If you spend $ 1.5 billion to spew shame - filled garbage to young people and then pass laws that limit their access to good information , contraception , emergency contraception and abortion , then you should n't be surprised when the health outcomes are n't to your liking . "
Knox indirectly outlines Canada 's approach .
According to StatsCan 's comparative study of fertility trends in Canada and the U.S. , no other industrialized country has juvenile birth rates as high as those observed in the United States .
The birth rate of American teenage girls is more than double that in other industrialized countries , including Canada , and 10 times greater than in Japan and the Netherlands .
The difference is not solely due to the ethnic composition of the U.S. population : the white population also has higher birth rates than other countries .
And it 's not due to a higher abortion rate in Canada .
In fact , unwanted pregnancies and births are more frequent in the U.S. , as is the use of abortion .
Good information = informed choices
No , the main reason is that Canadian teens of all social classes get comprehensive information about contraception and about how to avoid unwanted pregnancies .
They get more sex ed in school , and can access high - school - based family planning counselling though the nurse .
They can also always access universally free medical services , including visiting family doctor and special health clinics .
And at all levels , there 's a more positive attitude towards the pill , and either cheap or free prescriptions for it .
As a result , young Canadian women use more effective pharmaceutical methods ( i.e. birth control pills ) rather than less effective ones ( condoms , or the so - called withdrawal method ) .
The Washington Post reported the story of one teenager , Yasmin Herrera , 19 , who learned a month ago that she is pregnant with her second child , an unwanted pregnancy .
She had a new prescription for birth - control patches but not enough money to fill it .
That kind of case is avoidable here .
It 's important to point out there are other factors involved : the U.S. 's earlier average marriage age and higher levels of religious practice ( which can bring more traditional , pro-abstinence - only ideas ) also contribute to the higher rate .
But there are no policy implications for either of those .
So the role institutions can play is one of providing information about the pill and condoms , rather than telling kids they should n't have sex .
And really , who can blame kids who do ?
Adult culture glorifies and even flaunts sex , then educators tell kids they should n't try it because of the consequences : both social and moral .
I do n't know about you , but when I hear that kind of double standard , age - ist nonsense , I almost feel a teenage - style huff and coming on .
And it 's not just me .
When adults treat teens as intelligent beings capable of making informed decisions when armed with good information , then they do .
That 's backed not just by belief , but by actual numbers and science .

Tyee stories :
Evidence of how a British resident held in the Guantánamo Bay detention camp was tortured , and what MI5 knew about it , must remain secret because of serious threats the US has made against the UK , the high court ruled today .
The judges made clear they were deeply unhappy with their decision , but said they had no alternative as a result of a statement by David Miliband , the foreign secretary , that if the evidence was disclosed the US would stop sharing intelligence with Britain .
That would directly threaten the UK 's national security , Miliband had told the court .
This afternoon David Davis , the Conservative MP and former shadow home secretary , said ministers must urgently respond to the allegations that Britain was complicit in torture .
He demanded a Commons statement from the government on the ruling , calling it " a matter of utmost national importance " .
Davis said : " The ruling implies that torture has taken place in the [ Binyam ] Mohamed case , that British agencies may have been complicit , and further , that the United States government has threatened our high court that if it releases this information the US government will withdraw its intelligence cooperation with the United Kingdom .
" The judge rules that there is a strong public interest that this information is put in the public domain even though it is politically embarrassing . "
He told the BBC : " The government is going to have to do some pretty careful explaining about what 's going on . "
The ruling , by Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones , was the latest from a long - running and unprecedented series of court hearings into the abduction of Binyam Mohamed , who was seized and held incommunicado in Pakistan in 2002 before being secretly rendered to Morocco , where he says he was tortured .
He was subsequently flown to Afghanistan before being rendered to Guantánamo Bay .
Today 's ruling comes after the judges last year invited the Guardian and other media groups to question earlier claims by Miliband that the disclosure of evidence , originally contained in documents given to him by the US government , would threaten the UK 's national security .
The judges said today that they found it " difficult to conceive " the rationale for the US 's objections to releasing the information , which contained " no disclosure of sensitive intelligence matters " about how US officials treated detainees .
" Indeed , we did not consider that a democracy governed by the rule of law would expect a court in another democracy to suppress a summary of the evidence contained in reports by its own officials ... relevant to allegations of torture and cruel , inhumane or degrading treatment , politically embarrassing though it might be , " they said .
The judges said they had been taken aback by the severity of the threat made by the US government .
In another part of the ruling , the judges said lawyers for Miliband had told them the threat to withdraw cooperation remained in place under the new administration of President Barack Obama .
Clive Stafford Smith , Mohamed 's lawyer and director of Reprieve , said the UK and US governments had a duty to investigate torture claims , and not to suppress evidence that it had happened .
By not disclosing the evidence , the UK was guilty of " capitulation to blackmail " , he said .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of human rights group Liberty , called for ministers to launch an inquiry into Britain 's alleged role in rendition and torture .
She said it was " alarming and surprising " that the new US administration maintained the threat against the Foreign Office .
Mohamed was originally charged with involvement in a " dirty bomb " plot , but that charge was withdrawn and the US authorities said new ones could be brought .
But no fresh indictment was filed , and on January 22 President Obama issued an executive order that no new charges should be sworn , pending a review of the position of all those detained at Guantánamo Bay .

Pot -related questions deluge W.H .
When the White House put out a call for town hall questions , it might not have been expecting this .
The more than 92,000 people who responded either have a Cheech and Chong sense of humor or there is a deep concern in America — undetected by the media — about the decriminalization of marijuana , its possible use for medicinal purposes and its potential as a new source of tax revenue .

Given the opportunity to say what ’s really on their minds without going through the filter of the mainstream media , people “ buzzed up ” a series of questions that seemed to suggest broad interest in legalizing marijuana and taxing it .
In this moment of national economic crisis , the top four questions under the heading of “ Financial security ” concerned marijuana ; on the budget , people voted up questions about marijuana to positions 1 - 4 ; marijuana was in the first and third positions under “ jobs ” ; people boosted a plug for legalizing marijuana to No. 2 under “ health care reform . ”
And questions about decriminalizing pot occupied spots 1 and 2 under “ green jobs and energy . ”
After taking questions lower on the list , Obama addressed the pot issue head - on , noting the huge number of questions about marijuana legalization and remarking with a chuckle , “ I do n't know what that says about the online audience . "
" The answer is no , I do n't think that is a good strategy to grow our economy , " he said , as the audience in the room applauded and joined him in a laugh .
It seems part of the popularity of marijuana questions was fueled by NORML , the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , which was urging its members to vote for questions supporting the legalization of cannabis .
“ WhiteHouse.gov is once again asking the public to pose questions directly to President Obama via its ‘ Open For Questions ‘ service , ” the organization said on its website .
“ The topic of this week ’s forum is the national economy and , not surprisingly , many of you have already put forward questions to the president regarding the taxation and regulation of cannabis . ”
“ Please take a moment right now to log on the WhiteHouse .
gov / OpenForQuestions and vote for the questions above , as well as others pertaining to the need to regulate cannabis .
Let the president know that millions of American voters believe that the time has come to tax and regulate marijuana .
Help us send the White House a message our elected leaders can’t ignore , ” the statement said .
This is your war on drugs .
Since the Michael Phelps " thing " - the picture of him holding a glass waterpipe to his lips - the cannabis community has been in overdrive , boycotting Kelloggs for being so backwards as to not renew his contract , lambasting the Sheriff 's office in the tine South Carolina town where the sheriff was mulling extraction of Phelps from another state JUST for this picture .
The internets have been filled with commentary - from the " right " as well as the Left - regarding the utter stupidity of enforcing marijuana laws and noting that the sheriff must have nothing better to do with his time and resources .
Because , after all , IT'S JUST POT !
The United Nations International Narcotics Control Board , in reaction to this outpouring of truthful information and enthusiastic , serious discourse , has elected to spew reefer madness onto the internets and into the mainstream media .
In this essay I am going to post passages from a Raw Story write - up and comment on each one of them .
This is the normal effort we have had to do to deal with the MSM 's unquestioning lapdoggie relationship with cannabis prohibitionists - which are almost invariably Republican , and are made up of essentially Republican " talking points " .
Here we go !
Number 1 :
VIENNA ( AFP ) – A UN drugs agency warned Thursday against underestimating the dangers of cannabis .
" The international community may wish to review the issue of cannabis , " the International Narcotics Control Board ( INCB ) wrote in its annual report .
" Over the years , cannabis has become more potent and is associated with an increasing number of emergency room admissions , " the report stated .
Ok .
" Emergency room admission is pure reefer madness propaganda .
Click the link and scroll down to Number 6 .
Essentially , since the mid 1990 's the Reefer Mad ( the ONDCP and others ) have been really focusing on getting data from ER 's detailing " mentions " : of marijuana .
It works like this :
You get hurt doing something and you go to the ER .
When they take a health history from you they ask if you ever smoke pot .
You say yes .
VIOLA !
Your trip to the ER has generated a " mention " .
That is the sort of data that makes up this specious , deceitful , mean - spirited , and misleading claim .
It 's utter bunk that can ONLY be uttered by people with no sense of " shame " .
Number 2 :
Cannabis was often the first illicit drug taken by young people and was frequently called a " gateway drug , " in that it could lead to later use of hard drugs .
Unmitigated Assholiness .
This nonsense has been debunked so many times , but since propagandists get unfettered , unchallenged , FREE access to the media - a central issue in getting the law changed , really - all they have to do is post one sentence like that and restart a debate that nobody should respond to .
Only prohibitionists and people who just do n't know any better still make this ridiculous claim .
We reforms then have to scurry and post factual refutations to this that are essentially lost on those who still believe this false tripe .
Long and short :
If you buy this " gateway bit " you are n't smart .
You CANNOT trust the " government " on this .
You are DUMB to trust them if you do .
Period .
Lastly they take a swipe at medical marijuana .
Number 3 :
Indeed , many countries allowed the " recreational " use of cannabis , and public perceptions of the so - called " medical " uses of the drug and its recreational use " are overlapping and confusing , " it said .
Translation : anybody who is smoking pot and not going to jail is setting a bad example for the children .
This is what " confusing " means .
To answer the question in the back of your mind , " Yes .... you really are supposed to believe this . "
The INCB is really little more than the US DEA with a posh Swiss office and outrageous fake accent - and massive budget .
It produces little more than regurgitation of the standard , predictable DEA / GOP party line .
they spew it to the lapdog media that , in turn , merely rolls over and does it 's trick for them .
Medical marijuana laws and Michael Phelps damage the propaganda stream and the INCB has released this bullshit press material in an attempt to squash the current enthusiastic public discourse .
The recent online uproar is a very good thing and it should continue .
Dumbass agencies like the INCB and the DEA need to write to us MORE so people can really see how their tax dollars are wasted reproducing unbelievable drivel in the name of " protecting the community " .
The raw fact is marijuana is not a threat to our community , if tobacco and alcohol are legal and tolerated to the point of glorification .
People are free to believe anything they want to and free to express themselves ; but if what you say you believe is known to be amazingly stupid , you might want to check your facts sometime .
The DEA and the INCB should be defunded and dissolved .
They accomplish absolutely nothing .
This is your war on drugs .

Tesla boss Elon Musk has attempted to quell speculation about the future of his fledgling electric sports car company , by speaking frankly to reporters about its situation .
The PR offensive follows an announcement earlier this week revealing that the price of Tesla 's Roadster and Model S would have to go up to help keep the company viable .
" An audit ... found that the true cost [ of the Roadster ] was closer to $ 140 k , " said Musk .
" Which was obviously an extremely alarming discovery and ultimately led to a near complete change in the make - up of the senior management team . ”
Tesla is currently fulfilling orders for customers who have paid $ 90,000 or $ 98,000 for the car .
As a result , equipment that was intended to be included in the price of the Roadster - including the bespoke overnight 70A charger - has become optional to help bridge the price gap .
Each charger will cost $ 3000 .
“ This has been incredibly hard for me personally , ” Musk told reporters .
“ It ’s like eating glass . ”
The PayPal founder - whose fortune is estimated at $ 350 million - made clear that he could n't " shoulder the weight of the company alone " , and admitted that the last round of finance for the firm had been difficult to obtain .
Musk insisted that Tesla had a strong future , however , and that the new Model S electric saloon would be on the market by 2011 .
The firm also plans to double its production rate for the Roadster in the spring - from 15 to 30 cars per week - helping to create economies of scale .
Defiant Musk was keen to make much of Tesla 's deal with Daimler , where it will supply electric drivetrains for the Smart .
The new EV Smart will sell for around $ 20,000 in the States , it was revealed .
" It 's an endorsement of Tesla 's engineering , " he said .
The Tesla boss was frank in his assessment of the situation .
" I think people are taking a little bit of a risk on Tesla , " he concluded .
" But it 's worth it .
It 's the hottest car in the world . "

It is too easy to make fun of the people who packed Room 400 in San Francisco 's City Hall to stop American Apparel from opening a store on Valencia Street in the Mission District last week .
They are not serious people .
They live in a world where facts like 27 vacant storefronts on Valencia Street and 9.3 percent unemployment statewide and nearly 600,000 jobs lost nationally last month do not matter .
The few who read books know no authors beyond Naomi Klein .
They do not believe that the world has changed since the 1999 World Trade Organization protests in Seattle .
This accounts for both the static nature of their vocabulary - " no formula retail ! " is their death chant , though anyone who has picked up a newspaper in the last five months could tell you that there is n't a single retail establishment with a formula today - and the juvenile nature of their worldview .
They do not want to see businesses be successful .
They do not want the Mission District to be welcoming to different types of people .
What they want is magic .
The word " magic " kept recurring during the hours of public comment at the Planning Commission meeting where the American Apparel store 's permit was up for a vote .
" Valencia Street is a magical place , " one speaker said .
Another claimed that " Our neighborhood is a dream , a delicate flower . "
Others spoke of American Apparel as a " parasite " on their " ecosystem . "
Several local business owners testified that it was their " dream " to operate in such a " magical " place , and noted , with horror , that they might have to make alterations to their business plans if a new store opened in the area .
As it happens , American Apparel is somewhat of a magical company .
The company makes its clothing in downtown Los Angeles , employing mostly Latino and Asian immigrants .
It offers its workers health care .
It pays more than twice the federal minimum wage .
These used to be called progressive values , and I noticed that some of the people who did not want American Apparel bringing these values to the Mission understood that they should make an attempt to hide this fact .
" This is not about American Apparel , " Stephen Elliott told me .
Stephen Elliott is the founder of the " Stop American Apparel "
Web site and the starting point of this " movement . "
Yet he insisted to me that " if you allow American Apparel to come in , you 're going to have a much harder time saying no to the Gap . "
I suppose it is easier to fight against the Gap , but the Gap was not up for a vote at the Planning Commission last week .
I thought about pointing this out to city Supervisor David Campos , who attended a " movement " fundraiser and yet claims that he did not " take a stand " on the issue .
" I was showing that I shared their concerns , which have been expressed , about formula retail , " Campos told me .
Campos also happens to be an immigrant , from Guatemala , but this irony is lost on him as well .
Though some claim that this was always about " formula retail , " as I sat watching the Planning Commission meeting I noticed something else .
Most of these people were happy to sacrifice other people 's lives , other people 's dreams , for their idea of magic .
When a young man stood before the board and said that he only had health care because of his job at American Apparel , a voice in the overflow room called , " Get a job somewhere else ! "
Another employee told a story about a young Latino man who was able to send money to his family in Central America , and this news was met with sneers .
An American Apparel representative told the board that he had gotten messages from people threatening to throw a brick through the store window , and the crowd laughed .
The commission voted against issuing the permit , and American Apparel is lucky .
What a burden it would be to have a store in a magical place with such nasty elves .
I 've seen Blue Man Group in Chicago a few times and the show was amazingly good .
It started there and after watching a bunch of clips on the internet I 'd bet it 's the best place to see it .
If you are ever in the city - I 'd highly recommend it over seeing them in Vegas .
This clip shows a bit of what they do - and they are amazing as usual .
[ reactive ]
To fmap fmap or not ?
Thanks for the feedback .
Let 's see if I get this by writing a little newbie tutorial for myself using literal Haskell syntax .
I will import Control .
Arrow since fmap on a pairs transforms the second coordinate value , and when transforming pairs , I sometimes need to transform the first coordinate value ... > import Control .
Arrow
To understand the ( fmap.fmap.fmap ) thing , I will create a simple tutorial , mainly for myself to get a better understanding .
Suppose we have a pair : > p :: ( Bool , [ Char ] ) E.g. > p = ( True , " Reactive " )
The " type graph " ( pardon my lack of knowledge of correct terminology ) of p is ( , ) / \ Bool [ ] | Char Since fmap is about transforming a structure into another structure , let 's suppose that - given any " instance " with a type signature like p - we want to create a new instance p ' at runtime that transforms the string ( at the second coordinate ) into its length .
That 's easy ; we can use fmap ( or Arrow.second ) to do that : < instance Functor ( ( , ) a ) where < fmap f ( x , y ) = fmap ( x , f y ) > tp :: ( Bool , [ Char ] ) -> ( Bool , Int ) > tp = fmap length > > p ' = tp p fmap on pairs basically transforms the rightmost branch of our graph .
( , ) ( , ) / \ / \ Bool [ ] -->
Bool Int |
Char fmap always transforms the rightmost branch in the graph , since the kind of Functor is * -> *.
For example lets define an fmap on triples : > instance Functor ( ( , , ) a b ) where > fmap f ( x , y, z ) = ( x , y , f z ) < fmap :: ( c->d ) -> ( a , b , c ) -> ( a , b , d ) ( , , ) ( , , ) / | \ --> / | \ a b c a b d To continue the ( fmap.fmap.fmap ) story , suppose we now nest p in a Maybe : > m :: Maybe ( Bool , [ Char ] ) > m = Just ( True , " Reactive " ) Maybe | ( , ) / \ Bool [ ] | Char Again we want to transform the string into its length .
To do that we can use the fmap Maybe instance : < fmap f Nothing = Nothing < fmap f ( Just x ) = Just ( f x )
The function we need to fmap on m is just tp ! > tm :: Maybe ( Bool , [ Char ] ) ->
Maybe ( Bool , Int ) > tm = fmap tp > > m' = tm m
So again this fmap transforms the rightmost branch underneath the Maybe ( which is the one and only branch underneath the unary Maybe type )
If we expand tm we get < tm = fmap ( fmap length ) = ( fmap . fmap ) length
So here we have the first magical ( fmap . fmap ) : - the first fmap transforms the branch underneath the Maybe with ( fmap ( fmap length ) ) , - the second fmap transforms the right branch underneath the pair ( , ) with ( fmap length ) .
We can also do this for functions .
Suppose we now have > f :: Char ->
Maybe ( Bool , [ Char ] ) > f c = Just ( c=='a ' , " Reactive " )
The type graph of f is ( -> ) / \ Char Maybe | ( , ) / \ Bool [ ] | Char But function application also has an fmap instance !
It is just the same as function composition : < instance Functor ( ( <-) a ) where < fmap f g = f . g < fmap :: ( b-> c ) -> ( a-> b ) -> ( a-> c ) (->) (->) / \ -> / \ a b a c Again the rightmost branch is transformed ...
So to transform the string into its length but now in the f graph , we do > tf :: ( Char -> Maybe ( Bool , [ Char ] ) ) -> ( Char -> Maybe ( Bool , Int ) ) > tf = fmap tm > > f ' = tf f Expanding this gives > tf ' = ( fmap . fmap . fmap ) length > f '' = tf ' f
So the expression ( ( fmap.fmap.fmap ) g ) performs deep transformation on the 3 rightmost branches of any type graph ( that has fmap instances )
To transform a leftmost branch , we can use Arrow . first , for example : > tf '' :: ( Char -> Maybe ( Bool , [ Char ] ) ) -> ( Char -> Maybe ( String , [ Char ] ) ) > tf '' = ( fmap . fmap . first ) show > f ''' = tf '' f Demo : > main = mapM_ putStrLn > [ showT p $ fmap length > , showT m $ ( fmap.fmap ) length > , showF f $ ( fmap.fmap.fmap ) length > , showF f $ ( fmap.fmap.first ) show ] > > showT x t = show x ++ " == > " ++ ( show $ t x ) > showF f t = " \'a ' -> " ++ show ( f 'a ' ) ++ " ==> \'a ' -> " ++ show ( ( t f ) 'a ' ) | ( True , " Reactive " ) ==> ( True , 8 ) | Just ( True , " Reactive " ) ==> Just ( True , 8 ) | ' a ' ->
Just ( True , " Reactive " ) ==> ' a ' ->
Just ( True , 8 ) | ' a ' ->
Just ( True , " Reactive " ) == > ' a ' ->
Just ( " True " , " Reactive " ) I think I learned something cool here : being able to perform deep transformations without writing a lot of boiler plate code .
Thank you !

In 1985 Ralph Piro patented this “ self - congratulatory apparatus … which is useful for providing a self - administered pat on the back or a congratulatory gesture . ”
( Using one ’s own hand for this “ places one in a somewhat uncomfortable posture and additionally lacks the placement of a pat in the most desired middle portion of the back . ” )
We show you how to recycle your used electronics through manufacturers , your local electronics stores , and online trade - in programs that offer you cash or gift cards .
Consumer electronics including TVs , computers , peripherals , audio equipment , and phones make up almost 2 percent of the municipal solid waste stream , according to the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
This percentage may seem small and inconsequential , but the quantity of electronic waste is steadily rising .
In fact , the EPA estimates that the number of obsolete consumer electronics sold between 1980 and 2007 is 235 million ; a total weight of 2.25 million tons .
Where are these 235 million units now ?
Eighteen percent of these products were collected for recycling ; the rest are , unfortunately , sitting in landfills .
Toxins ( lead , mercury , flame retardants , and the like ) from these electronics can seep into the soil and ground water , posing serious health and environmental risks .
So what can we as consumers do to properly dispose of electronic waste ?
First , take inventory of the electronics in your household .
( The Consumer Electronics Association estimates that Americans own 24 electronic products per household . )
Find out what 's not being used or what 's stashed away in your closets collecting dust .
Maybe you can give your used PC to a family member or donate it to your local school .
Or better yet , DealNews.com Feature Editor Louis Ramirez ( also of Gizmodo fame ) offered some other ideas to PCMag : extend the life of your old PC by using it as a media server to store all of your music , videos , and photos , or use it as a test PC for trying out Linux .
If you can't repair , refurbish , or reuse your electronics or you must own the latest version then the next best thing is to recycle them .
There are a plethora of options to choose from , too .
You can recycle through a product 's manufacturer , your local electronics store , or an online trade - in program that offers a cash reward or gift card .
Ramirez 's top choices for manufacturer trade - in programs are the ones offered by HP and Gateway , since they tend to give you the most money back .
But with so many choices , how do you know the best way to approach recycling your outdated tech ?
That 's easy .
We researched all of the major electronics manufacturers from A to Z to find out what kinds of recycling programs they offer , if they charge a recycling fee , whether or not you get cash in return , and which geographical regions they service .
Next , we compiled a list of six retailers , including Best Buy and Staples , to reveal their recycling efforts .
Lastly , you 'll know exactly where to get cash back or gift cards for your recycled electronics by visiting the seven cash - back Web sites we recommend .
Keep in mind that all regions have different recycling practices , so please adhere to your local laws .

Last week , reports of a vulnerability in Windows Media Player ( WMP ) started coming in and Microsoft began to investigate .
The issue affects version 11 and earlier of the software , and according to the initial report ( now updated ) , it could be exploited remotely via a specially - crafted SND , MIDI , or WAV file to trigger an integer overflow where a hacker could execute arbitrary code .
Microsoft has since investigated the problem and while the company has admitted that WMP does indeed crash under the said circumstances , there is no security problem to be worried about :
The security researcher making the initial report did n't contact us or work with us directly but instead posted the report along with proof of concept code to a public mailing list .
After that report , other organizations picked the report up and claimed that the issue was a code execution vulnerability in Windows Media Player .
Those claims are false .
We 've found no possibility for code execution in this issue .
Yes , the proof of concept code does trigger a crash of Windows Media player , but the application can be restarted right away and does n't affect the rest of the system .
Microsoft also notes that the issue is already addressed in Windows Server 2003 SP2 and will be addressed in other versions in the future .
If you 're interested in the details on the issue discovered , see the second link below .

Consumers around the world no longer want to buy Japanese cars
Japan 's exports saw a record plunge in February , falling by nearly half compared with a year earlier , according to the country 's finance ministry .
Exports fell 49.4 % year - on - year to 3.526tn yen ( $ 36bn ; £ 24.6 bn ) , though this was in line with forecasts .
The latest data comes after figures for January showed year - on - year exports nearly halved that month as well .
The world 's second - largest economy is suffering in the downturn as demand for its products has collapsed .
Exports are important for Japan , so the global downturn is affecting the country particularly badly , according to the BBC's Tokyo correspondent Roland Buerk .
Surplus
" Japanese growth was exclusively dependent on exports , " said Professor Noriko Hama at Doshisha Business School in Kyoto .
" It was natural that Japan would be hit a lot more severely than other countries . "
Car exports dropped more than 70 % for February .
Car firms are cutting jobs and reducing shifts in response to slowing demand .
But on the upside , Japan 's trade balance was in surplus in February after a record deficit in January , because the decline in exports was offset by a sharp fall in imports , which were 43 % lower for the month .
This surplus last month , which reached 82.4bn yen ( $ 841 m ) , was the first in five months .
Japan , which is officially in recession , saw its economy contract by an annualised 12.1 % in the last three months of 2008 , the biggest contraction among developed countries .
The government is working on a third stimulus package , which local media reports have estimated will be worth 20 trillion yen .

10 Privacy Settings Every Facebook User Should Know [ AllFacebook ]
[ Updates below ]
Barack Obama 's Wikipedia entry completely omits the president 's " links " to former ' 60s radical William Ayers , Fox News reports .
And it claims the entry contains only a fleeting reference to his controversial former pastor , Jeremiah Wright .
This epic coverup was first reported by WorldNetDaily reporter Aaron Klein , who noticed that edits adding references to Ayers and Wright , among other things , were quickly being undone by Wikipedia volunteers .
Klein found it particularly alarming that a Wikipedia user called " Jerusalem 21 " was recently hit with a three - day wiki - suspension after twice posting the neutral and encyclopedic fact that there are " some doubts about whether Obama was born in the U.S. "
That was Sunday .
Fox picked up Klein 's explosive scoop Tuesday , noting in the first paragraph that — in contrast to Obama 's entry — the Wikipedia " pages for Ayers and Wright are heavily peppered with references to the president . "
That 's meant as evidence that Obama 's real and supposed links to the men are newsworthy enough to include in his bio .
Fame relationships are n't symmetric , though .
If Obama had cut me off in traffic in 1997 , the incident would occupy half my Wikipedia entry , while I would n't get a footnote in his .
Of more interest is the identity of the mysterious Jerusalem 21 , whose courageous disregard of Wikipedia 's ban on fringe material provided WND 's Aaron Klein with his smoking gun in the first place , spawning what will soon be a national wiki -scandal .
Curiously , it turns out that Jerusalem 21 , whoever he or she might be , has only worked on one other Wikipedia entry since the account was created , notes ConWebWatch .
That 's Aaron Klein 's entry , which Jerusalem 21 created in 2006 , and has edited 37 times .
Klein , who serves as WND's Jerusalem bureau chief , did not immediate respond to an e-mail Monday .
Update : March 10 , 2009 | 1:40:00 PM
This morning the WorldNetDaily story , which is headlined " Wikipedia scrubs Obama eligibility , " was scrubbed clean of the name Jerusalem 21 , who 's now referred to only as " one Wikipedia user . "
Fortunately , Google cache never forgets .
Second update : March 10 , 2009 | 7:20:00 PM
Aaron Klein has answered my e-mail .
Klein says that there 's an " undeniable trend " of Ayers and Wright references being scrubbed from Obama 's entry — as he wrote in his article .
But he now admits that he 's responsible for the Jerusalem 21 edits that he reported on , and says he 's updated his WorldNetDaily story to reflect that .
I am not " Jerusalem21 , " but I do know the Wikipedia user ( he works with me and does research for me ) , and I worked with him on this story , which focused on investigating allegations I had received from others of Wikipedia scrubbing Obama 's page .
I wanted to personally oversee whether indeed criticism of Obama was being deleted .
For your information , often investigative journalists engage in exactly this kind of testing — like seeing if they can bypass mandatory disclosures while donating to a candidate ( several newspapers did this prior to the November election ) , or if they can register a dog to vote in Illinois .
Thus , even if I had personally edited Obama 's page as a test to investigate allegations of scrubbing , this is entirely legitimate journalistic practice .
What 's missing from this treatise on investigative journalism is the reporter 's obligation to disclose when he 's engineered events on which he 's reporting .
In a follow - up e-mail , Klein acknowledges that he should have made that disclosure , but suggests he 's guilty of nothing more than an accidental omission in a hastily written story .
" It just slipped my mind , " he writes .
Interesting .
Let 's look at some of the original text .
Indeed , multiple times , Wikipedia users who wrote about the eligibility issues had their entries deleted almost immediately and were banned from re-posting any material on the website for three days .
In one example , Wikipedia user " Jerusalem 21 " added the following to Obama 's page : " There have been some doubts about whether Obama was born in the U.S. after the politician refused to release to the public a carbon copy of his birth certificate and amid claims from his relatives he may have been born in Kenya .
Numerous lawsuits have been filed petitioning Obama to release his birth certificate , but most suits have been thrown out by the courts . "
As is required on the online encyclopedia , that entry was backed up by third - party media articles , citing the Chicago Tribune and WorldNetDaily.com
The entry was posted on Feb. 24 , at 6:16 p.m. EST .
Just three minutes later , the entry was removed by a Wikipedia administrator , claiming the posting violated the websites rules against " fringe " material . [...]
When the user " Jerusalem 21 " tried to repost the entry about Obama 's eligibility a second time , another administrator removed the material within two minutes and then banned the Wikipedia user from posting anything on the website for three days .
That 's a lot of mind - slippage .
You'd think at some point in the writing , Klein would have a revelation , slap his head and say , " Silly me !
Here I am writing about my researcher following my instructions , and I 'm making it sound like I do n't even know the guy !
Glad I caught that . "
The only other example in Klein 's article of a user being suspended from Wikipedia also traces back to a Jerusalem 21 edit — this time about William Ayers .
That example found its way into the Fox News report .
But , similarly , Klein forgot to mention that it was the same user — his unnamed researcher — and the same ban : i.e. , the one that followed two successive edits accusing Obama of falsifying his birth .
If he 'd disclosed all that , it might have been a different article .
" Man Fails to Get Crazy Conspiracy Theory Into Obama 's Wikipedia Entry " is a story not even Fox would pick up .

Dubai has tried to become a regional trade and tourism hub
More than half of the residential and commercial property projects in Dubai due for completion by 2012 have been put on hold or cancelled , a study says .
Property company Jones Lang LaSalle says a lack of funding , job cuts and a fall in population are the cause of the delays and cancellations .
Dubai 's property market has seen a sharp downturn recently after years of rapid development and booming prices .
The report shows vacant office space has doubled in the past six months .

MONTREAL – Quebecers can now get a driver 's licence that will allow them to cross the U.S. border without a passport , and even the province 's privacy watchdog is satisfied with the new high - tech cards .
In the border town of Saint - Bernard - de - Lacolle yesterday , Premier Jean Charest pulled a freshly printed driver 's licence " Plus " out of his wallet , the first to be issued in the province .
The new " enhanced " licences look like the current permits , except they have a hidden radio frequency identification ( RFID ) microchip .
The chip allows border guards to access information about the driver , such as citizenship .
As with passports , only Canadian citizens will be able to obtain the new licences .
Charest said before the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , the main border preoccupation was trade .
After that , it became " security trumps trade , " he said , quoting former U.S. ambassador Paul Cellucci .
From June 1 , new American security regulations require anyone entering the U.S. by land or sea to have a passport or an enhanced driver 's licence .
Charest outlined the problems that would result if a passport were the only option .
One is the ability of Montreal to attract conventions to the city .
The other is the hypothetical family of five from Boston that wants to take a long weekend in Quebec City , but needs a passport for each member first .
" That 's $ 500 before they even get going , " he said .
Charest said New York , Washington , Arizona and Michigan have acted on enhanced licences already .
In Canada , B.C. and Ontario will roll them out this spring .
Privacy advocates had been leery of RFID - enabled licences , worried about how much information would be available on the driver , who would have access , and where it would be stored .
But after improvements to the program , Quebec 's privacy watchdog has approved the plan .
The optional licences will cost $ 40 on top of the $ 72 a licence costs .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Cablevision Systems Corp plans to charge online readers of its Newsday newspaper , a move that would make it one of the first large U.S. papers to reverse a trend toward free Web readership .
The paper said in a statement late on Thursday that it is in the process of transforming the site into a locally focused cable service .
Newsday , which covers the New York suburb of Long Island , was bought by Cablevision in a $ 650 million deal last May that was widely criticized on Wall Street as a puzzling move into a troubled newspaper market .
Cablevision had to write down Newsday ’s value by $ 402 million on Thursday , pushing its fourth - quarter results to a loss , as U.S. print advertising sales and circulation have dropped with more readers seeking free news on the Web .
But Cablevision Chief Operating Officer Tom Rutledge said the cable TV company was aware of the difficulties faced by the traditional newspaper business .
“ Our goal was and is to use our electronic network assets and subscriber relationships to transform the way news is distributed , ” he said on a conference call with analysts .
“ We plan to end the distribution of free Web content and make our news gathering capabilities a service for our customers , ” he added .
Rutledge ’s comments could raise speculation that the paper may seek cost cuts by reducing print operations .
It could also look to cross-promote Web access as part of the Cablevision programing package .
Newsday ’s publisher Timothy Knight said in a statement : “ We are in the process of transforming Newsday ’s Web site into an enhanced , locally focused cable service that we believe will become an important benefit for Newsday and Cablevision customers .
More particulars will be forthcoming over the next few months . ”
Several large U.S. newspaper groups have had to lay off staff , reduce print costs , slash dividends and scramble for debt refinancing in a fight for survival .
Others have filed for bankruptcy protection , including former Newsday parent Tribune Co , Journal Register Co and Philadelphia Newspapers
LLC .
In the past , several major newspapers including The New York Times charged readers for full or partial access to stories on their websites .
But in recent years , news content has become widely available for free , forcing many papers to give up small subscription revenue in the hope of gaining better ad sales by attracting more readers .
Such moves , however , have not made up for the loss of print advertising and circulation revenue .
Some major business papers like the Financial Times and News Corp ’s Wall Street Journal have been able to maintain subscription fees .
Cablevision has been seeking operational partnerships with Newsday .
Last August , it set up Newsday TV , an interactive television channel that allowed digital cable subscribers in Long Island to subscribe to the paper through their TV sets .
Aside from the financial pressures of owning a newspaper , Cablevision management has also clashed with the editors of Newsday , according to reports in the New York Times and other media sources last month .
The dispute allegedly arose over Newsday ’s coverage of allegations against Eddy Curry a player on the New York Knicks basketball team , which Cablevision also owns .
You see , this isnâ€™t a brainstorming session â€ ” itâ€™s a collision of fundamentally incompatible world views .

First , focus all attention on reversing the collapse in demand now , rather than on the global architecture .
Second , employ overwhelming force .
The time for â€ œshock and aweâ€ in economic policymaking is now .
Martin Wolf
OK , I think no regular reader of this blog could seriously suggest I have much sympathy for the sort of views you normally find being propagated by Italy ’s Finance Minister Guilio Tremonti , but when he starts to send out the kind of red warning light danger signals that he has been doing over recent days , then I think we should all be taking note , and when the republic is in danger , then its all hands to the pumps , regardless of who is sounding the alert .
This is not a brainstorming session , it is a real flesh and blood crisis .
Perhaps few of you will have noticed it , but our erstwhile logician has been getting extremely nervous in recent days , and most notably chose his visit to Davos to indicate that he personally would look extraordinarily favourably on any move to inititiate the creation of EU bonds ( for a brief explanation of why these are important , see Wolfgang Munchau ’s argument in favour of such bonds here .
( Or the longer version here )
Italy ’s Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti has said he favoured the issuance of government debt by the European Union .
“ Now my feeling — I am speaking of a political issue not an economic issue — is … now we need a union bond , ” Tremonti said at the World Economic Forum in Davos .
Countries in the euro zone currently issue sovereign debt in their own name , rather than regionally .
Bond traders concerned about the mounting public debt of Italy , Greece and Ireland have pushed down the value of their government bonds , sparking speculation they might be driven out of the euro zone .
Now why would he be arguing this ?
Well the state of Italy ’s own banking sector would be one part of the explanation , and the fact that the Italian government is in no position to mount a rescue operation on its own given the size of its existing debt to GDP commitment , would be another .
In particular , and as I have been arguing , Unicredit – and its Eastern Europe exposure – is a huge worry .
Indeed the situation is now so delicate , that according to this Reuters report last week , Unicredit really does n’t know which government to turn to .
The Italian one perhaps , or the Polish one , or “ it could consider doing it in Austria ” .
Italian bank UniCredit is considering requesting state support in Italy and Poland , a source close to the bank told Reuters on Thursday .
“ The bank does not exclude possible state support in Italy and Poland , ” the source said on condition of anonymity .
In an extract of an interview to be published in Germany ’s Handelsblatt newspaper on Friday , UniCredit Chief Executive Alessandro Profumo said the bank could consider “ state support as insurance against unpredictable events . ”
If the bank does seek state aid , it could consider doing it in Austria , for example , he added .
UniCredit SpA is considering asking for government capital amid the credit crunch , Chief Executive Officer Alessandro Profumo said .
â€ œState support as insurance for unforeseeable eventsâ€ is conceivable , Profumo told Handelsblatt newspaper in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland .
A UniCredit official confirmed the comments to Bloomberg .
Italyâ€™s top bankers met with central bank Governor Mario Draghi last week to discuss the financial crisis , which has caused bankruptcies and government bailouts across the world , while stocks have plunged and credit markets have seized up .
UniCredit and some of its rivals have tumbled in Milan since the start of 2008 amid concern about the strength of their finances .
Bloomberg 29 January 2009
The announcement that Unicredit was seeking state aid came on the same day that the bank admitted that investors had placed orders for only 0.5 percent of the shares they were offering in a rights issue .
The bank received orders for a mere 14.3 million euros of stock out of a total of 3 billion euros , and the plan was to sell leftover stock in the form of convertible bonds , but even this hit a snag , as
The shares were offered at 3.083 euros apiece , or over twice what they were trading for in Milan at the time ( around 1.408 euros ) .
Shareholders , including Allianz SE and the Central Bank of Libya , are among those who agreed to buy the convertible bonds , according to the bank offer document .
Shares of UniCredit have dropped 54 percent since October , when the rights offering was announced , amid concern the capital raising wonâ€™t be sufficient .
But even the bonds issue is running into trouble , since Il Sole 24 Ore reported that Unicredit may raise only 2.5 billion euros rather than the full 3 billion euros because because investor Fondazione CariVerona , which holds a 5 percent stake in the bank , reportedly hasnâ€™t received approval from the government to buy the securities , however , the reason they have not received approval may well be that they have not yet applied since the Italian Treasury , in what is a rather unusual step , said on Thursday announced that they had yet to receive a request from CariVerona to sign up for the bond issue .
All this suggests , of course , that Tremonti ’s warning about an imminent bailout could be a piece of brinksmanship , designed to presssure CariVerona to stop playing “ positioning ” games and come up with the money , but irrespective of whether or not this is the case , some sort of rescue operation for Unicredit surely cannot be far away at this point .
And the fact that Bulgaria ’s Finance Minister Plamen Oresharski was running around last week assuring everyone that Bulgaria ’s banks have not asked for state rescue aid so far , and that the government is not worried about the banking system ’s health for now , is hardly helping to calm already troubled nerves .
About 80 percent of the 29 commercial banks operating in Bulgaria are foreign - owned , with the biggest lenders being run by Italy ’s UniCredit , Hungary ’s OTP Bank , Greece ’s National Bank of Greece and Austria ’s Raiffeisen .
And only today Tremonti has warned that the announcement of more EU bank bailouts is imminent , and maybe as early as this weekend .
European governments may have to bail out more banks as soon as â€ œthis weekend , â€ Italian Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti said today .
â€ œSo far in Europe there have been more than 30 bank bailouts and I canâ€™t rule out that there will be more this week - end , â€ Tremonti said , speaking at a press conference after todayâ€™s Cabinet meeting in Rome .
So how should we address this danger , imminent or otherwise ?
At this point in time I have four proposals :
a) The creation of EU bonds
b ) The introduction of quantitative easing by the ECB ( quantitative easing is the monetary policy which is currently being applied in both the US and Japan , and probably soon in the UK too ) .
c ) Letting those members of the East who want to join the eurozone immediately do so .
d ) A new “ pact ” – one which would be much , much stronger than the old Stability and Growth Pact – to be signed by all countries who enter the EU bond system , a pact which gives direct fiscal remedies to Brussels in the event of non-compliance together with a substantial dose of effective control over the economies of individual countries – since nothing , Mr Sr. Tremonti , ever comes completely for free .
Obviously all of this is quite radical , and indeed fraught with danger , but these are hardly normal times .
In all of this ( d ) is obviously the most important part , as any protection given to EU member economies by the Union must be credible and serious .
So no country could or should be forced in , but it should also be pointed out to those who chose sovereignty and remaining on the fringes to participation that they would run an enormous risk .
Since almost all EU economies seem vulnerable at this point , anyone staying outside could rapidly see themselves exposed to the risk of forced default , since lack of protection is simply an invitation to attack .
Letting ourselves get picked off one by one is not an appetising prospect ( Latvia , Hungary , Greece , Austria , Italy , Spain , Ireland , the UK , Romania , Bulgaria ……… ) .
Clearly those who wish to remain “ dissenters ” should have the liberty to do so , but they should bear well in mind that should they do so they could very easily end up in a group – possibly lead by Diego Armando Maradona – together with Yulia Timoshenko ( Ukraine ) , Cristina Fernadez ( Argentina ) , Rafael Correa ( Ecuador ) and ( possibly ) whoever is the new prime minister in Iceland , bankrupt , and without the aid of international financial support to help deal with their mess .
Perhaps readers may think I am being rather shrill here , and perhaps at this point Tremonti ( for whom I have no afinity , elective or otherwise , see linked post above ) is only playing brinksmanship , but if he is n’t , and Unicredit is about to need bailing out , then push does quickly come to shove , since the EU leaders agreed on October 12 in Paris to bail out systemic banks , and Unicredit is a systemic bank .
So will will need to know how they plan to stand by their commitment , and if they do n’t , well then everyone of us stands exposed , since credibility rapidly falls towards zero .
Maybe this is a false alarm situation , and Unicredit will not need bailing out this weekend , or the next one , but one day it will , and one day Spain ’s huge non performing loan and household debt default problem is going to need sorting out .
So I think this is a line in the sand situation , and we are much nearer to having to make up our minds which side of the line we are on than many seem think .
To paraphrase Paul Krugman again , in flirting with the idea of whether the first to default should be Greece , or Hungary , we truly are flirting with disaster .
Jeff Bezos is spending this week working in an Amazon distribution center in Lexington , Kentucky ( AMZN ) .
He apparently wants to see what it 's like to be a rank - and - file Amazon employee .
More CEOs should try that once in a while .
( Note that this is not an hour with the press entourage on a factory floor .
It 's a week , 3000 miles away from home , with no cameras allowed . )
Lexington Herald - Leader : " Thanks so much for your interest in speaking with our CEO Jeff Bezos , " said spokeswoman Patty Smith .
" Unfortunately , I 'm not going to be able to arrange any interviews or photos this week while he is in Lexington .
" He is there to work , " Smith said , " and , unfortunately , we are just not scheduling any interviews while he is in town . "
Local Amazon employees say Bezos is working in the warehouse with the company 's hourly employees to see what they do and hear their comments about their work .
Casey B. Mulligan is an economist at the University of Chicago .
The terrible bottom line of last Friday ’s job report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics did not surprise many people — there were many fewer jobs in December 2008 than in the previous month .
Much less noticed , however , was Friday ’s breakdown by sex of employment declines before December .
Is it possible that one legacy of this recession is that women become a majority of the work force for the first time in American history ?
Years ago , women were a small percentage of the work force ( outside the home ) .
During much of the 20th century — especially the 1970s and 1980s — women ’s share of the labor force increased .
By 1990 , the work force was 47 percent female and 53 percent male , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Many view this as one of the most important and desirable social and economic transformations of our lifetimes .
Throughout the 1990s and 2000s , and until this recession , women remained less than 49 percent of the work force .
However , that percentage has now passed 49 percent and may cross the 50 percent threshold for the first time .
In November 2008 , the female work force shrank more in percentage terms than it ever has in any one month — and more than ever over any single year — since 1964 , if not longer .
Nevertheless , the drop in the number of women working so far in this recession is smaller than the decline for men — even when measured in percentage terms — as has been the case in previous recessions .
The table below displays calculations for three recessions — 1990 - 91 , 2001 and today .
According to the National Bureau of Economic Research , the recessions began in July 1990 , March 2001 and December 2007 .
The first two ended in March 1991 and November 2001 .
Two notes :
First , nobody knows when this recession will end , and second , the most recent data for which the the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports employment by sex is November 2008 .
During the first recession , male employment fell 2.0 percent , while female employment hardly fell at all ( less than 0.05 percent ) .
In the other two recessions , the percentage employment loss for men exceeded that for women by a factor of 3 to 5 ( interestingly , although women still have a small minority of each recession ’s employment decline , the female share of the decline has increased from one recession to the next , indicating that jobs held by women have become more sensitive to changes in the business cycle ) .
The bottom of the table shows how , as a result of the larger male jobs losses , women ’s share of the work force has increased 0.5 percentage points in each of the most recent recessions .
For example , the 0.5 percentage point increase that occurred in the 8 months of the 1990 - 91 recession is more than occurred for the 10 years that followed , or in the 6 years that followed the 2001 recession .
If the pundits are right that this recession will be long and severe , then women may gain the 0.9 percentage points from November 2008 that would push them past the 50 percent milestone .
Important milestones will remain to be achieved , but women ’s surpassing 50 percent of employment is something that historians will note for years to come .
Split the Party
Generally speaking , you should n’t split the party .
Sure , it might make sense based on the situation the PCs are in , but it ’s a nightmare to play it out .
What usually ends up happening is that half the people at the table can’t do anything but watch while their companions go left and they go right .
It ’s extremely difficult to keep the people not in the “ active ” group focused since PCs not in the scene ca n’t offer suggestions or actively participate .
When I ’m the DM , I do everything I can to discourage splitting up .
But an interesting thing happened this weekend during my Sunday night game .
We split up and it worked spectacularly .
My hat is off to Suddry , that evening ’s DM , for taking a usually disastrous situation and making it one of the most memorable nights of D&D we ’ve had in a long time .
Here ’s how it played out and what we learned from it .
Setup
The four PCs were facing a difficult skill challenge .
We needed information and had very little idea of how to find clues .
Keeping in character , we started kicking around ideas .
Most of them had real merit .
But the ideas were very much tailored to fit the PC who came up with each idea , and no one ’s idea was suitable for the entire group .
After some debate we decided to explore our own angle for gathering information individually .
We all knew which characters were good at which skills .
Usually this kind of skill challenge has the talkers doing most of the work and the muscle doing a lot of assisting .
This routine was getting boring .
The DM knew this better than the players so he did something about it .
He encouraged the players to be creative .
Rather than spoon feed us , the DM left things very wide - open .
He gave us the broad strokes and it was up to us to determine a course of action .
This was n’t the usual situation where the entire party is ushered into an audience chamber and suddenly the encounter begins .
We had time to plan .
It allowed each character to play to his strengths .
And the best way for that to happen was to split up .
Embrace Individuality
Once we decided to split up the DM laid down these two ground rules .
If your character is not in the scene you cannot participate .
Everyone gets to pursue one avenue of investigation and then we move on .
Then the DM went around the table asking each of us what we wanted to do , how long we needed to do it , and what skills we felt were most appropriate .
Playing To Your Strengths
Like most skill challenges , we each came up with ideas that played to our best skills and we had little trouble making the rolls to earn successes .
In most cases the roll was even easier because the PC was alone .
The Rogue was able to infiltrate the seedy underbelly of the town successfully since he was n’t seen in the Paladin ’s company .
The Paladin was able to mingle with the upper echelons of society without having to apologize for his gruffly and extremely uncouth friend , the Fighter .
Pacing
The reason that splitting up worked so well in this situation was the pacing .
Each player got a couple of minutes to briefly play out their scenario .
At the end of their turn they attempted to earn a single success .
After the roll was made and a success or failure occurred the scene would shift to the next player .
In many cases this left the PC who just acted in a mini-cliff hanger .
Everyone wanted to know what was going to happen next .
And this engagement by the other players in a storyline that did n’t involve them directly helped keep them focused .
Everyone wanted their story to be the most exciting so everyone dug deep and flexed their creativity , while still keeping in character .
The result was great role playing , great pacing and a very fun skill challenge .
Chronology
Since each PC was acting alone , it was important to determine how much time had passed between stories .
In one case the PC needed a week to adopt a trustworthy persona , make friends and gather key pieces of information to earn success .
In another case , kicking a few butts and intimidating a few thugs revealed success in the course of one evening .
Successes and Failures
Even though most of the PCs uncovered the same information as the previous player , each individual success counted towards the overall success of the skill challenge .
Since each approach was different and almost always used different skills , each piece of new information counted towards overall success .
Bringing It Back Together
After each PC had a few turns at earning a few successes in the overall skill challenge the DM was quick to rein us is .
As I mentioned at the outset , splitting up can be disastrous .
Our DM knew that the time for acting as individuals was done with and it was time to bring the PCs back together as a party .
This ended up being one of those rare occurrences when splitting up worked .
How often do characters split up in your campaign ?
How is it handled ?
When has it worked ?
When has it failed ?

LONDON ( Reuters Life ! ) -
A school boy of 13 has become one of Britain ’s youngest dads , underlining concern about the rate of teenage pregnancies in the country .
Four - foot Alfie Patten , who looks considerably younger than his age , was just 12 when his 15 - year - old girlfriend Chantelle Steadman conceived after a night of unprotected sex .
Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said the “ tragic ” case illustrated the country ’s social decline .
“ It exemplifies the point we have been making about broken Britain , ” he told London ’s Evening Standard newspaper .
“ It ’s not about being accusative : it ’s about pointing out the complete collapse in some parts of society of any sense of what ’s right and wrong . ”
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he was not familiar with the individual case , but told Sky TV : “ All of us would want to avoid teenage pregnancies . ”
Maisie Roxanne was born in Eastbourne on Monday and police said that despite both children being underage they would not be looking into the case .
In a short video clip posted on YouTube , the lad , whose voice has not broken yet , said he did not know how he would support his family .
In an interview with the Sun newspaper he said : “ I thought it would be good to have a baby .
I did n’t think about how we would afford it .
I do n’t really get pocket money .
My dad sometimes gives me 10 pounds . ”
A family charity blamed government policy .
“ Unless we begin to seriously address the issue of underage sexual activity , we shall continue to see cases like this , ” said Norman Wells , director of Family and Youth Concern .
“ The government ’s teenage pregnancy strategy with all its emphasis on sex education and making contraception freely available to young people is creating a climate in which teenagers think it is normal to be sexually active under the age of 16 . ”
Wells said in a statement that young people did not need more sex education , but a complete change of focus .
“ We need to challenge the common perception of sex as a casual recreational activity and present it rather as an expression of the total self - giving of a husband and wife to each other in marriage . ”

The Government ’s Change4 Life campaign upped the ante in drawing spurious links between games and premature death this week .
The British Heart Foundation , Diabetes UK and Cancer Research have all lent their name to a new print campaign ( pictured here ) , which shows a gamer risking an early grave by ‘ doing nothing ’ .
It has appeared in women ’s lifestyle press titles such as Star , Reveal and Heat .
The move follows the broadcast of the Government ’s Change4 Life TV ads , which link playing video games to obesity .
The ads have aired since the start of the year .

WASHINGTON --
The Obama 's administration 's leading plan to fix General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC would use bankruptcy filings to purge the ailing companies of their biggest problems , including bondholder debt and retiree health - care costs , according to people familiar with the matter .
The move would in essence split both companies into their " good " and " bad " components .
The government would like to see the " good " GM to be a standalone company , according to an administration official .
The " good " Chrysler would be sold to Fiat SpA , assuming that deal is completed , this person said .
GM and Chrysler have had bankruptcy attorneys devising plans for such a move in recent months .
President Barack Obama 's task force has told both companies that the administration prefers this route as a way to reorganize the two auto makers , rather than the prolonged out - of - court process that has thus far frustrated administration officials .
GM looks increasingly like it will be forced into filing for bankruptcy protection , sometime in mid-to - late May , in a plan where the automaker breaks into two companies , the surviving entity a " new GM " that maintains key brands such as Chevy and Cadillac and some international units , say several people familiar with the situation .
Thank you sooooooo much for making this export such a pleasant experience .
Your professionalism and great guidance , together with your day to day handling of documents , port authorities , vessel operators , etc. made this a fantastic experience for us .

“ If you realized how powerful your thoughts are , you would never think a negative thought . ” ~ Peace Pilgrim
Although I do often write from a personal perspective , I rarely reveal specifics surrounding my daily life .
Today is different .
I lost my job on Thursday .
I am now among the millions of unemployed … a number that we all know is growing daily .
While there is intellectual comfort in knowing that we are not alone , when faced with looming bills to be paid , those numbers mean little .
As I sent out emails , letting friends and old contacts know of the situation ( ie : Help !
I ’m looking for a job !! ) , many wrote back expressing sorrow and talking about the difficulties of finding work in these extraordinarily challenging economic times .
One , in particular , stood out … “ Glad to see that your spirits are up !!
Mine were down when XXXX let me go .
However …. persistence will prevail . ”
Yes , persistence will prevail , no doubt , but that ’s not what struck me .
What made me stop for a moment was the comparison … that in my note to him it was evident that I looked at things differently .
That I was n’t going to let the reality of the situation change my attitude toward life .
Why , or why not ?
My Father was a very logical and practical man .
I often thought of him as Mr. Spock .
I think I inherited the gene .
I ’ve also gone through some enormously challenging times in my life , starting from when I was a very young child .
Those challenging times left me with a gift … a gift of knowing just how strong the mind is .
We often hear that we can choose how we will handle challenges , but even more importantly , we can choose what we will look at in any given situation .
Right now , I can choose to focus my attention – my thoughts , my reactions , my talk – to the ‘ direness ’ of losing my job … or … I can focus that exact same amount of energy on making contacts every day , taking care of my health , reminding myself of my successes and that tomorrow is yet another brand new day .
If I concentrate my thoughts on the first scenario , I spiral down into a depression , sitting on the couch , worrying how I ’ll pay the bills and crying to my friend .
If I choose the second , I am making inroads toward what I know will be the end of this difficult and challenging time .
Life cycles .
Things begin , things end .
We all have absolutely wonderful days , filled with love and laughter and joy .
And we all have the harshest of times , when it ’s difficult to see anything beyond the moment .
No matter what I choose to focus on , life will continue its cycle .
I ’m fully aware of the difficulties that lie ahead … I know there are bills to be paid from a non-existent income , and that the job market right now is without question the most challenging one in the last 50 years or more .
I do n’t need to sit and think about them over and over … what good would that do me ?
What I can do , however , is choose to concentrate the energy within my spirit on the knowledge that I have the power to accept this challenge and move forward , doing what I can to lay the groundwork for the upside of life ’s cycle .
Are my spirits ‘ up ’?
You can call it that , if you want .
I prefer to call it reality .

Vital for our food production , honeybee populations are now in crisis ( Image : Nature Picture Library / Rex )
THE world ’s honeybees appear to be dying off in horrifying numbers , and now consensus is starting to emerge on the reason why : it seems there is no one cause .
Infections , lack of food , pesticides and breeding – none catastrophic on their own – are having a synergistic effect , pushing bee survival to a lethal tipping point .
A somewhat anti-climactic conclusion it may be , but appreciating this complexity – and realising there will be no magic bullet – may be the key to saving the insects .
A third of our …
The worst recession in three - quarters of a century is threatening to divide Britain more painfully than ever .
Younger , richer households are gaining from lower inflation , house prices and mortgage rates , but at the expense of older , poorer fellow citizens .
They are struggling to survive as they suffer relatively high price rises and a drop in their incomes as interest rates on savings hit zero and they see the equity in their homes destroyed by the property slump .
The spectre of a " two- nation Britain " – a subject talked of by Benjamin Disraeli in Victorian times – is conjured up again by the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies , which points out that older and poorer households are facing much higher average inflation rates than younger and richer ones , because the former have tended to suffer most from continued high annual inflation in food and domestic energy costs , while the latter have tended to benefit most from cuts in mortgage rates and falling petrol bills .
Richer households , and in particular those with mortgages , now have very low inflation rates , on average below zero , says the IFS .
But the poorest pensioner households , usually with no mortgage , are still coping with inflation at 6.9 per cent .
Thanks to cuts in the bank rate , mortgage interest inflation fell from 2.9 per cent in September to minus 34.7 per cent in January .
A homebuyer with a £ 200,000 mortgage and an interest rate tracking the Bank of England 's Bank Rate – now down to 0.5 per cent – will have enjoyed a £ 500 per month boost , the equivalent of a pre-tax pay rise of nearly £ 10,000 .

The fall in petrol and diesel prices has also disproportionately favoured the Porsche - driving classes .
But for those renting , things are not so jolly : inflation is 4.7 per cent for private renters , 4.9 per cent for those who own outright and 6.1 per cent for local authority renters , usually lower - income households that spend more of their budget on food and fuel .
The IFS analysis reveals that in January 2009 the richest fifth of households had an average inflation rate of minus 1 per cent ; the poorest fifth had an average inflation rate of 5.3 per cent .
High - spending households have struck a small bonanza from the fall in mortgage rates and the reduction in petrol prices .
If they are looking for a property and have a large cash deposit they can also take advantage of the 15 per cent slump in property prices , a £ 22,000 bonus , given the price of the average property .
For those looking for a new car , many manufacturers are falling over themselves to offer discounts , cash - backs and other savings .
There is also a long - term division growing between the public and private sectors : those who keep a job will fare best , but the chances of doing so are much higher in the state sector , the only area of the economy still expanding .
But pensioners are coming off relatively worst .
In January 2009 , RPI food inflation was 9.9 per cent , a little below the 11.2 per cent rate for food last September , while household fuel inflation was 35.1 per cent in January , down slightly from 39.6 per cent in September .
Both items are a big part of pensioners ' budgets .
So , even though average inflation is very low – 0.1 per cent on the RPI measure which includes mortgage interest , and CPI down to 3 per cent with negative rates to come over the summer – householders aged 70 to 79 have inflation rates of 5.6 per cent on average and those aged 80 + have an inflation rate of 7.1 per cent on average .
The economic , social and political consequences of this most divisive of downturns promise to be more dramatic than any seen since the 1930s .

From the ' intellectual property is not evil ' files :
There has been a lot of talk in the last several weeks about Microsoft 's patent lawsuit against navigation vendor TomTom , which includes Linux .
Despite that talk , ( at least in the press ) , Microsoft apparently is not seeing any direct backlash as a result of their patent case .
I asked Sam Ramji senior director of platform strategy at Microsoft about TomTom the other day and he
claimed that patent issues are n't causing any chilling effect on his part of Microsoft 's open source plans .
" We 've made so much progress in demonstrating a consistent and rational process for open source adoption of Microsoft technologies and interoperability with non-Microsoft platforms , " Ramji said .
" I feel like we 've gained some credit in that area and we do our best .
I 've been at two significant open source events in the last few weeks and none of attendees have brought up the issues of patents to me . "
Before I go any further , let me first state that Sam Ramji does not shy away from questions .
I 've had the opportunity to interview him several times over the last few years and he has always been as upfront as possible .
Ramji's comments , in response to my question on TomTom , is a direct correlation with what Ramji has been saying for as long as I 've been talking to him about patents -- namely that developers need not worry ( too much ) .
That said , last year at OSCON , Ramji was quite literally mobbed by the audience after his presentation by attendees that were ' curious ' about Microsoft 's patent stance .
The TomTom case potentially represents Microsoft 's first real patent legal attack against Linux and as such , somehow I suspect that eventually that will trigger a chill of some sort .

Dr. Beverages Page
Hello and welcome to the most important page on the internet .
First let me tell you a bit of history about this site :
About two years ago , my friends and I noticed a plethora of imitation Dr. Pepper drinks hitting the market .
Most of these are store brands , but some well - known companies hit with their own versions as well .
I was struck by how sudden all of these flooded the marketplace ( or perhaps on how quickly I noticed this ) and began keeping tabs on the names - after all , some of them were quite funny .
And so it progressed from this idle interest to quite a side hobby .
I 'm trying to collect the various cans of these sodas , which can be difficult , considering some of them do n't seem to manufacture cans .
In any case , I shall not keep dallying ; here is the extent of my collection :
Dr. Pepper
Of course , the original soda that started it all ...
Dr. Wells
This one is also apparently quite old , although its origin seems slightly silly , since it is not very different from the Pepper , but costs more .
Doc Shasta
A slight variation on the Dr. moniker , this one is also widely available .
If memory serves , it is also more red than the other sodas .
Dr. Thirst
This is the first generic one I noticed , and it really struck me because it had a very funny name .
It is made by Marquee Premium and available at Abco grocery stores .
Dr. Slice
This one also seemed very funny since I thought Slice would be too reputable name to rip off an actual soda ( anything goes for the generics , of course ) .
This is pretty widely available ; I 've even seen it in standard vending machines .
The cans bill it as " the Wild One . "
Dr. Right A Preferred Selection , we found this in New Mexico at a store I do n't remember the name of .
It is also available in Tucson , but I do n't remember where .
Dr. Smooth Made by President 's Choice and available at Smitty's , this one is billed as a " secret recipe soda . "
This one also went through a facelift , and I do n't have the original can , as that was discontinued before I began my collection .
Its new design is unusual because it discards the standard red coloring of most of these sodas .
Dr. Smith 's The Smith 's " Original " brand .
Dr. Starr An " American Premier " soda , available at Osco Drug .
Dr. K The Big K variation , available at Fry's .
The basketball allusion would be more clever if it had any depth ; I 'm sure it was just chance and keeping with the philosophy that many stores just adopt the word " Dr. " and add it to whatever their sodas may already be called .
This has a mostly white can , like all the Big K sodas .
Dr. A+ Made by A+ , the Albertson 's brand .
Real Dr. Unusual syntax , but a similar drink , although this is the only one in my collection I have never had the pleasure to taste .
It 's made by Sunny Select , and I am indebted to my friend Tivon Jacobson for retrieving this from a store in California I no longer remember the name of .
Dr. Becker A Blue
Sky soda , a " natural " variation on the theme , available at the more health - oriented groceries , like Reay 's Ranch Market and the Food Conspiracy .
Dr. Joe 's
Another healthy one , from Trader Joe's .
Both of these are unusual in that they have no caffeine , showing that the appeal of Dr. Pepper - like sodas goes far beyond the " pep " the caffeine would give you .
Dr. Furr 's
The Furr 's home brand , another one we found in New Mexico .
Dr. Topper
This one was just brought to me from a supermarket I do n't remember the name of in Lubock , Texas , and is made by the Hy - Top company .
Dr. Kist
This one comes from a truckstop in Lordsburg , New Mexico , thanks to the Jacobson clan ( mentioned below ) .
A picture is forthcoming .
Dr. Chek Information and picture forthcoming .
Dr. something - else I can't remember
As you can see I need some updating here .
When I get my pictures developed , these will be corrected and brought up to date .
That concludes the actual cans in my collection .
Here is a list of sodas that are rumored to exist , or I can't find in cans .
I 'm very interested in any information that can confirm their existence , and would be really grateful if anyone could get me a can of them .
Dr. Cheaper A classic name for a drink apparently nobody has seen .
My friend Keith Turausky swears he saw a truck with this painted on its side , but nobody I know has been able to find one .
Does it exist , or was Keith on drugs ?
( Or both , that may be most likely . )
Dr. Diablo Quite frankly I have no idea where the rumor of the existence of this soda came from , but it is another stumper .
My friend Josh Ostrander claims he has a bunch at his parent 's house , but I have yet to see evidence of this .
Does it exist , or is Josh a liar ?
Dr. Zeppa Available in New York somewhere , according to my friend Matt Buchholz .
Unfortunately he was unable to find a can .
Dr. Lariat Unfortunately this one I think may only be available by bottle .
I have seen it , though , so at least I am sure of this one 's existence .
And then , finally , of course there are those sodas that are too good to join the medical practice , starting with Mr. Pibb ( another old classic ) , but also including Skipper ( from Safeway ) , Mr. Aah ( or something like that , from Pennsylvania or something ) , and Southern Lightning ( from Wal * Mart ) .
Well , if you 've made it this far then you must be mildly interested in this topic at least ( or amazed at how anyone could waste this much time ) and will contribute to our search for the elusive remaining doctors yet to be uncovered .
If you can contribute , please do , send me an email immediately leading to the conquest of this strange beast at lars@u.arizona.edu .
Your assistance will be greatly appreciated .
I should also mention there 's actually someone else in the galaxy interested in this stuff , and point you to his web page .
It 's http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/~bmasmith/
Credits for this page : Natan Jacobson , pictured at left , helped me take all these pictures with his family 's digital camera .
Thanks to all the Jacobsons .
As far as people helping me with the hunt , these are the people I can name who have helped me : Keith Turausky , Russell Wiener , Tivon Jacobson , Daniel Brito , John Salwin , Shira Jacobson , Michael Rhodes , Matt Buchholz , and probably others .
Mail me if you think you belong on this list ; you probably do .
America ’s coming confrontation with Israel has been foreshadowed for quite some time by several under - the - radar signals , but the media has been too invested in the “ special relationship ” narrative to notice , at least until the Obama administration took the reins .
In spite of the Bush team ’s reputation for being the most pro-Israel White House ever , in the last year or so of the second term they had been moving steadily away from being Israel ’s yes - man  for example , by tightening visa restrictions on the entry of Israelis into the US  and this trend culminated in the White House vetoing an Israeli strike on Iran .
With the victory of the Israeli far - right in the recent Israeli elections , and the likelihood that the ultra-nationalist whack - job Avigdor Lieberman will serve in the new government as foreign minister , US - Israeli relations are headed for a crisis that will test the power of the Israeli lobby as it has never been tested before , and also provide an interesting lesson in the how and why of our foreign policy .
The recently reported Israeli air strike on Sudan , ostensibly conducted to intercept arms bound for the Palestinian territories , was carried out in January  just as pressure on the Bush administration to attack Iran was reaching a well - orchestrated crescendo .
Analysts interpret the raid as a signal to Iran that the Jewish state is ready , willing and able to lash out at its enemies , with or without US approval , and yet one cannot help thinking that it was just as much a signal to the Americans that Israel will no longer be constrained by the requirements of the “ special relationship . ”
To illustrate the growing tensions between Wasington and Tel Aviv , one has only to look at what happened at a recent meeting between our secretary of state and incoming Israeli prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , as reported by Foreign Policy ‘s Laura Rozen :
“ Sources tell Foreign Policy that when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with Netanyahu at the King David Hotel earlier this month , such was the concern that a certain former Mossad analyst who now serves as Netanyahu ’s security advisor may pose a counterintelligence problem that , after conferring with an aide , Clinton suggested to Netanyahu that they reduce the number of people in the room . ”
Ah , but wily old Bibi out - foxed Hillary by asking Israeli ambassador to the US Sallai Meridor to leave the room , instead of Uzi Arad , his top national security advisor .
Formerly a Mossad officer in the research division and foreign liaison , Arad is an academic who currently chairs the Herzilya conference , an annual event that brings together the Jewish state ’s key national security and political leaders for the Israeli equivalent of Davos .
Yet no doubt a great many Israeli officials are or have been connected to their nation ’s intelligence apparatus  why pick on this one ?
How to explain Clinton ’s aversion to Mr. Arad ?
It seems that ever since he was identified as having met with convicted Israeli spy Larry Franklin  a meeting that was monitored by the FBI ’s counterintelligence unit , and noted in Frankln ’s indictment 
Arad has had great trouble obtaining a US visa .
In August of 2004 , Franklin  the Pentagon ’s top Iran analyst , and a habitué of the neocons ’ ad hoc lie factory , the “ Office of Special Plans ”  was arrested and indicted for conspiracy to transmit sensitive classified information to Israeli embassy officials .
The indictment documents that he did so with the assistance of two employees of AIPAC , the Israel lobby ’s Washington powerhouse , including Steve Rosen , the group ’s chief lobbying official and architect of its unprecedented success .
They recruited Franklin , and then handed him over directly to Naor Gilon , then the Israeli embassy ’s chief political officer .
Gilon and Franklin met regularly from February through May and throughout the summer , often at the Pentagon Officers Athletic Club .
This was the venue of a meeting between Gilon , Franklin , and Arad , where , sitting at a table in the Pentagon cafeteria , Franklin briefed his handlers on the status of Iran ’s nuclear program  and doubtless much else .
Rozen avers that “ Clinton ’s suggestion was made , sources say , in the hopes that Netanyahu would get the message and excuse Arad from the meeting . ”
To be sure , he got the message all right  and so did she .
The Israelis are perfectly well aware that Arad is radioactive right now , with the trial of Rosen ( and his accomplice , Keith Weissman ) looming  which is precisely why the Israelis pushed him forward .
The Israelis are telling us that the threat they face from Iran is “ existential . ”
This means that an attack on Iran is a non-negotiable item , as far as Tel Aviv is concerned : it ’s just a matter of when , and by whom .
The Israelis and their amen corner in this country have been embarked on a longstanding campaign to gin up a US - Iranian confrontation , just as they did in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq , but this time the Lobby is being much more overt about taking a leading and very visible role in the agitation .
There is , however , a covert aspect of this campaign , and it ’s significant that the agency of both efforts has been AIPAC , which is in effect an unregistered agent of a foreign government .
Any other organization that had been raided twice by the FBI in connection with an espionage investigation would have been shut down long ago .
In the case of AIPAC , however , a great exception has been made , the sort of special treatment , as Grant Smith notes in his fascinating study , that has been granted the organization throughout its various incarnations .
But that ’s what the special relationship is all about .
The US - Israeli symbiosis that defined our Middle Eastern policy , and set the framework , in no small part , for our relations with the rest of the world , is coming under a severe strain .
In any relationship that goes sour , there ’s always a lot of recriminations : “ It is n’t like it used to be ! ” “ Yes , but you ’ve changed oh , how you ’ve changed ! ”
It ’s Israel , not the US , . that has changed , and not for the better .
The rise of an Israeli neo - fascist organization with real electoral clout  enough to get their leader the foreign ministry  is a sign of a very deep sickness , an ominous portent that cannot and must not be overlooked .
After all , Israel is a nuclear power , and Senor Lieberman did once express a desire to blow up the Aswan dam .
If the extreme right - ward trend in Israeli politics continues , it is n’t hard to imagine such a loon one day becoming Prime Minister  and I leave the rest to your imagination .
This is not the Israel of Exodus , the musical theme of which inspired my youthful passion for the lushly Romantic , the storyline as well as the music .
It is , increasingly , the Israel of our worst nightmares .
This is already costing the Lobby public support .
Cracks in the reflexively pro-Israel consensus are already beginning to appear , and the prospect of a real policy realignment has the Israel lobby working overtime to turn the tide .
This struggle will be an object lesson in how and why a nation ’s foreign policy is determined : whether it is formulated with an eye to objective circumstances , and the national interest , or simply designed to the specifications of lobbyists , foreign and domestic .
Objectively , the Israel - centric policy we pursue in the Middle East works against our interests , which , since 9/11 , are to split the Muslim world in the fight against Al Qaeda .
Up until now , however , our policy has been based entirely on the dubious axiom that Israeli and American interests are identical , a principle that unites the entire Muslim world against us .
Since 9/11 , and really since the end of the cold war , American and Israeli interests have begun to diverge , and , today , they are reaching the breaking point .
Whether the subjective factor  the power of the Lobby  can triumph over the objective circumstances promises to be an interesting test , and a fateful one for all concerned .
On Git 's lack of respect for immutability and the Best Practices for a DVCS
I learned something very important from the feedback after my entry last week on Git 's index .
Here 's what I learned :
Suppose I wrote a 300 page book describing all the great things about Git and why it is so awesome .
Further suppose that on page 295 near the bottom , I include a one - sentence mention of a way that I think Git might change for the better .
Further suppose that I wrote that sentence in Klingon .
And then I encrypted it with Schneier 's latest cipher , wrapped it in base64 encoding , ran it through rot13 and then pasted it into the book .
If I did this , the primary response from the Git user community would be : " Eric 's new book says that Git sucks .
He does n't get it . "
Trust me folks -- I get it .
Commits to a DVCS are different .
When you commit to a private instance of the repository , you do n't " break the build " .
The rules and guidelines for a DVCS are different than the ones for a centralized system .
Best Practices
But some of the best practices are the same .
Here 's my off - the - cuff sloppy definition of a " best practice " :
A best practice is a guideline that can be followed lots of times by lots of different people in lots of different situations with minimal likelihood of causing pain to the team .
Actually , I want to give TWO definitions .
Here 's another one , speaking as a source control vendor :
A best practice is a guideline that I can give to our customers to minimize the likelihood that they will need to call our tech support staff .
A technique can be " really cool " or " very powerful " and still not qualify for any reasonable person 's definition of " best practice " .
I stand by my original claims .
I think " git add - - p " is " really cool " , but it does n't qualify as a " best practice " .
It allows the developer to commit code they have never seen .
Yes , that commit happens in a private instance of the repo , but that code is eligible to be pushed into another instance .
Is there a good outcome here ?
Suppose I use " git add - - p " to commit some code that does n't even compile .
What can happen ?
Maybe this changeset never escapes my private repository instance .
In that case , it has caused no harm .
But it has also caused no benefit .
Maybe my next checkin fixes the build .
So now the offending changeset is less likely to cause problems , because the fix will get pushed as well .
But this scenario is equivalent to the centralized case where I break the build but fix it before anybody finds out .
It 's not very harmful , but it 's not very helpful either .
Maybe I later use Git 's history rewriting features to eliminate the offending changeset , replacing a chain of small changesets with one larger one that has been well - tested .
In this scenario , I have eliminated all the potentially harmful effects , since the DAG will not have any nodes that are " broken " .
But now I have other concerns .
Immutability
The issue of rewriting history is perhaps my biggest philosophical objection to the way Git works .
Call me old fashioned if you like , but I believe changesets and the history of the repository should be immutable .
Version control features that alter history make me squirm .
My own product supports an " Obliterate " feature and I hate it .
I understand why it 's there , but I still wish it was n't .
One thing I 've learned from twelve years of supporting version control products is that customers will find a way to misuse things .
The purpose of Obliterate is to help with that once - a - year situation where you really screwed up and checked in something that should never have been in the repository and absolutely must be removed .
But every now and then we get a tech support call from somebody who is using Obliterate every day .
Those are the days when I want to ship the product with that feature locked and only enable it for customers where every developer has passed a written exam .
Think about it .
Even if you love
Git 's ability to rewrite history , does this sound to you like a " best practice " ?
Or does it sound like a quick way to get a bunch of geeks addicted to recreational pharmaceuticals ?
Sandboxes
Like I said , I get it .
A DVCS gives me a private sandbox , so I can have more freedom while I play .
It 's " really cool " that I can kick and throw sand without hurting the other kids .
But that does n't mean it 's a " best practice " .
Conceptually , my private instance of the repository is still part of a larger whole .
The entire repository may not exist on any one machine , but it exists in concept .
It is one big Directed Acyclic Graph .
When I use " git add - - p " and checkin something that does n't compile , my offending commit is conceptually still a member of that DAG .
The best practices for a DVCS are built around this principle :
The extra freedom provided by a private sandbox should be held in the proper tension with a measure of respect for the entire DAG .
California goes broke , halts $ 3.5 billion in payments Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday February 2 , 2009
Print This Email This California , the eighth largest economy in the world , is broke .
" People are going to be hurt starting today , " said Hallye Jordan , speaking on behalf of the state Controller .
" There 's no money . "
Since state legislators failed to meet an end of January deadline on an agreement to make up for California 's $ 40 billion budget gap , residents wo n't be getting their state tax rebates , scholarships to Cal Grant college will go unpaid , vendors invoices will remain uncollected and county social services will cease .
At least , temporarily .
Services and payments will resume once state legislators come to an agreement on the budget .
" This time , there are real - world consequences , " said H.D. Palmer , spokesman for the California Department of Finance , in a report by KCRA in Sacramento .
" Because we have not been able to get to a budget agreement , payments are n't going to be made . "
" This is an issue of fairness , " said Assemblyman Ted Gaines , R- Roseville , in the KCRA report .
" It hurts hardworking families the most .
Refunds , in fact , will stimulate the economy , and taxpayers need their money . "
" Included are $ 515 million in payments to the state 's vendors and $ 280 million to help people with developmental disabilities .
Other public assistance agencies will be left waiting for hundreds of millions of dollars , " reports CNN .
" Other public assistance agencies will be left waiting for hundreds of millions of dollars . "
" I see the will during the negotiations even though these are very , very tough things that we talk about , where we go into areas that we have never , ever dreamt of going into and trying to solve , " said Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger .
" So you will be very surprised when the whole thing is done .
We 're still not there yet .
There is still a lot of work that needs to be done but we are moving slowly forward with this process . "
" If there is no deal by Friday , state government workers will take their first furlough day , " reports the San Diego Union Tribune .
" Schwarzenegger has ordered state employees to take two days off a month without pay through June 2010 to save about $ 1.4 billion .
" ' We 're really hoping we can work out a compromise that helps the governor achieve the savings he wants while minimizing the disruption to state services and to the lives of the employees who provide the services , ' said Jim Zamora , spokesman for the Service Employees International Union , Local 1000 , which represents the state 's largest employee union with 90,000 workers . "
" Some 46 states face budget shortfalls , forcing them to slash funding for many services , " reported CNN .
" But California , the largest state in the union by population , faces a deficit that totals more than 35 % of its general fund . "
State lawmakers returned to the Capitol on Monday evening to continue budget negotiations .
Judd Gregg 's surprise decision to remove himself from the Commerce secretary pool gives the GOP a new rallying cry .
Gregg flip - flop emboldens GOP
Judd Gregg was all but dead to his Republican colleagues just a few days ago , another collaborator drinking the Obama Kool - Aid .
But the New Hampshire senator 's surprise decision to remove himself from consideration as President Barack Obama ’s commerce secretary Thursday has provided the GOP with a new rallying cry , and a new hero against a foe who just a few weeks ago seemed almost unassailable .
Advertisement
In a way , it ’s all a testament to just how far the Republican Party have fallen ; what passes for victory now is an embarrassing flip - flop by an admired GOP senator and the passage of a massive economic recovery bill that most Republicans on the Hill oppose bitterly .
When Obama ’s stimulus bill clears the House today , Republicans will celebrate by pointing to how much House Democrats did without them – and then hope against hope that voters do n’t notice if the economy improves as a result .
Republicans applauded boisterously when Rep. Mike Pence ( R - Ind. ) opened a closed - door meeting in the Capitol basement Thursday night by announcing Gregg ’s withdrawal .
" He made a difficult decision to turn down a job that a lot of Republicans could take , " said Rep. Jack Kingston ( R - Ga . ) .
" Here 's a guy who 's going to turn down his place in the history books . "
In pulling out , Gregg pointed to “ irresolvable conflicts ” on the two issues behind which the Republicans have been closing ranks — the stimulus package and the alleged politicization of the census .
“ We are functioning from a different set of views on many critical items of policy , ” he said in a statement issued by his Senate office .
By citing reservations about the economic recovery package , Gregg reinforced widespread GOP criticism about wasteful spending that has less to do with reviving the economy than rewarding Democratic constituencies .
And by noting his differing view on the census , Gregg breathed life into Republican charges of a White House power grab over a critical Commerce Department function .
Both issues are part of an emerging GOP case against Obama and the ruling Democratic Party : Strip away the new face , the lofty rhetoric and the promises of post - partisanship and you ’ll find the same big - spending party of old , bent on politicizing government to consolidate its hold on power .
Even with the stimulus package on the verge of passing later this week , the unanimous GOP vote against the bill in the House and the near - unanimous opposition in the Senate revealed a Republican Party surprisingly united in direction and in message for perhaps the first time since losing its congressional majority in 2006 .
The unity comes with huge risk , of course .
A Gallup Poll out this week showed the public supporting passage of the economic recovery plan by nearly a two - to - one margin .
By opposing it , the Republicans are making a long - term bet that the public will turn against the plan and those who pushed it – a bet , essentially , that the economy Obama inherited from a Republican president will continue to tank deep into the next election cycle .
It ’s a massive gamble , and one the party might not have taken if the last two elections had n’t all but purged it of its wayward moderates .
In its diminished but highly concentrated form , the GOP is showing signs it ’s regained its mojo , at least internally , and some see the withdrawal of Gregg – ironically , a moderate like the ones the party has been purging — as a pivotal moment in the building process .
" Sen . Gregg 's decision reinforces suspicions about the stimulus bill and about moving the census from the Commerce Department to the White House , " said House Minority Whip Eric Cantor ( R - Va . ) .
“ By turning down a position of great honor , Sen .
Gregg has made a bold statement for principle and responsibility today , ” Republican Study Committee Chairman Tom Price of Georgia said in a statement .
“ The president ’s politically charged move to place the nonpartisan census process in the hands of his staff contradicts every pledge of openness he made on the campaign trail .
While the White House continues to break promises for politics , I commend Sen .
Gregg for acting with integrity .
Sen .
Gregg has shown the American people the type of selfless leadership they should only hope to see from the White House . ”
Gregg ’s own explanation for his decision was less aggressive .
He said he expects “ there will be many issues and initiatives where I can and will work to assure the success of the president ’s proposals . ”
He took no departing shots at Obama , instead acknowledging in an interview with Politico that he “ should have faced up ” to the conflicts he felt earlier .
“ The fault lies with me , ” Gregg said .
“ I may have embarrassed myself , but hopefully not him . ”
Nevertheless , for a Republican Party desperately careening from message to message , from “ drill , baby , drill ” to “ the future is Cao , ” Gregg ’s move has rallied the troops and provided them with a set of organizing principles around which to begin rebuilding their tattered brand — or at least to sully Obama ’s sterling brand .
The withdrawal was Obama ’s third failed nomination in less than two weeks , an unexpected state of affairs for a president whose campaign was known for its discipline , flawless execution and ability to see around corners .
All in all , Gregg 's decision in hardly the material to build a majority around , but given the GOP ’s free - fall in recent years , even a minor victory has the feel of a major triumph .
" When your opponent trips and falls on his face , it certainly emboldens the opponent , " added Rep. Patrick McHenry ( R - N.C. ) .
" This has been blunder after blunder .
As an administration , they are far from immune to tough days , weeks and months .
" It certainly emboldens us , " McHenry said .

Feb. 11 , 2009  --
The public relations firm representing Nadya Suleman , mother of the famous California octuplets , launched a Web site that allows visitors to donate to the family .
" The response has been excellent , " Mike Furtney , a spokesman for the family , told ABC News .
According to Furtney , " hundreds " of people have generously responded .
" Actually , a farmer in the Midwest said , ' They can live with us , ' " Furtney said .
" There have been many similar spots . "
Others , he said , have been " very direct and vocal " with criticism .
" We understand that people will not agree with us ... [ but ] this is a nation known for its charitable behavior , generosity and tolerance .
We hope people that share that thought will work with us to help Nadya and the children . "
Would you donate to the Suleman family ?
Click here to cast your vote .
The Web site , called the Nadya Suleman Family Web site , lists the pictures , names and weights of all eight newborns and allows supporters to donate money directly online or send items to a Los Angeles address provided by Suleman 's public relations representative , the Killeen Furtney Group .
" We thank you from the bottom of our hearts , " reads a note on the Web site from " Nadya Suleman and children . "
" [ The babies ] are all healthy and growing stronger by the day . "
The Web site 's launch comes after reports emerged concerning the staggering financial burden the octuplets ' family may lay on the state of California , including a possible $ 1 million hospital bill .
Suleman 's octuplets , born Jan. 26 , are expected to stay in the hospital for several weeks under close watch before being released .
The bill is the latest facet of the growing controversy surrounding the octuplets ' birth that also includes accusations by the octuplets ' grandfather that their mother falsified birth certificates by listing a fake name , David Solomon , as the kids ' father .
Falsifying birth certificates is a felony , punishable by a maximum of three years in jail .
Like the Babies , Costs Multiply
Premature babies cost an average of 15 times more that full - term babies in their first year of life , generally accruing more than $ 40,000 in bills for extended hospital stays , more outpatient visits and generally more medical needs , according to a 2005 report by the March of Dimes .
March of Dimes medical director Dr. Alan Fleischman expects Suleman 's record - breaking eight babies , who were born nine weeks premature , to ring up a hospital medical bill " somewhere between $ 700,000 and $ 1 million . "
It 's a bill that could fall on the state of California , which is $ 42 billion in debt .
Suleman 's octuplets qualify for Medi-Cal , the state 's health - care program for the poor , meaning the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Bellflower , where the octuplets are staying , can request reimbursement for treatment .
According to the Los Angeles Times , they 've done just that .
" With our economy the way it is , with California going to hell in a handbasket , why should I be excited about this ? " one of Suleman 's neighbors , an 87 - year - old woman , told " Good Morning America " a few days after the babies ' birth .
Under Medi-Cal , Kaiser Permanente could already be eligible for around $ 150,000 , conservatively , for the babies ' stay so far , not including delivery that included 46 staff members and four delivery rooms , the Times reported .
If they stay for 12 weeks , which is a possibility , that number is likely to climb north of $ 800,000 .
Coming Home Costs Octuplet Family Too , in Money and Attention
Suleman , who was already a single mother of six before her octuplets were born , is also eligible for federal assistance of more than $ 1,900 per month because three of her six children are disabled .
Despite the mounting price tags , Suleman said on the " Today Show " that she is " providing for [ her ] children . "
" I 'm responsible .
I am not on welfare , " she said , although she told NBC's " Today Show " this week that she has been receiving $ 490 in food stamps every month .
" I feel it is my responsibility to do what I can to provide for my children . "
Furtney told ABC
News today that Suleman plans to begin some kind of " business or enterprise that will allow her to get what she needs without needing to rely on state or federal funding . "
Dr. Charles Sophy , the medical director of Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services , cautioned that giving birth to octuplets would put eight times as much stress on a single mother and pose a daunting task in terms of rearing .
" It costs money to raise children , " he said .
" To raise these kids is probably going to cost about $ 2.5 million , just to give them basics .
That is not baseball lessons or piano lessons .
That is food , clothing or getting to school every day ; that is a lot of money . "
The Department of Children and Family Services worries that , in a house of 14 , there will be a lack of attention or that the children will be at higher risk of abuse or neglect .
Some critics , such as Fox News ' Bill O'Reilly , are calling on social services to investigate the family now for the sake of the children .
" The L.A. County Department of Children and Family Services can investigate if a complaint is made , if there is neglect , if there is child endangerment , if there is cause , " family rights activist and attorney Gloria Allred told " Good Morning America . "
" We do n't have any facts to support that right now and the octuplets are still in the hospital .
We do n't know what 's going to happen when they come home .
Are they going to come home to that three - bedroom home that the other six are living in ? "
The octuplets ' grandmother Angela Suleman told Radaronline.com that her daughter has " no means to support " her 14 children and that she never contributed rent or food money .
She also never told her mother about the more than $ 167,000 records show she received in disability payments after she was injured in 1999 .
Ironically , the mounting controversy over Suleman 's ability to support her large family may provide the much - needed capital .
" Has she sold photos , interviews ?
Has she sold film of the babies ? "
Allred asked , alluding to the significant monetary value that media attention can bring to such items .
" Are there going to be donations ?
We just do n't know what 's going to happen , but I think everyone in the public , I know I am , is very concerned about the safety , the welfare , the health , the conditions of the children and how their needs are going to be met . "
President Obama is tired of the old ideas , the Washington that existed for the last eight years when we suffered under policies that did n't work .
He insists that we need a new , bold kind of politics — his stimulus package is the first expression of this kind of approach .
But directing a large portion of GDP toward projects that were haphazardly assembled in Congress is n't change at all .
It 's more of what Mr. Obama calls " The failed policies of the past . "
To be sure , the past several years have n't seen America at its best .
Just like the bubble that led to the recession in 2001 , Wall Street has funneled money toward an area of the economy that was n't worth what everyone thought .
Main Street was at fault too .
Home flippers and even average folks who thought they'd be able to turn a profit on their homes after the prices rose even more , took loans they could n't afford and bet on a market that could n't sustain itself .
Those are just the actions of the past , not the policies .
Mr. Obama is focused on what he can change — the policies made in Washington .
Those policies are , indeed , in dire need of change .
The last eight years have seen the national debt double — you , me and every man , woman , and child in America are responsible for about $ 35,000 of the over $ 10 trillion the US owes to its creditors .
We 've also seen Washington throwing fuel on the fire , pushing policies that were supposed to promote the " American Dream " of home ownership , which is now the cause of our national nightmare .
So what has Mr. Obama proposed as his bold , new solution to this problem ?
Nothing bold or new at all .
Mr. Obama seeks to spend more , misallocate another trillion dollars and take the economy down more dead ends , and deepen our already deep recession .
The bold initiatives we need are n't even being talked about in Washington , because they 're politically unpopular , they challenge the status - quo , and they threaten the power of those entrenched in the Washington machine .
The policies that would prevent us from channeling resources down the dead ends that lead to recessions — tax code simplification , tax cuts , and overhauling the regulatory system — would be a real change .
But bold leadership would be required for huge policy reforms like these to occur .
Watching Mr. Obama now extolling the virtues of his " debt to end all debts " in Elkhart , Indiana , I do n't see the kind of leadership we need .
Instead , I see politics as usual .
ATLANTA  Travis
Henry was rattling off his children ’s ages , which range from 3 to 11 .
He paused and took a breath before finishing .
This was no simple task .
Henry , 30 , a former N.F.L. running back who played for three teams from 2001 to 2007 , has nine children  each by a different mother , some born as closely as a few months apart .
Reports of Henry ’s prolific procreating , generated by child - support disputes , have highlighted how futile the N.F.L. ’s attempts can be at educating its players about making wise choices .
The disputes have even eclipsed the attention he received after he was indicted on charges of cocaine trafficking .
“ They ’ve got my blood ; I ’ve got to deal with it , ” Henry said of fiscal responsibilities to his children .
He spoke by telephone from his Denver residence , where he was under house arrest until recently for the drug matter .
A public emergency is the ultimate example of multitasking .
It can require crowd control , medical aid , evacuation and emergency response all at once under trying conditions .
Managers who direct emergency operations centers ( EOCs ) have few technological tools to help them with these complicated , critical tasks , but the Renaissance Computing Institute ( RENCI ) hopes to change that .
“ Next to communications , situational awareness is the single most important aspect of emergency response , ” says Ken Galluppi , manager of RENCI ’s emergency management research projects .
“ Technologies that provide situational awareness — the ability to ‘ see ’ a whole staging area and know where you ’re people are , for example — can have a huge impact in saving lives and restoring safe conditions . ”
RENCI Senior Research Data Software Developer Jeff Heard developed the “ Big Board ” as a prototype Web - based , visual tool to provide situational awareness for EOCs .
The Big Board ( a reference to the War Room display in the film Dr. Strangelove ) starts with a high - resolution aerial map of a location , developed from photos and other data that every North Carolina county routinely updates .
With any Web - connected desktop of laptop computer , an emergency manager can access the Big Board and simply click to create a virtual conference room related to a specific map .
The virtual conference room allows users to select locations on the map and type in relevant notes .
The notes are augmented with existing data about hazards and resources , and often , with real - time field data such as photos or video .
Creating a virtual conference room
For example , if the city of Raleigh was preparing for a major outdoor concert , planners could create a conference room and annotate important locations .
The first aid tent might be annotated with contact information for the paramedic teams on duty and on call , annotations relevant to security headquarters might contain important phone numbers , details about the numbers of officers on duty , links to information about private security firms hired , and more .
Annotations at major intersections could include street views from web cameras to provide real - time information on traffic congestion .
By returning to the virtual conference room when the event starts , the event managers have a real - time tool that provides situational awareness and the ability to obtain in - depth information by viewing or reading the embedded notes .
Workers in the field equipped with GPS and Web - enabled cell phones are able to add new annotations as the event unfolds and their locations are automatically tracked on the map .
Because the Big Board is Web based , these same workers can view it in the field from a laptop or cell phone .
Equipped with real - time images of traffic , the event managers can run traffic routing algorithms and display the resulting change in traffic patterns before actually rerouting traffic .
But what if something goes wrong at our hypothetical outdoor concert ?
What if a tanker truck crashes near the entry to the venue , causing a dangerous chemical leak and the need to evacuate a large and possibly unruly crowd ?
“ You can use the Big Board to plan in advance , but it becomes even more useful if something unexpected happens , ” says Heard .
“ If you already have annotations with important contacts and other information , you have an advantage in an emergency .
The goal is situational awareness , and because this system is a visual display with geographic reference points , a complex , dynamic situation become understandable . ”
A RENCI server stores all the data from the Big Board ’s annotations , allowing emergency managers to later re-enter a virtual conference room and evaluate an event and the response .
So far , RENCI has tested the software with aerial maps from Wake and Orange counties and expects to soon have maps of Mecklenburg County and the I - 85 corridor between Greensboro and Charlotte .
Galluppi and Ray Idaszak , RENCI ’s director of visualization and collaborative environments , introduced the Big Board at a March 9 presentation during the North Carolina Emergency Management Association ( NCEMA ) meeting in Sunset Beach .
The tool also will be used in a NCEMA practice exercise in late March .
JACKSONVILLE , Fla . --
Running back Fred Taylor wanted to end his career in Jacksonville , hoping to join the small list of standout players who spent an entire career with the same team .
He wo n't get the chance .
The Jaguars released Taylor on Monday , parting ways with their all - time leading rusher after 11 seasons and continuing the team 's offseason makeover .
Coach Jack Del Rio flew to Fort Lauderdale earlier Monday to meet with Taylor and deliver the news .
Del Rio made it clear the team has no plans to re-sign Taylor , who turned 33 last month and was scheduled to make $ 6 million next season .
" We felt like the best thing for this football team is what it has to be about , " Del Rio said .
" We feel good about the talented group of backs that we have ... and as you work through it , it 's difficult to come up with a role that 's going to be acceptable for everybody .
" It makes it awkward .
It makes it difficult .
We came to an agreement on what the best course of action was as a football team . "
And that was to move on without Taylor , who ranks 16th on the NFL's career rushing list with 11,271 yards , 81 behind John Riggins .
Frank Gehry , who turned 80 on Saturday , is the most famous architect in the world by a healthy margin .
He is also , arguably , the most significant talent in American architecture since Frank Lloyd Wright .
His firm , Gehry Partners , has streamlined a process in which his free - flowing sketches are turned into digital designs and then into dazzlingly unorthodox buildings around the world .
The success of Walt Disney Concert Hall , an acoustical and architectural triumph , has solidified his sometimes rocky relationship with Los Angeles , where he arrived with his family from Toronto in 1947 as a teenager .
He has become a surprising pop-culture icon , designing a jewelry line for Tiffany and starring in a documentary by the late Sydney Pollack and in cartoon form in an episode of “ The Simpsons . ”
He remains engaged in a range of new work , designing a huge branch of the Guggenheim Museum for a waterfront site in Abu Dhabi and fine - tuning a proposal that is among four finalists for the Dwight Eisenhower memorial in Washington , D.C .
And yet if Gehry now stands atop a mountain he spent much of his career trying to ascend -- driven by a fierce ambition he has often tried to conceal beneath what he calls an aw - shucks persona -- he does so at a moment when the mountain itself is beginning to crumble beneath his feet .
After a decade in which a handful of leading architects became global stars -- with Gehry leading the charge -- and private and government clients alike were willing to finance jaw - dropping feats of architectural innovation , funding for new construction has suddenly vanished , as if overnight .
Most distressing of all for Gehry , two projects that he saw as capstones to his career , gigantic mixed - use developments on L.A. 's Grand Avenue and at Brooklyn ’s Atlantic Yards , have both been put on hold .
“ I ’ve had a disappointing year , couple of years , with Grand Avenue and Brooklyn , ” he said in a wide - ranging conversation in his office last week in which he was by turns ruminative , weary and hopeful .
“ All my life I ’ve wanted to do projects like that , and they never came to me .
And then all of a sudden I had two of them .
I invested the last five years in them , and they ’re both stopped .
So it leaves a very hollow feeling in your bones . ”
In response to the global slowdown , Gehry , like many of his peers , has been forced to radically cut his staff , which he said is now half the size it was just a year ago .
In a broader sense , the virtuosic approach to design that Gehry has embodied since his Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao , Spain , opened to rapturous acclaim in 1997 faces an increasingly pointed critique within his profession .
For young architects , the way Gehry has organized his office and integrated new technology remains an inspiration .
But for some of them , his recent work also represents the excesses of a decade that combined easy money and architectural celebrity .
They are less interested in the bravura , photogenic icons that Gehry has lately produced -- so - called signature buildings by a so - called starchitect -- and more compelled by eco-friendly designs or anti-poverty efforts such as those aimed at providing affordable housing in rural areas .
Other young architects are looking beyond the star model of architectural practice and toward communal , even anonymous , design initiatives .
Much of that shift is unsurprising , even predictable : a generational changing of the guard .
But the extent of Gehry ’s global prominence over the last decade and the speed with which the credit crunch has choked off building plans are both unique in the history of architecture .
For a while , it seemed Gehry could hardly hire new staff quickly enough , and the building models in his studio -- this one slated for Panama , that one for Princeton -- were almost literally piled atop one another .
The office now seems quiet .
And Gehry is clearly stung by the charge that his most mammoth projects -- the Brooklyn development , in particular , which was originally planned to include as many as 16 towers -- have been vehicles for self - aggrandizement forced on unwilling communities .
After all , he has long painted himself as a lonely talent pushed to the periphery of the profession in the early decades of his career by myopic developers and less - principled colleagues .
In his mind , he does n’t run roughshod over the little guy , as he has been accused of doing by neighborhood activists in Brooklyn .
He is the little guy .
Given recent setbacks , he said , he is glad he accepted the commission in Abu Dhabi .
His sprawling new Guggenheim , which he insists remains on track , is one anchor of a proposed cultural district called Saadiyat Island that would jut dramatically into the Persian Gulf .
He is clearly thrilled to be working again with Thomas Krens , the former Guggenheim Museum director now spearheading the Abu Dhabi development .
“ I was reluctant at first to do it , ” Gehry said .
“ I thought , ‘ I do n’t want to go there now .
It ’s too far , it ’s a new culture , I ’m too old to get into it . ’
And Krens prevailed and got me to go .
And you know , if I had n’t taken that job , the office would be a lot smaller today .
It may very well help me get through this downturn . ”
At 80 , Gehry remains a hungry consumer of new ideas and images and remains noticeably sensitive to perceived slights -- retaining the chip on his shoulder that has long provided him with a competitive edge over more sanguine peers .
Though he said he makes an effort not to spend too much time dwelling on the past or thinking about how his partners might get along without him , he has n’t been able to banish such notions altogether .
He acknowledges that he worries about what will become of his office without him and that he is actively considering various options for the future shape of Gehry Partners .
“ I try not to look back , ” he said .
“ There ’s not much use in that .
But when you get to my age , you get anxiety about succession . ”
In certain ways , Gehry is better positioned than most of his famous globe - trotting colleagues to handle the economic crisis and the lower budgets and smaller staffs that come with it .
He sheathed his early houses and commercial projects , after all , with provocatively cheap materials .
Riffing on the messy , vital work of Robert Rauschenberg and other artists , he built his reputation one section of chain link and one sheet of corrugated metal or cardboard at a time .
In 1978 , Gehry recalled , he decided to walk away amicably from his biggest client , the Rouse Co. , and in an effort to start fresh slashed his staff from roughly 50 architects to three .
“ I ’m prepared to do that again , if I have to , ” he said .
“ Today , if there ’s frugality , I ’m ready .
I ’ll do corrugated again .
It ’s fun to work that way , and it ’s easy .
Why spend all the money for fancy details and stuff ?
You do n’t need it .
You can get the passion with simpler things . ”
Still , the size of the firm over the last several years was no accident :
Gehry wanted the office to be a behemoth with global reach , and he drove it toward that goal .
In other ways too , Gehry is making concessions to the current moment and to his age .
He said he has abandoned plans to build a house for himself and his family on three contiguous lots in Venice , despite having worked on the design of the compound intermittently but intensely over several years .
Instead , he said , he is going to divide up the parcels -- giving one to his son Sam , who has been working in the Gehry Partners office , and one each to a pair of young architects in the firm , Meaghan Lloyd , currently his chief of staff , and Anand Devarajan .
He and his wife , Berta , will stay , he said , in the modest bungalow on 22nd Street in Santa Monica that he famously and radically reworked in the late 1970s -- just about the time , not coincidentally , that he was cutting ties with Rouse and making an effort to begin his career anew .
It is dawning on him , he said , that he is unlikely to realize a long - standing dream of moving to Paris .
“ I love going to Paris , and I keep fantasizing that I ’ll move there for the last years of my life .
But I do n’t know if I can do it .
I think I ’m stuck here , on 22nd Street in Santa Monica . ”
Wherever he winds up , his legacy appears secure -- particularly as it relates to Los Angeles .
Great architects preceded him here , of course , including Charles and Henry Greene , Richard Neutra , Rudolf Schindler and others .
But if those architects , with strong links to styles pioneered elsewhere , brought the world to Los Angeles , Gehry has done the opposite .
By designing projects on several continents rooted in the loose , informal aesthetic of his adopted hometown , he has delivered Los Angeles to the world .

Victor Anichebe was said to be deeply upset by the incident Premier League striker Victor Anichebe was challenged by police looking for a gang of robbers , as he looked in a jeweller 's window with a friend .
The innocent Everton player , who was wearing a leg cast after surgery , is now demanding an apology .
Cheshire police said they acted because there had been a series of violent robberies in the area .
During a " heated dialogue " between the two men and officers in Knutsford , Anichebe 's friend was handcuffed .
Everton FC spokesman Ian Ross said : " Victor was deeply upset and very distressed by the incident .
" I believe he is still waiting for a full and unreserved apology from the police involved .
" Once he has received that both the club and the player will consider the matter closed . "
' Acting suspiciously ' A Cheshire Police spokesman said : " For some time Cheshire Constabulary have been responding to a series of violent robberies targeting jewellers in Knutsford and in the wider Cheshire area .
During the course of this exchange , an officer took the decision to restrain one of the two men concerned by applying handcuffs
Spokesman , Cheshire Police
" We have robust plans in place to respond swiftly to any report of any suspicious activity at or in the vicinity of jewellers ' premises .
" As part of that plan , local CCTV operators identified what appeared to be two men acting suspiciously outside a jeweller 's store on King Street .
" Police attended the location within minutes and upon speaking with the two men , a heated dialogue developed in an attempt to ascertain exactly what the two persons were doing outside the jeweller 's premises .
" During the course of this exchange , an officer took the decision to restrain one of the two men concerned by applying handcuffs .
" It was subsequently ascertained that there was no criminal conduct whatsoever on behalf of the two men concerned and they were in no way involved in any criminal activity . "

In the context of a discussion about why one low - skilled worker 's salary is no longer enough to support a family , MC writes :
Look , there have always been people who could command a wage that could support a family , and people who could not .
In the old days , the people who could not were called women .
And various other names related to skin color that I will not include here .
That whole notion of earning a family wage with no specialized education or skills only applied to a subset of the population , and the organizations protecting their interests worked to keep it that way .
Nowadays , white men have no special protections .
If they want to buy a house and raise a family , they need to learn a trade better than Walmart clerk .
And they may need to move away from depressed rural economies .
The gain is that a lot of people who never had a shot at the good jobs in the past do have that shot now .
White men are competing with everyone now , and they can't coast .
They are even competing with the entire populations of China and India .
Terrifying thought , but you can't get around it .
The 50s were fake , so we can't really use them as our baseline .
And even that fake only applied to some people .
It 's also worth remembering that companies were not only legally allowed , but expected , to pay married men more that anyone else , and that ordinary people lived much , much more modestly than they do now .
Many workers lived with other family members , or in rooming houses -- the houses in television and movies from the era are , just as now , abnormally large because average - sized houses would be too small to film .
In the popular mind , every blue collar worker in 1950 was pulling down a hefty wage at GM , but union membership peaked at about a third of workers , and most of those jobs were at companies that did n't have the profits , or the freedom from competition , to support those kinds of wages .
A lot more blue collar workers were people like the mechanics and pump operators at my grandfather 's gas station , who raised families on . . . the kind of money you could generate working at a gas station .
Our memories are distorted by two things : first , the tendency of all cultures to focus on their own outliers ( many fewer people work for silicon valley startups in real life than in either our entertainment , or the popular imagination ) , and second , the fact that the people who have written about the period are abnormally likely to have come from successful families who pushed them through an education .
Their memory of a well - appointed blue - collar childhood in a nice suburb on Dad 's generous steelworker wages endures ; few memories of a straggling blue - collar childhood as the child of a factory janitor do , because those kids were less likely to go to college and become people of letters .
The successful and educated are disproportionately likely to be represented in all parts of our written and spoken culture , from man on the street interviews to letters to the editor .
History really is written by the winners .

Dell Mini 12 W/ Ubuntu -- Question From Ron Swift
I 'm not sure what happened but this message was caught as a bounce from the mailing list .
I just saw it and am forwarding it intact .
It was originally sent by Ron Swift ----------
Forwarded message ---------- From : Ron Swift < rswift at swiftstaffing.com >
To : ubuntu-us - md - bounces at lists.ubuntu.com Date : Fri , 27 Mar 2009 15:51:14 - 0400 Subject : Dell Mini 12 w / Ubuntu I purchased a Dell Mini 12 with Vista from Dell 's outlet site .
I called Dell and asked for their Ubuntu iso that they load on these units and was told that they would not provide it .
They suggested that I download the latest ubuntu distro and install it .
They also caution that if I did that I would void my warranty since the machine was pre-installed with Vista .
After searching the Internet and seeing lots of posts where persons have experienced problems installing 8.04 , 8.10 and 9.04 alpha versions .
The suggested solution however was rather simple and it was to install Ubuntu remix 8.04 .
Everything worked , wireless , bluetooth , camera and touch - pad with no configuration .
Video worked but it was suggested to upgrade Xorg driver with the ubuntu - mobile PPA package to get full resolution 2D display .
Compix is not supported on this machine .
Also , this system was extremely slow with the remix interface so I switched to the traditional gnome interface and it now runs great .
I thought that I would share my experience so that others could benefit .

Celebrating 20 Years in Business !
I am coming out in favor of nationalization in the United States .
The efforts to fix the banking system to date have failed .
As a result , America is still threatened by the menace of systemic risk .
In my view , this risk can only be diminished significantly by ‘ pre- privatizing ’ large , bankrupt institutions .
I am talking about temporary nationalization of a few institutions rather than a wholesale longer - term government ownership of the banking sector .
I will often use the word ‘ pre- privatization ’ because the word nationalization conjures up a Hugo Chavez - style asset confiscation which I believe is not accurate and clouds the picture .
Through the pre-privatization of large institutions which are effectively insolvent , trust will be restored , asset prices will find a natural equilibrium level and prudent lending can commence once again .
By resisting pre-privatization in any and all forms , the Obama Administration is setting itself up for failure .
In that scenario , President Obama might end up looking a lot more like Herbert Hoover than Franklin Roosevelt in American history books .
A few days ago , I issued a poll here on this site asking readers what they felt about nationalization .
A plurality came out for my favored choice that nationalization is definitely a good option because “ some banks are effectively insolvent . ”
Illiquidity of insolvency ?
As we debate this issue , it is critical that we ask a few questions first because the answers will be determinative of the right approach to take .
The first such question is the question of illiquidity and insolvency .
This is a topic I first broached last September , in a post called “ Solvency ” immediately before the Lehman bankruptcy .
And how you answer it changes your view on everything else regarding the pre-privatization issue .
If one believes that financial services firms merely need to work through a period of abnormally low market liquidity , then nationalization is akin to asset confiscation .
However , if one believes , as I do , that we are seeing a return to normal market pricing which reveals the insolvency of many institutions , then one should believe nationalization is critical to addressing the problem .
My basic point was that ‘ solvency ’ is almost never an issue for a firm going into administration .
It is almost always liquidity drying up that forces an organization into Chapter 11 .
Lenders pull credit lines , investors stop buying the organization ’s bonds , counterparties call in loans .
In the case of financial institutions then , there will always be a question as to whether the institution is truly ‘ insolvent ’ or merely ‘ illiquid . ’
This is more so the case in a credit crisis because asset prices are falling , thus reducing capital and triggering a pullback in liquidity .
If the liquidity were there , would the institution eventually fail because of asset writedowns ?
Or would it be a survivor ?
This was the central question with Northern Rock , the first bank to be nationalized in this crisis in 2007 .
Northern Rock is a very good example of the basic question here : would their imprudent lending have bankrupted them due to loan charge - offs and asset writedowns or were they a victim of illiquidity .
I believe Northern Rock was an insolvent company as was Wachovia , Washington Mutual and other institutions that have since disappeared .
My view is that asset price declines have reflected a reversion to the mean and a return to realistic valuation levels .
( I also anticipate that the decline in asset prices will eventually overshoot to the downside . )
Thus , these institutions were carrying assets on their books at inflated values , that –when marked down to values that reflected median levels of house prices - to - rent , house prices - to - income , rolling 10 - yr. house price appreciation , real price - per-sq .
ft. , Debt - to - EBITDA
or whatever realistic metric you use — would later reveal a catastrophic shortfall in capital — otherwise known as insolvency .
How does one deal with illiquidity ?
But , for the sake of arguments , assume we are talking about illiquidity .
How do you deal with this ?
U.S. government officials have decided that one way is for the government to step in as lender of last resort .
This is one reason you have seen the Federal Reserve becoming active in many asset markets .
The problem here has been that asset prices have continued to fall and markets have remained illiquid , requiring more government interference .
At this point , one must wonder whether illiquidity is the problem .
The markets are sending a signal that it is not .
On the other hand , capital injections are not a good way to solve questions of illiquidity .
The need to top up an institution ’s capital base is an a priori sign that the institution is insolvent .
How does one deal with insolvency ?
To my mind , there are three ways to deal with an insolvent financial institution :
Bankruptcy .
Allow the institution to collapse ( like Lehman Brothers )
.
Allow the institution to collapse ( like Lehman Brothers ) Nationalization .
Seize the assets of that institution and nationalize it ( like Northern Rock , AIG , or Fannie Mae )
.
Seize the assets of that institution and nationalize it ( like Northern Rock , AIG , or Fannie Mae ) Bailout .
Inject capital into the institution in order to allow it breathing room until it can meet capital adequacy levels .
As you can see , governments have tried all three solutions .
However , there are vast differences between the three .
The bailout solution is the most ‘ anti - free market ’ choice and seems to be the favored solution of governments everywhere .
It props up organizations , giving them an unfair advantage at the expense of other more prudent institutions .
It also acts as a subsidy , which favors domestic institutions over foreign rivals .
Bailouts increase moral hazard by rewarding risky and reckless lending practices .
And they are often the result of crony capitalism due to the power of the financial services lobby .
There are many other problems with bailouts .
All around , bailouts are a poor solution .
Then comes bankruptcy .
I like this solution in general .
This is the most hands - off approach and the ultimate free - market approach .
However , it is one tried with Lehman Brothers to disastrous consequences .
Unfortunately , bankruptcy of large organizations increases systemic risk .
And , as we saw when Lehman Brothers failed , systemic risk is quite acute at present .
Bank of America and Citigroup should not be allowed to fail .
If we had the time , one might be tempted to break larger financial institutions up into smaller organizations and allow these smaller units to fail .
But , this is not a realistic proposal given the speed with which this crisis is moving .
Therefore , we are left with one alternative : Pre-Privatization .
Pre-Privatization
Rather than debate the merits of nationalization , I am going to dismiss that term out of hand .
No one is talking about a longer - term government ownership of all or part of the financial sector .
What is needed is temporary recovery assistance on the way to banking health .
Think of the banks as potential cancer patients and the government as the hospital .
Some patients have no tumors or at least benign tumors .
These patients can be quickly evaluated for health and sent on their merry way .
Others have potentially malignant tumors .
These patients must undergo more significant evaluation and continued monitoring .
To the degree that the cancer is malignant , it must be excised .
Now , sometimes the cancer will have metastasized from subprime cancer to CDO to high yield bond to leveraged loan and all manner of cancerous , toxic stuff .
In this case , excising the cancer will not be enough , the patient needs more serious attention that can only be given through pre-privatization .
Mind you , this is intended as a temporary stay .
But , we have to assume some patients will not make it .
Perhaps , this is the mysterious process by which Geithner is going to proceed .
I doubt it .
Moreover , the ad hoc way decisions are being made regarding bankruptcy , bailout or pre-privatization is not going to attract much private capital to Geithner ’s plan because , quite frankly , one cannot be sure if the government is going to later seize a bank outright — confiscating any capital provided — or ‘ top up ’ capital again — diluting all private capital investment .
In the end , bailouts must cease .
They add uncertainty and a nefarious moral hazard into the picture that only reduces liquidity and increases systemic risk .
Bank failures , on the other hand , should be the preferred mechanism for dealing with non-systemic risk .
Small institutions are being seized by the FDIC every week .
Not only should this continue , but the FDIC should be given greater capital and more resources with which to continue doing so .
Ultimately , this crisis is about the large institutions like Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase or PNC Bank .
The systemic risk , the illiquidity and the fear have everything to do with these giant organizations .
Some of these larger institutions are effectively insolvent .
The government should pre-privatize those which are insolvent , thereby reducing systemic risk and uncertainty in the banking system and paving the way to a healthy banking sector and renewed lending in the future .
As a health writer , I ’ve read hundreds of nutrition studies and countless books on diet and eating .
And none of these has contained such useful advice as the cover of Michael Pollan ’s latest book , “ In Defense of Food . ”
Wrapped around a head of lettuce are seven words that tell you pretty much everything you need to know about healthful eating .
“ Eat food .
Not too much .
Mostly plants . ”
This seemingly - simple message is surprisingly complex , because there is food , and then there are what Mr. Pollan describes as “ edible food - like substances . ”
Mr. Pollan , who writes for The New York Times Magazine , developed something of a cult following for his best - selling book “ The Omnivore ’s Dilemma , ” which traced the food chain back to its original source .
But while “ Omnivore ” left many scared to eat , “ In Defense of Food ” helps the reader bravely navigate the food landscape , explaining what food is , what it is n’t and how to tell the difference .
Mr. Pollan agreed to take some time this week to answer a few questions from the Well blog .
Q .
In this book , you talk about “ nutritionism , ” the tendency of scientists and nutrition experts to view food as just a sum of its nutrient parts .
What ’s wrong with that thinking ?
A .
Two things go wrong with nutritionism .
Whatever tentative scientific information is developed , it gets very quickly distorted by the food marketers and manufacturers .
They will take partial information about antioxidants , and they are suddenly telling you if you eat almonds you are going to live forever .
There is a distortion of what are hypotheses of science .
We ’re guilty of this too .
We take sketchy science , and we write headlines .
One of the things that surprised me is how poor the data is that is underlying many of these big dietary trials .
If you try to fill out a food frequency questionnaire , you realize very quickly this is not good data .
I was as honest as I could be and tried to remember what I ’d eaten , and it claimed I was only eating 1,200 calories a day .
Clearly , I was forgetting at least 1,000 calories .
We know people underreport by about 30 percent .
We do n’t know the first thing about nutrition , which is , “ What are people actually eating ? ”
It ’s hard to build good science on top of that .
Q .
Did you expect the phrase , “ Eat food .
Not too much .
Mostly plants . ” to create such a stir ?
A .
I was kind of surprised .
After the original article in The Times magazine used those words , I started hearing it then .
I realized they had a certain power .
That ’s why I encouraged the publisher to put them on the cover and give it all away there .
Q .
But it ’s not as simple as it sounds , is it ?
A .
It ’s not , because of all these edible food - like substances in the stores that are masquerading as food .
It ’s simple advice as long as you know what food is , but I spend 14 pages trying to define what food is .
It ’s gotten complicated because of food science and the kind of engineering that ’s gone into processing food .
Q .
Speaking of engineering , food from cloned animals appears headed for approval in Europe and the United States .
Does cloned food qualify as real food ?
A .
I think the bigger concern with cloned animals is not personal health .
It ’s what will it take to keep a herd of genetically identical chickens , horses or pigs alive ?
Sex and variation is what keeps us from getting wiped out by microbes .
If everything is genetically identical , one disease can come along and wipe out the entire group .
You will need so many antibiotics and so much sanitation to keep a herd of these creatures going .
The bigger concern should be antibiotic resistance .
Q .
The nutrition community is fascinated by the French paradox — the fact that the French eat seemingly fattening food but do n’t get fat .
In your book you describe an American paradox .
What is it ?
A .
Americans are a people so obsessed with nutrition yet whose dietary health is so poor .
That strikes me as a paradox .
We worry more about nutritional health , and we see food in terms of health .
Yet we ’re the world champs in terms of obesity , diabetes , heart disease and the cancers linked to diet .
I think it ’s odd .
It suggests that worrying about your dietary health is not necessarily good for your dietary health .
Q .
So how should we think about food and health ?
A .
I think health should be a byproduct of eating well , for reasons that have nothing to do with health , such as cooking meals , eating together and eating real food .
You ’re going to be healthy , but that ’s not the goal .
The goal should just be eating well for pleasure , for community , and all the other reasons people eat .
What I ’m trying to do is to bring a man - from - Mars view to the American way of thinking about food .
This is so second nature to us — food is either advancing your health or ruining your health .
That ’s a very limited way to think about food , and it ’s a very limited way to think about health .
The health of our bodies is tied to the health of the community and the health of the earth .
Health is indivisible .
That ’s my covert message .
Q .
A reader commented recently that this sounded like a diet book .
Is it ?
A .
There is no Michael Pollan diet .
It ’s an algorithm to help you make decisions rather than telling you narrowly : “ Eat butter .
Do n’t eat margarine . ”
Although you could probably deduce that from what I ’m saying .
I do n’t feel like it ’s our job to tell people what to eat .
I think our job is to help people think about it .
I ’m trying to take down the cult of expert eating .
The danger is that I then offer myself as an expert .
I ’m trying to channel the wisdom of culture about eating .
My idea here is that science so far has n’t figured out nutrition well enough to be the arbiter of our food choices .
When science has done that — take the public health campaign around fat , that has been the biggest test case — it did n’t work out very well .
If science ca n’t guide us yet , who can ?
The answer is not me .
The answer is culture , history and tradition .
That ’s what my rules are all about .
The book is trying to show why this nutritionism approach to food does n’t work very well , besides the fact that it ruins our pleasure in eating .
Q .
What do you eat ?
A .
I eat lots of food .
What do you mean ?
Q .
Does your food ever come out of a package ?
A .
Really seldom .
If you look in my pantry , you wo n’t find that much processed stuff .
Maybe some canned soups and tuna fish .
I do n’t have a lot of low - fat products .
I much prefer to eat less of a full - fat product .
You wont ’ find skim milk .
We ’re lucky .
I live in Berkeley with a farmers ’ market four blocks away , and it ’s open 50 weeks a year .
I have the luxury of being able to buy very fresh , good food .
I have a weakness for bread .
A good white baguette — I have a weakness for that .
Q .
After reading your book , I want to plant and grow something .
Do you get this a lot ?
A .
My first book was about gardening , and I like gardening .
It ’s a really important part of the solution .
In so many places , including urban areas , there is a yard , there is a lawn , a little patch of land where you could grow food .
My garden is only 10 by 20 feet .
It ’s a postage stamp .
I grew so much food there last summer .
What food is more local than the food you grow yourself , not to mention the fact that you get all this exercise while you ’re gardening .
Q .
How does one stop eating edible food - like substances and switch to eating real food ?
Is n’t it difficult to change ?
A .
We have more choices now than we ’ve ever had .
There is organic food at Wal - Mart .
The big challenge is that you do have to cook .
A lot of us are intimidated by cooking today .
We watch cooking shows on TV but we cook very little .
We ’re turning cooking into a spectator sport .
This process of outsourcing our food preparation to large corporations , which is what we ’ve been doing the last 50 years , is a big part of our problem .
We ’re seduced by convenience .
You ’re going to have to put a little more time and effort into preparing your food .
I ’m trying to get across how pleasurable that can be .
It need n’t be a chore .
It can be incredibly rewarding to move food closer to the center of your life .
Analysis
A new ad campaign by the Metropolitan Police warns the public to be on the alert for strangers who look at them in a funny way , and to check the contents of their neighbours ’ bins .
Suggestions that the campaign may be a tad alarmist have been dismissed , the police arguing they are only doing what is necessary to protect the public in dangerous times .
Meanwhile , lawyers already concerned by what they see as police overreaction and exaggeration of threat have warned that this campaign may represent a much more sinister attempt to extend police powers into places where Parliament has hitherto been unwilling to allow them .
First the campaign .
About a week ago , a reader alerted us to a Met campaign warning Londoners to be on the lookout for suspicious people and circumstances : chemical containers left lying in a wheelie bin , or people staring " suspiciously " at CCTV cameras .
This is in line with the overall Met message of " If you suspect it , report it " , which urges Londoners to trust their instincts and to report any activity they believe suspicious , and posters such as the anti-photography one , which suggests that people taking photos may be suspicious .
The official police line is that this is no more than sensible precaution .
A spokeswoman for the Met said : " Acts of terrorism involve planning stages . "
She went on to explain that the Met are merely " giving examples of suspicious activity which could be linked to terrorism that people should look out for " .
She also cited instances in which behaviour of the sort warned against formed part of the case against individuals later convicted of terrorist offences .
Following Operation Rhyme , Dhiren Barot was sentenced to 30 years ’ jail in 2006 for conspiracy to murder : he had previously filmed security measures - including CCTV - in various US cities .
In the UK , 2008 's Operation Vivace led to the jailing for 40 years of Muktar Said Ibrahim and a number of co-defendants : they had used hydrogen peroxide in bombs which were detonated on the London transport network two weeks after the 7/7 bombings .
Hundreds of litres of hydrogen peroxide were purchased by the defendants , and bottles were recovered from Ibrahim ’s flat and the bin area at the flats after they were spotted by a caretaker .
One problem with this debate is that it has consequences well beyond the psychological : because in law , police powers depend directly on the reasonableness – or otherwise – of the suspicions they have in specific situations .
Under s1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 , a police officer may stop an individual to look for stolen or prohibited items where he has reasonable cause for supsicion .
s60 of that Act provides a broader power to search where a senior officer has declared there to be a specific risk of violence .
S43 of the Terror Act 2000 gives an officer the power to stop and search anyone he reasonably suspects to be a terrorist , for items that may help prove that fact .
SPRINGFIELD , Ill . ( CBS ) ―
Medical Marijuana Bill Moves Ahead
In State HouseA state House committee on Wednesday passed a bill that will legalize medical marijuana in Illinois if approved .
HB 2514 , also called the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act , passed the state House Human Services Committee 4 - 3 , according to an aide for State Rep. Lou Lang ( D - Skokie ) , who is sponsoring the bill .
Lang said it is the first time a House proposal for medical marijuana has ever gotten off the floor .
He told CBS 2 that he expects to work hard in the coming week telling colleagues in the state House " that we have nothing to fear from this bill , and we have a responsibility to alleviate pain and suffering for the citizens of Illinois .
"
The bill specifies that marijuana can alleviate pain for patients with cancer , HIV / AIDS , multiple sclerosis , glaucoma , Chron 's disease and several other disorders .
Pointing to those with pain or nausea from chemotherapy , Lang said other than medical marijuana , " People can not get relief in any other place , except totally sedating and debilitating medication that makes them unable to cope with life . " " Strong evidence shows that this is very significant help to them in their life , and I do n't understand why anybody would be against this , " Lang said .
He said political posturing was to blame for opposition to the bill .
Critics of medical marijuana legislation have raised concerns about abuse of the law .
Since California became the first state to approve medical marijuana in 1996 , many complaints have arisen that doctor 's notes are too easy to obtain and that the law has resulted in the opening of storefront dispensaries .
Lang said the Illinois bill is highly controlled with built - in restrictions . " " This is a very controlled bill .
It does n't allow anyone to have more than seven plants , " Lang said .
" Second , we have to be able to trust the medical community .
"
He said there is little outcry when doctors prescribe massive amounts of morphine , Vicodin or codeine to alleviate pain .
" It 's only when you start talking about cannabis that people start talking about that , because they 're looking for an excuse to be against the bill , " he said .
If approved , the medical marijuana law would expire in three years , after which point it would have to be renewed .
If problems or abuses arose , Lang said , " after three years , we could always let the law expire and be done with it .
" Lang said he has not yet spoken with Gov. Pat Quinn about the bill , but anticipates that Quinn will support it .
A total of 13 states now permit medicinal marijuana in some form , although marijuana remains illegal in all forms under federal law .
Scenes of federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents raiding marijuana dispensaries in California have been frequent in recent years .
" We have 13 states today that allow the use of cannabis for medical reasons , and they have n't shut down those operations , " Lang said .
" Secondly , the Obama administration has already signaled publicly that they do n't have an interest in making this part of their law enforcement priority list .
" Lang said he has not yet spoken with Gov. Pat Quinn about the bill , but anticipates that Quinn will support it .
State lawmakers have tried unsuccessfully to pass a medical marijuana bill previously , although not in the House .
A similar bill passed out of a state Senate committee in 2007 , but failed in the full Senate .
Technically , Illinois authorized medical marijuana in 1978 .
But implementation was left to the Public Health Department and it never took action , so the law has been in limbo .
The movement on the medical marijuana legislation came the same day as a Chicago Sun -Times columnist 's call to repeal the federal prohibition .
Steve Huntley wrote in support of an effort by a California state lawmaker to legalize marijuana , regulate it similarly to alcohol , and tax it at a rate of $ 50 per ounce , which would require a change in federal law to enact .
Huntley said fully legalizing marijuana could both raise tax revenue and cut down enforcement costs , and to help curb the violence associated with the drug trade .
" Marijuana prohibition no longer makes sense , if it ever did , " Huntley wrote .
" For the record , my recreational chemical of choice is alcohol .
After the sun sets , I like to enjoy a glass of wine or scotch .
Why should n't my neighbor , if so inclined , be able to relax with a joint ?
" Lang said he saw Huntley 's column on Wednesday , and said of the latest California proposal , " I think it 's far too early to go there . " " California is talking about legalizing marijuana because they think it will help their economy , " Lang said .
" They want to turn marijuana into a tobacco product to help their budget gap , " a move he called " cynical .
" Some Illinois municipalities have reduced the penalty for possession of small amounts of marijuana in recent years .
In south suburban Chicago Heights , a law was recently passed that made possession of less than 30 grams result in a ticket and an administrative hearing , rather than criminal charges .

This is an amazing video for the times .
We planted front yards parking areas , and back yards .
My Dad tells me that he got tired of eating tomato soup for every lunch .
I think that we need to temper this need to grow and overuse of pesticides with todays want to grow organic movement ... but it is hard work .

Subject : The 1940s Garden I happen to live in " Northern Maryland " and this property looks a lot like my neighborhood .
I have never tried to plant an early crop and a late one , but I 'm having a hard time believing in two potato crops in one season in Northern Maryland , not to mention the lettuce that never seems to bolt .
And Good Lord !
This family dealt with every type of disease and insect imaginable .
I understand we talk a lot about organic gardening now ( I myself am a practitioner ) and organic / heirloom seed but I like my seed free of V , F wilts and other nasty diseases so I do n't have to burn my entire garden when my tomatoes get fusarian wilt .
However , I did like the fact that the video showed all of the backbreaking labor that goes into producing a garden and gave a lot of good advice .
I think a lot of people just think they can sprinkle some seed on the ground and viola !
a garden will instantly appear .
But the No Work , No Victory slogan was more frightening than encouraging .

Subject : Garden chemicals
I 'm not an anti-pesticide fanatic , but it 's simply incorrect to suggest that ' 40s pesticides were less dangerous than modern stuff .
In the '40s , it was common to use phosphorus compounds , arsenic compounds , nicotine compounds , thallium bait , DDT and other complex organics that we now know are neurotoxins , carcinogens / mutagens , environmentally persistent / accumulative , etc. on food - bearing ground , directly on food crops and animals , or where they would be drained / washed / flushed into watercourses that later would be utilized as public water supplies , for irrigation of food - bearing ground , or for food fishing .
Modern rules and practices have made a difference , generally for the better .

So , I am 50 years old .
Both of my parents lived to be in their 90's - we survived this kind of gardening just fine , chemicals and all .
My father grew victory gardens during both wars , and we had a 2 acre garden year round when I was growing up .
I would not be so quick to judge the chemicals used - most were far less dangerous than the " RoundUp " that homeowners use around their property for weed control today , not to mention the chemicals that commercial growers use .
Organic is better , but it is FAR more labor intensive to always be vigilant over pest control - one day looking away can wipe out your whole garden .

Ron Paul : McCain 's earmark opposition just ' grandstanding ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday March 11 , 2009
Print This Email This Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) has been known for years as a leading earmarker , despite his criticisms of government spending , and no Republican member of the House of Representatives had more earmarks in the recently - passed omnibus spending bill .
However , when called on his earmarking ways by Fox News host Neil Cavuto , Paul was unrepentant .
He even charged that Sen. John McCain , who has recently been the leading critic of earmarks , " totally misunderstands -- that 's grandstanding . "
Paul explained that he actually approves of earmarks because they force Congress to specify how funds are to be allocated .
" We should earmark every penny , " Paul suggested .
" The whole idea that you vote against an earmark -- you do n't save a penny .
That just goes to the administration and they get to allocate the funds .
...
The most important thing is to have transparency . "
" It just strikes people as a little weird , " Cavuto insisted .
" You champion and rail against government waste .
...
But yet your constituents are going to benefit to the tune of more than 73 million dollars in various projects from this package . "
" It 's like a tax credit , " Paul replied .
" If I can give you any of your money back , I vote for it .
So if I can give my district any money back , I encourage that ....
I do n't think the federal government should be doing it , but if they 're going to allot the money , I have a responsibility to represent my people . "
Paul 's outlook appears to mirror that of Sen. Lindsay Graham , who recently called on President Obama to veto the spending bill because of its earmarks but simultaneously insisted , " I think I should have the ability as a United States senator to direct money back to my state as long as it's transparent and it makes sense . "
" It 's better to spend it on a bridge here than spend it on a bridge in Iraq , " Paul concluded .
A full transcript of the Paul interview is available here .

GNUプロジェクトは3月5日、GNU tar 1.22をリリースした。このバージョンでは、新たに「xz圧縮」をサポートする“－－xz”オプションが追加された。この見慣れない圧縮形式は、.lzmaを置き換えるものとして、LZMA
UtilsをリリースしてきたTukaaniプロジェクトが公開したフォーマット。拡張子は.xzだ。
GNUプロジェクトは3月5日、GNU tar 1.22をリリースした。tarは、複数のファイルを1つにまとめるUNIX標準のファイルアーカイブ。GNU tarバージョン1.22では、新たに「xz圧縮」をサポートする“--xz”オプションが追加された（“ -J” にショートカットがアサインされている）。
この見慣れない「xz」という圧縮形式は、これまでLZMA
UtilsをリリースしてきたTukaaniプロジェクトが1月29日に正式公開したフォーマットで、拡張子は.xz。既存の.lzmaを置き換えるものとして、アーカイバも昨年末から「XZ Utils」に名称変更されている。
tar.xzフォーマットは、すでにGNU
Coreutils 7.1の配布などに利用されており、同時に配布されているcoreutils-7.1.tar.gz（9310KB）に対して、coreutils-
7.1.tar.xz（3875KB）と約40％のサイズまで圧縮効率が向上している。
ファイルのアーカイブと圧縮が統合されているDOS/Windows由来のプログラム（ZIP、RAR、LHAなど）とは異なり、UNIXでは伝統的にアーカイブと圧縮が別々のコマンドとして、組み合わせて利用される。現在では、アーカイブはtarが標準となっており、圧縮にはGNU
zip（.gz）が広く使われているが、大きなプログラムの配布には、より圧縮率の高いbzip2（.bz2）が併用されることも多い。さらに圧縮率の高いXZがどれだけ利用されるか注目される。
なお、オリジナル のLZMAフォーマットは、7-Zipアーカイバの7zフォーマットで使用されているデータ圧縮アルゴリズムで、2001年から開発されている。7-ZipのウェブサイトでSDKがパブリックドメインで公開されており、最新は2月3日に公開された4.65。

When You 're Stuck
If none of these drawing ideas got you out of your rut , then perhaps it 's time to try something different .
Considering the following drawing tips if you 're in need of a fresh start .
Change your location .
If you always draw at the same desk at the same time of day , try to switch up your positioning to get inspired .
Move to a different room or go outside in the shade .
You might have the best technique at your desk , but inspiration could strike for a new sketch out in the world somewhere .

Switch up your medium .
One effective solution is to experiment with different media that you 're unfamiliar with .
Instead of a pencil , try out crayons , pastels , or charcoal .
You might even enjoy some painting projects .

As Arab thoroughfares go , Hamra Street in the center of Beirut is probably the most chic of them all .
International in flavor , cosmopolitan in character , it boasts the sort of smart little café where a Lebanese sophisticate can pause between water - skiing in the Mediterranean in the morning and snow - skiing in the mountains just above the city in the afternoon .
“ The Paris of the Middle East ” used to be the cliché about Beirut : by that exacting standard , I suppose , Hamra Street would be the Boulevard Saint - Germain .
Not at all the sort of place you would expect to find a spinning red swastika on prominent display .
Yet , as I strolled in company along Hamra on a sunny Valentine ’s Day last February , in search of a trinket for the beloved and perhaps some stout shoes for myself , a swastika was just what I ran into .
I recognized it as the logo of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party , a Fascist organization ( it would be more honest if it called itself “ National Socialist ” ) that yells for a “ Greater Syria ” comprising all of Lebanon , Israel / Palestine , Cyprus , Jordan , Kuwait , Iraq , and swaths of Iran , Saudi Arabia , Turkey , and Egypt .
It ’s one of the suicide - bomber front organizations — the other one being Hezbollah , or “ the party of god ” — through which Syria ’s Ba’thist dictatorship exerts overt and covert influence on Lebanese affairs .
Well , call me old - fashioned if you will , but I have always taken the view that swastika symbols exist for one purpose only — to be defaced .
Telling my two companions to hold on for a second , I flourish my trusty felt - tip and begin to write some offensive words on the offending poster .
I say “ begin ” because I have barely gotten to the letter k in a well - known transitive verb when I am grabbed by my shirt collar by a venomous little thug , his face glittering with hysterical malice .
With his other hand , he is speed - dialing for backup on his cell phone .
As always with episodes of violence , things seem to slow down and quicken up at the same time : the eruption of mayhem in broad daylight happening with the speed of lightning yet somehow held in freeze - frame .
It becomes evident , as the backup arrives , that this gang wants to take me away .
I am as determined as I can be that I am not going to be stuffed into the trunk of some car and borne off to a private dungeon ( as has happened to friends of mine in Beirut in the past ) .
With my two staunch comrades I approach a policeman whose indifference seems well - nigh perfect .
We hail a cab and start to get in , but one of our assailants gets in also , and the driver seems to know intimidation only too well when he sees it .
We retreat to a stretch of sidewalk outside a Costa café , and suddenly I am sprawled on the ground , having been hit from behind , and someone is putting the leather into my legs and flanks .
At this point the crowd in the café begins to shout at the hoodlums , which unnerves them long enough for us to stop another cab and pull away .
My shirt is spattered with blood , but I ’m in no pain yet : the nastiest moment is just ahead of me .
As the taxi accelerates , a face looms at the open window and a fist crashes through and connects with my cheekbone .
The blow is n’t so hard , but the contorted , glaring , fanatical face is a horror show , a vision from hell .
It ’s like looking down a wobbling gun barrel , or into the eyes of a torturer .
I can see it still .
I ’ll assume that US News and World Report writer Mary Kate Cary despises the people on this list ( which was provided by Radley Balko ) :
Cary probably hates George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , James Madison , James Monroe , Andrew Jackson , Zachary Taylor , and Franklin Pierce , too ( source ) .
After all , here ’s what Cary has to say about Michael Phelps ( and the people who defend him ) :
Does she not realize how many middle - and high - school kids look up to Michael Phelps ?
That he’s on the front of Wheaties boxes right now ?
That we all warn our kids about the dangers of drug use ?
Most parents find that photo sad and disappointing and will use it as a Teachable Moment for teenagers .
What Michael Phelps did was a shame , but adults ’ defending — and even encouraging — his drug use are far more shameful .
The last time I checked , that Obama guy has a much more important position than being a silly Wheaties model .
Same for those assorted Washington , Jefferson , Madison , Monroe , etc. guys .
However , there is another reason to go after Phelps .
He ’s the perfect poster child for Marijuana Amotivational Syndrome .
For a verrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyy long list of Cheetos - eating slackers just like Phelps , check out this list ( and read all of the comments ) .

While I have smoked marijuana ( and did inhale ) , it just ai n’t my thang .

Has Our Economy Become Dependant On Bubbles ?
from the that - would n't - be - good dept
Joseph Stiglitz :
We had the tech bubble , followed by the housing bubble .
But once we fix the recent mess , what will replace these bubbles as the engine for the economy ?
Feldstein :
What will replace the consumer spending bubble ?
( Both men ) :
We run the risk of the economy becoming depend on constant stimulus to replace these bubbles .
Stiglitz : I worry that after two years of stimulus , that the economy wo n't be going on its own , and then what will we do ?

I 've said in the past that economic bubbles are n't necessarily a bad thing for the overall economy .
Afterall , a bubble ( at least one in a productive area , such as technology ) tends to get a lot of money thrown at some problems , allowing a variety of innovation to take place very rapidly -- effectively throwing a lot of ideas at a wall to see what sticks .
The fallout from a bubble popping often harms investors who bet on the wrong players in the bubble , but the fundamental benefit to society is often positive : a lot of infrastructure gets built very , very fast , and the strongest survives ( and often buys up leftovers for pennies on the dollar ) .
However , there are others sides to the story as well .
Joel West points to a recent interview of economists Martin Feldstein and Joe Stiglitz , where Stiglitz worries that we 've built an economy based on bubbles
Along those same lines , economist Hal Varian has written , in the Wall Street Journal , a very straightforward and clear explanation of why the economy is stuck in neutral right now .
Basically , ( and , yes , I 'm significantly paraphrasing ) , there 's no new bubble to invest in , so ( as Stiglitz implies above ) , everyone 's looking for the government stimulus package to basically act as an artificial bubble until such time as a new bubble rises out of the mess .
And , for that to happen in away , any sort of " stimulus " needs to create incentives for others to invest in productive , growth - producing parts of the economy , rather than just throwing cash at pork barrel spending projects .
This is a pretty fine line to walk ( especially since it 's politicians who are working out the details , and theypork barrel spending ) .
And , to make matters even scarier , economist David Henderson points out that recent research from economists Christina and David Romer ( it 's worth noting that Christina Romer is Obama 's choice to chair the Council of Economic Advisers ) suggests that gov't fiscal policy in an attempt to modify business cycles does n't work .
In other words , things are going to be pretty messy in the economy for a while , unless we can come up with a productive and useful bubble quickly .
Anyone have any suggestions ?

Unless you ’ve been living under a rock , you do n’t need me to tell you that social media has legs .
And it ’s getting leggier by the minute .
Many companies do n’t fully understand what to do with social media .
They do n’t see the path to benefit from it .
Others have tried using it and walked away not seeing the value of social media .
Others still do n’t get it at all , and have left themselves completely to the mercy of the online mobs .
Most of us are somewhere in between .
Social media is at its best when used as a tool to listen and interact with buyers in the early - to - middle stages of their buying cycle .
This is the time to focus on providing consumers with content that matters to their buying process .
While it ’s possible to direct sell and find customers “ in the market ” today , it ’s also difficult .
Most of today ’s companies are overly obsessed with late - stage buyers ; thus , this kind of thinking seems to them less valuable .
What It Can Do
Relationship building , goodwill , and improved customer service are what social media can do for you .
Also , social media can :
Help your company communicate with early - and middle - stage buyers more effectively and push them closer to a sale .
Help your customers communicate the bad and the good , with you and everyone else they know .
Help you listen to what potential buyers in your sector are talking about .
Help you find opportunities to delight customers .
Push you to become more focused on the customer .
What It Ca n’t Do
If you think putting up a Twitter account or a Facebook fan page will build huge gobs of closable traffic overnight , you ’re kidding yourself .
Relationships need nurturing .
Social media can’t :
Drive hundreds of thousands of new qualified visitors ( yet ) to your site or store .
Let you take control of the customer dialogue about your company .
Those days are long gone .
Be your primary channel for marketing your mid- to large - sized company .
More on Buying Stages
A short example : early - stage buyers have only identified a need ( e.g. , “ I need a winter vacation this year ” ) .
Middle - stage buyers know approximately what they want ( e.g. , “ I want to go to Florida this summer ” ) .
Late - stage buyers know exactly what they want ( e.g. , “ I ’m going to Florida and I ’m making reservations and buying plane and park tickets now ” ) .
Do you think someone in early or middle stage might be influenced to by social media ?
If you are n’t convinced , look at what happened to United Airlines .
Anybody who is thinking about going on a winter vacation and happens to cross the “ United Breaks Guitars ” video will think twice about United .
That is a negative influence on early - to - middle stage buyers .
Now , say it ’s 10:30 a.m. , you ’re starting to think about lunch , and you come across this video ?
Andy Sernovitz , an interactive marketing consultant and author , writes about P.F. Chang ’s brilliant use of Twitter .
They ’re clearly trying to influence early - stage buyers , but this is n’t easy to bring to mass scale .
Still , Not Everyone ’s Convinced of Social Media ’s Value
Patricio Robles , tech reporter at Econsultancy , recently wrote specifically about monetizing Twitter and real - time search .
I agree , because Robles was talking about social media as an ad platform .
Where we part in our agreement is in thinking that real - time search and social media have no monetary value .
Remember , social media can build relationships , though not paid traffic generation .
Some Practical Steps for Getting More From Social Media
Reward customers who talk about your company in social media , both good and bad .
Remember , bad word of mouth can be good for your brand too .
Quit talking about yourself all the time .
It gets old , really .
Talk about your customers .
Heck , just share a joke to break things up so you are n’t “ wewe- ing ” all over yourself .
Unconvinced that social media has legs or is a match for your company ?
Test it .
Offer a social media specific promo code and see if it gets traction .
Use social media to take an interest in your customers needs .
For instance , are you selling items in a vertical sector ?
Search for “ follow ” and “ friend ” people in that space .
Add value to the conversation about their needs .
( Early - stage buyer prospecting . )
Use it to meet people .
Meeting people is good .
Where ’s the Value for You ?
Social media is n’t everything people are hoping it will be , yet .
Still , there ’s value in participating and investing resources to be a part of the online 2.0 conversation .
Just temper your expectation , and use it for what it ’s good for .
Have you had to prove that social media has value to someone ?
Tell us how you won them over and we will share the best stories in a future column .

It 's on : the Employee Free Choice Act will be introduced in both the Senate and House this afternoon .
Supporters of the bill held a press conference today at the Capitol , and the lead sponsors each released statements .
Here 's Sen .
Ted Kennedy , EFCA 's lead sponsor in the Senate :
The current crisis has shown us the dangers of an economy that leaves working families behind .
The people who work in our factories , build our roads , and care for our children are the backbone of this great nation .
The Employee Free Choice
Act will give these hardworking men and women a greater voice in the decisions that affect their families and their futures .
It 's a critical step toward putting our economy back on track , and I hope that we can act quickly to send it to the President 's desk .
And here 's Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , an ardent opponent of the bill :
The right to a secret ballot is one which has been protected in America for hundreds of years because we know the value of political expression without fear of coercion .
The attempt by some Democrats to take away this fundamental right goes against the ideals of political freedom upon which our nation was founded .
Not only will this legislation invite harassment and intimidation into the work place , it could also cost America even more jobs ...
The bill would eliminate employer - mandated secret - ballot elections in the union organizing process , allowing workers to potentially form unions via petition .
Labor likes it because it makes the organizing process easier ; business alleges it will foster union intimidation .
EFCA promises to be one of the more intense lobbying fights of the new Congress , with a Chamber of Commerce VP describing it as an " Armageddon " showdown between business and labor .
The lobbying fight has been on for some time now , but blitzes from both sides will likely follow after today 's development .
Right on cue , the Chamber led nearly 200 small business leaders to the Hill today to talk to their senators about it , and a similarly amped up effort from labor can be expected as well .
Update : Labor , it should be noted , had workers on the Hill today visiting congressional offices as well .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

DETROIT 
The brand that was once hailed as an important part of the future of General Motors now will be part of its past .
G.M. said Tuesday that it would phase out its Saturn brand by 2012 .
It does not plan to develop any more new vehicles for Saturn , which began 19 years ago as an effort to attract owners of small Japanese cars .
G.M. also said it was considering its options for the Pontiac division .
The Pontiac name , part of the car business since 1932 , could remain on some models , but may no longer be a separate division .
G.M. said Pontiac would be a “ focused brand ” with fewer models .
The disclosures by G.M. , contained in a viability plan submitted to the government , means that G.M. plans to cut its brands in half , to four : Chevrolet , Cadillac , Buick and GMC .
PLUTOCRATS TO MEET IN GREECE AFP on the trail of Bilderberg group : Site near Athens , Greece , is verified to be scene of 2009 globalist coven By James P. Tucker , Jr. Bilderberg will return to its 1993 crime scene when it attempts to meet secretly in Vouliagmeni , Greece , May 14 - 17 .
Bilderberg will return to the grounds of Nafsika Astir Palace hotels in Vouliagmeni , 20 miles outside Athens , and meet behind guards at the Westin Nafsika .
High on the Bilderberg agenda will be how to manipulate the global economic crisis for their selfish interests .
They will pressure both European and North American nations to pull back from “ protectionism ” in the later meetings of heads of state .
Since the international financiers and high officials of government see themselves as “ citizens of the world ” and scorn “ nationalism , ” their only loyalty is bankrolls , not their country .
They love free trade , essential for world government .
Thus , they are determined that the United States and other nations refuse to impose tariffs that would equalize competition at the water ’s edge .
They want to continue shipping U.S. manufacturing jobs overseas where cheap labor may be exploited .
They want to continue importing products made by slave labor in China and Africa , underselling domestic products .
Bilderberg , a secret elitist group that meets each spring at posh resorts protected by armed guards , uniformed police , sometimes the host nation ’s military plus a brigade of private , plain - clothes guards , tries hard to keep its deliberations secret .
But , with help from the European media and with inside sources , their mischief is always
Bilderberg has a dutiful son in President Barack Obama who will be told to press ahead with the North American Union , which is to be expanded throughout the Western Hemisphere into an “ American Union ” similar to the European Union .
Ultimately , with creation of an “ Asian - Pacific Union , ” the world is to be divided into three great regions for the administrative convenience of a global government of the UN .
Following orders , Obama has a platoon of Bilderberg luminaries in his administration .
But Bilderberg has had problems for years in trying to impose its will on the globe .
When meeting in Greece 19 years ago , it was celebrating President Bill Clinton ’s promise to sign the Rio Treaty on global warming , which would have surrendered U.S. wealth and sovereignty to international bureaucrats .
Clinton , who attended Bilderberg in 2001 and was elected president in 2002 , did sign the Rio Treaty but a test vote in the Senate showed ratification would be overwhelmingly rejected .
It is still pending and Bilderberg boys are depressed .
AFP editor James P. Tucker Jr. is a veteran journalist who spent many years as a member of the “ elite ” media in Washington .
Since 1975 he has won widespread recognition , here and abroad , for his pursuit of on - the - scene stories reporting the intrigues of global power blocs such as the Bilderberg Group .
Tucker is the author of Jim Tucker ’s Bilderberg Diary : One Man ’s 25 - Year Battle to Shine the Light on the World Shadow Government .
Bound in an attractive full - color softcover and containing 272 pages — loaded with photos , many never published before — the book recounts Tucker ’s experiences over the last quarter century at Bilderberg meetings .

One thing Facebook is good for ( other than sucking up your time clicking “ ignore ” on SuperPokes and Lil’ Green Patch requests ) is reconnecting with old high school friends , who can either confirm or deny your vague , “ did that really happen ” memories .
The other day an old friend recalled an epic adventure we had involving The Cure , a bus , and bad Mexican food ; weirdly enough , it reminded me of some corny but important life lessons .
My hometown of Gothenburg , Nebraska is about as far from an urban area as you can get without going on a wilderness trek , midway between Omaha and Denver on an endless , nearly straight stretch of I - 80 that anyone who ’s driven across country describes with abject horror .
This meant that activities city - folk teens took for granted — record stores , concerts , stuff to do that did n’t involve driving up and down main street — were major undertakings for us , and we grabbed opportunities whenever we could .
In July , 1987 , I was 16 years old and about to enter my senior year of high school .
Our marching band ( of course I was in marching band ! ) was set to make a trip to Cheyenne for a parade and judging , and afterward the band bus would take us 90 minutes south to Denver for some touristy activities .
Fun , but imagine my teenage incredulity when I discovered that The Cure would be playing at the legendary Red Rocks venue outside Denver that very night .
A fellow Cure - loving buddy and I immediately started planning our getaway .
Remember , this is pre-internet , and we sure as hell did n’t have credit cards , so just purchasing tickets required a complicated set of maneuvers involving somebody ’s random Denver acquaintances buying tickets and delivering them to us at Casa Bonita , the famous Mexican restaurant where our fellow band - members would be entertained by cliff divers and terrible tacos while we were serenaded by Robert Smith .
My memory is a bit fuzzy on the details , but I ’m honestly not sure we had actual permission to do this : both my friend and I were first - chair marching band mainstays ( myself in percussion , FYI ) so perhaps there was a sort of tacit acknowledgment that we could engage in a bit of rule - bending ?
Either way , we were doing it , and we had to get ourselves to Red Rocks , watch a concert , and then somehow get back and meet the bus at Casa Bonita for the 5 hour return trip to our wee hamlet .
No problem .
So , uh , “ taxi ? ”
Of course , neither of us had ever taken a cab , which was scary enough , and although I ’m sure the fare was something like $ 27 , I remember it seeming astronomical , just about the most money either of us had ever spent on anything .
Finding our seats , we immediately made friends with the kids around us : a goth girl with tangled hair making multiple miniature Robert Smiths out of blue Play - Doh , an older ( like , 19 ! ) guy who gave us sips of vodka he was drinking from a Shasta can .
The concert itself I remember as otherworldly , and while I had experienced little live music at the time , it stays with me as one of the greatest shows of my life .
If you ’ve never been to Red Rocks , it ’s perhaps the most naturally spectacular venue in the world , set up above Denver in the foothills of the Rockies between sheer cliff walls , an endless view of the Colorado prairie laid out before you .
This was a stop on the Cure ’s Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss
Me tour , and that album ’s extended , epic tracks combined with the awe - inspiring setting ( and lightning storms off in the distance ) to blow my little 16 - year - old mind , even though we were so far up in the back benches Robert Smith looked about as big as one of the Play - Doh figures we had gleefully smashed by that point .
Afterward , the Play - Doh girl gave us a ride to Casa Bonita in her sputtering little car , and who knows what we would have done otherwise —
God bless you , Play - Doh girl , wherever you are !
The bus had , of course , been waiting for a significant amount of time ( accounts vary as to how much ) and anyone left awake was not exactly happy to see us .
Later , there were rumblings that we might be expelled from the band or worse , but nothing ever came of it , and in fact , I look back on this as one of my proudest moments .
While I was , in many ways , a crazy rebel teenager with goofy haircuts and weird records , in a lot of other ways I was a coward , nervous about rocking the boat or messing up my college - bound path , fascinated but terrified by the world outside our little town .
From that perspective , the obstacles between us and The Cure at Red Rocks were major , and the potential for trouble significant .
Looking back , of course , all those potential pitfalls have melted away into insignificance , and only the great memory remains .
Sure , to many of you ( and to you spoiled kids these days ! ) this may seem silly , but to us small town boys it was a triumph , an unlikely combination of coincidences , lucky breaks , and perhaps even skillful maneuvering and courage .
I do n’t care how corny it is , it ’s a reminder that sometimes it ’s best to aim for your goal and barrel through as if you have every right to be doing it , no matter how clueless and scared you really are .
Superficially , it might seem like an ironic lesson to connect with masters of darkness
The Cure , but somehow , I think it ’s the right one .

At the mega port of Singapore on Feb 27,2003 just after midnight the Gas Roman loaded with 44,000 cubic meters of natural gas T - boned the Springbo loaded with 4,000 cubic meters of sawn timber .
The Gas Roman cut fully halfway thru the Springbo .
The two ship were so tightly joined that they were n't in emanate danger of sinking .
If the Gas Roman were to back out , the Springbo would rapidly fill with water and capsize in moments .
What to do ?
The crews were evacuated and salvage was contracted .
The ships were tethered to prevent accidental separation .
Stevedores removed all accessible lumber from the Springbo via a barge .
Steel was brought in and a sea wall was constructed around the gaping wound inside the Springbo .
Internal fuel leaks that were leaking into the hole were repaired by divers .
On the afternoon of March 2nd the two ships were separated successfully with no sea contamination .

This was a quick attempt to get a nicer python syntax for un / packing binary data structures .
This requires python 3 because now we can get ordered data about the declared items using the __prepare__ meta - class - method .
I also use here class descriptors for making the array syntax nicer ( instead of char [ 2 ] you can use array ( char , 2 ) ) .
I was going to use abstract meta classes ( ABC ) for the types but decided it was overkill :) .
This is really a quick version so there is much that can be improved but as a POC I think it works very well .
I would be interested in seeing the syntax with a metaclass being used by something like the peach or construct python modules .
I only have 2 basic types but it is trivial to add the rest .
Adding substruct's ( as in a class inside a class ) should be doable but might require fixing up the metaclass up a bit .
Once you 've got that doing unions is trivial .
The hardest feature still missing is being able to do element dependencies like : msNumOfNumbers = dword msItems = dword[msNumOfNumbers ] but I think that will require some major restructuring .
I might fixup the code to allow it if I need it / have time for it .
Feel free to take this code and improve it or do with it what you want .
Comments would be appreciated .

IT is the ultimate thankless job — when an organization 's IT organization is performing optimally , nobody notices , and when it is n't , the IT department is the target of complaints and the butt of jokes .
A consortium of academic and industry partners hopes to change this by turning IT from a cost center and something of a necessary evil into a " value center . "
At the center of this effort is the IT Capability Maturity Framework ( IT - CMF ) , which was launched at Chevron 's world headquarters today .
Yes , I know what you 're thinking : a " framework " needs a launch event ?
But it was actually interesting , somewhat in spite of itself .
The event was a snapshot of a discipline in transition , and the assembled participants were trying to take charge of that transition in order to improve the status of IT while still retaining its identity as a coherent discipline .
It 's not clear to me that the latter is actually possible , but Microsoft , Intel , Chevron , BP , and the rest of the members of the Innovation Value Institute plan to try .
Keeping the business running , vs. running the business
Intel CIO Diane Bryant shared a Gartner report with the audience that claims that 67 percent of the average IT department 's budget is spent just keeping the business running ; another 20 percent is spent on enhancing existing capabilities , and only 13 percent is spent on " innovation . "
Bryant admitted that the Intel 's own internal IT operation spends well over 67 percent on just keeping the business running , and she went on to describe Intel 's efforts to shrink that percentage so that more money can be spent on the other two categories .
This reflects a wider desire to move IT departments from being mostly maintenance and support operations — ones that spend their time reacting to user needs — to something that plays a more active role in " creating business value . "
There was also plenty of talk about raising the level of respect for IT within businesses , as well as of getting IT a " seat at the table " when it comes to running the business .
One of the IVI participants gave some more statistics that paint a picture of the current state of IT .
In a survey of CIOs , the IVI found that 75 percent of them said that they would like to be in a better position to understand how IT is actually delivering value to the company ; two thirds of them do n't believe most of the ROI numbers that are put in front of them ; and fully half of these CIOs do n't actually measure value at all , since they 're focused on just keeping the business running .
Whose values ?
Throughout the event , terms like " value " and " innovation " were left undefined , and this was apparently deliberate , since " value " differs with the business setting .
Nonetheless , the vagueness of the stated goals points out a potential challenge for the framework .
To see why , let 's take a look at part of the framework itself ( pulled from this page ) :
Maturity Major Strategies Managing the IT Budget Managing the IT Capability Managing IT for Business Value Managing IT like a Business 5 .
Optimising Sustainable Economic Model Corporate Core Competence Optimizing Value Value Centre 4 .
Managed Expanded Funding Options Strategic Business Partner Options & Portfolio Management Customer / Service Focus 3 .
Defined Systemic Cost Reduction Technology Expert ROI & Business Case Customer / Service Orientation 2 . Repeatable Predictable Performance Technology Supplier TCO Cost Centre 1 . Initial Beginning Beginning Beginning Beginning
Source : Martin Curley , Intel / National University of Ireland
Most of the renderings of the chart above that I saw had an added vertical axis labelled " maturity , " so that " maturity " increases as you go up in levels .
( Note that " maturity , " along with the five stages above , is derived from the Carnegie Mellon Capability Maturity Model , which itself has its roots in software engineering and object - oriented programming .
This is much deeper into the weeds of quality management than I 've ever had occasion to venture , so I found the Wikipedia entry on CMM helpful . )
In all of the case studies that I saw presented ( and I did n't see all of them ) , the CIOs who evaluated their departments found that they were operating more or less at level 3 of the chart above .
And this makes sense , since the difference between levels 3 and 4 is the difference between expertise in a particular set of enabling technologies and expertise in a particular business .
And therein lies the question that I have about this framework : once you 've crossed the line from " technical expertise " to " strategic business partner , " have n't you left the " IT " box entirely ?
Or , to ask essentially the same question from a different angle : should n't it be the job of everyone in your organization to create value with the best available technology , and if it is n't , then why is n't it ?
If " IT innovation " only happens in the IT department , are n't you kind of up a creek already in today 's business environment ?
IT insights from The Onion
When thinking about abstract attempts such as IT - CMF 's efforts to quantify IT 's value to businesses , I 'm reminded of the old Onion headline : " Bantu Tribesman uses IBM Modem to Crush Nut . "
Like the tribesman 's novel use of the IBM modem , the most " creative , " " innovative , " and valuable uses of technology are also the most specific and occasional .
Even more importantly , the most valuable technical solutions fundamentally require a deep understanding not of the tool , but of the problem .
Thinking as a tribesman solved a problem specific to his domain and just happened to use advanced technology to do it ; a business person , thinking as a business person , should solve problems specific to her domain in whatever way works , using the best tools and practices available to her in her situation .
And where is the IT guy in this picture ?
He 's the one who handed the tribesman the modem and let him take it from there , or who handed the business function the technology and let them run in some totally unforseen direction with it .
He is , unfortunately for those who would raise the status of the discipline , still just the enabler — and if his job is successful , then he 's a slightly surprised enabler who looks on at a particularly creative use of his technology and says , " hey , if it works ... "
Ultimately , I left the IT - CMF launch not entirely convinced that you can develop a technology - independent framework for creating business value ( i.e. , identifying and solving business problems ) with technology .
But I applaud IVI 's participants for trying .
Individuals , Not Institutions , Contribute Most to Open Source Projects
by Ostatic Staff - Feb. 17 , 2009
There was an interesting write up on Forbes.com this week discussing who contributes most to open source projects -- and why .
Even though many open source projects have a commercial or institutional component that contributes some degree of direction ( or funding ) to software development , and even though many businesses and institutions use open source software regularly , the vast majority of contributions to these projects come from individuals .
Forbes ' Dan Woods , after hearing Alfresco's Matt Asay and Eclipse 's Ian Skerrett speak of this contributor gap , concluded that there must be something very different about how institutions contribute .
While having any individual who uses an application ( regardless of his affiliation with a company ) contribute in some way is the preferred scenario , this disparity is n't necessarily damaging to an open source project .
An individual submits a bug report , or contributes code to a project , but the project itself is a group of individuals bound by a common interest .
Scientific studies have shown that groups are better at solving complex problems than individuals .
It might not be damaging , but again , having a percentage of the userbase not giving any sort of input is worrisome ( especially if there 's support revenue involved ) .
Is the software perfect as it is ?
Are these users getting what they need or want from the software now ?
If these users are n't contributing , how likely will they be to continue using the software if the contributions given by others do n't mesh with their future needs ?
Joe " Zonker " Brockmeier , openSUSE community manager , tells Woods that when institutions participate in open source projects , they often do so to meet a specific need .
It 's logical , of course , and it 's still very valuable .
If one company contributes code to add or extend a program 's capabilities , it 's not a stretch to imagine other companies ( even the contributing company 's competition ) would n't find the addition useful -- even if the application 's " casual " users never need the functionality .
Brockmeier also mentions that it's hard to truly " institutionalize " an open source project .
Contributors come from all over , and the right to contribute to a project depends less on affiliation with a corporate entity than it does on how much the contributor can offer in terms of skill and commitment .
Skerrett wonders if it 's something along the lines ( and I paraphrase here ) that institutional settings are n't so good at encouraging people to share .
I think this is a good point .
Certainly , with open licenses , there are rules concerning how companies distribute and share the code they create .
Some companies might discourage contributions in an effort to protect business secrets , but I 'd wonder if there 's an equal amount of " we never really thought about encouraging contributions " at play here .
It would seem businesses could be quite active ( and not divulge trade secrets ) in contributing bug reports , fixes , and generic enhancements .
This might be such a foreign way of thinking , warming to it could take some time .
Groups might be great at tackling problems , and individuals better at contributing for completely ( or not - at - all ) altruistic reasons .
The open source way gets the best of both worlds -- the contributions of individuals and the combined brainpower of a group .
Companies have much to gain from -- and give to -- this approach .
The hard part is showing companies that a cycle of giving could well start an infinite loop of " gains " in motion .
Our goal with the HPS40 was to develop a user - friendly , feature - packed and genuinely " hand - held " oscilloscope .
A number of characteristics were on our wish list : low noise , high sensitivity , modest weight , a backlit LCD and a choice between regular batteries or rechargeable ones .
Furthermore , the scope also offers a selection of 5 different screen layouts .
Both novices and professional users will admire the fast and fully automatic setup function , allowing them to perform measurements without physically touching the unit !
Floating measurements are completely safe thanks to the battery - powered operation and the ( included ) fully insulated measuring probe .
These features make the HSP40 indispensable to the professional user , service centres and even to the hobbyist .
Dear programmers .
I am happy to inform you that , despite the in- progress liquidation of French Universities , OCaml Batteries Included Alpha 3 has landed .
Barring any accident , this should be the final Alpha version , with a mostly stable API and module structure .
You may now download it from the Forge .
A GODI package is also available and a Debian package should follow soon .
You may also read the documentation on - line .
So , what ’s new with Alpha 3 ?
Plenty of things , as you ’ll see .
General
OCaml Batteries Included is now available for both OCaml 3.10 and OCaml 3.11 .
Using OCaml 3.11 bring several additional features .
Language
A new syntax extension allows merging several modules into one : module List = List include Labels gives name List to a new module containing both List and Labels .
This extension should simplify the use of labels , exception - less extensions , etc .
General and extendable data structure comprehension : [? i* i | i <- 1 -- 100 ; i mod 2 = 0 ] [ / sourcecode ] produces an enumeration containing all the squares of even numbers between 1 and 100 , while [ sourcecode language= ' php ' ] [?
String : c | c <- open Char in ' a ' -- 'z ' ] [ / sourcecode ] produces string < code >" abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz " </ code >.
This works just as well with arrays , Unicode strings , Unicode ropes , doubly - linked lists , dynamic arrays , etc. </li > < li >( OCaml 3.11 only )
It is now possible to write Unicode strings , Unicode ropes , read - only strings , write - only strings , etc .
Similarly , it is now possible to pattern - match against these strings with a natural syntax : # u" This is a Unicode string " ; ; - : Batteries .UTF8.t = u" This is some Unicode string " # ro" This is a read - only string " ; ; - : [ ` Read ] Batteries .
String .
Cap.t = ro" This is some Unicode string " # r" This is a functional Unicode rope " ; ; - : Batteries .
Rope.t = r" This is a functional Unicode rope "
Library
After public consultation ( 1 , 2 ) , the module hierarchy has been completely rewritten into a mostly flat hierarchy , as per common OCaml usage .
New abstract thread - safe modules , to allow extensibility to e.g. coThreads .
Thread - safe version of the I/O library .
Old - style ArrayLabels , ListLabels , etc. have been replaced with Array .
Labels , List .
Labels , etc .
Plenty of new functions in Enum , Array , Hashtbl , Pervasives , String , Rope , Bingarray , Dllist , DynArray , Arg , Sys .
The File module now permits using temporary files .
New compatibility layer with OCamlNet .
New version of the Unix module , now compatible with I/O .
New module Future .
Path for manipulating paths .
New module CharEncoding for transcoding inputs / outputs .
New module Date for manipulating time .
Documentation
The new documentation allows browsing modules by topics .
If this is successful , this will be generalized to browsing values , types , etc. by topics .
New documentation generator .
New explanations on a number of subjects .
A number of docfixes .
Bugfixes
A host of bugfixes , in particular wrt Enum .
Toplevel
Loading speed improved .
More robust implementation of the toplevel .
Pretty - printers for UChar , Rope , String .
Cap , UTF8.t .
More robust implementation of the help system .
Examples
Beginning of reimplementation of Pleac in idiomatic OCaml Batteries Included .
Opening a web - browser from a program .
Text encoding transcoder .
Solution of the Euler problem .
Build system
It is now possible to configure whether documentation should be generated .
Documentation installation made more robust .
What now ?
Well , as any Alpha version , this code needs testing , lots of testing .
So please consider using it and posting both feedback , requests for features and bug reports .
Besides testing and fixing bugs , our next few steps consist in
improving the documentation and the on - line help
attempting to decrease the size of binaries produced with Batteries
integrating Delimited Overloading
integrating more network features ( OCamlNet )
a preference system
improving configurability of the GODI package .
And progressively moving towards 1.0 !
The next release should be Beta 1 and is planned for March .
Have fun !
There ’s no doubt that Adobe Photoshop CS3 is probably the most popular and powerful image editing software on the market today .
There are so many features packed into Photoshop that many people get overwhelmed at the very thought of Photoshop ’s extensive photo editing power .
However , if all you need to do is retouch photos , create designs , or even design a website template , then there is life beyond Photoshop .
They may not be as powerful , but they may just be the answer that you ’re looking for .
Apart from having so many features that most ordinary users will never take advantage of , Photoshop ’s other big downfall is its high price tag .
Adobe Photoshop CS3 is currently priced at over £ 330 , and the Photoshop CS3 Extended version is priced over £ 500 .
If you ’re looking for an application for basic image editing and design , then Photoshop may be a waste of your hard earned money .
On the other hand , if you ’re into more advanced graphic design , then Photoshop may the right software for your specific needs , but make sure to check out Photoshop alternatives first to see if there ’s another less expensive software out there that will suit your needs for a lesser price tag , or even for free .
This open source free alternative to Photoshop works on pretty much any platform , and it ’s perhaps the best free alternative to Photoshop out there .
GIMP includes a ton of photo manipulating features that can be used to create cool effects or to retouch photos .
You can also create just about any type of design from scratch , much like a paint program .
GIMP may not be quite as powerful as Photoshop , but when you compare the price tags , there ’s no competition .
Pixia
This free software was originally created in Japan but is available in other languages including English .
Pixia is an advanced paint program that works on a Windows - based operating system ( ME , 2000 , XP , Vista ) .
This software is best used to create artwork rather than photo manipulation , and it can be a very powerful tool for digital artists out there .
Best of all , Pixia is totally free to download .
This open source image editor is designed to be used exclusively on the Mac OS X operating system .
It uses the same native file format as GIMP , but this software is n’t quite as feature - filled as GIMP .
For people who are looking for a very basic image editor for their Mac , Seashore may be a good choice because of its ease of use and small footprint .
Inkscape
This open source application is a vector graphics editor that is a great alternative to any type of drawing program .
Inkscape wo n’t replace Photoshop in terms of photo manipulation , but if you ’re looking for a drawing program which uses SVG file format , then Inkscape may be the answer .
This is a complete alternative to Photoshop .
You can use this software ’s advanced features to edit photos , create drawings and artwork , and for web design purposes .
Xara Xtreme also claims to be the world ’s fastest graphics software .
This software is n’t free , but it costs much less than Photoshop at about £ 70 for the basic version and about £ 200 for Xtreme Pro .
ChocoFlop is a free image editor / drawing application for Mac users ( Mac OS X 10.4 or higher ) .
This program is very user - friendly , supports layers , and has a ton of filter effects .
One of the main benefits offered by ChocoFLop is its small size so load times are very quick , and it does n’t drain very much processing power from your computer .
This application will remain free to download up until the developers finally develop a stable version of this software ( they ’re still working out a few bugs ) so now is the time to grab a copy .
PhotoPlus
This amazing application can pretty much do it all , and best of all it ’s entirely free to use .
This full suite of software can be used to edit photos , create professional - looking documents , design websites , draw , and generate 3D effects from 2 - dimensional objects .
The web design feature does n’t even require any knowledge of HTML or previous web design experience .
The only downfall of PhotoPlus is that it ’s only available for Windows users , so if you use a Mac or Linux , you ’re out of luck ( unless you have virtualisation software installed ) .
Find out more …
This powerful open source software is free to download , and it is one of the best available image retouching tools available which supports higher fidelity colour up to 32 - bits , compared to GIMP ’s 8 - bit , which allows for a deeper colour range and better quality prints .
CinePaint is also a powerful drawing / animating application often used to make animated feature films by major studios .
Krita
This application is part of the Koffice suite of software for Linux .
It ’s free to download and features up to 32 - bit colour management with a large variety of photo editing tools .
Krita is scriptable in Python and Ruby and offers a useful DCOP interface .
Released in 2005 , Krita received the Akademy Award for Best Application in 2006 .
If you are running Linux and do n’t want to use GIMP , Krita is well worth a look .
This photo editing software is a great alternative to Adobe Photoshop that features a robust set of filters , brushes , and editing capabilities .
It also supports layers , transparencies , red - eye removal , and various artistic special effects .
The interface is easy to use and requires a small learning curve .
PhotoFiltre is only available to Windows users , and it costs 29 euros to purchase a license after the initial 30 day trial period .
Paint is a “ poor man ’s Photoshop ” and is one of the most popular Photoshop alternatives out there .
It has support for layers , unlimited undos , a wide variety of special effects , and sports several brushes .
The main advantage of Paint. net is that because it ’s so popular , there are lots of tutorials available online to help guide you through the more advanced features of the program .
Paint.net is only available for Windows - based platforms .
Picnik is a free web - based photo editor which has quickly grown in popularity since it partnered with Flickr .
The advantages of using Picnik to edit photos is that it ’s extremely easy to use , it does have some advanced features ( although not up to Photoshop ’s standards ) , it features lots of special effects , and it works on any platform because it runs within a web browser .
The basic version of Picnik is free , while the Premium version carries just a small annual service fee .
This is another popular web - based application , which works great as a photo editor , and integrates seamlessly with photo sharing websites such as Picasa , Flickr , Facebook , and many others .
Splashup runs in any web browser with a versatile interface that will be instantly familiar if you have ever used Photoshop before .
Splashup is in its Beta stage and is totally free to use .
FotoFlexer is yet another web - based photo editing application .
This free editor has a lot of cool features such as a morphing feature , a smart resizing option , support for layers , and a neat recolour hair feature , which quickly and easily changes hair colour within a photo .
This useful image editing program also integrates easily with all of the social media and photo sharing sites .
This low - cost image editing app is fast becoming one of Photoshop ’s biggest competitors .
It ’s only available for Mac OS X , and its interface is very intuitive with eye - pleasing graphics , easy to use controls making for a highly versatile UI .
Pixelmator ’s graphics drawing tablet features pressure sensitive drawing and painting capabilities should you prefer to avoid using a mouse .
Best of all , Pixelmator supports third - party filters .
The price of Pixelmator is approximately £ 40 , a far stretch from Photoshop ’s rather bloated price tag !
This professional photo editing software is a solid competitor to Photoshop and has a long term development history , so you know that it ’s a very refined application .
The extensive feature - set in Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 includes but is not limited to Express Lab ultra - fast photo editing , an easy HDR conversion feature , easy watermarks , and a plethora of filters and special effects .
This robust image editor will only set you back about £ 40 .
This extremely small and quick application is n’t well - known by any means , but it ’s a very cost - effective alternative to Photoshop for Mac users .
Pixel Image Editor has full support for pressure sensitive tablets , a must for any graphic designer .
The interface is easy to use and navigate , and there ’s an extensive amount of filters , brushes , and drawing tools available to use for editing or creating artwork .
Pixels Image Editor is a great alternative to Photoshop for people looking for software with a small footprint and an equally small price tag at around £ 30 .
Photoline was created by a group of German software developers who set out to create a solid Photoshop alternative , and they did .
It may not be quite as powerful or popular as Photoshop , but it ’s certainly advanced enough for professional photo editing .
Photoline includes easy to use HDR creation tools , a variety of cool filters , flash and GIF animation support , compressed HD - photo file formats , and a user - friendly interface .
It ’s available for 59 euros at Photoline ’s website , where there is a 30 - day free trial period as well .
This Windows - based program is a feature - filled photo manipulation software package designed for more advanced users .
Photos Pos Pro is a lot like Photoshop in terms of functionality , but its interface is quite different .
Novice photo editors should choose a less robust photo editing software as this one can get very complicated - much like Photoshop .
This software comes with a free 30 - day trial and the option to buy for £ 35 at the end of the trial period .
FastStone Image Viewer is a free , basic image editing app that has been around since 2004 .
You wo n’t find many advanced features in this Windows - based tool , but it has just enough features to keep most amateur photographers happy .
Some of the most useful features include red - eye removal , cropping , colour / brightness adjustments , lens , waves and morphs .
FastStone Image Viewer has received 5 out of 5 stars from Cnet ’s download.com and over 3 million downloads , so you know it ’s a good choice .
This image editing tool was created by Nikon and therefore works seamlessly with Nikon cameras , although anyone can use this application for retouching photos , resizing , applying filters , and much more .
Capture NX 2 does a good job of balancing an advanced feature - set with an easy to use interface that even a beginner will have no problem figuring out .
The coolest aspect of this app is the control points sliding feature where you simply point and click the mouse on any part of a photo and use sliders to adjust the color of that part of photo instantly .
There ’s also a free trial period available .

US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has unveiled a comprehensive bank bail - out plan worth at least $ 1.5 trillion ( £ 1.02 trillion ) .
Under the plan , the size of a key Federal Reserve lending program will be expanded to $ 1 trillion from $ 200 bn .
In addition , a public - private investment fund of $ 500bn will be created to absorb banks ' toxic assets and could be expanded to $ 1 trillion .
" Critical parts of our financial system are damaged , " Mr Geithner said .
The Obama administration is even more neurotic about nationalising banks than its predecessor
Stephanie Flanders , BBC economics editor
Two big messages from the Geithner plan " Instead of catalyzing recovery , the financial system is working against recovery , and that 's the dangerous dynamic we need to change , " he added .
The new plan is aimed at restoring confidence in the damaged financial system and restarting bank lending .
The key question now is how eager the private sector will be to participate both in the new investment fund and the new Federal Reserve lending programme .
Meanwhile , the US Senate has backed an $ 838bn economic stimulus package which will now have to be reconciled with the House of Representatives version .
Doubts Leading US stock indexes fell sharply after Mr Geithner unveiled the new plan , as many analysts expressed scepticism .
" It 's not big enough .
There are few details .
The administration is trying to buy time and they do n't get the fact that we need to get something yesterday , " said Joseph LaVorgna , chief US economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York .
Investors want clarity , simplicity , and resolution .
This plan is seen as convoluted , obfuscating , and clouded
James Ellman , Seacliff Capital
Q&A : Bank bail - out plan " Investors want clarity , simplicity , and resolution .
This plan is seen as convoluted , obfuscating , and clouded , " said James Ellman , Seacliff Capital president .
Others say that the plan is not perfect , but in general they agree with many of its proposals .
" I think the idea of more or less buying back some of the debt , monetizing it , is a good idea .
I think that 's probably a good move , " said Carl Birkelbach , head of Birkelbach Management .
Transparency and accountability Mr Geithner said the new plan should unfreeze the credit market , strengthen banks and " provide critical aid for homeowners and for small businesses " .
" And as we do each of these things , we will impose new higher standards for transparency and accountability , " he added .
THE KEY AIMS OF THE PLAN Absorbing toxic assets from a weakened banking system Unfreezing the credit market Softening the housing crisis Transparency and accountability
He said that the public - private investment fund to buy up risky assets will be seeded with government money .
The expanded Federal Reserve lending program will support lending to small businesses and consumers , including credit card lending and student loans , and also cover the troubled commercial real estate market .
The government also will give banks access to additional capital from the Treasury 's original $ 700 bn bail - out fund " as a bridge to private capital " .
But that will come with strict terms , including full disclosure and limits on executive pay .
" This assistance will come with terms that should encourage the institutions to replace public assistance with private capital as soon as that is possible , " said Mr Geithner .
The government will also provide $ 50 bn to try to soften the deep housing crisis , which has been having a negative impact on the economy .

A UK resident freed from Guantanamo Bay has said he would not have faced torture or extraordinary rendition but for British involvement in his case .
US interrogators told him , " This is the British file and this is the American file , " Binyam Mohamed , 30 , told the BBC in his first broadcast interview .
He said he wanted to see ex-President George Bush put on trial and , if there were evidence , former UK PM Tony Blair .
The UK says it does not condone torture , but will examine any claims .
The US has dropped all charges against Mr Mohamed .
BBC
News reporter Jon Manel , who conducted the interview at a secret location , said that Mr Mohamed looked " very thin " and claimed to be suffering from health problems .
Binyam Mohamed 's journey Mr Mohamed , who spoke to the media against the advice of his psychiatrist because he wanted people to know what happened to him , described his return to the UK last month .
Feelings of happiness and sadness , I still do n't have them .
As far as I am concerned , nothing matters

Binyam Mohamed : Key quotes
Freed detainee describes captivity
Send us your comments " I did n't feel like I was free .
Even now I do n't feel that I 'm free , " he said .
" It 's been seven years of literal darkness that I have been through .
Coming back to life is taking me some time . "
He added : " I do n't have the regular person 's feelings that people have .
The feelings of happiness and sadness , I still do n't have them .
" As far as I am concerned , nothing matters . "
The former terror suspect said that the six years and 10 months he spent in detention had left him feeling " dead " .
MI5 involvement Later detained in Pakistan , Mr Mohamed said , he was interviewed for three hours by an MI5 officer calling himself John whose role , according to Mr Mohamed , was to support the American interrogators .
" If it was n't for the British involvement right at the beginning of the interrogations in Pakistan , and suggestions that were made by MI5 to the Americans of how to get me to respond , I do n't think I would have gone to Morocco , " he said .
" It was that initial help that MI5 gave to America that led me through the seven years of what I went through . "

The MI5 agent who questioned him has previously denied at the British High Court any suggestion that he threatened or put any pressure on Mr Mohamed .
Mr Mohamed said he had originally travelled to the region after becoming a practising Muslim , visiting Afghanistan because he had been told it " was where the real Islam was " .
" There was just a word out there that Afghanistan was the real Islamic state at that time , and I should make my way over there , " he said .
During the interview , Mr Mohamed 's lawyer prevented him from answering questions about travel documents he had used to get to Afghanistan and a training camp he attended .
This was because Mr Mohamed 's immigration status is currently under review .
Mr Mohamed said that in July 2002 he was flown to a secret site in Morocco where , he claimed , he was tortured by local officers asking him questions supplied by British intelligence operatives and showing him hundreds of photographs of Muslim men living in the UK .
" The interrogator who was showing me the file would say , ' This is the British file and this is the American file . ' "
In the ' dark prison ' I was ... dead .
I did n't exist .
I was n't there .
There was no day , there was no night
Binyam Mohamed Mr Mohamed said that 70 % of questions put to him had to have come from sources in the UK .
In the UK , the attorney general is continuing a review into whether to ask police to investigate allegations of British collusion in mistreatment of Mr Mohamed .
His lawyers have previously placed on record claims that the torture included a razor being used to slash his genitals .
In the interview , extracts of which were broadcast on Radio 4 's Today programme , the former detainee told the BBC he had never been involved in any plots and had not attended terrorist training camps before 9/11 .
Asked if he had been an al - Qaeda operative , he replied : " I do n't even know what that means because how am I supposed to be an al - Qaeda operative ?
" How do you become an al - Qaeda operative ? "
Camp closure
In January 2004 , Mr Mohamed said he was taken to a place he calls the " dark prison " in the Afghan capital , Kabul , where he said he almost lost his mind .
He claimed he was put in a dark cell with just a blanket on the floor .
Speakers attached to the walls pumped out music by the American rapper Eminem 24 hours a day for a month .
" In the ' dark prison ' I was literally dead .
I did n't exist .
I was n't there .
There was no day , there was no night . "
Following his experiences in Kabul , Mr Mohamed signed a confession which he said he agreed to only because he was told he would be flown back to the " dark prison " if he did n't co-operate .
Shortly after this he was sent to Guantanamo Bay where , he said , guards attacked him for refusing to give his fingerprints .
He claimed abuses at the camp had increased since President Barack Obama announced his intention to close it within a year .
' Abhorrent practice ' Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Edward Davey said that Mr Mohamed 's allegations " could not be more compelling " .
William Hague , the shadow foreign secretary , said the UK's " name and reputation will be dragged through the mud " unless a judicial inquiry is held into the affair .
The director of human rights group Liberty , Shami Chakribarti , echoed calls for a full investigation , insisting that there could not be " one law for the government and another for everyone else " .
On Thursday , a Home Office spokesperson said : " The government unreservedly condemns the use of torture as a matter of fundamental principle and works hard with its international partners to eradicate this abhorrent practice worldwide .
" The security and intelligence agencies do not participate in , solicit , encourage or condone the use of torture or inhumane or degrading treatment . "

Wen Jiabao has ' enough ammunition ' to aim for 8 % economic growth target – but fears rising US deficit
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
China is worried about its vast United States treasury holdings , premier Wen Jiabao said today , urging Washington to safeguard their value .
Wen also pledged to expand the country 's stimulus package if necessary , as Beijing undertakes what he admitted was the difficult task of shoring up growth .
His remarks came ahead of the meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in London this weekend to lay the groundwork for next month 's G20 summit on the global downturn .
Beijing wants to head off protectionism and pressure for further appreciation of the yuan , which would cripple its plummeting export sector .
It is also pressing for restructuring of the International Monetary Fund to pay more attention to the interests of developing countries .
While relations with the US are broadly stable , there was displeasure when treasury secretary Timothy Geithner said President Barack Obama believed China was manipulating its currency .
The administration subsequently rowed back from the remarks .
This week also saw a spat between the two countries when America accused the Chinese navy of harassing one of its surveillance ships in international waters in the South China Sea .
Beijing alleged that the US vessel was operating illegally .
Speaking at his annual press conference at the close of China 's parliament , Wen said : " We have made a huge amount of loans to the United States .
Of course we are concerned about the safety of our assets .
To be honest , I 'm a little bit worried . "
He called on Washington " to honour its words , stay a credible nation and ensure the safety of Chinese assets " .
China had worked to diversify its $ 2tn - worth of foreign exchange reserves , although it remains the single largest holder of US government debt , which accounts for about half of its stockpile .
Washington needs to continue selling treasury notes to fund its $ 787bn stimulus package .
Last month , the secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , urged Beijing to maintain its stock as she visited China .
" They are worried about forever - rising deficits , which may devalue treasuries by pushing interest rates higher , " Frank Gong , a JP Morgan economist , told Reuters .
" Inside China there has been a lot of debate about whether they should continue to buy treasuries . "
Any change would be gradual because abrupt action would punish the dollar – damaging the value of existing holdings and further hitting the sale of goods to the US , its biggest export market .
Wen said it would be difficult but possible to reach China 's 8 % growth target .
Independent economists suggest the figure could be as low as 5 % – enviable for most major economies , but potentially too low to keep unemployment down .
Beijing announced a 4tn yuan ( about £ 400 bn ) plan in November , but Wen promised : " We have prepared enough ammunition and we can launch new economic stimulus policies at any time . "
He said years of growth and prudent management had left more leeway to run a larger fiscal deficit and take on more debt .
" The most direct , powerful and effective way to deal with the current financial crisis is to increase fiscal spending – the quicker the better , " he said .
The premier acknowledged that unemployment was a " very serious " problem but said the country was still stable .
" I really believe we will be able to walk out of the shadow of the financial crisis at an early date , " he said .
" After this trial , I believe the Chinese economy will show greater vitality . "
He promised to focus on job creation and give more help to smaller companies , which he said generated 90 % of Chinese new employment .
Many economists think the government has done too little to aid entrepreneurs .
Figures released this week show a mixed picture for the Chinese economy , with exports slumping by more than 25 % in February and retail sales weakening , but a sustained surge in bank lending which some analysts believe offers hope of a recovery .

Shuttle launch put on hold
BY WILLIAM HARWOOD
STORY WRITTEN FOR CBS NEWS " SPACE PLACE " & USED WITH PERMISSION
Posted : February 20 , 2009
After a marathon 13 - hour flight readiness review , NASA managers late Friday were unable to reach a consensus on launching the shuttle Discovery Feb. 27 with suspect hydrogen flow control valves .
As a result , senior management decided not to set an official launch date and Discovery 's mission to deliver a final set of solar arrays to the international space station was put on hold pending additional analysis and discussions next Wednesday .
To avoid conflict with a Russian Soyuz spacecraft set for launch in late March to ferry a fresh crew to the space station , Discovery cannot take off between , roughly , March 14 and April 6 .
If NASA managers can develop an acceptable flight rationale to launch Discovery as is following next Wednesday 's assessment , the agency has a shot at getting in at least a few launch attempts before the Soyuz cutout .
Otherwise , the flight will slip into April .
Shuttle Program Manager John Shannon shows an example of the flow control valve poppet .

" We were really , really close to having the entire team at a point where we could accept ( the valve risk ) and go fly , " shuttle Program Manager John Shannon told reporters late Friday .
" But as we talked through all the data , a lot of it came in fairly late this week , a lot of the impact data , a lot of the analysis data .
We found a couple of small errors in things as we were going through the data . "
When Bill Gerstenmaier , chief of space operations for NASA , " went around and polled the team to get input , there was just a sense of unease that we did not quite have the rigor that we typically expect for a question like this , " Shannon said .
" It 's a very complicated problem . "
The decision to defer a launch date decision came as a surprise to many observers who believed extensive test data and computer analyses indicated the valves could be safely flown as is and that the likelihood of in - flight problems was sufficiently remote to press ahead with launch .
But others , including Johnson Space Center Director Mike Coats and the engineering directorates at Johnson and the Marshall Space Flight Center , were opposed , arguing engineers do not have a sufficient understanding of the mechanism that leads to cracks and potentially catastrophic failures .
Shannon and Gerstenmaier were in favor of pressing ahead with launch , but they were in the minority and the flight was put on hold .
Gerstenmaier said the long - term goal is to develop a valve redesign that will eliminate concern about cracks and debris shedding once and for all .
In the near term , the goal is to develop a better understanding of the valve failure mechanism , to identify pristine valves that should be able to withstand the rigors of launch and to make sure any unexpected valve failures that occur in flight do not lead to catastrophic damage .
" The overall philosophy is , while we 're working this redesign we 'll have a strategy that allows us to continue to fly with the valves we 've got and we 'll do that in parallel , " Gerstenmaier said .
Discovery originally was scheduled for launch Feb. 12 .
But the flight was delayed , first to no earlier than Feb. 19 , then to Feb. 22 and eventually to no earlier than Feb. 27 because of concern about the integrity of the shuttle 's three hydrogen flow control valves .
The shuttle is equipped with three flow control valves that work like pop-up sprinklers to route hydrogen gas to the external tank to keep the hydrogen section properly pressurized at 32 to 34 pounds per square inch during the climb to space .
The valves are critical to flight safety .
An over - pressurized tank could lead to hydrogen being dumped overboard through a relief valve , creating a potentially catastrophic environment depending on when such an incident occurred .
Under - pressurization could lead to premature main engine shutdowns .
And if debris from a broken valve punctured the pressurization line , hydrogen could be released into the aft engine compartment with potentially catastrophic results .
During the most recent flight last November , part of a flow control valve poppet broke off inside the pressurization line .
While the valve that cracked allowed more hydrogen to flow through than normal , the Endeavour 's flight computers compensated by reducing flow through the other valves .
But engineers were surprised by the incident and tests were ordered to find out what caused the failure .
They quickly discovered small cracks in other valves across the fleet and heretofore unknown harmonic conditions in the pressurization line that can lead to high - cycle fatigue .
While the valves aboard Discovery were replaced by presumably crack - free units , additional testing of other valves showed that surface roughness left over from the manufacturing process could mask small cracks .
The issue then was whether whether fresh cracks could form in the flight environment , how fresh or pre-existing cracks might propagate and how far a crack might extend before causing part of the valve poppet to break away .
NASA and its contractors built full - scale mockups of the pressurization line and fired small bits of debris into it under simulated flight conditions to find out what would happen if additional in - flight failures occurred .
Borescope examination of the test line showed scuffing where the debris had ricocheted along , but no punctures .
Based on examination of test results and the broken valve from Endeavour , engineers believed a crack could not grow beyond an arc of 90 degrees without that part of the poppet breaking away .
This week , fragments representing the results of a 180 - degree crack were used for impact testing in a mockup of the pressurization line mounted on the external tank and again , no internal damage to the pressurization line occurred .
But engineers remain concerned about the consequences of debris impacts in a 90 - degree bend in the line just five inches from each flow control valve .
The hydrogen gas passing through a flow control valve could result in debris impact velocities at that first bend ranging from around 205 mph to more than 600 mph .
Additional testing is needed to confirm the pressurization line can stand up to such impacts from debris potentially twice as large as the fragment released during Endeavour 's mission .
" We were working towards getting flight rationale to go fly , " Gerstenmaier said .
" Some of that work is not done and we still need to do a little bit more work to get that completed and get it understood .
So we spent a long time today discussing what we know and do n't know about the failure , what we know about the consequences if a piece comes off and what it means to us . "
In the 124 flights to date , only one flow control valve has ever suffered an in - flight failure like the one observed during Endeavour 's mission .
While engineers now know cracks may have been present all along , the flight record and the test results over the past two weeks indicate a relatively low probability of any significant problems with Discovery .
But additional work is needed to make sure .
" The piece that was kind of missing today was on the orbiter side , if a piece of this valve comes off like it did on ( Endeavour 's launch ) , first of all , do we know how big a piece can be , can we bound that ? "
Shannon asked .
" And then , once we understand how big that piece is , can the orbiter plumbing take that piece coming off and hitting it ? ...
It looks like it can , if the size is about the size of ( Endeavour 's ) or slightly larger .
But we did n't have the bow tied around it that we could say that with the definitization that we ( normally ) do . "
The decision comes at a critical time for NASA , with five shuttle flights planned this year and only nine left before the fleet is retired in 2010 .
But Gerstenmaier said based on what engineers know about the valve issue to date , NASA will stick with the current launch sequence and send up Discovery first , in March or April , followed by a Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission aboard Atlantis and then another space station assembly mission with Endeavour .
" I fully believe we 'll be able to put a plan together , " Shannon said .
" We 're not that far away . "

There is no way Wheelman will be good .
It 's impossible .
The game is being developed by the bankrupt Midway , which has n't released an exciting game since Mortal Kombat II in 1993 .
It 's a Grand Theft Auto knock - off , which usually means you can't expect much .
To make matters worse , it 's based on a delayed movie by the same name staring Vin Diesel , and games based on movies are hardly a good thing .
The negative associations are all here , and from the sound of it , you 'd be wise to keep this one well off your gaming radar .
And yet here I am .
Playing the latest preview build of Wheelman to the very end — at will , even .
It 's hard to put the controller down .
" Is this possible ?
Could it be ?
Are you sure this game is n't made by someone other than Midway ? "
I ask myself .
Yes and no .
Consider the source
Wheelman is being co-developed by Tigon , the same production studio that created The Chronicles of Riddick : Escape from Butcher Bay .
That game , also starring Diesel ( who founded Tigon in 2002 ) , was an unexpected hit on Xbox when it was released in 2004 .
Unlike the movie of the same name , critics praised Escape from Butcher Bay for its engrossing first - person action and showered it with review scores in the 90th percentile .
Although young , the production studio has some history .
But Tigon does n't handle coding duties for Wheelman .
That 's being done by Midway Newcastle , the company 's only studio outside of the US .
Midway acquired the Newcastle office , formerly known as Pitbull Syndicate , in 2005 .
I 'm convinced the distance from Midway 's embattled American headquarters only plays in the game 's favor .
And it 's an important point .
Even though Wheelman will carry Midway 's disreputable name upon release , it was developed in connection with a proven production company , and programmed overseas — far , far away from the crumbling base camp .
What makes it special
" A lot of people do n't know what to expect from Wheelman , but invariably they walk away wowed by the vehicle combat , " says designer Mark Thompson .
" The focus on vehicles as weapons is truly something unique . "
Vehicular combat , a fancy term Midway uses to describe how Jason Bourne might drive a car , is the heart and soul of the game .
It sorta feels like the first time you plowed through pedestrians on a sidewalk playing Grand Theft Auto 3 , only it 's a lot more lasting and meaningful , but just as destructive .
For example , say the Polic ? a ( the game is set in Barcelona ) sound their screaming sirens and attempt to pull you over for speeding or reckless driving — take your pick .
They approach you from the right , and instead of eluding them or shooting out their tires ( which you have the option of doing ) , you flick your right analog stick in the desired direction to throw your steering wheel and ram their port side .
This shoves them to the side and is very satisfying .
You do it again , sideswiping their car almost two lanes to your immediate right .
Hit 'em three successive times and boom !
Your opponent is blown into oblivion .
Gas leaks are such a pain .
" Finishing Moves are an example of how we increased the depth of the combat , " Thompson says .
" Attacking vehicles with melee attacks causes them to enter a finishing state .
A vehicle could have 50 percent health remaining , but if you chain together a combo , one solid hit in the finishing state can destroy an enemy vehicle , with the destruction highlighted in glorious slow motion . "
And the effect looks gooooooood .
Whether car , motorcycle , truck , or scooter , car -ram " fatalities " will launch your challengers into orbit .
This can be done at any time , to either side or in front of you , and to any movable object .
I often got sidetracked on missions , the move is so addicting .
But wait , there 's more !
Sender - Inner Dutch writes : " Attached are pictures of my annual hatch .
Despite having a heat lamp to keep them roasty - toasty , they sleep by packing themselves in like sardines , burying their little faces under their neighbor .
The result looks like a fluffy carpet or rug ( with the odd wing , beak , or foot sticking up out of the pile ) that undulates as they breathe . "
" ... The little buggers are so damned cute , I can hardly stand it . "
" And although it may be difficult to believe , in just a fortnight they 'll all be as ugly as sin ... "
" ...( Ever seen an adolescent chicken ?
They 're definitely NOT Cute Overload material ! ) . "
I 'd like a 4 by 4 swatch of this carpeet delivered immediately , Dutch .
I think I 'll do my living room in it .
With freezing temperatures expected to endure for at least a week , there were predictions that resulting disruption and an expected spike in absenteeism could cost the British economy as much as £ 600 million a day , as the public transport system grinds to a halt and schools and offices are forced to close .

Siegelman : Americans need Karl Rove to testify Joe Byrne
Published : Wednesday February 18 , 2009
Print This Email This
This article has been retracted by the editors due to insertion of opinion in a news article .
Allegations that former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove was involved in pushing for a prosecution in Alabama have not been proven .
Don Siegelman has a right to hear Karl Rove testify on his activity during the Bush administration .
If it was n't for him , Siegelman would n't have spent the last decade fighting unfounded allegations and politically - motivated prosecution .
Siegelman had everything you need in the political world - popularity , a governor 's chair and a clean track record - until he found himself on the wrong end of Rove 's agenda .
Siegelman had made enemies during his time as the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama , working on lawsuits against the tobacco industry in his state .
Rove and veteran GOP operative Bill Canary were employed as strategists for the tobacco lobby and also by the campaign to re-elect William Pryor , another tobacco industry lobbyist , as Alabama 's attorney general .
Pryor quickly opened an investigation into the newly - elected Governor Siegelman .
When Bill Canary 's wife was appointed by the White House as US attorney general in 2001 , a federal investigation of Siegelman picked up where Pryor left off .
The result of that four year investigation was 32 convictions of bribery and other crimes .
Siegelman was sentenced to seven years and four months in prison and was immediately whisked off to a series of out - of - state jails , not even being allowed to remain free on bond while his appeal was under way .
Shortly before the sentencing , however , suspicions expressed by Alabama observers that there was something " fishy " about the case -- as Scott Horton of Harper 's Magazine would later put it -- began to reach the national stage .
What initially appeared to be merely a whiff of possible political corruption became something stronger , with allegations that Karl Rove and the Bush Justice Department had been operating behind the scenes .
Raw Story published a four - part article on the Siegelman case in November 2007 , which was nominated for an investigative journalism award by the Online News Association , and which can be found here .
Karl Rove has been subpoenaed and is due to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on Monday in connection with the firing of nine US attorneys and the Don Siegelman case .
However , the Obama administration is advising Congress not to force a Rove testimony , John Byrne reported yesterday .
Obama is sensitive to protecting the institution of the presidency , and does n't want to risk diluting his own executive privilege by negating the Bush decision .
Obama 's lawyers believe they can reach a settlement with Rove .
In an e-mail sent to RAW STORY today , Don Siegelman expressed his support for John Conyers and the House Judiciary Committee in their investigation of the backstage activity of the Bush administration .
ï¿
½There should be no deal offered to Karl Rove , no grant of executive privilege , no immunity , and no accommodation , ï¿½ Spiegelman said .
ï¿
½What the American people want and need to begin the process of restoring justice is for Karl Rove to be brought before the committee , placed under oath , and forced to answer the tough questions about his abuse of power and the use of the Department of Justice as a political weapon .ï¿½
One of Obama 's most popular campaign promises was to expose the secrets of the Bush administration and reform the way the executive branch interacted with the judicial branch .
In 2007 , while in the Senate , Obama rebuked Bush 's White House as " the most secretive in modern history , " which aimed " to hide its abuse of our justice system . "
Responding to a Bush claim of executive privilege , he said , " By continuing to act as the most secretive White House in modern history , the Bush Administration has once again placed itself above the law in order to hide its abuse of our justice system from the American people .
On the first day of an Obama Administration , we will launch the most sweeping ethics reform in history to shed sunlight on the decisions made by government and put the interests of the American people at the center of every decision that 's made . "
Rove 's lawyer , Robert Luskin , told Raw Story last week that no agreement had been reached between the Obama and Bush teams .
Although Rove has clearly stated that he will not show for the hearing , the House Judiciary Committee hearing is still set for next Monday .

“ On the Internet , nobody knows you 're a dog . ” —
The words of a well - known adage dating back to a New Yorker cartoon from 1993 have been interpreted and re-interpreted , acting over the years as a starting point for debates on privacy and online anonymity .
In Japan , a country with one of the world 's most popular online bulletin boards , the limits of this adage have become clear in recent years , high - profile slander cases having exposed the dangers of relying too heavily on online anonymity .
Government institutions , companies , media organizations and advertising agencies have similarly learnt not to take the dog adage too literally — at least not while editing Wikipedia .
This week though saw a whole new take on the familiar “ nobody knows you 're a dog ” adage .
Blogger coconutsfine [ ja ] , in a post entitled “ The people I 've been friends with for ages on Twitter were bots ” ( twitterでずっと仲良くしていた人がbotだった ) , described his disbelief at discovering that two of his closest friends on Twitter were not the kind of people he thought they were .
The blog entry , posted on March 9th , begins :
僕もtwitterを始めてからもうすぐ2年になる。情報系の大学に入ってから関わりのある人のtwitter-erが増えたのでどんどんのめり込んで行った。まあろくすっぽ大学生活をエンジョイもせずにtwitter充していたわけで、友人からの遊びの誘いを断ってまで
twitterをやってるような廃人なわけだ。そんな廃人になってくると、そろそろtwitter上にも旧知の仲というか、移り変わるタイムラインでも昔からの顔なじみみたいな人が結構でてくる。昔よく見たのに最近見ないなと思っていたらアカウントが消えていたり、wassrで偶然見つけたり、まあそんなことがあったりする。
It 's been nearly 2 years since I started using twitter .
Since I entered a university specialized in informatics , the number of people around me using twitter has increased , and I 've been getting more and more absorbed in it .
I 'm using twitter so much that I hardly take the time to enjoy university life , to the point where I 'm like a shut - in , turning down invitations to hang out with friends so I can write to twitter .
Having reached this point , I 've ended up on twitter with what I guess you could call old friends , familiar faces that , despite coming and going , I 've known for a long time .
When the accounts of people who I used to see quite often disappear , I end up finding them back by chance on wassr , that 's kind of how it goes .
僕のtwitter古馴染みの中に@donsukeと@ha_maがいる。@donsukeは今でこそ猫のアイコンだが、最初はマントを着ている熊のぬいぐるみのアイコンで、「〜なのだ」という語尾をつけるなどの子供っぽいところがあって、なかなかお茶目なやつだ。@ha_maは「〜なのよ」という語尾を一貫していて、女の子のアイコンからして、なかなかキュートな人である。つまらないpostばかりしている僕によく話しかけてくれるなんとまあ楽しいやつらで、帰宅報告をすれば「おかえり」と言ってくれるし、起床報告をすれば「おはよう」と言ってくれ、僕もそれに対してよく返事をするというとても親しい仲だった。
Among my old friends on twitter , there are two users named @donsuke and @ha_ma .
@donsuke has an icon of a cat right now , but he used to have an icon of a stuffed bear wearing a cloak , and he had this thing about ending his sentences with child - like expressions like “ nano da ” — quite the kidder .
@ha_ma always uses the ending “ nano yo ” , and has an icon of a little girl , so she seems like a cute person .
These two are good fun , always replying to my boring posts .
When I would announce that I had arrived home , they would greet me with “ okaeri ” , and when I would announce that I had just woken up , they would reply with “ good morning ” — and I would often reply back .
They were really close friends of mine .
そんな旧友の二人だったが、最近どうも@donsukeの様子がおかしかった。先週、まったく文脈と関係ないところで
These two were old friends of mine .
Recently though , for some reason @donsuke started acting pretty strange .
Last week , @donsuke replied with this total non-sequitur :
あともうちょっとだ ！
You 're getting there !
こんなreplyを飛ばしてきた。まあtwitter上では誤爆はよくあることで、@donsukeは昔から大量postする
twitter-erだったのでこのときもあまり気にしなかった。誤爆postしてることを教えようとも思ったが、twitterというのは発言がどんどん流れていく場所だから、そのままにしておいた。そして、一週間たった今日の昼のことである。
This reply came my way .
There are more than a few off - target comments on twitter though , and @donsuke has been a heavy poster on twitter for a long time , so I did n't think much of it .
I thought I might mention to @donsuke that his post was off - target , but there are so many messages flowing through twitter that thought , I 'll just let it go .
But then , just a week later , this came today at lunchtime .
あともうちょっとだ ！
You 're getting there !
…あれ ？
… what ?
もしかして@donsukeってbotだったの？
Is this what I think , is @donsuke a bot ?
@donsuke のwebページに飛んでみる。他の一般ユーザーのtwitterアカウントだった。「どういうことだ？」と思いながらそのアカウントのwebページからたどってみる。すると、いくつかのtwitterアカウントが並んでいるページに飛ぶ。右上には「つくりました」の文字。
I rushed to check @donsuke 's webpage , only to find that it was a link to another user 's twitter account .
“ What 's going on here ? ” I thought to myself as I followed the link to the webpage of the other twitter account , where I found a page with a list of twitter accounts .
And at the top right of the page , there were the characters of the word : “ Tsukurimashita . ” [ つくりました /” I made them . ” ]
「 …@donsukeってbotかよ！！」MacBookに向かって一人で叫ぶ俺。
“ … @donsuke is a bot ! ! ” I screamed at my MacBook , with no one around to hear .
さらにそのページをよく見ると見覚えのあるアカウント名がある。もう一度MacBookに向かって叫ぶ俺。
But there was more .
When I looked closely at the page , I saw another account name that I recognized .
And I screamed at my MacBook again :
ちょw@ha_maもbotかよw
So @ha_ma is a bot too ?
@ha_maお前もか。
@ha_ma , you too ?
驚愕。もう言葉が出ない。僕は0と1の羅列と仲良くしていたなんて。
Complete shock .
I was speechless .
These two were at the top of my list of friends .
おそらくだけど、僕が一番始めに出会ったbotは@bomtterだった。twitter上で「爆発しろ！」が流行るきっかけになったbotだ。そして同じようなbotである@wakatterが人気になった。しばらくすると@kyoujinのような人口無能のbotが出てきた。これらは一目でbotとわかるような特徴的なものだった。文脈無視の決まり文句だらけか、明らかに中に人間はいないような人口無能の文章生成postだったからだ。ところが、その bot達が注目を集めている頃からfollowをしていた僕の親友の二人は違った。@donsukeと@ha_maを僕が先にfollowしたのかあちらからしてきたのかは覚えていないが、僕は一度@donsukeをfollowしてすぐに「botかな？」と疑ったことが確かにあった。しかし、何故かは知らないがそのときbotでないと判断してしまったのだ。一度疑って、botでないと判断したらもうbotと思えなくなる。@ha_maにいたってはbot と疑いすらしなかった。「あれ？マジで@ha_maの中の人って女なのかな？」とか思っていたくらいだ。
I think the very first bot I ever met was @bomtter , the bot that sparked the twitter “ Bakuhatsu shiro ! [ “ Explode ! ” ] trend .
And then there was @wakatter , another similar bot that became pretty popular .
A bit later on , there were artificial chatting bots like @kyoujin that came out .
You could spot at a glance that these twitter users were bots , that was their common characteristic .
They either posted canned phrases that were totally out - of - context , or they posted artificial - sounding phrases that were clearly not written by a human .
The two friends of mine [ @donsuke and @ha_ma ] who I had been following in the time since these earlier bots hit the limelight , however , were different .
I do n't remember whether I followed him first or vice versa , but certainly I had my initial doubts just after I started following @donsuke that maybe he was a bot .
But for some reason , I do n't really remember why now , I reached the conclusion that he was not a bot .
And once I had doubted him once , then judged that he was n't a bot , I could no longer think of him as a bot anymore .
On the other hand , I never even suspected that @ha_ma was a bot .
I was wondering more about whether she was really a “ she ” or not .
しかし、よくよく考えてみれば、ほとんどのtwitter-erとはリアルで接触することはないだろう。twitterという媒介を通してしか僕と話せない人ばかりなのだ。結局リアル知り合い以外の大半の人は、人間ではなく「twitterのアカウント」でしかない。中の人がbotかどうかなど関係ない。アニメアイコンの人は実際にそんな可愛い顔をしているのだろうし、堀北真希のアイコンの人はきっと本物の堀北真希なのだろうと信じきっていくことにする。
But then , when I really think about it , I hardly have any real contact with most twitter users .
They 're all people I talk to exclusively through this intermediary , twitter .
In the end , apart from real acquaintances , the majority of these people are not humans , but just “ twitter accounts ” .
It really has nothing to do with whether they 're bots or not .
I just trust completely that a person with an anime icon actually has a really cute face , and that a person with an icon of Maki Horikita must definitely be Maki Horikita .
とにもかくにもプログラムと仲良くなるという貴重な体験が出来たことはとても幸せなことだ。
In any case , the fact that I was able to have such a valuable experience with someone who was actually a [ computer ] program makes me very happy .

Anti-virus - 1 is a new rogue anti-spyware program from the same family as Antivirus 2010 and Antivirus 360 .
This program is promoted primarily through two methods .
The first is through the use of advertisements that pretend to be online anti-malware scanners .
These advertisements go through what appears to be a scan of your machine and then when finished , state that your computer is infected and that you should download Anti-virus - 1 to protect yourself .
Remember , though , that this is just an advertisement and it has no way of knowing what is running on your computer .
The second method that is used to promote this rogue is through the use of Trojans .
When certain Trojans are installed on your computer they will display security alerts stating that your computer is infected or that you have some other security risk .
When you click on these alerts , it will download and install Anti-virus - 1 onto your computer .
When Anti-virus - 1 is installed it will configure itself to start automatically when Windows starts .
It will also modify your C : \Windows \System32 \drivers\etc\hosts file so that when you visit certain sites you will be go to a site under the malware developer 's control rather than the legitimate site you were expecting to go to .
This allows them to show you information that further promotes the Anti-virus - 1 program .
When the program is started it will automatically scan your computer and then display a list of infections that cannot be removed unless you first purchase the program .
The infections that it will show include Spyware .
IEMonster.d , Zlob.PornAdvertiser.ba , Spyware .
IMMonitor , Infostealer .
Banker .E , and Dialer.Xpehbam.biz_dialer among many others .
All of these infections do not actually exist on your computer , but are only being shown to scam you into thinking that you have infections on your computer .
While the program is running you will also see security alerts in the form of a balloon appearing from the Windows taskbar .
These alerts will have messages like :
Spyware activity alert !
Spyware .IEMonster activity detected .
It is spyware that attempts to steal passwords from Internet Explorer , Mozilla Firefox , Outlook and other programs , including logins and passwords from online banking sessions , eBay , PayPal . and svchost.exe
Internal conflict alert .
Anti-virus - 1 detected internal software conflict .
Some applicztion < sic > tries to get access to system kernel ( such behavior is typical to Spyware / Malware ) .
It may cause crash of your computer .
You may also encounter what appears to be a crash screen , or Blue Screen of Death , that states SPYWARE .
MONSTER .
FX_WILD has been detected .
Your computer will then pretend to reboot and in the fake Windows boot screen you will see the following message under the Windows logo :
Your Anti-virus - 1 copy is unregistered .
Microsoft Security recommends you to activate your antivirus protection software .
When you see these fake taskbar alerts , blue screen crashes , and reboots , please do not be alarmed as they are all fake .
In fact the blue screen crash , and the subsequent reboot , are just a screen saver run by the c: \Documents and Settings \All Users \Application Data\AV1\svchost.exe file .
In reality your computer never crashed or rebooted .
Though Anti-virus - 1 may look like a legitimate anti-malware program it is important to remember that these programs are scripted to always show that you have infections .
This program , when run will always show you the same infections , the same alerts , and the same warnings .
It does this for one reason and only one reason .
To scare you into thinking you are infected and thus you purchase their software .
Instead of doing so , please use the free removal guide outlined below to remove Anti-virus - 1 and the malware that was installed with it .
A diamond ring .
Scientists have calculated that wurtzite boron nitride and lonsdaleite ( hexagonal diamond ) both have greater indentation strengths than diamond .
Source : English Wikipedia .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Currently , diamond is regarded to be the hardest known material in the world .
But by considering large compressive pressures under indenters , scientists have calculated that a material called wurtzite boron nitride ( w - BN ) has a greater indentation strength than diamond .
The scientists also calculated that another material , lonsdaleite ( also called hexagonal diamond , since it ’s made of carbon and is similar to diamond ) , is even stronger than w - BN and 58 percent stronger than diamond , setting a new record .
This analysis marks the first case where a material exceeds diamond in strength under the same loading conditions , explain the study ’s authors , who are from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the University of Nevada , Las Vegas .
The study is published in a recent issue of Physical Review Letters .
“ The new finding from our results is that large normal compressive pressures under indenters can transform certain materials ( such as w - BN and lonsdaleite ) into new superhard structures that are harder than diamond , ” coauthor Changfeng Chen from the University of Nevada , Las Vegas , told PhysOrg.com .
“ This is a new mechanism that can be used to design new superhard materials . ”
The scientists explain that the superior strength of w - BN and lonsdaleite is due to the materials ’ structural reaction to compression .
Normal compressive pressures under indenters cause the materials to undergo a structural phase transformation into stronger structures , conserving volume by flipping their atomic bonds .
The scientists explain that w- BN and lonsdaleite have subtle differences in the directional arrangements of their bonds compared with diamond , which is responsible for their unique structural reaction .
Under large compressive pressures , w - BN increases its strength by 78 percent compared with its strength before bond - flipping .
The scientists calculated that w- BN reaches an indentation strength of 114 GPa ( billions of pascals ) , well beyond diamond ’s 97 GPa under the same indentation conditions .
In the case of lonsdaleite , the same compression mechanism also caused bond - flipping , yielding an indentation strength of 152 GPa , which is 58 percent higher than the corresponding value of diamond .
“ Lonsdaleite is even stronger than w - BN because lonsdaleite is made of carbon atoms and w - BN consists of boron and nitrogen atoms , ” Chen explained .
“ The carbon - carbon bonds in lonsdaleite are stronger than boron - nitrogen bonds in w - BN .
This is also why diamond ( with a cubic structure ) is stronger than cubic boron nitride ( c - BN ) . ”
Until recently , normal compressive pressures under indenters have not been included in the calculations of ideal shear strengths of crystals from first principles , but latest developments have enabled researchers to consider their effects , resulting in surprising discoveries like the one shown here .
Still , experimenting with w- BN and lonsdaleite will be challenging , since both materials are difficult to synthesize in large quantities .
However , another recent study has taken a promising approach to producing nanocomposites of w - BN and c - BN , which may also provide a way to synthesize nanocomposites containing lonsdaleite and diamond .
In addition , by showing the underlying atomistic mechanism that can strengthen some materials , this work may provide new approaches for designing superhard materials .
As Chen explained , superhard materials that exhibit other superior properties are highly desirable for applications in many fields of science and technology .
“ High hardness is only one important characteristic of superhard materials , ” Chen said .
“ Thermal stability is another key factor since many superhard materials need to withstand extreme high - temperature environments as cutting and drilling tools and as wear , fatigue and corrosion resistant coatings in applications ranging from micro- and nano - electronics to space technology .
For all carbon - based superhard materials , including diamond , their carbon atoms will react with oxygen atoms at high temperatures ( at around 600 °C ) and become unstable .
So designing new , thermally more stable superhard materials is crucial for high - temperature applications .
Moreover , since most common superhard materials , such as diamond and cubic - BN , are semiconductors , it is highly desirable to design superhard materials that are conductors or superconductors .
In addition , superhard magnetic materials are key components in various recording devices . ”

Prop. 8 backers splinter as court fight resumes CALIFORNIA
Yes on 8 campaign distances itself from more conservative opponents of gay rights
Gay marriage opponent Randy Thomasson urged lawmakers to reject a same - sex marriage bill before the Senate Judiciary committee during a hearing held at the Capitol in Sacramento , Calif. , Tuesday , July 12 , 2005 .
The measure , by Assemblyman Mark Leno , D - San Francisco , background , is similar to a same - sex marriage bill that was defeated in the Assembly in June .
Despite the opposition it was approved 4 - 1 by the committee .

The group that persuaded California voters this month to pass Proposition 8 , which bans same - sex marriage , now is fighting its friends as well as its foes .
Other conservative groups that loudly backed Prop. 8 are being targeted as too extreme and off - putting by ProtectMarriage.com , which put the constitutional amendment on the Nov. 4 ballot and hopes to help persuade the state Supreme Court to uphold the measure .
" We represent the people who got things done , who got Prop. 8 passed , " said Andrew Pugno , general counsel for the Yes on Prop. 8 campaign .
" An important part of defending Prop. 8 is eliminating arguments not helpful to our concerns . "
Pugno , for example , persuaded the Supreme Court last week to bar the Campaign for California Families from intervening in the court case over the validity of Prop. 8 and the same - sex marriage ban .
" That organization represents the extreme fringe and is not representative of the coalition that got it passed , " Pugno said .
" They did n't even support Prop. 8 until sometime in the summer . "
People associated with the group did n't expect the Prop. 8 campaign 's efforts to push them to the sidelines .
" I'm surprised , because we 've litigated beside each other for 4 1/2 years " in the unsuccessful effort to keep the Supreme Court from overturning Prop. 22 same - sex marriage ban in 2000 , said Mathew Staver , founder of Liberty Counsel , which represents the Campaign for California Families .
" We have the same goal , which is to defend Prop. 8 . "
The group , now known as the Campaign for Children and Families , is run by Randy Thomasson , who for years has been one of California 's most visible opponents of gay rights and what he bills as " the homosexual agenda . "
The people behind Prop. 8 have been butting heads with Thomasson for years , arguing that his efforts to outlaw same - sex marriage and curb domestic partnership arrangements are a long step further than a majority of California voters is willing to go .
In 2005 and again in January , Thomasson and his allies proposed initiatives that not only would bar same - sex marriage but that also " voids or makes unenforceable " rights conferred by California law on couples , gay or heterosexual , registered as domestic partners , including community property , child custody , hospital visitation and insurance benefits .
" It was like the nuclear option to obliterate the entire domestic partners law , " Pugno said .
" We were constantly hassled by that organization , who thought we were n't aggressive enough . "
Limiting the range of the ballot measure - and making a point to avoid direct attacks on gays , lesbians and same - sex couples during the campaign - made political sense for the Prop. 8 strategists .
Of the 31 " defense of marriage " measures that have gone on ballots across the nation , the only one that lost was a 2006 Arizona constitutional amendment that also would have banned legal recognition of many domestic partnership benefits .
When Arizona groups put a measure on the Nov. 4 ballot aimed solely at barring same - sex marriage , it passed easily .
A Field Poll released in May showed that nearly a third of California voters opposed same - sex marriage , but still believed gay and lesbian couples should be allowed to have civil unions granting them the rights of married couples .
Surveys done earlier this year by GOP pollsters also showed that any measure attacking domestic partnership rights had little or no chance of passing in California .
" We wanted to be singularly focused on defending and protecting marriage , " Pugno said .
Different views
Policy disputes should n't spill over into public attacks , said Staver .
" The CCF originally had a version of the marriage amendment that was much larger and comprehensive , but they abandoned that and supported Prop. 8 , " he said .
" Different people have different views .
Moving in the same direction to protect marriage is more important than singing from the same song sheet . "
But the disputes between the groups have grown in the past few days , with Thomasson launching an all - out attack against the Supreme Court for accepting the challenge to Prop.
8 , a court decision Pugno and others from ProtectMarriage.com had welcomed .
" If the court disobeys the constitution by voiding Prop. 8 , it will ignite a voter revolt , " Thomasson said in statement released after the court agreed Wednesday to hear arguments over the validity of the constitutional amendment .
" The court is playing with fire by threatening to destroy the people 's vote on marriage . "
Pugno and others from the Prop. 8 campaign want to avoid such fiery challenges and threats to the court and keep matters on a quiet legal level until the court rules on same - sex marriage sometime after March .
" What we are not doing is discussing the possibility of recalling justices who oppose us , " Ron Prentice , chairman of the Yes on Prop. 8 effort , said in an e-mail to supporters Wednesday .
" Making threats to recall justices from office is counterproductive and harmful to our chances of winning in court . "
Fundraising , publicity
Money also is part of the dispute .
While ProtectMarriage.com collected almost all of the nearly $ 40 million raised to back Prop.
8 , Thomasson 's group and others gathered money to support their own efforts to pass the same - sex marriage ban .
But Prentice argued that " some other groups are attempting to use the passage of Prop. 8 for fundraising and publicity purposes , " and Pugno said his group had unsuccessfully tried to stop the groups from claiming they were part of the official Prop. 8 effort .
Ballot measures do n't belong to anyone or any group , Staver argued for the Campaign for Children and Families .
" There were a lot of different organizations and people that supported Prop. 8 , but not through the official campaign , " he said .
" Did we give money directly to them ?
No .
But did we encourage people to support Prop.
8 ? Absolutely . "
This depression is historic in many ways , but one way that does n’t get talked about a lot is that it ’s the first time America has had a credit - based downturn with a government that is a major existing factor in the economy .
Before the Great Depression , in the 1920s , government spending at all levels was around 15 % of personal income .
Today , it ’s close to 50 % .
Sure , government spending shot up under FDR , but the point is it shot up from virtually nothing .
What happens when you hit a depression when government spending is already over one third of GDP before the depression ?
So , we have this situation where there is a huge economic entity that is about to see its income drop precipitously , as tax revenues fall off a cliff .
Whether by spending cuts or inflationary printing , future real government contributions to the economy are going to have to decline .
It ’s easy to forget , but the government does n’t actually make anything .
Whatever money they spend either comes from the present or the future or from inflating the currency , but either way it is a hole that has to be filled sometime .
Due to the large delay between the effects of a downturn and government spending , this will take a while to play out , and it ’s a huge overhanging issue that has yet to completely hit the proverbial fan .
Here ’s the thing that scares me about all of this : one of the tenets of control theory is that having a strong feedback loop with a large delay in any system is a good recipe for instability , and yet that ’s exactly what we have when the government becomes such a large factor in the economy .
Of course , an economy is not a model system , and it could never experience runaway instability like a linear circuit could .
But if there are forces pushing it towards instability , I ’d argue the result may not be exponentially growing oscillations , but it wo n’t be good .
Humans do n’t like unstable systems , especially when their money is involved , and rather than suffer oscillations , I suspect the economy would just fall and stay down .
Why has n’t this happened before ?
Well , one likely possibility is that I ’m completely out of my mind to be applying principles of control theory to the national economy .
But another is that we ’ve simply never tied this big of a feedback loop around our economy before .
The last time we had a credit dislocation , perhaps government was small enough that these oscillations were damped .
But the gain is way up , now , and I ’m a little nervous to see what happens now that the system has been given a big kick .
1 The Wave ( between Arizona and Utah – USA )
A red-rock stunner on the border of Arizona and Utah , The Wave is made of 190 - million - year - old sand dunes that have turned to rock .
This little - known formation is accessible only on foot via a three - mile hike and highly regulated .
2 Antelope Canyon ( Arizona – USA )
The most visited and photographed slot canyon in the American Southwest , the Antelope Canyon is located on Navajo land near Page , Arizona .
It includes two separate , photogenic slot canyon sections , referred to individually as Upper Antelope Canyon –or “ The Crack ” – and Lower Antelope Canyon –or “ The Corkscrew . ”
The Navajo name for Upper Antelope Canyon is Tse ’ bighanilini , which means “ the place where water runs through rocks . ”
Lower Antelope Canyon is Hasdestwazi , or “ spiral rock arches . ”
Both are located within the LeChee Chapter of the Navajo Nation .
3 Great Blue Hole ( Belize )
Part of the Lighthouse Reef System , The Great Blue Hole lies approximately 60 miles off the mainland out of Belize City .
A large , almost perfectly circular hole approximately one quarter of a mile ( 0.4 km ) across , it ’s one of the most astounding dive sites to be found anywhere on earth .
Inside this hole , the water is 480 feet ( 145 m ) deep and it is the depth of water which gives the deep blue color that causes such structures throughout the world to be known as “ blue holes . ”
4 Crystal Cave of the Giants ( Mexico )
Found deep inside a mine in southern Chihuahua Mexico , these crystals were formed in a natural cave totally enclosed in bedrock .
A geode full of spectacular crystals as tall as pine trees , and in some cases greater in circumference , they are a translucent gold and silver in color and come in many incredible forms and shapes .
The Crystal Cave of the Giants was discovered within the same limestone body that hosts the silver - zinc - lead ore bodies exploited by the mine and it was probably dissolved by the same hydrothermal fluids that deposited the metals with the gypsum being crystallized during the waning stages of mineralization .
5 Eye of the Sahara ( Mauritania )
This spectacular landform in Mauritania in the southwestern part of the Sahara desert is so huge with a diameter of 30 miles that it is visible from space .
Called Richat Structure –or the Eye of the Sahara — the The formation was originally thought to be caused by a meteorite impact but now geologists believe it is a product of uplift and erosion .
The cause of its circular shape is still a mystery .
6 Blue Lake Cave ( Brazil )
Mato Grosso do Sul region in Brazil ( and especially the quiet town of Bonito ) boasts many marvelous underground lakes : Gruta do Lago Azul , Gruta do Mimoso , Aquário Natural .
The world famous “ Gruta do Lago Azul ” ( Blue Lake Cave ) is a natural monument whose interior is formed by stalactites , stalagmites and a huge and wonderful blue lake .
The beauty of the lake is something impressive .
The Blue Lake Cave has a big variety of geological formation but impresses mainly for the deep blue colored water of its inside lake .
7 Giants Causeway ( Ireland )
An area of about 40,000 interlocking basalt columns , the Giants Causeway is a result of an ancient volcanic eruption .
Located on the north - east coast of Northern Ireland , most of its columns are hexagonal , although there are also some with four , five , seven and eight sides .
The tallest are about 12 meters ( 36 ft ) high , and the solidified lava in the cliffs is 28 meters thick in places .
In a 2005 poll of Radio Times readers , the causeway was named as the fourth greatest natural wonder in the United Kingdom .
8 Hell Gate ( Turkmenistan )
Called by locals
The Door to Hell , this place in Turkmenistan is situated near the small town of Darvaz .
When geologists were drilling for gas , 35 years ago , they suddenly found an underground cavern that was so big , all the drilling site with all the equipment and camps got deep deep under the ground .
None dared to go down there because the cavern was filled with gas , so they ignited it so that no poisonous gas could come out of the hole , and since then , it has been burning .
Nobody knows how many tons of excellent gas has been burned for all those years but it just seems to be infinite .
9 Wave Rock ( Australia )
The Wave Rock is a natural rock formation located in western Australia .
It derives its name from the fact that it is shaped like a tall breaking ocean wave .
The total outcrop covers several hectares ; the “ wave ” part of the rock is about 15 meters high and approximately 110 meters long .
One aspect of Wave Rock rarely shown on photographs is the retaining wall about halfway up the rock .
This follows the contours and allows rainwater to be collected in a dam .
It was constructed in 1951 by the Public Works Department , and such walls are common on many similar rocks in the wheatbelt .
10 Chocolate Hills ( Philippines )
Composed of around 1,268 perfectly cone - shaped hills of about the same size spread over an area of more than 50 square kilometres ( 20 sq mi ) , this highly unusual geological formation , called Chocolate Hills , is located in Bohol , Philippines .
There are a number of hypotheses regarding the formation of the hills .
These include simple limestone weathering , sub-oceanic volcanism , the uplift of the seafloor and a more recent theory which maintains that as an ancient active volcano self - destructed , it spewed huge blocks of stone which were then covered with limestone and later thrust forth from the ocean bed .
I ’ve read a few comments about why Haskell is awesome .
I even wrote an ironic blog post about it .
Today I ’m going to explain why I use Haskell for doing real work , entirely in terms of the tools Haskell developers use .
Edit : Immediately after posting , I found this article on Sententia cdsmith about reasons why Haskell is a good language .
So between this post on tools and his post on the language , I think we ’ve got our bases covered :)
Availability of quality libraries
I first really came into appreciating libraries by way of Perl ’s CPAN , probably around 1999 .
These days I ’m absolutely convinced that your language needs to have a searchable , cross- referenced , dependency - tracking library repository .
For Haskell , it ’s Hackage .
Hackage has many desirable qualities : Packages are written to work together rather than compete with one another .
Searching for packages by name or description is performed by Google , and has all of the quality you ’d expect as a result .
But Hackage has another search option , which brings me to my next point …
Searching for Haskell Code
Haskell is strongly - typed and purely - functional .
Good Haskell style is all about writing tiny functions ( one- liners ! ) and remaining abstract ( code - reuse ! ) .
These qualities make the type signature of a function very telling .
Think about how many times you ’ve been working with data in one format and needed a function that could convert it to something else .
You ’d like to avoid writing the function yourself ( code - reuse ! ) but do n’t know what it is called .
How would you find it ?
Google around with related terms ?
Ask a mailing list ?
The Haskell community has two search engines that trivially solve this problem : Hooge and Hayoo !.
These engines can search for a function by name or by its type signature ; and Hayoo ! is linked into Hackage , so it is able to tell you which library contains the function you want .
Here ’s a concrete example : I ’ve got a list of numbers , and I want to split it up into two lists — one consisting of the evens , one consisting of the odds .
This seems like a pretty specialized task , so I doubt there ’s a function written for it explicitly .
So let ’s look for a function that takes a list , and a boolean test , and splits it into two lists — one consisting of the elements satisfying the test , and the other consisting of the elements that do n’t .
That is , I need a function that takes a list of integers , and a function from integers to bools , and produces two lists of integers .
No problem : I jump over to Hoogle and search for functions of type [ Int ] -> ( Int -> Bool ) -> ( [ Int ] , [ Int ] ) .
It produces a short list of results , tells me what library they are in , and even gives a brief description of what the function does .
I quickly see that partition is the function I want .
Remember that Hayoo ! works in conjunction with Hackage , so that I have this ability for all of the libraries in the standard repository .
What other language is so centralized ?
Project Management
We ’ve got all the usual things — source control by darcs , unit testing by HUnit , automated testing by Quick Check , and source documentation by Haddock .
We ’ve also got package management by Cabal ( tied into Hackage , of course ) .
We ’ve got one other tool that is perhaps the strongest reason for the language — the Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler .
You wo n’t find a more advanced compiler anywhere on earth .
It produces code that is performance - competitive with C , has built in support for profiling , and features a rich interactive mode that both helps you test code and also explore types and interfaces .
Technology
For many people , the initial draw to Haskell is the advanced technology that is built into the language .
Haskell was originally drafted as a “ language playground , ” giving researchers a place to experiment with new ideas .
Over time it has adapted to keep the experiments that worked .
Today it stands alone in its simultaneous support for many language features that the mainstream world probably wo n’t see for at least another 10 years .
This stuff is n’t just syntactic sugar , either .
Haskell probably has better support for concurrency than any other language , due to a combination of its pure semantics , modern memory sharing techniques , and data - driven parallelism .
To get a sense for how wildly amazing Haskell - related technology , check out Automatic generation of free theorems — a tool that , given a function ’s type signature , can write a function for you that has the correct signature !
You wo n’t find this kind of thing anywhere else .
Community
Lastly we come to one of the most special features that Haskell offers : its unique developer community .
The Haskell community is famous for its strange blend of pure academics , working engineers , and tinkering hobbyists .
The community has active mailing lists where people pour unimaginable amounts of time into giving each other detailed and useful answers .
It is not at all uncommon for the discussion on the lists to lead to groundbreaking developments in Haskell development .
The community also has one of the most active language - centric IRC channels , complete with an IRC bot that evaluates Haskell code publicly , giving everyone a chance to experiment with code together in real - time .
Of course , the community does the “ web 2.0 ” thing as well : we ’ve got an active reddit , tons of active and insightful blogs , an electronic magazine , a Wikibook , and a weekly newsletter of online Haskell community happenings .
Conclusions
Haskell programmers generally feel like they ’ve caught on to something very special .
Every day there are new developments in the community that push the boundaries of technology , enabling people to write sophisticated programs in less time and with greater reliability .
There really is a sense that we ’re playing with the toys of the future , which have somehow been gifted to us today .
It ’s a strange language — far enough ahead of the others that it can be tricky for beginners — but it really has quite a bit to offer .
And with the availability of the supporting tools we ’ve just looked at , it is beyond ready for prime time .

In Interfaces , Similar Things Should Have Similar Names ( and Vice Versa )
A good interface usability rule - of - thumb is : when two things do the same , name them the same ... but when two things do something different , name them differently .
This streamlines your site and makes actions more expectable , and expectability enhances usability .
To give you an example of a particular offender of the second part of the rule – when two things do something different , name them differently – take Reddit ’s comment edit functionality .
Here ’s what the interface looks like before you edit your comment :
It ’s pretty obvious you need to click “ edit ” when you want to edit your comment .
And sure enough , you ’ll learn to associate the word “ edit ” with “ start editing a comment ” at Reddit .
Now when you do click edit , an interface like the following expands :
When you ’re done editing , what do you click ?
The button is named “ edit ” , but this is not the most intuitive name – because you learned to associate “ edit ” with “ start editing a comment . ”
Of course , it may only take a very small , perhaps second - long delay and you ’ll understand what you need to do ( you need to click the “ edit ” button again ) .
But you ’ve just been made to think , and that ’s something interfaces should avoid doing to us .
The “ thinking ” part should be reserved for a site ’s content ( and only when the interface is intended to challenge you , like for artistic reasons , does it become part of the content ) .
To see how that interface should have been done , take a look at Friendfeed .
There , entering the edit mode is called More ->
“ Edit this entry ” , but the button to save the comment is called by what it does , “ Save ” ( and it is weighted more strongly than the canceling action ) :

I ’ve felt the cold - weather cravings for piping - hot soup and stew , but outside of my daily coffee and tea , I do n’t drink enough hot drinks this time of year .
With at least six more weeks of winter in front of us , however , I ’ve been trying to change that .
More than just a nightcap or occasional comfort for a sore throat , a hot drink makes you stop and smell the bourbon ; it ’s the perfect melding of teatime and happy hour .
Unfortunately , the only hot adult beverages that usually make it on to a bar ’s drink menu involve coffee and liqueur .
These after - dinner drinks often taste more like a dessert .
Bailey ’s and coffee is one of my all - time favorite smells , but it ’s not something I order at 6:00 when I ’m meeting a friend after work .
A hot toddy , however , fits the bill .
Toddys are often easier to make as a nightcap at home than to order out .
Ask for a toddy in the majority of bars , and you ’ll likely get some anemic , half - assed whiskey - water blend with a lemon .
I consider a hot toddy to be any spirit paired with a hot beverage — in any combination that does n’t already have its own name .
Add a sweetener or a citrus garnish if you so choose .
Think hot apple cider and whiskey ; hot cocoa and Jägermeister ; herbal tea and bourbon .
My favorite toddy , a Blueberry Tea , has an aroma so heady the payoff is worth the silly name .
Ask your bartender for a pot of Earl Grey tea and a mug containing a shot that ’s half each brandy and amaretto .
Add to the shot at least twice that much tea , and take a big whiff — oddly , it smells like blueberry pie hot out of the oven .
Any highly aromatic tea will do the trick , even some herbal - tea variety like ginger - lemon .
After shopping for supplies in the Pike Place Market the other day , I snuck down the hallway between Don & Joe ’s and Pike Place Fish to Place Pigalle , the city ’s best place for hot toddies .
There I spent the afternoon gazing at the tumultuous bay , sipping on armagnac with black tea .
One of the all - time most delicious , and most often butchered , hot drinks is hot buttered rum .
Mix hot water with a healthy shot of dark rum and a pat of butter loaded with spices and a little sugar .
The butter adds an amazing mouthfeel and flavor — as long as you drink the buttered rum before it cools off .
Stay away from mass - produced buttered rum batters ; they taste like chemicals and leave a nasty film in your mouth , like fake whipped topping .
Around these parts , if you look in the dairy section , you may find bright yellow tubs of Harvey ’s Buttered Rum Batter kicking it next to the eggnog .
The batter is still made in Bremerton according to a recipe Harvey Hudson developed more than 50 years ago .
Harvey ’s mix turns boiling water and rum into Seattle ’s official winter warmer .
Hudson ’s spiced butter is pleasantly nutmeg - centric , making it perfect for hot buttered brown anything , be it rum , bourbon , or brandy .

CANBERRA ( Reuters ) - Drought in Australia ’s main food growing region of the Murray - Darling river system continues , with water stores near record lows despite recent rains , the head of the government ’s oversight body for the system said on Wednesday .
Cracks are seen in a dried - up dam near the western New South Wales town of Parkes , located over 400 kilometres west of Sydney March 7 , 2007 .

The long - running drought has hit irrigated crops such as rice , grapes and horticulture hardest , but has had less impact on wheat with good falls of rainfall in grain - growing areas to the north of the Murray - Darling River basin .
“ The immediate prospects are not good as only about 10 percent of Murray system inflows normally occur between February and May , and the latest rainfall outlook from the Bureau of Meteorology shows only neutral conditions across the Basin for the next three months , ” said Rob Freeman , chief executive of the Murrary - Darling Basin Authority .
The Murray - Darling basin , which is as large as France and Germany combined , accounts for 41 percent of Australia ’s agriculture and provides A $ 21 billion ( $ 13.54 billion ) worth of farm exports to Asia and the Middle East .
Around 70 percent of irrigated agriculture comes from the basin .
Dry land wheat crops are also grown in the region but crops have struggled in recent years .
The region contributed little to a boost in Australia ’s wheat production to 20 million tons for the just completed 2008 / 09 harvest from 13 million tons harvested a year earlier .
The drought has already wiped more than A$ 20 billion from the $ 1 trillion economy since 2002 .
It is the worst in 117 years of record - keeping , with 80 percent of eucalyptus trees already dead or stressed in the Murray - Darling region .
Freeman said the volume of useable water in storage was now 1,470 gigaliters , or 16 percent of capacity , slightly higher than at the end of January last year , but well below the January long term average of 5,400 GL .
A recent heatwave across the country ’s southeast and lower than normal flows had also increased the risk of algal blooms and aquatic plant growth along the river , also bringing three mass fish kills due to high water temperatures .
Freeman said the prospects for irrigation in 2009 - 10 would depend on future rainfall and system inflows , though enough water would be carried over to meet critical human needs , with the basin home to 2 million people .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Nissan Motor
Co said it would cut 20,000 jobs and joined a growing list of automakers warning of red ink this year in what would mark its first loss since Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn took the reins a decade ago .
The spreading global recession has put consumers off buying expensive goods and even if they wanted to purchase a car , financing has become difficult due to a dearth of credit .
Saddled with excess capacity and headcount and with sales plummeting in developed markets , Japan ’s No.3 automaker has already taken a number of steps to cut production and staff , including through 1,200 voluntary buyouts in the United States .
With these and other measures , including reducing 12,000 jobs in Japan mostly through natural attrition , Nissan said it would reduce groupwide headcount by a total 20,000 by the end of March 2010 , equivalent to 8.5 percent of the workforce .
Nissan , 44 percent - owned by Renault SA , now expects an operating loss -- its first in 14 years -- of 180 billion yen ( $ 2 billion ) for the year to March 31 , instead of the 270 billion yen profit it projected three months ago .
Consensus forecasts from 19 analysts had put the loss at 70 billion yen .
Nissan expects its net loss at 265 billion yen instead of a 160 billion yen profit .
“ Earnings are going to be bad at automakers for some time , ” said Tomomi Yamashita , senior fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management .
“ You ’ve got the currency problem and the amount of production adjustment that ’s ahead , ” he said , adding that automakers could be in the red for a few more quarters .
Last week , Toyota Motor Corp tripled its annual operating loss forecast citing a faster - than - expected sales slump in the main U.S. , Japanese and European markets .
Honda Motor
Co also cut its forecast last month , but expects to stay in the black .
In the year to March 31 , Nissan said it would produce 3,069,000 vehicles , or 20 percent less than it had planned at the start of the business year .
It expects sales of 3,382,000 vehicles in 2008/09 , down 10.3 percent from last year .
For the October - December third quarter , Nissan made an operating loss of 99.2 billion yen and a net loss of 83.2 billion yen .
A year ago , it made an operating profit of 211.9 billion yen and net profit of 132.2 billion yen .
Third - quarter revenue fell about a third to 1.8 trillion yen .

COUNTER -MEASURES
With the triple blow of a credit crisis , recession and a strong yen making life tough for Japanese automakers , Nissan outlined steps to save cash and focus on a healthy balance sheet .
Specifically , Nissan said it would aim to return to positive free cash flow next business year even as it assumes the global vehicle market will shrink to 55 million units in 2009 from 62 million last year , and for the dollar to average 90 yen .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
The efforts will focus on three areas : recovering profit , preserving cash and pursuing deeper savings with Renault , details of which would be outlined in three months .
To that end , Nissan said it would cut labor costs by a fifth in high - cost regions such as Japan , the United States and Europe , including by reducing high - ranking officials ’ salaries by 10 percent .
No bonus will be paid to directors this year .
Nissan will also negotiate work - sharing schemes .
Nissan plans to reduce capital spending this year by 21 percent to 384 billion yen , and a further 14 percent in 2009 / 10 to 330 billion yen or lower if necessary , including by suspending its participation in a factory project led by Renault in Morocco .
“ All these actions and countermeasures are not merely short - term fixes , ” Ghosn told a news conference in Tokyo .
“ They will enable our company to recover and secure a more competitive position that will benefit Nissan long after the current crisis subsides . ”
Ghosn said he was putting Chief Operating Officer Toshiyuki Shiga in charge of functional operations , mirroring a structure introduced at Renault in October with COO Patrick Pelata at the top .
Both will continue to report to Ghosn .
SINKING VALUE
Shares in Japanese automakers have tumbled cross the board in the last year but Nissan has fallen harder than Toyota and Honda , which have healthier balance sheets and liquidity positions .
Rising debt at Renault , in which Nissan holds 15 percent , has also raised worries about any knock - on effects on the Japanese automaker .
Nissan ’s shares have dived more than 70 percent in the last 12 months , while Toyota and Honda are down 47 percent and 30 percent .
Nissan has shed $ 12 billion in market value since Ghosn arrived from Renault to rescue Nissan in 1999 .
Nissan ’s shares are the worst performer in the domestic auto sector in the year to date , falling 13 percent against a 7 percent rise in Tokyo ’s transport sub-index .
The stock ended down 5.8 percent at 261 yen ahead of the results .

( NaturalNews ) Adults who are having trouble remembering things may be able to boost their mental performance with only moderate physical activity , according to a study conducted by researchers from the University of Melbourne , Australia , and published in the " Regular exercise is one of the best ways to reduce your risk of dementia and can help slow progression of the condition , " said Susanne Sorensen of the Alzheimer 's Society .
" This study demonstrates that exercise improves cognition in people with mild cognitive impairment , and that there is a lasting effect even after the exercise intervention stops .
" Researchers conducted the study on 138 adults over the age of 50 who were suffering from mild memory problems but did not have dementia .
One portion of the group was assigned to take part in a 50 - minute exercise session three times per week , while the rest was not assigned to any exercise .
The exercise sessions consisted of moderate physical activity like walking .
After 24 weeks , participants in the exercise group had significantly higher cognitive function and exhibited fewer dementia symptoms than participants in the control group .
" To our knowledge , this trial is the first to demonstrate that exercise improves cognitive function in older adults with subjective and objective mild cognitive impairment , " the researchers said .
" The benefits of physical activity were apparent after six months and persisted for at least another 12 months after the intervention had been discontinued .
" The researchers noted that regular exercise is well - known to provide a wide variety of health benefits .
" Unlike medication , which was found to have no significant effect on mild cognitive impairment at 36 months , physical activity has the advantage of health benefits that are not confined to cognitive function alone , as suggested by findings on depression , quality of life , falls , cardiovascular function , and disability , " they said .

" The human race divides politically into those who want people to be controlled and those who have no such desire . "
~ Robert A. Heinlein ( 1907 — 1988 )
" The common man , finding himself in a world so excellent , technically and socially , believes it has been produced by nature , and never thinks of the personal efforts of highly endowed individuals which the creation of this new world presupposed .
Still less will he admit the notion that all these facilities still require the support of certain difficult human virtues , the least failure of which would cause the rapid disappearance of the whole magnificent edifice . "
~ José Ortega y Gasset ( 1883 — 1955 )
The glory years of Pax Romana can rightly be set as that period in Roman history from the beginning of Augustus ’ reign in 27 BC to the end of stoic Emperor Marcus Aurelius ’ reign in 180 AD .
The Christian apologist Tertullian ( 200 AD ) gives us an excellent example for how Rome was viewed during this period : “ Surely a glance at the world shows that it is daily being more cultivated and better peopled than before .
All places are now accessible , well known , open to commerce .
Delightful farms have now blotted out every trace of the dreadful wastes ; cultivated fields have supplanted woods ; flocks and herds have driven out wild beasts ; sandy spots are sown ; rocks and stones have been cleared away ; bogs have been drained .
Large towns now occupy lands hardly tenanted before by cottages .
Islands are no longer dreaded [ as the abode of pirates ] ; houses , people , civil rule , civilization are everywhere . ”
However , even as the ancient world basked in the glory of the Roman civilization its very foundation was decaying .
The causes for this decay and the eventual collapse of the Roman Empire have long been debated by historians and are generally attributed to one or more of the following :
Lack of Public
Health which led to relatively short lives among the wealthy and debased living conditions among the lower classes and the poor .
A marked decline in the morals and ethics among all Roman social classes as witnessed by the gladiatorial games , rampant prostitution , gluttony of the ruling class and alcoholism among all classes .
Certainly the wealth of the empire contributed to various forms of social and individual debauchery .
As one author put it : " The Roman Empire could n’t stand prosperity . "
Excessive government with its accompanying political corruption which can be demonstrated through the Roman state ’s use of the frumentarii or the Roman secret service .
It was the frumentarii that Emperor Hadrian engaged , to collect the corn throughout Roman ’s provinces .
This brought them in contact with local politics , and as spies for the emperor they gathered a wealth of intelligence concerning the people and their thinking throughout the empire .
This in turn earned those who spied for the emperor , the hatred of the people .
The people feared and hated the frumentarii so much that when in the third century ( 217 AD ) Macrinus appointed a former head of the frumentarii and prefect of the Praetorian Guard to the senate , he alienated a large portion of the Roman establishment against him , in effect signing his own death warrant which was summarily executed the next year .
This is not to excuse the gangster rulers of the latter part of the 3rd century nor the totalitarian , socialist state created by Diocletian , Constantine , and their successors which not only aided but exacerbated the destruction of the Roman society .
Excessive military spending with corresponding government projects and social programs which led , in due course , to inflation and then hyperinflation .
Inflation , price controls , and the state ’s attempt to completely regulate the Roman economy destroyed manufacturing along with the empire ’s agricultural base .
This swelled the unemployment rolls and sent large numbers of people to cities looking for either work or to get on the public dole .
Such was the desperation of the empire that in 274 AD Emperor Aurelian extended the relief rolls by making government subsidy a right of heredity .
He also replaced bread for the traditional wheat and added free pork , olive oil and salt to the rations , making the Roman state ’s war on wealth even more pronounced .
Inferior Technology is not often thought of as a reason for the decline and eventual collapse of the Roman Empire .
However , behind all the architectural grandeur that was Rome there was deadly lack of simple technology needed to advance , protect and sustain the Roman civilization .
From the early part of the second century there were no technical improvements in industry .
Roman tools were poor at best : men working in quarries , mines and construction were required to use brute force to make up for inadequate tools .
The Romans never devised a practical harness or horseshoes which would have made their draught animals more productive .
The Roman horse collar applied too much pressure to the animal ’s windpipe , causing choking , and greatly reducing the animal ’s ability to haul or do any heavy work .
The Roman military ’s inability to develop heavy cavalry to protect the empire was due to their failure to develop the simple stirrup , a failure that would haunt them in later years .
Civil war accompanied by external invasions .
Each of these points can be expanded or elaborated on to show their relationship to the ultimate collapse of the Roman Empire .
Certainly no serious student of history would dare ignore any of these lines of reasoning in studying the fall of the Roman Empire .
However , there is one further item that is rarely addressed but which should be of equal importance to understanding why great empires , like Rome , ultimately fail .
Whether we are talking about an autocracy , oligarchy , or democracy we are in the final analysis dealing with a coercive force which will become violent to attain its ends .
As the state increases its power base and the demands upon its citizens , it will seek to have a domineering effect upon the human spirit .
The result is the destruction of self - reliance , self - determination and self - confidence of free citizens and replacing them with a dutiful , subservient drone totally reliant on the state .
The pressure the state exerts on it subjects was not lost on Tacitus who bemoaned the servile mood of the Roman Senate under Tiberius in contrast to the character of the Senate during the building of the Empire .
Even Tiberius is reported to have said in disgust of the Roman senators : " O men , ready for slavery ! "
Three of the great writers of antiquity — Livy , Pliny the elder , and Tacitus — all recognized that the Roman society was becoming enslaved .
Livy felt it was because of the wealth and Pliny concurred that the lack of intellectual interests was the result of the worship of wealth .
Tacitus , however , stated that " genius died by the same blow that ended public liberty " laying the blame directly at the feet of the rising tyranny of the Roman state .
However , it is the unknown philosopher of Longinus ’
On The Sublime who pinpoints the cause when he says : " we of to - day , seem to have learnt in our childhood the lessons of a benignant despotism , to have been cradled in her habits and customs from the time when our minds were still tender , and never to have tasted the fairest and most fruitful fountain of eloquence , I mean liberty .
Hence we develop nothing but a fine genius for flattery .
This is the reason why , though all other faculties are consistent with the servile condition , no slave ever became an orator ; because in him there is a dumb spirit which will not be kept down : his soul is chained : he is like one who has learnt to be ever expecting a blow .
For , as Homer says — u2018 the day of slavery takes half our manly worth away . ’ "
In Catiline ’s War Gaius Sallustius Crispus opens his dissertation with this statement : " Every man who is anxious to surpass the lower animals should strive with all his power not to pass his life in obscurity like the brute beasts , which nature has made the groveling slaves of their bellies .
Now our whole ability resides jointly in our mind and body .
In the case of the mind it is its power of guidance , in the case of the body its obedient service that we rather use , sharing the former faculty with the gods , the latter with the brute creation … "
We may say then , without too much contradiction , that the real war between a free people and the state resides over who will control the mind : the individual or the state .
If it is the individual , society will continue to grow and flourish , while if the state wins control , the society rapidly decays , allowing the points often citied for the fall of the Roman Empire to occur .
What is reflected by these ancient authors is not merely loss of liberty but a mood of apathy .
This lethargy was prevalent throughout the empire and it was strictly due to the severe paternalism of the Roman state ; the result being the people had lost their will to succeed .
Curiosity was discouraged ; the history of the Roman Republic which had been the foundation for the Empire was bastardized , forgotten or ignored .
The accepted leaders of Roman cities were persecuted to the point they lost all their initiative and public spirit ; their every thought being subject to the whims of Rome .
For the general public the results were to suppress the entrepreneurial spirit , while in its place every effort was made , by the Roman citizen , to secure for himself and his family a docile and inactive life on a safe , if modest , income .
In short , almost every intellectual endeavor was discouraged , suppressed , or redirected , reducing the population to " groveling slaves of their bellies " and to the Roman Empire .
While history will judge when the American spirit of self - reliance , self - determination and self - confidence was destroyed we have an indication that its destruction is well advanced .
Recently I was sent an email asking me to take a civics quiz that was designed and issued by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute of Wilmington , Delaware .
While most LRC readers will find the quiz easy if not simplistic I was stunned to see the results when the quiz was issued to a random sample of Americans .
Testing their " knowledge of America ’s founding principles and texts , core history , and enduring institutions " showed that of the 2,508 respondents only 21 could pass it with a score 90 % or better ; 66 with 80 to 89.9 % ; 185 with 70 to 79.9 % and 445 with a " D " score of 60 to 69.9 % .
This left an unimaginable number ( 1,791 ) who were not able to pass this basic quiz .
What is worse is that the mean score of all who took the test is 49 % .
Now if that was n’t bad enough the ISI broke the score down and found that elected officials taking the test scored 5 % BELOW the mean with an average of 44 % .
The politicians ’ weakest points were the questions dealing with U.S. - Soviet Tension in 1962 , the Declaration of Independence , Sputnik and not surprisingly the definition of Free Enterprise .
This from those who believe they are supernaturally endowed to be the sole lord and arbiters of our private actions and property when they should be the brunt of our jokes and exiled from our midst .
I have often lamented that politicians always emanate from the dregs of society ; the historical proofs now have modern confirmation .
It is always dangerous to lay current events at the door of history and say because it happened before under these circumstances it will happen here and now .
But given the recent presidential campaign and the promise of " change " trumpeted by the president - elect I suspect that we are doomed to witness the destructive exploits of another Diocletian rather than the calming influence of an Augustus .
Given also that the society that elected the president - in - waiting is dominated by blind nationalism , trendy savior - worship , an unending ignorance of history , economics and philosophy and devoid of a critical thought process , I fear history will say of this moment , " the civilization of the modern world suffered final collapse . "
The American author and revolutionary Thomas Gordon wrote : " … [ I ]t is that we everywhere find tyranny and imposture , ignorance and slavery , joined together … " one then wonders how long America can last .

Olbermann to Rove : Newsflash !
' You guys leaked like hell ' David Edwards

While speaking to an audience at Loyola Marymount University the other week , former Bush adviser Karl Rove expressed his belief that government leaks to the media can cause serious damage .
On Wednesday 's Countdown , MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann told viewers , " Karl Rove is still talking .
The creator of the impermanent Republican majority , the possessor of the math that did not add up , telling an audience at Loyola Marymount University in L.A. that government leaks to the media can cause serious harm and newspapers should not run them .
And he never did . "
" Quote , ' the Bush White House was criticized for being tight lipped , ' " Olbermann continued .
" ' We didnt leak .
Secrecy and confidentiality are necessary for every government , especially when you re at war , ' he scolded . "
Olbermann went to town on what he perceived as Rove 's hypocrisy .
" So why didnt you practice that ? " Olbermann asked .
" You guys leaked like hell .
You and your minions leaked the name of a CIA op , ironically one devoted to countering weapons of mass destruction , while you were starting up a war supposedly designed neutralize weapons of mass destruction .
By the way , the quote / unquote leak you re still whining about , the ' New York Times ' revealing that you and your fellow future convicts had arranged to illegally eavesdrop on many , most or all Americans , and maybe some people who might have had tangential connections to terrorism , maybe , that leak came from somewhere in your government , Karl . "
Olbermann then accused Rove of " doing the same things to Americans that the terrorists want to do to Americans . "
" So stop spraining your arm patting yourself on your back , because somebody among you realized that what you were doing , infiltrating the communications of Americans , violating the privacy of Americans , gaining secret information to use against Americans , and causing fear and anxiety to grow among Americans somebody realized that doing that , Karl , was you doing the same things to Americans that the terrorists want to do to Americans , " Olbermann said .

It was merely a matter of time : Twitter , the latest social networking phenomenon , appears to have sparked its first libel action .
And perhaps inevitably , singer Courtney Love , well known for sounding off online , is at its centre .
Fans of Twitter say its beauty is that it allows users to upload their thoughts as and when they think of them .
This can be a serious disadvantage for those of a belligerent disposition .
Ms Love 's angry " tweets " against her former fashion designer , Dawn Simorangkir , have landed her in court .
According to a libel claim lodged by Simorangkir in Los Angeles Superior Court last Thursday , the widow of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain has carried out " an obsessive and delusional crusade " of malicious libel against her on Twitter , adding insult on MySpace and other websites .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The designer , who lives in Austin , Texas , also claims that numerous tweets posted by Love on Twitter accuse her of being a " nasty , lying , hosebag thief " ; having " a history of dealing cocaine " ; having " lost all custody of her child " ; and , being guilty of " assault and burglary " .
The singer adds that the designer would be " hunted til your [ sic ] dead " .
Love then allegedly posted on a fashion site where Ms Simorangkir sells her clothes : " The nastiest lying worst person I have ever known ... evil incarnate , vile horrible lying bitch . "
Ms Simorangkir is seeking punitive damages , arguing that the comments have destroyed her reputation and her business .
Court papers laying out the claim state : " Whether caused by drug - induced psychosis , a warped understanding of reality , or the belief that money and fame allow her to disregard the law , Love has embarked on what is nothing short of an obsessive and delusional crusade to destroy Simorangkir 's reputation and her livelihood . "
Love turned against her , says the designer , after she billed the singer in February for around $ 4,000 of clothes she had made for her .
Before that , Love had been buying ready - made items from the fashion website on which Ms Simorangkir trades .
Love contacted the designer and flew her to Los Angeles last November and in January to give her bags of remnants to turn into bespoke garments .
The court documents say Love was furious that Ms Simorangkir stopped working for her after Love failed to pay her bill ; this led to " an intense level of animosity ... well beyond what any reasonable person would consider acceptable behaviour " .
Love was not available for comment last week .
The case highlights the perils of celebrity blogging .
Famous people such as Jonathan Ross , Stephen Fry and even President Barack Obama have embraced Twitter because it lets them communicate with fans and supporters without involving the media .
Texts of 140 characters can be sent and uploaded in almost real time .
But many celebrities , including President Obama , now use ghost - writers to update tweets .
He said : " We now know that not only are the mountains the size of the European Alps but they also have similar peaks and valleys .
San Pedro de Atacama is one of the most visited tourist places in all of Chile .
It ’s located in the Atacama desert which is the driest place on earth .
Yet many unique plants and animals like flamingos , Llamas and Alpacas can be found there .
The town is located close to many different and amazing archaeological , geographic and tourist areas .
You can visit such tourist attractions as Pukara ( prehispanic fortress ) Quitor , Tulor village ( over 3,000 years old ) , the Tatio geysers , the Atacama salt lakes , Moon Valley as well as the picturesque Inca towns of Toconao , Peine , Socaire , Talabre and Caspana .
There are many mummies , known as the Mummies of Atacama , which have been found in this area .
The driest of the desert , as well as the isolation and the saltiness of the soil are just some of the factors that helped in the natural mummification of the bodies .

In the middle of the desert you will come across the giant salt lake of Salar de Atacama .
It is the world ’s third largest salt flat and is inhabited by beautiful pink flamingos .
Even if water is present , you should realize that the water would be toxic to humans because it has so much salt .

As I have said so many times , there are many things that add together to make up the BDSM lifestyle and what it means to you as a person , that also goes for those who engage in it a step further , in the D/s and M/s relationships .
There are many types of these relationships , myself personally I am a poly Master , that is I own a couple of slaves , their service to me is I wish it to be , it might be as a house slave or as a sex slave or it might be a mix of the two , the point is , it is what I want and they know I am poly when submitting to me .
I have the options open to me to share my slaves if I wish to , be it with others in this life or having them play together to please me , although it does help if the slaves are bi sexual and get on with each other if I want them to play together but again that is something I decide upon in the end .
When a poly Master lets others play with those
He owns it is not the slaves choice , however most Masters will lay down a few guide lines before the scene and be present through out to ensure that the slave is ok and not in distress , again whether he actually joins in is up to him , many times I prefer to watch at first so I can be alert to what is happening especially if she is new or these are people I know but have never had join us before I then have my slave please me afterwards and I have found that they are usually more than happy as this then brings them back to familiar ground and helps them to realise I am pleased with them and what has happened during the scene
Introducing JSTalk , an alternative to AppleScript
Let me say right off the bat- JSTalk is n't a replacement for AppleScript .
I do n't think anything will ever replace AppleScript and some of the amazing things I 've seen done with it ( especially in the publishing world ) .
But I think of AppleScript in the same way as the original Macintosh Toolbox and Carbon after it .
AppleScript was good in its day , but the time has come for something new .
Something that does n't require using a strange language , crufty apple events , or writing xml files to describe your object model .
I want a language with momentum and resources behind it .
I want something easy to setup and debug , where I can peek under the covers when things goes wrong .
JSTalk 's goal can described like this : JSTalk is to AppleScript , what Cocoa is to Carbon .
I know , I know .
It 's a lofty , crazy goal .
But someone has do try and it does n't look like the solution is coming from Apple anytime soon .
So I 'm keeping it very simple , and very easy .
JSTalk is n't anything new .
You write your scripts in JavaScript , and application communication is handled via Cocoa 's distributed objects .
Like PyObjc and RubyCocoa , JSTalk uses a bridge to talk to Cocoa (
SBApplication.application ( " iChat " ).setStatusMessage ( " Happy ( funball ) " ) ;
Here 's a JSTalk script which works on a build of Apple 's Sketch sample code , with native JSTalk support added :
var sketch = JSTalk.application ( " Sketch " ) ;
var doc = sketch.orderedDocuments ( ) [ 0 ] ;
var rectangle = doc.makeNewBox ( ) ;
rectangle.setWidth( 100 ) ;
rectangle.setHeight( 100 ) ;
Adding this ability to Sketch was about 7 lines of code , and adding the JSTalk framework to it .
Seriously .
No XML files , no four character event codes , and I did n't even have to sacrifice a goat to get it to work .
I 've also added basic support to both

One of the things that has always bothered me about PyObjC and other Cocoa bridged scripting languages , is that I was n't writing in Objective - C .
The funny looking method names always bothered me :
var bezierPath = NSBezierPath.bezierPath ( ) ;
bezierPath.curveToPoint_controlPoint1_controlPoint2_(pointA , pointB , pointC ) ;
bezierPath.fill( ) ;
What 's with all the _'s in the method names ?
Well , yes - I do know what 's with all the underscores .
And I know they are necessary so the bridge can convert the method names into Objective - C selectors , but it does n't look or feel very Cocoa like to me .
And since I 'm using Cocoa APIs , and talking to Cocoa applications , I want to write in the same style as Cocoa uses , like so :
var bezierPath = [ NSBezierPath bezierPath ] ;
[ bezierPath curveToPoint:pointA controlPoint1:pointB controlPoint2:pointC ] ;
[ bezierPath fill ] ;
And that 's my favorite part about JSTalk .
You have the option to write your script in a Objective - C like style if you want to .
And if you 're the type of person who is scared of ['s , you do n't have to use them !
That 's the quick and dirty on JSTalk .
The source is up on GitHub under an MIT license , you can download a pre built binary with examples to play with , and it even has a mailing list .
It 's very much a developer preview , and I really really want feedback on it .
I hope to ship a usable 1.0 by WWDC .
So if this kind of thing interests you , and you have ideas , please bring it up on the mailing list .

JSTalk comes with a little editor , a command line tool , and an automator action .
If an application you want to script is n't exposed via JSTalk , you can still tell it what to do via the Cocoa Script Bridge ( which is new to 10.5 ) .
Here 's an example which sets your iChat status using this technique :

Earth to Wall Street :
It ’s over , people .
You had a terrific run , better than you deserved , but now you ’d be wise to pay attention to those citizens outside , the ones with the pitchforks and the torches .
Sen .
Claire McCaskill ’s righteous verdict on shameless , clueless , bonus - grubbing executives should be carved on the tombstone of the whole “ Masters of the Universe ” ethos that brought us to this moment of dire economic peril : “ These people are idiots . ”
The Democrat from Missouri was ranting for the nation last week when she took to the floor of the Senate to denounce the reported $ 18.4 billion in year - end bonuses that Wall Street awarded itself — a pat on the back for such total , abject failure that taxpayers have had to shell out nearly a trillion dollars in emergency bailout funds .
So far .
On the subject of Merrill Lynch , which traditionally pays its bonuses in January , McCaskill was white - hot : “ You know what these sneaky guys did ?
They decided to give their bonuses in December , before the Bank of America took over .
[ They ] paid out three to four billion dollars in bonuses in December , and that quarter Merrill Lynch lost $ 21 billion .
What planet are these people on ?
What could they be thinking about ? ”
Themselves , would be my guess .
McCaskill introduced a bill to limit compensation at any company receiving bailout money to $ 400,000 — the salary of the president of the United States .
It ’s hard to improve on her words : “ We should have done it in the first place .
But I do n’t think any of us thought these guys were this stupid .
I do n’t think any of us believed that they would take billions of dollars in bonuses while their institutions were literally days from being wiped out .
But they did .
And we ’ve learned our lesson . ”
To the weasels , I mean executives : “ Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom , must , like men , undergo the fatigues of supporting it . ”
No , wait , that ’s from Thomas Paine , not Claire McCaskill .
Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa called on President Obama to “ pull back ” the bonuses paid by firms that received bailout money .
I ca n’t help but imagine a fleet of government tow trucks “ pulling back ” a bunch of brand - new BMWs to an impoundment lot .
The offending bonus payments suggest that Wall Street utterly fails to comprehend how its standing in the nation and the world has changed .
As long as the Masters of the Universe kept producing wealth with their mumbo jumbo about collateralized debt obligations and credit - default swaps , we mortals were willing to tolerate their preening excesses .
But it turned out that they were generating only the illusion of wealth — and that the mumbo jumbo was as nonsensical as it sounded .
Ordinary Americans are now paying with their jobs , their homes , their mental and physical health .
Respected economists are talking about the worst crisis since the Great Depression .
And Wall Street has the gall to break out the champagne ?
Things have changed .
No longer does it seem reasonable — if it ever did — that the average CEO makes 344 times as much as the average worker , as estimated last August by the Institute for Policy Studies and the nonprofit group United for a Fair Economy .
No longer does it seem acceptable that John Thain , the since - ousted Merrill Lynch chief who ordered those accelerated bonuses that so irked McCaskill , would spend $ 1.2 million of his fast - sinking firm ’s money to redecorate his office — and then , with Merrill ’s losses being revealed as even greater than feared , request a bonus of up to $ 10 million for himself .
No longer does it make any sense to reward those who work in the financial industry so lavishly , compared to the way we compensate those who , say , build tractors or write software or teach our children .
Salaries should be reasonable , and bonuses — much more modest ones — should be reserved for those who actually , you know , make money .
If some of Wall Street ’s vaunted “ talent ” balks and flees , terrific .
It was “ talent ” that got us here .
Maybe some in the industry feel fully entitled to their customary wheelbarrow of cash in a year when the stock market lost about 40 percent of its value .
The people with the pitchforks and the torches beg to differ .
Idiots is among the milder epithets being tossed around these days .
It would be in Wall Street ’s interest to get with the new program before the villagers come any closer to the castle .

In rural Nevada , the possible expansion of the brothel industry has sex workers hoping to be given a central role in governing their own industry , rather than being seen as at - risk women who require protection from themselves .
Sex workers
have long struggled to be regarded as leaders in the prevention of HIV , not as
vectors of disease from which the public must be protected .
This challenge extends to the few counties in
the United States where
prostitution is regulated and permitted under law — in rural Nevada ,
where the possible expansion of the brothel industry has US sex workers
hoping at last to be given a central role in governing their own industry ,
rather than being seen as at - risk women who require protection from themselves .
In January ,
the key lobbyist for Nevada ’s legal brothel
industry , George Flint , obtained the backing of state Senator Bob Coffin for a bill to impose
a statewide tax on Nevada ’s 25 legal brothels .
Flint’s
aspirations are two - fold : gain the favor of Nevada citizens who face bracing budget
cuts , and reinforce the status of brothels as legitimate businesses
contributing to the economy and community welfare .
His tax proposal also has
the support of Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman , who has asked Flint
to work on a model bill to create highly regulated legal brothels in Las Vegas , where
prostitution is currently illegal .
While
Senator Coffin intends to hold public hearings on prostitution at some point through
the Senate Taxation Committee , Flint’s
proposal is due to be heard by the state legislature this month .
All of this has sex workers and advocates
wondering : if the brothel business is going to be taxed and expanded , who will be involved in developing
new regulations ?
Will it be sex workers ?
Sex worker
advocates ’ concerns about brothel regulations go back to the early days of the
HIV / AIDS pandemic , when Nevada ’s current system of mandatory HIV / STI testing
and quarantining brothel workers from the public were put into law without the
consultation of the workers themselves .
Nevada state law mandates that sex workers
in the legal brothels must undergo monthly HIV and syphilis tests and weekly
gonorrhea and chlamydia tests .
In
addition , some county and municipal codes stipulate that sex workers may not
leave the brothels for more than 24 hours without being tested again .
Some brothels do not permit workers to be
off - premises at all in evening hours , unless accompanied by a chaperone .
" Girls
do leave all the time , to go to town , to get their nails done , " said George
Flint , " but I ’m a huge fan of girls staying on - premises .
Without the controlled
environment that the brothel provides , they may turn tricks outside without safety
things [ condoms ] . "
Sex workers
do n’t object to being tested for HIV and STIs on principle , sociologists Barb
Brents and Kate Hausbeck of the University
of Nevada – Las Vegas found in their
research with brothel workers .
But workers and health advocates argue that
regulations governing their workplaces were put into place as a reaction to
public misperceptions about HIV , and that these practices have not been updated
now that more accurate information on HIV transmission and prevention has
emerged .
" The current system is old and
ineffective , " said Amanda Brooks , who
has worked at a legal brothel in Nevada .
" It ’s time for the brothel industry to enter the 21st century . "

The Nevada brothels ’
mandatory HIV testing laws were established in the mid-80 ’s , in response to
concerns that tourism dollars would be lost in the panic over HIV .
State law stipulates that all new workers to
the brothels must test negative for HIV as part of a pre-employment screening
conducted at approved testing sites , in addition to testing every thirty days
of continued employment .
Even as these
regulations were first adopted into law , the state Department of Public Health
maintained that the compulsory testing was passed " as a symbolic gesture , " said
Barb Brents .
" It was a gut reaction to
the AIDS crisis . "
In a 2006 interview ,
Rick Reich , Communicable Disease / AIDS Services Supervisor for the Clark
County Health Department , said of the mandatory testing law , " [ W ]e test these
people so often , it ’s almost like we over - test them .
That does n’t stop the
infections from coming into the brothels by the customers .
That ’s where the mandatory condom use comes
in . "
The one existing Nevada brothel regulation that effectively
keeps sex
workers safe was pushed for by workers themselves — a statewide
mandatory
condom policy .
Sex
workers had been demanding that condom use be made mandatory across the
brothel system in order to make uniform the safety practices they
already knew worked best , but it was n’t until 1987 , after compulsory
HIV / STI testing had been adopted into law , that brothel owners realized
their competitive advantage was at risk
unless a statewide condom policy was in place .
" In my understanding , it was the workers
that wanted [ mandatory condoms ] , " said Cheryl Radeloff , assistant
professor of
Women ’s Studies at Minnesota State University – Mankato , who has
studied the
Nevada brothels .
" They were scared of being exposed to HIV , " which
testing the workers
alone cannot prevent from occurring .
The practice remains effective ,
both for prevention and to demonstrate what workers can accomplish
collectively .
As Radeloff observed , " the workers all bought in to this
law because it was the workers who most wanted it . "
Sex workers have also questioned
the messages about testing and the sexual health information they receive from
their employers .
Amanda Brooks , who
worked in a brothel this summer , wrote that
she was told by the health care providers referred to her by the brothel that
she would not be tested for hepatitis because " Mexicans and Asians carry
hepatitis " and she appeared to be white .
Said Brooks ,
" We were n’t given accurate basic health information at my
brothel . "
" Look at
the tests that are pushed , " said Cheryl Radeloff .
" We ca n’t use throat and urine cultures for
testing gonorrhea and chlamydia because the law stipulates a cervical specimen
is to be taken .
And with HIV – we can ’t
use rapid tests , because there ’s no provision for them in the law .
There ’s a
lag between the law and best practices . "
In addition to the weakness of relying
on twenty year old laws to set current public health standards , sex workers
have not yet been considered to be important in the design and implementation
of brothel health policy .
Asked Radeloff , " Where ’s the advocacy for workers
within the brothel system to take roles as peer advisors and mentors ? "
" As workers
and health advocates , we can push for an update to the current system , for an
assessment of best practices in brothel health , " said Naomi Akers , executive
director of St. James Infirmary ,
a peer -run occupational health and safety clinic for sex workers .
Akers also
worked in the Nevada
brothels for several years .
Currently , brothel workers are responsible for the
costs of their own tests .
Additionally ,
if a worker leaves the brothel for more than twenty - four hours , she must be
re -tested for HIV before being allowed to return to work .
However , the brothels currently use the ELISA
HIV test , which may not detect the antibodies that cause HIV for up to three
months .
" If you leave the brothels for
just twenty four hours , it does n’t make any sense , " said Akers .
" The RNA PCR
test is what we offer for HIV screening in our clinic .
It has a shorter window
period for detection , and tests for the presence of the virus itself . "
As brothel
workers carry the cost of their own test , this twenty - four rule may have more
to do with encouraging workers to stay on - site and work continuously rather
than pay to be tested and lose work while waiting for results .
Said Susan Lopez , director of the Sex Workers ’ Outreach Project - Las Vegas , " Sometimes
it feels like they just want to keep the ‘ dirty whores ’ out of the city so that
they do n’t infect the public , " and even with overwhelming evidence that sex
workers are not any more responsible for the transmission of HIV , these attitudes
remain .
In fact , there are sex partners
involved in the Nevada
brothel system who are n’t tested : the clients .
" I ’m sure over the years ,
statistically speaking , that I had a client who was HIV positive , " said
Akers .
" And still , with condom use , it ’s
entirely possible for workers to remain HIV negative . "
" The
rhetoric that needs to be crushed right off the bat is that women need to be
confined , " said Brents .
" There is just an acceptance of this being the way
things are .
But to hear George Flint talk , there ’s the sense that now that we
could do it right . "
Now that Flint needs to convince
legislators to support his bill giving even more legal status to prostitution
in Nevada ,
shifting the public ’s perception of brothel workers — from that of outsider threats
to contributing members of the community – could not be better timed .
To date , no sex workers have been
included in the brothel regulatory boards , though Flint said he is open to this .
But as sex workers and advocates have said , being
willing to listen to sex workers is not enough .
Rather , ensuring sex workers have an equal voice in lobbying for policy
based on evidence over unfounded fears should be his first step in proving his
commitment to a better brothel business .

Acidification from absorbing atmospheric CO 2 is changing the ocean 's chemistry
PEOPLE CAN'T walk on water , but scientists say the carbon dioxide emitted by humans into the atmosphere has started to leave noticeable footprints on the ocean .
Justin Ries ( both )
View Enlarged Image Contrast Calcifying organisms , such as these sea urchins grown in seawater acidified with 400 ppm CO 2 ( left ) — the current level in the ocean — produce spines that are truncated by dissolution when reared in seawater acidified with 2,850 ppm CO 2 ( right ) , an extreme level for lab tests .
Numbered scale in centimeters
Scientists have been concerned for years that lower ocean pH caused by absorption of CO 2 emissions could decrease calcification processes underlying the growth of shells and corals ' hard exteriors .
Besides studying that phenomenon , they are investigating how acidification alters the concentration and behavior of the ocean 's trace metals , some of which are nutrients for marine life .
They are also looking into some unexpected consequences of ocean acidification , such as disruptions to sound propagation and transmission of chemical cues .
Some scientists believe the net effect of these and other yet undiscovered changes may threaten the survival of a wide variety of marine organisms .
Increased use of fossil fuels has caused the levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere to nearly double since the Industrial Revolution .
" Over the past 200 years , the oceans have absorbed approximately 550 billion tons of CO 2 from the atmosphere , or about a third of the total amount of anthropogenic emissions over that period , " says Richard A. Feely , a senior scientist with the National Oceanographic & Atmospheric Administration 's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory , in Seattle .
That means the ocean currently absorbs about 22 million tons of CO 2 per day , he adds .
Marine scientists who have measured the pH of the ocean 's surface waters for decades see that it has been dropping .
They say that the pH is currently about 8.1 , down from about 8.2 in the 18th century .
If CO 2 emissions continue at current rates , they expect the pH to fall by approximately 0.3 more units in the next 50 – 100 years .
And as the ocean becomes more acidic , scientists anticipate myriad changes to the ocean 's chemistry .
Changing pH is likely to affect many aspects of biochemistry , development , and reproduction for many marine organisms , says Donald C. Potts , an evolutionary biologist at the University of California , Santa Cruz .
Whether these organisms can adapt and survive remains to be seen , he adds .
For example , almost all reaction rates are pH dependent , so acidification may change processes in the ocean ranging from enzyme activity to the adsorption of metals onto particle surfaces in seawater , says Frank J. Millero , a professor of marine and physical chemistry at the University of Miami .
Many sea organisms without shells , such as anemones and jellyfish , may be especially susceptible to even the smallest changes in ocean pH because their internal pH tends to vary with that of the surrounding seawater .
These organisms cannot actively regulate their internal pH as mammals do .
Although marine mammals can regulate their internal pH , ocean acidification could still affect how they function .
Peter G. Brewer , an ocean scientist at Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute ( MBARI ) , in Moss Landing , Calif. , says , " What most people do n't get is just the sheer scale of the changes that are going on and the multiple ways that acidification can have further impact on the ocean . "
Consider the ocean chemistry - sound connection .
Brewer and his MBARI colleagues published a study showing that at lower pH , the ocean will absorb less sound at low frequencies and essentially become noisier ( Geophys .
Res. Lett. 2008 , 35 , L19601 ; C&EN , Oct. 6 , 2008 , page 47 ) .
The researchers suggest that mammals dependent on sonar may be able to communicate over longer distances , although they would have to deal with more background distractions .
" I think it shocked a lot of people that something as strange as that could be impacted , but it is absolutely true , " Brewer says .
Fish fall between simple organisms and mammals with regard to pH regulation .
Most fish can easily regulate small changes in pH .
Few studies have examined the effects of ocean acidification on fish , but Philip L. Munday , a coral reef expert at James Cook University , in Australia , and colleagues recently reported how acidification impairs olfaction and homing ability in orange clownfish larvae .
In laboratory studies , they found that larvae raised in seawater acidified with CO 2 to pH 7.8 , which is the pH level predicted for 2100 at current CO 2 emission rates , had difficulty discriminating between different chemical cues ( Proc. Nat. Acad .
Sci. USA 2009 , 106 , 1848 ; C&EN , Feb. 9 , page 30 ) .
Such olfactory cues help guide larvae back to reefs so they can locate adult habitats at the end of their larval phase .
Disrupting that sensory ability could affect whether or not larvae from a broad range of marine species can find a home , Munday says .
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Losing Nemo Acidified seawater disrupts the homing ability of orange clownfish .
THE SPEED at which acidification is occurring is a particular concern to ocean scientists .
The " Monaco Declaration , " a statement released on Jan. 30 by 155 ocean scientists from 26 countries , sums up their discussions at a symposium in Monaco last October .
" We are deeply concerned by recent , rapid changes in ocean chemistry and their potential , within decades , to severely affect marine organisms , " they wrote in the statement , adding that " severe damages are imminent . "
They pointed specifically to acidification - related decreases in shellfish weights and slowed growth of coral reefs , among other problems .
" Increasing acidity and related changes in seawater chemistry also affect reproduction , behavior , and general physiological function of some marine organisms , such as oysters , sea urchins , and squid , " the scientists wrote .
They added that field studies suggest impacts of acidification on some major marine organisms that produce calcium carbonate structures may already be detectable .
Adding CO 2 to seawater affects calcifying organisms by upsetting the natural equilibrium of calcium carbonate chemistry in the ocean .
When CO 2 dissolves in seawater , it forms carbonic acid , which can dissociate into hydrogen ions and bicarbonate ions .
Those hydrogen ions are likely to react with carbonate ions to form more bicarbonate .
" Some of that bicarbonate comes at the expense of the carbonate , which is the form of carbon that some organisms use in calcification , " says Justin Ries , a marine geochemist at the University of North Carolina ( UNC ) , Chapel Hill .
In addition , " a critical factor is that at the present time , Ca2 + concentration in the ocean happens to be at its lowest level in more than a half - billion years , " geologist Steven M. Stanley of the University of Hawaii , Manoa , wrote in an article in Chemical Reviews ( 2008 , 108 , 4483 ) .
Reduced carbonate concentration in combination with low calcium levels results in exceptionally low calcium carbonate levels in seawater , he wrote .
Numerous published laboratory studies indicate that organisms calcify more slowly under acidic conditions when fewer carbonate ions are available .
Carbonate also dissolves from existing calcified structures of organisms at a faster rate in lower pH water , thereby exacerbating the calcification problem .
© 2008 Science Unexpected Growth Coccolithophores like these may prosper in high - CO 2 seas .
CORAL REEFS may be degrading from ocean acidification , but the ability of tiny calcifying phytoplankton called coccolithophores to grow in high - CO 2 seawater demonstrates that the marine response to ocean acidification is not uniform .
These calcifying organisms build their skeletons by forming crystals of calcium carbonate , and coccolithophores alone produce roughly one - third of the calcium carbonate in today 's ocean .
M. Debora Iglesias - Rodriguez of the University of Southampton , in England , and colleagues presented lab evidence , confirmed by data collected from sediment cores , suggesting that the average coccolithophore 's mass has grown by 40 % over the past 220 years ( Science 2008 , 320 , 336 ; C&EN , April 21 , 2008 , page 43 ) .
UNC's Ries wanted to see if CO 2 - induced acidification could affect the crystal structure and composition of calcium carbonate produced by calcifying organisms , which generally form one of two different crystal lattice arrangements : aragonite or calcite .
These polymorphs have different solubilities , and Ries wondered if calcifying organisms would alter their polymorphic calcite composition to cope with more acidic water .
He and his colleagues Anne L. Cohen and Daniel McCorkle of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution recently raised various calcifying organisms in CO 2 - acidified water and then used X - ray diffraction , spectroscopy , and microscopy to quantify changes in the organisms ' skeletal mineralogy .
Of the 18 organisms studied , only tube worms increased their calcite composition in acidified water .
Ries says the results may indicate that some organisms alter their mode of calcification in response to carbonate deficits .
He also notes that results from his and others ' studies on the effect of elevated CO 2 on calcification suggest that some organisms may adapt by using bicarbonate for calcification .
" If they are able to strip away the proton from bicarbonate by manipulating the pH of their calcifying fluid , some organisms may be able to convert bicarbonate back to carbonate at their site of calcification , " he says .
He adds that this enhanced pH regulation may come at a high energetic cost to the organism .
Changes in carbonate availability , along with decreases in hydroxide concentrations because of decreased pH , will likely have a large influence on trace metals in the acidified ocean too , according to marine chemists .
Metals can exist in different chemical forms in seawater .
They can be in the free form or interact with other organic ligands or inorganic ions to form complexes in solution .
" Normally , the free form is more active in a biological and chemical sense , " Miami 's Millero says .
Copper , for example , in its free form ( Cu2 + ) can be toxic to marine organisms such as phytoplankton .
The ocean 's pH can affect how dissolved metals complex with inorganic anions , such as hydroxide and carbonate ions , and with organic ligands , which have not been well characterized , says Robert H. Byrne , a professor at the University of South Florida who studies the physical chemistry of seawater .
The concentration of free metals will increase if there is less carbonate and hydroxide to bind , he adds .
Decreases in concentrations of these anions are likely to also affect the concentration and speciation of iron , an essential nutrient for the growth of many organisms .
Millero suggests the decrease in pH will slow down oxidation of Fe2 + with dissolved oxygen and hydrogen peroxide and increase the solubility of Fe3 + .
The resulting increase in total available iron may boost the production of phytoplankton in the oceans , but marine chemists differ at this point on whether this boost would ultimately be a boon or a detriment to ocean life .
Marine chemists do n't expect that the growing acidity of surface waters will affect the concentrations of all trace metals .
For example , Millero says metals that form strong complexes with chloride , such as mercury and cadmium , will not be affected by changes in pH .
Because the organic ligands that complex metals in the ocean have not been well characterized , marine chemists have more difficulty predicting how pH will affect metal complexation with organic ligands .
Ocean scientists say acidification of surface waters will likely affect how metals are adsorbed onto biological detritus , which essentially removes metals from surface waters as the debris sinks into the deeper ocean .
The adsorption processes are thought to be pH dependent , but there has been little study on the effect so far .
What is known is that the ocean has pulled so much CO 2 from the atmosphere that the resulting levels of carbonic acid could fundamentally change the ocean .
To what extent the ocean will continue to acidify and whether marine organisms can adapt to the changes in store remain to be seen .

Yesterday I attended the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage hearing into the television industry in Canada and its impact on local communities .
The hearing featured MPs from all parties taking CRTC Chair Konrad von Finckenstein to task for not doing enough to save local television broadcasting .
Von Finckenstein rightly noted that there is no obvious or easy solution , but that was n't good enough for many MPs , who ( given the usual demands that the CRTC stop regulating ) oddly demanded that the CRTC engage in more regulation .
Even stranger were the positions on fee for carriage .
Six months ago , the notion of a monthly television tax on cable and satellite subscribers would have been rejected out of hand by most MPs .
Indeed , the CRTC itself has twice rejected broadcaster requests for it .
No longer .
In the current environment , the CRTC hinted it was possible and it was the Conservative MPs who were the most vocal in support of imposing a new television tax .
While one MP tried to characterize it as a business - to - business solution , the reality is that the television tax would add roughly $ 75 per year to the cable and satellite bills of millions of Canadians as the industry hopes to raise $ 300 million from the new fee .
This sounds like the sort of thing that Conservatives would strongly oppose , yet with many MPs hailing from ridings where local broadcasters are shutting down , they kept asking why the CRTC had not acquiesced to the broadcaster demands .

Individual ownership of a firearm no more qualifies the owner to protect themselves and their property and defend the rights granted by their creator than individual ownership of a cowboy hat qualifies the owner for the National Finals Rodeo .
Responsible ownership of a firearm requires not only adequate training in its use , but also a mental mindset capable of formulating and implementing a plan should that tool ever be required .
Irresponsible use of a firearm often provides opponents of the right to keep and bear arms a useful weapon , especially considering their willing accomplices in the congress and the media .
Training with your chosen firearm should occur frequently , weekly if possible , at the very least , monthly .
Always practice on silhouette targets and not bull ’s - eye targets .
Reality is a must in training .
Devote quite a bit of practice and ammo on headshots .
Criminals frequently wear body armor .
Train diligently to become ambidextrous in the use of your firearm in the event your strong side should become incapacitated .
If one has decided to become trained and may be forced at some time to use his weapon for defense of his home , life , family , or rights , he / she should take the time to talk this decision over with members of their family .
Each should be aware of the inherent danger should events occur that require a firearm to be employed , and where they should position themselves to remain as safe as possible .
The person(s ) most likely to use the firearm should be aware of where other members of the family would be and to make every effort to insure that any missed shots not endanger them .
High - powered magnum pistols and rifles can penetrate several internal and / or external walls .
It is imperative that one have complete knowledge of his living environment : where are your firearms located , can you negotiate your way through the house without lights , etc .
It could prove invaluable to possess the ability to navigate each and every room in your house in complete darkness without giving away your position .
Keeping your firearm and ammunition in separate locations is absurd .
An unloaded $ 800 pistol or revolver can instantly become a very expensive rock .
Have an adequate supply of ammo .
I , personally , have a firearm and ammo discretely located in each room of my home so as to never be isolated from either should the need arise .
I do not recommend the use of the laser sights now in vogue with many gun owners .
In a dark environment they give away your position to a possible adversary .
Not a good thing in a gunfight .
A high intensity flashlight can be a force option , used to locate , identify , and temporarily disorient a potential bad guy , but should be employed with discretion when one is facing multiple targets , for the light too can give away your position .
Home invasions are becoming more and more in the news and usually involve a multitude of bad guys .
Know whom you are admitting into your home .
It is not unusual in a self - defense situation to find oneself in a target - rich environment .
One magazine or cylinder of ammo may not be sufficient for the situation .
Practice your reloads until they are automatic .
An adrenaline rush will cause one ’s aim to be unsteady and erratic .
Sometime before you practice on your silhouette targets , run in place for several minutes , pick up your firearm and attempt to engage the targets .
Raising your heart rate is the closest one can come to duplicating the adrenaline rush brought on by a potential life or death encounter .
Do not rush toward the sound of a forced intrusion into your home ; in so doing you give away your position and could draw fire from several adversaries at once .
Do not turn on lights as that too could give away your position and draw fire .
Stay low , think on your feet and react .
Fear should be a motivator , but never the director of your actions .
What I am going to mention next is something I have personally done and recommend to all .
Either travel to your local law enforcement , or , if you have a group of like - minded citizens or a shooting club , ask a representative of law enforcement to attend a meeting .
At this meeting ask the LE representative if he / she understands their oath to uphold and defend ; have a copy of their oath handy .
Pointedly ask how an unlawful order to seize public firearms would be handled by their department .
If they answer the order would be executed , ask what would be their department ’s response if citizens refused to comply .
I believe this serves to inform those in LE that adherence to unconstitutional confiscation might not go as smoothly as they expect and serve as a subtle reminder of who they are paid to " serve and protect " and who is paying their salaries .
If you have a number of like - minded patriots , or a gun club with members you trust , establish a phone tree .
In other words , should one of your group become the target of a criminal invasion , they would call the first person on the list who would in turn call two people on the list and so on until all members were notified .
Criminals prefer to execute their crimes with relative cover and quiet .
A number of well - armed , concerned folks arriving at the scene could possibly insure a positive outcome and / or provide much needed assistance .
Train hard ; train often ; train in realistic scenarios ; your life and the life of your family may depend on it .

Hearst seeks changes at Chronicle
2009-02-24 14:30:00 PST
NEW YORK -- The Hearst Corp. today announced an effort to reverse the deepening operating losses of its San Francisco Chronicle by seeking near - term cost savings that would include " significant " cuts to both union and non-union staff .
In a posted statement , Hearst said if the savings cannot be accomplished " quickly " the company will seek a buyer , and if none comes forward , it will close the Chronicle .
The Chronicle lost more than $ 50 million in 2008 and is on a pace to lose more than that this year , Hearst said .
Frank J. Vega , chairman and publisher of the Chronicle , said , " It 's just a fact of life that we need to live within our means as a newspaper - and we have not for years . "
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Vega said plans remain on track for the June 29 transition to new presses owned and operated by Canadian - based Transcontinental Inc. , which will give the Chronicle industry - leading color reproduction .
If the reductions can be accomplished , Vega said , " We are optimistic that we can emerge from this tough cycle with a healthy and vibrant Chronicle . "
The company did not specify the size of the staff reductions or the nature of the other cost - savings measures it has in mind .
The company said it will immediately seek discussions with the Northern California Media Workers Guild , Local 39521 , and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , Local 853 , which represent the majority of workers at the Chronicle .
" Because of the sea change newspapers everywhere are undergoing and these dire economic times , it is essential that our management and the local union leadership work together to implement the changes necessary to bring the cost of producing the Chronicle into line with available revenue , " Frank A. Bennack , Jr. , Hearst vice chairman and chief executive , and Steven R. Swartz , president of Hearst Newspapers , said in a joint statement .
Hearst purchased the Chronicle in 2000 , but soon afterward felt the impact of an economic downturn in the dot.com sector as well as the loss of classified advertising to Craigslist and other online sites .
The problems have been exacerbated by the current recession .
In the news release , the privately - held , New York - based company said that the Chronicle has had " major losses " since 2001 .
" Given the losses the Chronicle continues to sustain , the time to implement these changes cannot be long .
These changes are designed to give the Chronicle the best possible chance to survive this economic downturn and continue to serve the people of the Bay Area with distinction , as it has since 1865 , " Bennack and Swartz said in their statement .
" Survival is the outcome we all want to achieve , " they added .
" But without specific changes we are seeking across the entire Chronicle organization , we will have no choice but to quickly seek a buyer for the Chronicle , and , should a buyer not be found , to shut down the newspaper . "
The Hearst statement further said that cost reductions are part of a broader effort to restore the Chronicle to financial health .
At the beginning of the year , the Chronicle raised its prices for home delivery and single - copy purchases .
Hearst owns 15 other newspapers including the Houston Chronicle , San Antonio News - Express and the Albany Times - Union in New York .
Hearst announced Jan. 9 that in March that if a buyer is not found it will close Seattle Post - Intelligencer , which has lost money since 2000 .
Vega said readers and advertisers will see no difference in the Chronicle during the discussions with the unions .
" Even with the reduction in workforce , our goal will be to retain our essential and well - read content , " Vega said .
" We will continue to produce the very best newspaper for our readers and preserve one of San Francisco 's oldest and most important institutions . "
The Chronicle , the Bay Area 's largest and oldest newspaper , is read by more than 1.6 million people weekly .
It also operates SFGate , among the nation 's 10 largest news Web sites .
SFGate depends on the Chronicle 's print news staff for much its content .
The San Francisco Bay Area is home to 21 daily newspapers covering an 11 - county area .
The Chronicle 's news staff of about 275 , even after a series of reductions in recent years , is the largest of any newspaper in the Bay Area .
" While the reductions are an unfortunate sign of the times , the news staff has always been resilient in San Francisco , " said Ward Bushee , editor and executive vice president .
" We remain fully dedicated toward serving our readers with an outstanding newspaper .
We are playing to win . "
The area's other leading newspapers - the Bay Area Media News Group that includes the San Jose Mercury News , Contra Costa Times and Oakland Tribune - also have seen revenues decline sharply and cut staff .
These problems are a reflection of those faced by newspapers across America as they experience fundamental changes in their business model brought on by rapid growth in readership on free internet sites , a decline in paid circulation , the erosion of advertising and rising costs .
Advertising traditionally has offset the cost of producing and delivering a newspaper , which allowed publishers to charge readers substantially less than the actual cost of doing business .
The loss of advertising has undermined that pricing model .
In the case of the Chronicle , Vega said the expense of producing and delivering the newspaper to a seven - day subscriber is more than double the $ 7.75 weekly cost to subscribe .
At the beginning of the year , in an effort to evolve its business model and offset its substantial losses , the Chronicle raised its subscription and newsstand prices , taking a cue from European papers that charge far more than their American counterparts .
" We know that people in this community care deeply about the Chronicle , " Vega said .
" In today 's world , the Chronicle is still very inexpensive .
This is a critical time and we deeply hope our readers will stick with us . "
The challenge the Chronicle faces , Vega said , is to bring its revenues from advertising and circulation into balance with its expenses so that the newspaper can at least break even financially .
" We are asking our unions to work with us as partners in making these difficult cost - cutting decisions and reduction in force to ensure the newspaper survives , " Vega said .
The Grammys , much like the Oscars , have lost some of its luster and credibility in recent years with such pop phenoms such as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera taking home Grammys .
But even more indefensible is the rock and roll legends that have n’t won a Grammy .
Some of the most famous and influential musicians in music history have never won a Grammy and here are the top 10 on the list .
Bob Marley and Jimi Hendrix won Lifetime Grammy Achievement Awards after their deaths , but we wo n’t count those since they were given out based on a career and not a year , so to speak .
10 . Buddy Holly
Although his success lasted only a year and a half before his death in an airplane crash , Holly is described by critic Bruce Eder as “ the single most influential creative force in early rock and roll . ”
His works and innovations were copied by his contemporaries and later musicians , notably The Beatles , The Beach Boys and The Rolling Stones , and exerted a profound influence on popular music .
In 2004 , Rolling Stone ranked Holly # 13 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time .
Buddy Holly died in 1959 , the year of the first Grammy Awards ceremony and was never eligible for a Grammy during his lifetime .
9 . The Doors
The Doors ’ music was a fusion of psychedelic rock , hard rock , blues - rock , and acid rock .
They were considered a controversial band , due mostly to Morrison ’s cryptic lyrics and unpredictable stage persona .
After Morrison ’s death on July 3 , 1971 , the remaining members continued as a threesome until disbanding in 1973 .
Despite a career that barely totaled eight years ,
The Doors still enjoy a huge cult following as well as status in the mainstream music industry as being hugely influential and original .
According to the RIAA , they have sold over 32 million albums in the US alone .
The Doors went winless by the Grammys for during their entire eight years together .
8. Lynyrd Skynyrd
The band became prominent in the Southern United States in 1973 , and rose to worldwide recognition before several members , including lead vocalist and primary songwriter Ronnie Van Zant , died in a plane crash in 1977 .
The band reformed in 1987 for a reunion tour with Ronnie ’s younger brother , Johnny Van Zant as the frontman , and continues to record music today .
The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 13 , 2006 .
The band now has a total of 7 deceased members .
A Grammy still eludes this iconic and pioneering Southern rock band .
7. Jimi Hendrix
Hendrix synthesized many styles in creating his musical voice and his guitar style was unique , later to be abundantly imitated by others .
Despite his hectic touring schedule and notorious perfectionism , he was a prolific recording artist and left behind more than 300 unreleased recordings .
With all of his popularity and musical influence he never won a Grammy .
In 1992 , Hendrix was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award .
6. Queen
As of 2005 , according to The Guinness Book of World Records , Queen albums have spent a total of 1,322 weeks or twenty - seven years on the United Kingdom album charts ; more time than any other musical act including The Beatles and Elvis Presley .
Also in 2005 , with the release of their live album with Paul Rodgers , Queen moved into third place on the list of acts with the most aggregate time spent on the British record charts , but Queen has still never won a Grammy .
5. Grateful Dead
The Grateful Dead ’s musical influences varied widely ; in concert recordings or on record albums one can hear psychedelic rock , blues , rock and roll , country - western , bluegrass , country - rock , and improvisational jazz .
These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead “ the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world .
30 years of touring though could n’t garner a Grammy award .
4. Led Zeppelin
With their heavy , guitar - driven sound , Led Zeppelin are regarded as one of the first heavy metal bands .
However , the band ’s individualistic style draws from many sources and transcends any one genre .
The band have sold more than 300 million albums worldwide , including 111.5 million sales in the United States and they have had all of their original studio albums reach the U.S. Billboard Top 10 , with six reaching the number one spot .
Led Zeppelin are ranked # 1 on VH1 ’s 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock .
Rolling Stone magazine has described Led Zeppelin as “ the heaviest band of all time ” and “ the biggest band of the ’ 70s ” .
But sorry , no Grammy for you .
3. Diana Ross
A twelve - time Grammy and Oscar - nominated singer , record producer and actress , whose musical repertoire spans R&B , soul , pop , disco and jazz .
During the 1960s , she helped shape the sound of popular music and the Motown Sound as lead singer of The Supremes before leaving for a solo career in the beginning of 1970 .
Since the beginning of her career with The Supremes and as a solo artist , Diana Ross has sold more than 100 million records .
Apparently not enough to win a Grammy though .
2. Bob Marley
He was the lead singer , songwriter and guitarist for the ska , rocksteady and reggae bands : The Wailers ( 1964 – 1974 ) and Bob Marley & the Wailers ( 1974 – 1981 ) .
Marley remains the most widely known and revered performer of reggae music , and is credited for helping spread Jamaican music to the worldwide audience .
Although he never won a Grammy in his lifetime , he was recently announced as a 2007 Grammy Hall of Fame inductee .
1. The Who
The primary lineup was guitarist Pete Townshend , vocalist Roger Daltrey , bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon .
They became known for energetic live performances , are one of the most influential rock bands of the 1960s and ’ 70s , and recognized as one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all time .
They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 , their first year of eligibility .
According to the New York Times , The Who have sold 100 million records yet were never recognized by the Recording Academy .

[ digg - reddit - me ] A friend asked me recently in response to my Reagan Revolution posts :
A. Would you rather have sustained economic growth where 90 % of the growth goes to the rich and 10 % to everyone else ?
or
B. Economic stagnation and contraction where everyone stays at the same level except the rich lose a chunk of their proportionate wealth ?
[ edited slightly for clarity ]
I think my friend may be surprised at how close America already is to Situation A .
The top 20 % of Americans own over 84 % of America ’s wealth and make just under 50 % of each year ’s income .
Of the growth in America ’s economy in the past 10 years , most of it has gone to the richest 5 % .
( See the Federal Reserve ’s Chartbook – warning – a massive pdf .
Also , for easier to read charts , see this and this . )
The question my friend seems to be proposing is :
Is this disparity inherently wrong ?
Not necessarily .
But it raises a number of difficult questions .
Fairness
Do you really believe that the top 20 % of Americans has done work or provided value to society sufficient to deserve 84 % of the wealth ?
If you ’re just looking at income – do 20 % of the people do 50 % of the work each year ?
Or do these 20 % of people provide 50 % of all things of value ?
Is it possible that this distribution can be just ?
It does not seem to me that it can – unless you postulate that a day ’s work for the average person in the top 20 % is worth a week ’s worth of work for the average American .
Stability
A second question is whether a system in which such a high percentage of income disparity is sustainable .
Certainly , when wealth is concentrated to such an extent , it undermines both the freedom of the market and democratic institutions .
The freedom of the market is based on competition – which is undermined by the concentration of wealth .
Democratic and market institutions are based on a free flow of information which can be controlled with sufficient wealth .
For a time , as long as enough people benefited , this might be sustainable – but at some point , the concentration of wealth would reach a tipping point that would force a change .
And that is only if all goes well – if growth ceases , or ceases for the majority of the people , then such a system would collapse .
( This is what we are facing now . )
The only way such a lopsided system could be sustainable would be with massive government intervention to maintain those institutions and mechanisms necessary for stability or intervention to spread the wealth around .
It sometimes seems to me that conservatives forget that the free market exists because of – not in spite of – government interventions .
And that some percentage of an individual ’s success is due to the society and market created and maintained at least in part by the government .
The real problem I have with the construct of the question is that it might be asked another way :
Would prefer massive injustice or collective misery ?
I ’d like to think we can do better than either .

Teens Prefer Music To Sex And Have No Intention Of Paying For It
Forget free love .
Today 's teens are far more interested in free music .
A new survey of 1000 UK youth showed that 70 % of 16 - 19 year olds would rather go without sex than music for a week .
Broaden the age group to 16 - 24 and the go without sex group only falls to 60 % .
61 % of the same age group do n't feel they should have to pay for the music .
Narrow the survey to 15 - 19 % and the " Why should I pay ? " crowd rises to almost 70 % .
Those that would pay pegged the fair price of a single track download at 39 p pr ( 55 cents ) or GBP 3.91 ( $ 5.50 ) for a full album download .
UK music is generally higher than in the US and yet the average price that respondents think is fair to pay for a CD is GBP6.58 ( $ 9.50 ) .
You Tube is the top web spot for music discovery for 38 % of UK youth .
Myspace and a
band 's own website combined to come a distant second at 15 % .

A bill that would legalize the medicinal use of marijuana in Minnesota has cleared a second committee in the state Senate , with the Judiciary Committee approving it on a narrow 4 - 3 vote .
A hearing on the companion House bill before the House Civil Justice Committee is expected shortly .
The bill , SF 97 , would allow qualified patients or their caregivers to possess up to 2 1/2 ounces of usable marijuana and 12 plants .
People suffering from cancer , glaucoma , AIDS , Hep C , or Tourette 's Syndrome or a chronic or debilitating disease or its treatment that produces wasting syndrome , intractable pain , severe nausea , seizures , or spasms whose doctors approve of their use would qualify .
A previous version of the bill passed the Senate and every House committee vote during the 2007 - 2008 session , but died without a House floor vote .
It faced the strong opposition of law enforcement and a veto threat from Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty .
Pawlenty 's position has not changed , but bill supporters are hoping it will .
" I am increasingly confident that this will be the year that Minnesota joins the 13 other states that have acted to protect medical marijuana patients from arrest , " said bill sponsor Sen. Steve Murphy ( DFL - Red Wing ) .
" This is an issue where science , compassion and simple common sense come together . "
Before voting , the Senate committee heard testimony from opponents and proponents of the bill .
" Two puffs , two minutes , and the violent sickness was totally gone , " said Kathy Rippentrop , who described her mother 's use of marijuana to alleviate the symptoms of cancer chemotherapy .
" An hour later , Mom was able to have a good meal .
The stomach problems from the chemo were totally gone .
It also helped her regain a quality of life that allowed her to continue to fight . "
And while some worried that allowing for the use of medical marijuana would make law enforcement 's job more difficult , Sen. Yvonne Prettner Solon ( DFL - Duluth ) , whose husband died of colon cancer , was not one of them .
" We 're not talking about getting people hooked on drugs and then going out in the street and , you know , destroying their lives and passing it on to other people , " said Prettner Solon .
" We 're talking about end of life issues -- a last resort for people 's suffering . "
While we all know that guns are not toys , these colorful gun replicas designs are cool enough to be placed on a living room wall as a really colorful home design and they are also replicas of famous guns .
These gun replicas gallery designs provided by David Buckingham Studios are absolutely amazing .
The various colors , shapes and design of the assorted guns really give a different style to each , which I have not seen before .
Each of these sculptures also have famous nicknames which we could be familiar with : Son of Sam , Phil Spector , Mark David Chapman , Barney Fife , Travis Bickle III , Officer Christina Labriola LAPD , and Valerie Solanos .
Again , guns are not toys and should not be played with , but all of these seen here are made from cut and welded found metal and are not functional as a weapon .
Thanks David for the permission to post the images .
Merrill Lynch admitted today that it had uncovered a possible rogue currency trader in its London offices , in another blow to the reputation of the bank that was rescued from near - oblivion last year .
Authorities in the UK and Ireland are investigating the foreign exchange trader Alexis Stenfors ( right ) , who worked in the Merrill offices near St Paul 's cathedral .
He is still on the Merrill payroll but listed as inactive on the Financial Services Authority register , meaning he cannot work as a trader .
The Irish Financial Regulator said it had been made aware of " matters relating to the mispricing of trades " in London on 18 February and had authorised investigators to go into the offices in the days that followed .
Merrill Lynch International is registered in Ireland , with the London office operating as a branch .
As well as co-ordinating the investigation with the FSA in London , the Irish regulator is in dialogue with US authorities , including the Federal Reserve .
An independent law firm has been hired and the audit office of Merrill 's parent company , Bank of America ( BoA ) , is also involved .
" We are receiving daily updates on the investigation , " a spokeswoman for the Irish regulator said .
It was not immediately clear what kind of sums were involved , although one report , in the New York Times , suggested that Stenfors had recorded a trading profit of $ 120 m ( £ 85 m ) last year and taken a " handsome bonus " .
The report appeared to suggest his losses could have reached as much as $ 120 m , but that could not be verified last night .
In a brief statement , Merrill said : " During a recent evaluation of certain trading positions , we discovered an irregularity .
We informed regulators immediately and are working closely with authorities to thoroughly investigate the matter .
Senior managers of the business are focused on the issue and believe the risks surrounding possible losses are under control . "
Stenfors , who is understood to have worked at the bank since 1995 , told the New York Times that the allegations were a " misunderstanding " .
His lawyer , Ian Ryan at the firm Finers Stephens Innocent , said that Stenfors was co-operating with the investigation .
More than half the world 's currency trading takes place in London and the volatility in the markets has provided a welcome revenue stream for banks hit by the credit crunch .
The discovery of the " irregularity " is likely to cause further tension between Merrill and BoA , which rescued the bank in a takeover in September .
BoA is said to be investigating whether Merrill delayed booking trading losses until large bonuses were approved and the takeover sealed .
BoA risk officers are said to have uncovered the irregular trades allegedly made by Stenfors .
Relations between BoA and Merrill have become strained since the brokerage slumped to a $ 15.3 bn loss for the final quarter of 2008 .
Merrill said last month that it had understated its losses for 2008 by $ 500 m because of ineffective internal controls .
Merrill 's boss , John Thain , was ousted in January amid a whispering campaign over his management style .
BoA executives privately criticised him for spending $ 1.2 m refurbishing his office with antiques and for planning " inappropriate " parties at this year 's Davos economic summit .
BoA 's chief executive , Ken Lewis , has complained that he was left in the dark about Merrill 's mounting liabilities and that Merrill paid $ 3.6 bn in bonuses to its senior executives against his wishes .
Insiders feel that buying Merrill undermined BoA 's reputation and created a perception of weakness .
Lewis admitted this week that he made a " tactical mistake " in accepting $ 20bn of US government money to support the deal , saying this put BoA in a similar category to strugglers such as Citigroup .
The New York attorney general , Andrew Cuomo , is conducting an investigation into the executive bonuses awarded by Merrill just before the BoA deal was finalised .
Cuomo's office issued subpoenas this week to seven Merrill executives who each banked bonuses of more than $ 10 m , including David Gu , the head of the currency division .
AMID a worsening downturn , bad conditions contribute to layoffs , which reduce spending and fuel debt defaults , which create layoffs , and so on .
But in Dubai , contractionary conditions are actually shrinking the population :
With Dubai ’s economy in free fall , newspapers have reported that more than 3,000 cars sit abandoned in the parking lot at the Dubai Airport , left by fleeing , debt - ridden foreigners ( who could in fact be imprisoned if they failed to pay their bills ) .
Some are said to have maxed - out credit cards inside and notes of apology taped to the windshield .
The government says the real number is much lower .
But the stories contain at least a grain of truth : jobless people here lose their work visas and then must leave the country within a month .
That in turn reduces spending , creates housing vacancies and lowers real estate prices , in a downward spiral that has left parts of Dubai — once hailed as the economic superpower of the Middle East — looking like a ghost town .
Did You Know Who Created GBWhatsApp ?
Here ’s What You Need To Know
You might have already heard about GBWhatsApp , but many of you have n’t used it yet .
Yet many still did n’t know who created it and what is it all about .
Well basically , it is just an app that has a simple logic that everyone has already been using .
How does GBWhats App work ?
If you are using more than one mobile number , you can make use of the dual SIM features in many smartphones nowadays .
With this advantage , dual SIM mobile devices have an edge over other devices having only a single SIM slot .
This is how GBWhatsApp works , as users can add a couple of accounts on the same smartphone .
Thus , you will be able to use 2 WhatsApp accounts in only 1 smartphone .
Surely , many people have more than a single WhatsApp account .
This will be a good reason to download GBWhatsApp .
But , who would make such an app to accommodate users having more than 1 WhatsApp account ?
Who is the creator of GBWhatsApp ?
Many people are wondering who created GBWhatsApp .
Well , the creator of GBWhats App can be found in the GBWhats App website named https://gbmods.co.
The person who commonly found posting about the most recent versions of the app goes by the name of Omar .
You can also catch him on his Twitter account at twitter .com / atnfas_hoak , which he claims to be from Daraa , Syria .
Where to download GBWhatsApp ?
There are many download sources for GBWhatsApp , but you ca n’t find it in the Google Play Store .
So , you have to enable the Unknown Sources option to be able to install third - party apps .
Just as you would on any app you download away from the official Android repository , you can also apply on GBWhatsApp .
However , before you install GBWhatsApp on your Android mobile device , you should have Whats App installed .
Then , in the process of installing GBWhatsApp , you will be prompted to Agree and Continue .
Just do n’t forget to disable the Unknown Sources option from the Settings ->
Security to avoid allowing malware to get into your system .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The ugly sales year that was 2008 will haunt U.S. retailers in 2009 , with industry experts warning that disastrous holiday sales will spark a domino effect of store closures and bankruptcy filings .
And , with thousands of fewer stores , the " shop - ' til - you - drop " mentality that has characterized American consumerism could be coming to an end .
" There 's going to be a massive sea change in the retail landscape , " said Nina Kampler , executive vice president with Hilco Real Estate , which advises retailers on their property management .
She said many strip shopping centers already have multiple big - box vacancies after several large stores filed for bankruptcy in 2008 .
Some eventually went out of business .
When that happens , the smaller stores in the strip centers can't attract the requisite customer traffic to stay productive and profitable .
Michael Burden , principal with industry adviser Excess Space Retail Services , expects as many as 14,000 stores will close in 2009 .
" We could see among the highest ever number of closures , " he said .
He said states such as Nevada , California and Florida will be especially hard hit .
The International Council of Shopping Centers estimates that chain store closings could exceed 3,100 in just the first half of the year .
Burden 's firm , whose 450 U.S. retail clients include Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) , Home Depot ( HD , Fortune 500 ) , J.C. Penney ( JCP , Fortune 500 ) and Sears ( SHLD , Fortune 500 ) , helps retailers in the disposition of their surplus real estate .
He said most merchants will be in a " bunker " mentality .
" It 's about survivability , " he said .
" Retailers have to really fight to live another day and do what they can to get through to 2010 . "
Burden said that means closing underperforming stores , shedding stores under bankruptcy restructuring , and even " right - sizing " stores - shrinking the store size or moving to a smaller location .
" We 'll see a lot of shaking out of the industry , " he said , adding that no sector will be spared .
" Apparel , home furnishings , home improvement , electronics , luxury sellers will all close stores . "
Consumer impact
For consumers , it will mean both fewer stores to shop and possibly less brand variety on shelves .
" Retailers across the board from top - end luxury to mom-and - pop stores on Main Street are feeling a gigantic consumer [ spending ] choke from people 's perceived and actual loss of wealth , " said Kampler .
" At the end of the day , people are buying far less stuff .
They are buying what they need as opposed to what they want , " she said .
This spending slump , which started in early 2008 , has already claimed a number of retail casualties .
Prominent national chains such as Linens 'n Things , Steve & Barry's , KB Toys , Whitehall Jewelers and Shoe Pavilion have gone out of business .
Still others such as No. 2 electronics seller Circuit City are barely surviving , hoping to find a lifeline while in bankruptcy protection .
But after suffering one of the worst year - end shopping seasons in decades - November and December combined can account for half of merchants ' annual profits and sales - experts predict that many more chains will disappear .
Kampler said she personally knows of " dozens " of retailers who are taking a very hard look at their entire business .
She declined to identify them due to confidentiality agreements .
" They are considering closing entire divisions or restructuring parts of their business that they want to keep , " she said
As retailers ' sales continue to tumble and mall traffic evaporates , one of the biggest challenges for sellers is their rent occupancy costs .
Kampler explained that the amount of rent a retailer can comfortably pay for a given store location is proportionately related to the volume of sales generated at that location .
Ideally , she said a retailer 's occupancy cost should be equal to 10 % of its sales .
But a long stretch of slumping sales and rising mall vacancies can dramatically push up the occupancy costs .
" Once rent and occupancy costs hit the 20 % to 25 % of sales threshold , you are treading water , " she said .
" You ca n't run a viable business with those numbers " .
Also , once a retailer faces a cash shortage , the likely next step is to file for bankruptcy protection .
To that end , Kampler predicts that retail bankruptcy filings will " be huge " in January .
But given the implosive impact of the overall economy on the retail sector , Kampler said filing for bankruptcy could be the death knell for those merchants .
" It used to be that when [ a company ] filed for bankruptcy , it was to restructure its debt and realign its operations in order to emerge alive , " she said .
" Now it 's almost impossible to restructure , " she said , pointing out that a significant number of retailers that did file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this year have eventually gone into liquidation .
Burden agreed with Kampler .
" Companies in bankruptcy are n't getting debtor - in - possession financing , " he said .
" This will continue in 2009 . "
Burden said his firm historically advised retailers to always re-evaluate the bottom 10 % to 15 % of their store base , or the poorest - performing stores in their portfolio , for closures .
But given the level of anxiety in the industry about a severe spending freeze , he said many retailers are already looking at closing up to 25 % to 30 % of their store base .
" Obviously fewer stores means less choice for consumers , " he said .
" I think the whole consumer economy is being recalibrated , " said Kampler .
" It 's something that 's not been done in decades .
I think it will be a three - year recalibration of consumer behavior and expectations . "
While it 's something that she believes is " unavoidable " and will hit the economy in terms of more job losses , she hopes it will also change the consumers ' buy - at - all - cost shopping mentality .
" Consumers are used to thinking about buying 50 T - shirts , 10 pairs of jeans and 6 sneakers , " she said .
" Do we really need all this stuff ?
Ultimately we will all be buying less . "

NASA ’s Odyssey orbiter , the oldest spacecraft operating in orbit around Mars , was successfully rebooted on Wednesday , a procedure that seems to have restored the probe ’s backup systems ( Illustration : NASA / JPL )
NASA ’s Mars Odyssey orbiter woke up refreshed on Wednesday , after being rebooted to clear its memory of the accumulated effects of space radiation .
The reboot also restored Odyssey ’s “ B - side ” , back - up systems that could be used if any problems were to arise in the probe ’s primary equipment .
A power supply on Odyssey ’s “ B - side ” has been down since March 2007 , but engineers suspected a reboot would restore the instrument .
“ For nearly two years , we have not known for certain whether the backup systems would be usable , ” Philip Varghese , Odyssey ’s project manager , said in a statement .
“ This successful reboot has allowed us to ascertain their health and availability for future use . ”
‘ Not risk - free ’
Odyssey has been orbiting Mars since 2001 .
The orbiter ’s last reboot was in October 2003 .

Although a reboot is “ not a risk - free event ” , continuing to operate the craft without refreshing its systems would have left it vulnerable to memory flaws , NASA said last week .
Incoming charged particles from space , called cosmic rays , can cause errors in Odyssey ’s on - board memory that accumulate with time .
A team is now restoring the spacecraft to full function , and the craft ’s science instruments are expected to be back to studying Mars by next week .
Spacecraft highlights
Odyssey , the longest - serving spacecraft currently orbiting Mars , has been the prime communications relay for the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity .
( If Odyssey were to fail , the rovers could relay data through NASA ’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter or Europe ’s Mars Express orbiter .
They also have the capability to relay data directly to Earth . )
The probe paved the way for the agency ’s recent Mars Phoenix lander by detecting vast amounts of frozen water beneath the surface near the planet ’s poles .
Recently , Odyssey found the chemical fingerprints of what might have been an ancient ocean on Mars , as well as the planet ’s first known chloride salt deposits , which may have preserved evidence of past Martian life .
NASA originally planned to conduct the reboot on Monday , but the procedure was delayed in order to analyse a rise in temperature in the probe ’s star camera , which uses the locations of stars to pinpoint the probe ’s orientation .
Engineers later found a temporarily stuck heater circuit was responsible for the readings .
The circuit was switched off before the reboot .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
An 850 - pound emerald said to be worth as much as $ 370 million is in the hands of the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department while a court decides who really owns it , a spokesman for the sheriff said .
This enormous raw emerald was being kept in a Las Vegas , Nevada , warehouse .
The " Bahia Emerald " -- one of the largest ever found -- was reported stolen in September from a secured vault in South El Monte in Los Angeles County .
The report was made by someone who claimed to own the giant gemstone , Los Angeles Sheriff 's Lt. Thomas Grubb said .
Federal court papers showed the emerald has been at the center of a dispute between a California man who claimed ownership , a company he contracted with to sell it , and a potential buyer .
Detective work traced the Brazilian stone to a Las Vegas , Nevada , warehouse , where the person in possession claimed to be the rightful owner , Grubb said .
A federal judge ordered the sheriff to hold the 180,000 - carat emerald until he can sort the case out , Grubb said .
Investigators suspect someone used falsified papers to remove the stone from the secured vault in California , although no criminal charges have been filed , Grubb said .
While Grubb said it was his understanding the stone had been appraised at $ 370 million , the value is unclear .
The company hired by the owner to sell it said in court papers it had received a $ 19 million offer , which the company wanted to accept .
It alleged the gemstone 's owner then tried to go around the broker to sell the emerald to the same buyer for $ 75 million .
At one point , the emerald was listed for sale on eBay for a " buy it now " price of $ 75 million .

JERUSALEM ( CNN ) --
Arab protesters threw rocks and hurled insults at flag - waving Jewish marchers in Israel 's largest Arab city on Tuesday , an event that reflected fresh hostilities between Israel 's Arab citizenry and rightist sectors of the Jewish state .
The march by Israeli extremists turned into violence on the streets of Umm al - Fahm .
About 100 far - rightists marched in the predominantly Muslim town of Umm al - Fahm , and the angry Arab demonstrations that erupted after the march took place left more than nearly 30 people injured and at least 10 people detained , police said .
Deputy Israeli police commissioner Shahar Ayalon and 15 other policemen were wounded by stone throwing demonstrators , 12 Umm al - Fahm residents were hurt in scuffles with police .
Police also said Israeli leftist lawmaker Ilan Ghilon , a member of the Meretz Party , was lightly injured by a tear gas grenade .
The Jewish group , led by Hebron activist Baruch Marzel , petitioned the Supreme Court for permission to stage the march , with the rightists arguing that they were exercising their right to march under Israeli law as Arabs and Muslims have in Israeli towns like Tel Aviv .
But marchers disseminated a particularly hot - button message in Umm al - Fahm that has been setting people off :
They demanded that Israeli Arabs should be loyal to the Jewish state , a stance considered insulting by many Israeli Arabs .
While the march leaders are not affiliated with right - wing party Yisrael Beytenu , their words about Arab loyalty reflect the concerns among Israeli Arabs about that political movement , which made a strong showing in recent elections .
It has called on Arabs -- who it sees as disloyal to Israel -- to have their citizenship revoked .
And , Avigdor Lieberman , that party 's leader , also said that such Arab towns like Umm al - Fahm could become part of a Palestinian state in any peace arrangement .
Leaders in Umm al - Fahm -- the scene of past bloody clashes with police and an Islamist hub -- warned that the march would provoke violence , and 2,500 police mobilized in the town .
Arab demonstrators waved Palestinian flags , chanted slogans and threw rocks .
Police fired tear gas canisters .
There were also Israeli Jews in Umm al - Fahm who protested the right - wing march and agreed that the display hurt Jewish - Arab relations .
According to the CIA Factbook , Israel 's Jewish population is 76.4 percent .
It 's non-Jewish population is 23.6 percent , including 16 percent Muslim , 1.7 percent Arab Christians and 1.6 percent Druze .

“ We have become the World War II Japanese and Germans , ” a prominent American law school dean writes of the United States in a book of essays .
“ We do what they did , and we use similar justifications , albeit we alter them to fit our own circumstances .
Meanwhile the Japanese and the Germans are now the opposite . ”
In his book “ An Enemy of the People ” ( Doukathsan Press ) Lawrence Velvel , dean of the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover , says , “ it is a marvelous thing ” that Japan and Germany in the last half century “ have very little or nothing in common with the savages of the war period .
They seem to have become instead , and largely because of the U.S. one gathers , exemplary to the world . ”
“ They are democracies , ”  Velvel continues .
“ They are prosperous .
They show no desire to make war .
And all this in major part because of American tutelage and aid . ” 
In his essay comparing America under the recent Bush administration to Germany and Japan of World War II , Velvel writes :
“ It is now America that is using torture ” ¦and that is justifying torture and is engaging in , and causing , mass killing — with the result being three million dead ” ¦in Viet Nam and somewhere between 30,000 and 100,000 more in Iraq . ” 
Just as Japanese militarists seek to rearm their country and expunge any mention of Japan ’s war crimes from their text books , Velvel says in America supposed patriots want the public to endorse Bush - style “ patriotism ”  that includes torture and making aggressive war .
Velvel writes , America “ has become the most warlike nation on earth , fighting war after war after war …
It was Japan and Germany that claimed that war , torture , mass killing ” ¦were necessary for national safety , and now it is America that claims it will achieve national safety through war . ” 
As a result of its aggressive ways , the U.S. “ is finding that other countries ” ¦are beginning to gang up against it ” ¦ ” 
If accusations of treason and lack of patriotism are to be thrown around , Velvel writes , “ in my view the traitors are those like Bush and his allies who ignore the ideals that give meaning to America , and instead are making this country into one that imitates the barbarism of our enemies of WWII and of the Soviet Union before and during the Cold War . ” 
Noting that right - wing U.S. backers of Bush policies claim anti-war liberals “ cannot run national security and wo n’t fight where necessary , ”  Velvel replies that many necessary U.S. wars “ were run at the top civilian level by liberals . ” 
He cites the Revolutionary War that “ was run by the Continental Congress , dominated by great liberals of their day ”  ; the Civil War , run by Lincoln ; World Wars I and II , run by ( Presidents Woodrow ) Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt , respectively ; and the Korean War , run by President Harry Truman .
Velvel concludes America ’s great problems include “ a widely prevailing lack of imagination or empathy , so that one does not understand or care about what the other guy may be feeling , and that causes approval of torture as well as other major problems . ” 
Dean Velvel is cofounder of the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover , opened in 1988 and purposefully dedicated to providing a quality , affordable education to minorities , immigrants , and students from low - income households who could not otherwise afford to attend a law school .

Andry Rajoelina has tapped into frustration with the government
A key opposition leader in Madagascar has called for more protests against the president , a day after security forces killed 28 of his supporters .
Andry Rajoelina , who was dismissed last week from his post as mayor of the capital , Antananarivo , spoke as he visited injured supporters in hospital .
He is locked in a power struggle with President Marc Ravalomanana , who he says should step down .
There have been repeated protests against the firing of the ex-mayor .
Demonstrators had been marching towards President Ravalomanana 's compound on Saturday when police opened fire , killing 28 and injuring more than 200 .
We cannot stop - the struggle continues

Earlier , during a rally attended by 20,000 people , the former mayor 's supporters had declared him head of a " transition higher authority " .
Mr Rajoelina , a 34 - year - old former DJ , has successfully tapped into widespread frustration with the government .
" I tell the people that their lives , their blood was lost , " he said on Sunday .
" ( But ) we can not stop .
The struggle continues , "
" The people need change , " he said .
" What is Ravalomanana 's answer ?
Shots . "
There was an uneasy calm on the streets of the capital Sunday as heavily armed security forces patrolled , correspondents said .
Prime Minister Charles Rabemananjara announced that a night - time curfew already in force in the capital would be extended for a week , AFP news agency reported .
The sacked mayor accuses President Marc Ravalomanana of misspending public money and being a dictator .
President Ravalomanana , 59 and also a former mayor of Antananarivo , has blamed the opposition leader for the violence and called for a return to calm .
Dozens of people were killed in unrest in January after anti-government protests turned into rioting and looting .
Madagascar , the world 's fourth - largest island , has become a destination for tourists as well as foreign companies , searching for oil , gold , cobalt , nickel and uranium .
I think he 's dreaming of chasing the mailman ..
The hallucinogen N, N - dimethyltryptamine , the active ingredient of mind - bending snuffs and sacramental teas used in shamanic rituals in South America and which also occurs naturally in the body , has been unmasked as the binding partner for a widely occurring receptor molecule whose function remains unknown .
For decades scientists have puzzled over the role of the sigma - 1 receptor , a protein found in almost all mammalian cells , including the nervous system .
A key question that remained elusive was the identity of natural ligands for the protein .
Now a team led by Arnold Ruoho of the University of Wisconsin in the US has provided compelling evidence that dimethyltryptamine , or DMT , is one of sigma - 1 ’s ligands .
Sigma - 1 was known to bind a range of molecules with a common chemical backbone .
Ruoho and his team searched for naturally occurring compounds with the key structure .
They alighted upon DMT , which has been found in human blood , urine and cerebrospinal fluid , but whose function in the body is not known .
The team showed that in the test tube DMT was able to displace molecules that are known to bind with high affinity to sigma - 1 .
They then compared the effect of DMT on heart muscle cells from mice that possessed sigma - 1 with those genetically engineered not to produce the receptor - so - called sigma - 1 receptor knock - out mice .
Here , the activity of an ion channel was inhibited where sigma - 1 was present , but unaffected in its absence .
Ion channels are important in cell signalling processes , and the result suggest not only that DMT is interacting with sigma - 1 , but also that sigma - 1 might be an ion-channel regulator .
Finally the team gave DMT to mice with and without the receptor .
’ We showed that DMT increased the activity of wild - type mice , but in the knock - out mice there was no response , ’ says Ruoho .
Intriguingly both sigma - 1 receptors and endogenously occurring DMT have been implicated in diseases such as schizophrenia .
The new results open the way , says Ruoho , to search for synthetic compounds based on DMT that bind more powerfully to the receptor and observe their effects .
’ This is a very important finding and will lead to more interest in the role of DMT and the sigma - 1 receptor in mental illness , ’ says James Stone of the Institute of Psychiatry in London .
’ People did not know what the natural ligand of sigma - 1 was , and this has led to a lot of blind alleys .
So this is really big news . ’
Radiochemist Erik Arstad , of University College London , who has worked on sigma - 1 receptors , agrees that the finding is significant .
’ Given the potent hallucinogenic effects of DMT , its presence in the human body has so far been a mystery .
The role of the sigma - 1 receptor is also poorly understood , so the suggested link between endogenous DMT levels and modulation of the sigma - 1 receptor is intriguing .
The findings are likely to spur considerable interest in the sigma - 1 receptor , as well as trace amines , particularly in relation to mental illnesses such as schizophrenia . ’

The Vulcan has thrilled thousands of people but costs £ 1.6 m a year to run
" It made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up " said Dr Robert Pleming , chief executive of the Vulcan to the Sky Trust , of the aircraft 's first public take - off .
" All the hospitality tents emptied , all the movers and shakers of the industry came out , the crowds at the fence must have been 20 deep .
" Everyone was silent , all you could hear was the roar of the engines and the clicking of cameras .
And suddenly she was up . "
The restored Vulcan bomber XH558 first flew in front of the public at RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire in July 2008 .
The team admit to moments of both despair and elation But , it could be permanently grounded if the project does not raise another £ 1 m by the end of January .
" This whole project has run on the power of a dream " said Andrew Edmonson , the project 's engineering director .
The restoration , based at Bruntingthorpe in Leicestershire , went roughly double over budget .
The operational phase , actually taking to the air , has running costs of about £ 1.6 m per year - insurance alone costs £ 180,000 .
Top secret
The main source of income was supposed to be corporate sponsorship but the economic downturn is causing problems with that .
Dr Pleming said : " The whole scene has changed now , in that heritage is not seen as such good news by companies , you know ' Why are we doing this ?
This is old technology .
We do n't need to be wasting money on this . '
It is as awesome today as it was then
Dr Robert Pleming , chief executive of the Vulcan to the Sky Trust He added : " Marketing budgets have come into very strict review and have been trimmed right down and that has really hurt us .
" It 's a real problem , almost a perfect storm in terms of funding the project . "
Despite delays caused by a sticking undercarriage flap , engine problems and faulty brakes , Mr Edmonson said , the aircraft had been " reasonably reliable " .
" One of the main problems we had was with the electrics .
It was all cutting edge , top secret stuff in the 1950s but it did n't like the modern power systems .
" We kept trying to connect it up at airbases and it kept blowing fuses .
That became an art in itself . "
Technological leap Another issue was the sheer size of the aircraft - 97ft 1ins ( 29.59 m ) from nose to tail , 99ft 5ins ( 30.3 m ) wing tip to tip .
" We would be assured ( the airfield ) had a space for us , " said Mr Edmonson .
" But there was often a bit of an awkward pause when the local ground crews saw her .
" Then it was a case of finding out if the space was big enough , or if they had a tractor powerful enough to move her . "
The aircraft only makes a fraction of its income from airshows
While the pilots apparently find the aircraft a pleasure to fly , the vintage machine has a few peculiarities .
" It does n't like the wet , " Mr Edmonson said .
" It seems to get in everywhere .
On one take off , the engineer reported seeing water pouring out of the wings . "
But with all the effort , expense and stress , was the first year in the air worth it ?
Dr Pleming 's response goes back to that first flight at Waddington when it joined the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight 's Lancaster .
" That first flight with the Lancaster was really important because there was only 11 years separating the first flight of the Lancaster in 1941 and the first flight of the Vulcan in 1952 .
" That is one of the big reasons I got involved because people forget what a huge achievement it was , what a huge leap in technology .
" From the old Lancaster with piston engines , with straight wings , chugging along at 200 mph ( 322 km / h ) to this amazing new concept , the tailless Delta wing with its jet engines , electric controls and countermeasures , just a completely new generation of aircraft . "
" It is as awesome today as it was then . "

WASHINGTON  The Obama administration and the Federal Reserve , still smarting from the political furor over the bailout of American International Group , began a full - court press on Tuesday to expand the federal government ’s power to seize control of troubled financial institutions deemed too big to fail .
In his news conference on Tuesday night , President Obama said the government could have handled the A.I.G. bailout much more effectively if it had had the same power to seize large financial companies as it did to take over failed banks .
“ It is precisely because of the lack of this authority that the A.I.G. situation has gotten worse , ” Mr. Obama said , predicting that “ there is going to be strong support from the American people and from Congress to provide that authority . ”
Earlier on Tuesday , the Treasury secretary , Timothy F. Geithner , offered a proposal that would allow the government to take control , restructure and possibly close any kind of financial institution that was in trouble and big enough to destabilize the broader financial system .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
One of the victims of the Buffalo commuter plane crash , Beverly Eckert , was a Sept. 11 widow who put her never - ending grief to good use to make the country safer .
President Obama , speaking in the White House 's East Room , said Eckert " was an inspiration to me and to so many others , and I pray that her family finds peace and comfort in the hard days ahead . "
A week before her death , Eckert met with Obama at the White House as part of a group of 9/11 families and relatives of those killed in the bombing of the USS Cole , discussing how the new administration would handle terror suspects .
Eckert was flying to Buffalo Thursday night to celebrate what would have been her husband Sean Rooney 's 58th birthday .
When he died in the World Trade Center , she became one of the most visible , tearful faces in the aftermath of the terror attacks .
Carol Ashley , whose daughter died at the World Trade Center , said the grim details of Eckert 's death are particularly painful to Eckert 's friends among 9/11 families .
" The fact that it was a plane crash , it was fire , it was reminiscent of 9/11 that way , that 's just very difficult , " said Ashley , a retired schoolteacher from Long Island .
She carried that grief to Congress as she tried to make the government do a better job protecting its citizens from terrorism .
Her husband worked at Aon Corp. , a risk management firm , at the 98th floor of the south tower .
Eckert would cry when she told the story about how her husband — who was her high school sweetheart — called her on the morning of the attacks , and told her he loved her just before there was a loud explosion and nothing more .
She became part of a small group of Sept. 11 widows , mothers , and children who became amateur lobbyists , ultimately forcing lawmakers in 2004 to pass sweeping reforms of the U.S. intelligence apparatus .
They spent months walking the halls of Congress .
All of the women were grieving , but Eckert seemed unable or uninterested in holding back her tears .
When it was over and they'd won passage of the intelligence reform law , Eckert vowed to quit her high - profile role " cold turkey . "
All she wanted , she said , was to go home , buy groceries , and return to something like a regular life .
" I did all of this for Sean 's memory , I did it for him , " she said , crying again .
" There is a euphoria in knowing that we reached the top of the hill .
... I just wanted Sean to come home from work .
Maybe now , someone else 's Sean will get to come home . "
Eckert was flying to her hometown Thursday night when the plane crashed on approach to the Buffalo airport .
After the 2001 attacks , she co-chaired the 9/11 Family Steering Committee , a group of activists devoted to exposing government failures that led up to the 2001 attacks , and fixing them .
She pushed for a 9/11 Commission .
She pushed the Bush administration to provide more information to the commission .
And when the commission 's work was over , she pushed Congress to adopt their recommendations .
For Eckert , the public role was not easy .
One night after a long day at Congress , she found herself in the New York City train station , without a connecting train to her home in Stamford , Connecticut .
" We slept in the train station .
We had no place else to go .
That 's when you look at yourself and say , ' What am I doing ?
How can we possibly get this done ? '. "
As Congress hemmed and hawed , Eckert vowed to sleep there , too , if it would get the law passed .
After the law passed , Eckert turned her energies to Habitat for Humanity , helping build homes for low - income families .
" I'm in shock , I just can't believe it , " said Carie Lemack , whose mother died Sept. 11 on one of the hijacked planes .
" Beverly had a can - do attitude about everything , and she never gave up . "

Details of the document , which could prompt calls from Egypt for a return of the 3,400 - year - old figure of the Pharaonic queen , hailed as the world 's most beautiful woman , were revealed by German news magazine Der Spiegel .
Written in 1924 , the archival material recounts a meeting held on Jan. 20 , 1913 between Borchardt and Egypt 's chief antiquities inspector Gustave Lefebvre to divide the treasures found in archaeological digs .
It indicates that Ludwig Borchardt , the archaeologist who discovered the bust in 1912 , deliberately withheld its true value from Egyptian authorities .
But the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation , which is in possession of the bust , has rejected claims that the finds were not divided up fairly .
" We are not worried about having to return Nefertiti because the division of the objects from the dig was perfectly legal , " said a spokeswoman for the foundation , which administers Berlin 's state - run museums .
Hidden value
The archaeologist reportedly wanted to keep the bust for Germany
According to the document , which was recently discovered in the archives of the German Oriental Society and penned by the secretary of the German Oriental Company who was present at the meeting , " Borchardt wanted to save the bust for us , " Der Spiegel said .
To achieve this goal the bust was tightly wrapped and placed at the bottom of a box in a poorly lit room where Lefebvre was examining artifacts discovered during the excavation .
According to the witness , Borchardt presented an unflattering photograph of the bust .
He also said it was made of gypsum , which is of little value , when in fact Nefertiti was painted on limestone .
This apparent deception resulted in official permission for the bust to be exported to Germany where it is now seen by hundreds of thousands of visitors every year at Berlin 's Egyptian Museum .
Egypt wants bust back
Nefertiti is said to have been the most beautiful woman in the world
The secretary general of Egypt 's Supreme Council of Antiquities said Wednesday , Feb. 11 , that he wanted to see the document and may pursue legal , political , diplomatic channels to get the bust back .
" If reports are true and such document exists we will start taking strong action , " Zahi Hawwas told the DPA news service in Cairo .
" The revelation , if true , is great news that will certainly back our case . "
Hawass has previously said Borchardt covered the bust in mud to disguise its real worth .
Nefertiti was the chief wife of Pharaoh Akhenaten , who ruled during the period around 1350 BC .
Center of dispute
The bust has been a subject of dispute between Germany and Egypt for years , with Berlin refusing to allow it to travel to Cairo for the opening of Egypt 's National Museum in 2011 .
The bust was initially kept in the Berlin home of James Simon , the German merchant and patron of the arts who funded the dig at Amarna , 150 kilometers ( 93 miles ) out of Cairo .
Simon later donated it to the state , which put it on public display in 1924 .
It has graced various museums since , accompanied by repeated calls from Egypt for it to be returned .
Germany , starting with the Adolph Hitler 's Nazi regime , have refused Egyptian requests to return the bust , insisting that their legal ownership of the bust is beyond question .
The bust of Nefertiti is set to obtain a new home this fall in the nearby Neues Museum , which is being renovated .

Mininova , one of the leading BitTorrent sites , has been suffering from a massive DDoS attack over the past few days .
Originating from a botnet spanning three continents , the attacks vary in strength and are causing the site to be completely inaccessible at times .
The Mininova team is working on a solution .
DDoS attacks are not an unusual event for BitTorrent sites , with smaller sites suffering the effects more often than they ’d like .
However , to take out one of the big players requires some serious power , and that is exactly what Mininova is up against right now .
Mininova co-founder Niek confirmed to TorrentFreak that they have been suffering from a DDoS attack over the past few days .
The site is currently being pounded by a botnet of hundreds of computers which is slowing the site down significantly and at times making it completely inaccessible .
Niek said that he has no idea who ’s behind the attack or why they chose to target Mininova .
This is not the first time the site has had to deal with a Denial of Service attack , but they have n’t witnessed one of this magnitude before .
It started on Thursday originating from three different continents , but seemed to wear off in the hours that followed .
Today it ’s back in full force .
Mininova is used to serving millions of visitors a day , but even they are not equipped to handle an attack like this .
Today ’s attack originates from Germany and Argentina and is 2 Gbit strong .
The DDoS attack is maxing out the entire uplink and is hard to filter since it uses UDP connections .
Niek told TorrentFreak that they are working on a solution at the moment , and he hopes things will be back to normal soon .
The appearance of Bar Refaeli on the cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue is not without controversy .
Yes , it may be the magazine ’s most uncovered cover pose to date .
True , too , that comments the Israeli model made to a magazine last fall cast her in an unpatriotic , cowardly , and shallow light .
Israel ’s
Ynet reported the story in an article sensationally titled Dodging IDF paid off big time .
First , it pointed out that to take advantage of an exemption from mandatory military service , Ms. Refaeli married an acquaintance who she later divorced .
Worse , she said :
I really wanted to serve in the IDF , but I do n’t regret not enlisting , because it paid off big time . …
That ’s just the way it is , celebrities have other needs .
While she may not have served her country , at least did her part to confirm the dumb model stereotype .
But , to be fair , like Americans who evaded the draft decades ago , Ms. Refaeli seems to have acted out of a combination of self - interest and opposition to war .
Why is it good to die for our country ? …
Why should 18 - year - old kids have to die ?
It might be an issue in Israel , where its militarized society is indisposed to try to understand the motives of those who do n’t serve .
In fact , if hindsight is 20 / 20 , Ms. Refaeli comes off as prescient for avoiding possible complicity in the IDF ’s latest barbarity ( Gaza , of course ) .
To Americans , meanwhile , who do n’t have to deal with the draft , it ’s less of an issue .
Besides , you can make a case that the role of Sports Illustrated ’s swimsuit cover model is the print equivalent of a USO tour .
Then where ’s the controversy ?
One look at Ms. Refaeli ’s cover picture and you might come to the same conclusion as commenter Pat A at Huffington Post :
God did n’t give her those breasts .
God gave an engineer somewhere the ability to make a sac that holds a huge amount of silicone and then he helped some doctor learn how to put those babies on gullible women .
Because of her robust build , you could make a case that Ms. Refaeli ’s breasts are natural .
But the similar size of the breasts of most of the other models in the issue — laborious research reveals — defies credulity .
Especially if you watch the TV show Project Runway , which , in large part , is about the challenge of making clothing that flatters young women whose starved bodies seem to have cannibalized the fat in their breast .
Still , the breasts in this year ’s Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue do n’t seem as inflated as those of last year ’s cover model , Marisa Miller .
Presumably , like the excesses of wealth , ostentatious bra cup sizes are now out of favor ( except in pornography ) .
But silicone implants are not exactly breaking news .
Why , you ask , make a big deal out of them now ?
In a February 9 Sports Illustrated story , Selena Roberts and David Epstein reported that baseball superstar Alex Rodriguez tested positive for anabolic steroids in 2003 , the year he won both the home run title and MVP for the Texas Rangers .
See where I ’m going with this ?
How can your biggest story of the year expose an athlete for using artificial supplements , while your biggest issue of the year features models who likely used artificial implants ?
Looking at these women is the same as watching Major League Baseball players you suspect of doing steroids .
They ’ve all taken extreme measures which both give their bodies an unfair competitive edge and expose them to unhealthy substances .
Sports Illustrated needs to cancel its subscription to hypocrisy .
If it decides trimness is of the essence , feature models with breasts proportional to their hips .
If large breasts are deemed more important , use models with hips proportional to their breasts .
Sports Illustrated needs to understand that the swimsuit issue is not just starter pornography for young men ( and a showcase for the swimsuit fashion industry ) .
Young girls , too , are examining it for cues on what attracts boys .
Does Sports
Illustrated really want to be complicit in encouraging the use of implants ?
She fits the cliché of the Canadian who is a celebrity abroad but is mostly ignored at home .
Naomi Klein shot to international fame eight years ago with her book No Logo , which has since sold 1 million copies .
The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism , published 15 months ago , has already sold 800,000 copies and been translated into 26 languages .
Last week , a documentary based on the book was released at the Berlin Film Festival .
Her speaking engagements and political activism keep her on the road , around the world .
Her newsletter goes to 30,000 subscribers .
No Logo charted the corporate commodification of youth pop culture and the casualization of labour ( what 's sold in the West are expensive brands , not products , which can be manufactured cheaply in the East ) .
The Shock Doctrine is about the globalization of the neo-conservative ideas pioneered by Chicago economist Milton Friedman and popularized by Ronald Reagan .
There was the massive privatization – not only of public services at home but wars abroad ( private security forces and contractors galore in Iraq and Afghanistan ) and even disaster relief ( post - tsunami and Katrina ) .
There was the deregulation of the markets , which led , inevitably , to the current economic meltdown .
Critics attack her for seeing corporate conspiracies .
They particularly sneer at her hypothesis , announced in the book 's subtitle , that right - wing economic policies have faced such popular resistance that they can only be introduced in the jet stream of shock - and - awe wars and natural disasters ( laying off tens of thousands of Iraqis in order to sell state enterprises ; building tourist beach hotels in Southeast Asian fishing villages washed away by the tsunami ) .
Her admirers see the economic crisis as proof of her prescience .
The New Yorker magazine recently ran a 12 - page profile : " She has become the most visible and influential figure on the American left – what Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky were 30 years ago . "
She has campaigned against the University of Chicago 's plan to build a $ 200 million Milton Friedman Institute to honour its former professor , who died in 2006 .
" The crash on Wall St. should be for Friedmanism what the fall of the Berlin Wall was for authoritarian communism , an indictment of an ideology , " she has said .
In a twist of fate , the economic crisis has dried up funding for the institute , and it has been put on hold – much to her delight .
In an interview Tuesday , Klein , 38 , said she welcomes the election of Barack Obama .
But she has two problems : his refusal to insist on accountability for recent American misdemeanours abroad and at home ; and his " narrative that everything went wrong only eight years ago " with the election of George W. Bush .
It was Bill Clinton who periodically bombed Iraq and tightened the economic sanctions that killed 1 million Iraqis , including 500,000 children , according to UNICEF .
It was he who axed the Depression - era restrictions that had prevented investment banks from also being commercial banks .
He and Alan Greenspan resisted the regulation of the huge derivatives industry .
If you develop amnesia about all that , " then you do exactly what Obama is doing .
You resurrect the Clinton economic and foreign policy apparatus , and you appoint Larry Summers , the key architect of the economic policy that has imploded at this moment . "
Obama 's economic recovery plan , especially the bank bailout , is a disaster .
It is " layering complexity over complexity .
What got us into this mess in the first place were these complex financial instruments that nobody understood .
Now they have a bailout that nobody understands .
" The facts are easy to understand , namely , that these banks are bankrupt and they should be allowed to go under or be nationalized because there also needs to be a workable financial sector .
" The amount of money that 's at stake in the bailout – if you include everything , the deposit guarantees , the loans , Fannie May and Freddie Mac and AIG – is now up to $ 9 trillion .
The American GDP is only $ 14 trillion .
So they 've put more than half the American economy on the line to try to fix a mess that actually cannot be fixed in this way .
Just look at what happened to Iceland .
The debt that their three top banks held was 10 times their GDP .
You can bankrupt the country this way . "
Obama 's stimulus package is not big enough .
Almost 40 per cent goes to tax cuts .
" And to pay for the cuts , they had to drastically scale back much more important and stimulative spending , on such things as public transit . "
Among the many parallels to the 1930s , the one Klein finds most useful is that president Franklin Roosevelt was under constant public pressure to improve the New Deal .
That " history of resistance , struggle and community organizing " needs to be replicated to keep Obama honest .
" Obama is an important change from Bush , and the reason why he is important is that he is susceptible to pressure from everyone .
He is susceptible to pressure from Wall Street , to pressure from the weapons companies , from the Washington establishment .
But unlike Bush and ( Dick )
Cheney , I do n't think he'd ignore mass protest .
" The irony is that just at the very moment when that kind of grassroots organizing and mobilization could have an impact , we are demobilizing and waiting for the good acts to be handed down from on high , whether it is the withdrawal from Iraq or the perfect economic stimulus package . "
It is equally important that America come to terms with its recent past .

" So much of this moment for me comes down to whether there 's going to be any accountability for what happened – whether it's the illegal occupation of Iraq or torture or the economic crimes that led to this disaster .
" The FBI believes that there 's a huge criminality at the heart of the economic meltdown but they 've made a decision not to prosecute because they were afraid that might send panic through the market .
" All this argument for impunity , amnesia is really corrosive . "

France is embroiled in a bitter row over how to resolve its issues surrounding race after Nicolas Sarkozy 's new diversity tsar suggested breaking one of the republic 's biggest taboos and legalising the counting of ethnic minorities .
Unlike in Britain or the US , where people are often asked to tick a box about ethnic origin , in France it is illegal to classify people by ethnicity or to ask census questions on race or origins .
The foundation stone of the secular French republic is that all citizens should be equal and free from distinctions of class , race or religion .
Sarkozy recently went further than any other French president to denounce the hypocrisy of everyday racism and discrimination , which has poisoned that republican ideal .
He said the lack of data on ethnic minorities was hampering the ability to measure inequality and deal with it .
Meanwhile , race campaigners describe a society plagued by discrimination , where non-white French citizens with " foreign - sounding " names are routinely discriminated against in education and employment , or targeted by police stop and searches .
Even state housing authorities have been found guilty of denying flats on the grounds of race .
Yazid Sabeg , a businessman of Algerian - Berber origin appointed by Sarkozy to advise on tackling discrimination , will today launch a commission to examine ways of officially collecting statistics on France 's ethnic make - up for the first time .
But the proposal has created such a political row that it is unclear whether Sarkozy could shelve any future plans .
Sabeg was due to hand a report to the president on Friday detailing his recommendations , but it was indefinitely postponed by the Elysée , which blamed presidential " diary commitments " .
Sabeg has warned that discrimination in France is so acute that the nation was becoming " an apartheid state " .
He said data collected on minorities would be voluntary and anonymous .
People would not be made to tick a box by human resources departments , but instead in surveys would be asked to define what " community " they felt they belonged to , such as black , white , north African or Asian .
This caused outrage from both left and rightwing politicians and intellectuals in France , where the very word " community " is seen as an affront to the republican ideal .
The British approach of multiculturalism is seen as dangerously divisive .
" Our country must not become a mosaic of communities , " said Fadela Amara , the left - wing junior minister for urban affairs .
French history bears heavily on the debate .
The 1978 law that bans collecting ethnic data has roots in France 's shame over collaboration with the Nazis during the second world war , when Jews were marked with yellow stars and sent to death camps .
" No one else should ever wear a yellow star , " Amara added .
Untitled Document Syndrome
1 .
Scenario : you have an idea for something , start a new document in an appropriate app , and then work for hours before realizing you have n’t yet saved the document ?
Typically , it ’s a chuckle — ha , guess I should save this thing .
Occasionally , it ’s a disaster , because you only realize you had n’t yet saved your work when the app crashes or the power goes out .
I ’ve had the disastrous version happen a few times over the years .
What strikes me as odd , though , is that I still catch myself doing it occasionally .
I call it “ Untitled Document Syndrome ” , because when I catch myself doing it , it ’s almost always with a new untitled document window , not an existing file with unsaved changes .
All subsequent saves after the first one require nothing more than a quick Command -S .
There ’s a great line in Programming Perl , the bible on the Perl programming language by Larry Wall ( Perl ’s creator ) , Tom Christiansen , and Jon Orwant , which sums up the entire appeal of modern scripting languages :
One thing that ’s easy about Perl is that you do n’t have to say much before you say what you want to say .
In Perl , this is a complete working “ Hello world ” program :
print " Hello world
" ;
That same simple example also works , without changing a character , in Python and Ruby .
If you want to print a string , you just say “ print ” .
The equivalent program in C , in contrast , requires you to say a bit before ( and after ) you say what you want to say :
1
#include < stdio.h > main ( ) { printf ( " Hello , world
" ) ; return 0 ; }
The result is that programmers often wind up using syntactically efficient languages like Perl , Python , and Ruby to write little throwaway programs that they might never have written in the first place using , say , C , because it ’s so much less of a hassle to get a simple working program off the ground .
There ’s simply less friction between the idea to write a little program and actually doing it .
You do n’t have to be a programmer to see this .
In fact , I suspect the above examples work even better for those of you who are n’t programmers — the frictiony bits of the C example surely stick out even more if you do n’t understand what they mean .
Friction is a problem for software in general , not just programming languages specifically .
There ’s the stuff you want to do , and there ’s the stuff you have to do before you can do what you want to do .
People have a natural tendency to skip the have to do stuff to get right to the want to do stuff if they can get away with it .
Friction is resistance .
Hence untitled document windows containing hours of unsaved work — there ’s an idea in your head that you want to express or explore , and the path of least resistance is to hit Command - N and just start working .
Saving a document for the first time is a minor chore , but it ’s a chore nonetheless .
The avoidance of such a minor chore is not rational ; it is neither particularly complicated nor time consuming to hit Command - S and deal with the Save dialog .
But we humans are not perfectly rational .
We do n’t always floss our teeth .
We ’ll pick the burger and fries instead of the salad .
We ’ll have one more beer .
And sometimes we just do n’t feel like dealing with the Save dialog box yet so we ’ll put it off .
2 .
So one conclusion to draw from this is that developers of document - based applications should protect users from themselves .
Your work should be saved even if your document is not .
Separate the management of items in the file system from the idea that what you ’ve typed or drawn or edited should be “ safe ” .
BBEdit 9 has a good implementation of such a feature .
Once a minute , it silently and invisibly stores a copy of every open document window .
If BBEdit crashes or otherwise exits abnormally ( like , say , if the entire system goes down ) , when next you launch BBEdit , it restores your work to the last auto - saved state .
The worst case scenario is that you lose 59 seconds of work .
This is not about auto - saving your files in the file system — BBEdit ’s auto - save will also restore untitled document windows that have never been saved as files .
There ’s no good reason why every application should n’t protect your work in a similar way .
But the more important conclusion is less obvious , which is that nearly everyone can benefit from the use of software that does n’t require explicit file system management at all .
Most of Apple ’s iLife suite works this way , for example .
There is no chore involved with adding music or video to your iTunes library , or importing a new batch of pictures to iPhoto .
It ’s rare to have , say , two songs with the same file name , but using iTunes you do n’t have to worry about it .
Just add them both and iTunes will figure out how to store them .
iTunes became popular and useful before there was an iPod , and before there was an iTunes Store , because it absolved the user from managing music as discrete files in the file system .
Instead of putting music files into a folder , all you had to do was put it into iTunes .
Once you ’ve added a song to iTunes you no longer need to worry about where it actually is in the file system .
2
Everything on your computer is ultimately saved somewhere in the file system .
But that does n’t mean that you want to handle the actual filing by hand for everything .
You do n’t really want to know a lot of things about the specific technical details of how your data is saved , or if you did , you ’d write your own app .
And those of you who object to these generalizations — those of you shaking your heads and saying to yourselves , No , I very much do want to specify by hand the file name and location in the hierarchical directory structure for every bit of data on my system — are almost certainly , I would wager , computer programmers .
To argue that users should embrace manual file system management for every bit of data they wish to store is to argue against human nature .
3 .
The obvious problem with Untitled Document Syndrome is in the rare cases where you lose data because you never saved it .
The non-obvious problem is that the mental friction posed by the Save dialog often keeps you from ever even creating or saving small items of data in the first place .
This , I think , explains the relative popularity of Mac OS X’s included Stickies application .
For years , Stickies ’s popularity confounded me .
Why would anyone use a note - taking utility that requires you to leave every saved note open in its own window on screen ?
The more you use it , the more cluttered it gets .
But here ’s the thing : cluttered though it may be , you never have to save anything in Stickies .
Switch to Stickies , Command - N , type your new note , and you ’re done .
( And , yes , if you create a new sticky note , then force - quit Stickies , the note you just created will be there when next you launch the app .
Stickies ’s auto - save happens while you type , not just at quit time . )
It feels easy and it feels safe .
Stickies does not offer a good long - term storage design , but it offers a frictionless short - term jot - something - down - right - now design .
Let ’s say , on the other hand , that your system for saving small text notes for future reference is to create them as individual files using a simple text editor .
This , in fact , was my system for about four years .
I kept a folder named “ Misc. ” and whenever I ’d want to jot something down for future reference — movies I wanted to rent , the steps to go through to reboot a particular server , ideas for projects , anything — I ’d create a new text file in that folder and jot the note down using BBEdit .
I started doing this at some point in 2001 and kept doing it until 2005 , when I switched to Yojimbo .3
By the time I dropped my “ folder full of text files ” system , I had about 50 files in the folder — which works out to about one new file per month .
As of this writing , I have 1,588 notes in Yojimbo — which works out to about one per day .
The single biggest advantage I ’ve gained by switching to Yojimbo is that I actually use it .
For any little thought or tidbit of information I want to remember , I create a new Yojimbo note .
The result , now that I ’ve accumulated several years worth of notes , occasionally amazes me .
It ’s like having a mind with an unfailing memory ( which I most decidedly do not possess ) .
Just one example , from earlier this week : I wear two - week disposable contact lenses , and , after making my first appointment with a new optometrist , realized that I threw away the box from my last pair without noting the exact brand and model .
I check in Yojimbo with a search for “ contact lens ” , and , yes , there it is , from November 2007 : Bausch and Lomb Optima FW ( SofLens 38 ) .
Yojimbo is not alone in this category of utilities , and a detailed paean regarding the specific Yojimbo features I like best will require more space than even my generous standards for parenthetical digressions allow .
But the key is that it minimizes friction .
There ’s little friction to create a new note , and little friction to search for existing ones .
And you never have to explicitly save anything .
This is not an argument that all software should abstract the file system by using the library paradigm , but just that more software should .
It ’s like the aforementioned differences between the C and Perl “ Hello world ” programming examples .
When you do n’t have to do much before ( or after ) doing what you want to do , you do surprisingly more .

Speak out against the National Animal Identification System !
The USDA has proposed a rule to require all farms and ranches where animals are raised to be registered in a federal database under the National Animal Identification System ( NAIS ) for existing disease control programs .
The draft rule covers programs for cattle , sheep , goats and swine .
It also sets the stage for the entire NAIS program to be mandated for everyone , including anyone who owns even one livestock animal ( for example , a single chicken or a horse ) .
Learn more about the legislation in The Truth About the Animal ID Plan .
It ’s critical that the USDA and Congress hear from the hundreds of thousands of people who will be adversely affected by the NAIS program .
This includes not only animal owners , but also consumers who care about local and sustainable foods , taxpayers who object to wasteful government programs and advocates for a safer food system .
STEP 1 : Submit comments to USDA online or by mail .
The comments must be received by the USDA by March 16 , 2009 .
Submit comments on the federal regulations website ( click on the yellow balloon under “ add comments ” ) .

Or mail two copies of your comments to the USDA at the address below .
Clearly state that your comments refer to Docket No. APHIS - 2007 - 0096 .

After receiving multiple complaints about NBC's Sunday telecast of the Golden Globes , the FCC said Wednesday that it is reviewing the program for possible violations of indecency rules .
Toward the end of the program , director Darren Aronofsky was caught on camera jokingly making an obscene gesture -- " flipping the bird , " as it 's commonly called -- at actor Mickey Rourke , who was onstage accepting an acting award for Aronofsky 's film " The Wrestler . "
Rourke and other attendees also salted their speeches with occasional off - color language , some of which was bleeped by NBC censors .
Now the FCC , which regulates decency issues on the broadcast networks , has stepped into the fray .
" We received 18 complaints about the Golden Globes telecast , " FCC spokeswoman Edie Herman wrote in an e-mail to The Times , " and the commission is reviewing the matter . "
An NBC spokeswoman confirmed that it aired the Aronofsky gesture on the live telecast .
" On the West Coast , it went to black for two seconds , " the spokeswoman e-mailed .
" Beyond that , we have no further comment . "
Aronofsky 's publicist , Karen Samfilippo , said earlier this week that she had not heard anything from NBC about the matter .
The FCC has a mixed record with decency enforcement .
The agency fined CBS $ 500,000 for airing Janet Jackson 's notorious " wardrobe malfunction " during the 2004 Super Bowl .
But a court overturned the fine last year .

The End of the Global War on Terror
Updated 4:58 p.m. 3/24/09
By Al Kamen
The end of the Global War on Terror -- or at least the use of that phrase -- has been codified at the Pentagon .
Reports that the phrase was being retired have been circulating for some time amongst senior administration officials , and this morning speechwriters and other staff were notified via this e-mail to use " Overseas Contingency Operation " instead .
" Recently , in a LtGen [ John ] Bergman , USMC , statement for the 25 March [ congressional ] hearing , OMB required that the following change be made before going to the Hill , " Dave Riedel , of the Office of Security Review , wrote in an e-mail .
" OMB says : ' This Administration prefers to avoid using the term " Long War " or " Global War on Terror " [ GWOT ] .
Please use " Overseas Contingency Operation . ' "
Riedel asked recipients to " Please pass on to your speech writers and try to catch this change before the statements make it to OMB . "
An OMB spokesman took issue with the interpretation of OMB 's wishes .
" There was no memo , no guidance , " said Kenneth Baer .
" This is the opinion of a career civil servant . "
Referring to the phrase " global war on terror , " Baer said , " I have no reason to believe that would be stricken " from Hill testimony .
By way of history , senior Bush administration officials several years ago wanted to stop using the phrase and switch to something many felt might better reflect the realities of the fight against international terrorism .
One leading option was to change the name to GSAVE , or Global Struggle Against Violent Extremism .
This was not as catchy an acronym as GWOT , but officials felt it more accurately described the battle .
Then - Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld even used the GSAVE abbreviation publicly .
But , in a White House meeting , President Bush ruled that it was still a war for him , and Rumsfeld and everyone else went back to GWOT .

Has this scenario ever happened to either you or somebody you know ?
You get a raving endorsement from a friend or family member about the doctor they saw , and how they ’re the best thing ever , and how you absolutely MUST go see them immediately ?
How many times has somebody actually gone to see a doctor based on that recommendation , only to be underwhelmed and confused about the beaming review ?
These are cases where people fell victim to the cult of personality .
The doctor - patient relationship , just like any other relationship , takes on many forms .
What works for one person may not jive for another .
Because medicine in the United States is an essentially free market , doctors tend to carry a kind of gravity about them .
Patients that like their doctor ’s style stick around and recommend others , while the relationships that do n’t work fall apart and the patients end up drifting away to another doctor that better suits them .
The end result is that a doctor ’s practice and patient base becomes a direct reflection of their personality .
Of course every relationship is different and nuanced , but doctoring styles tend to lean towards one of two broad flavors :
Paternalism
I ’m the doctor , you ’re the patient .
Docs of this tradition believe that they are the absolute stewards of the human body , and that patients come to doctors to be told how to improve their health and treat their disease .
In an encounter there is generally not much room for questions or discussion on the part of the patient .
Furthermore , doctors who practice this way may get offended or disdainful of patients who second - guess their decisions or ask for other opinions .
Partnerism
Doctors of this ilk view themselves more as guides , or consultants .
They have spent the time studying and honing their skills to become experts in the human condition , and believe the patient is the ultimate steward of their own body .
Patients come to physicians for their expertise , in order to gain some insight into what may be happening to them , and information required to make their own informed decisions about health management .
Doctors who subscribe to this philosophy tend to push a lot onto their patients , which they may or may not be in a position to handle .
Needless to say , the potential for conflicts between doctor and patient personalities and their expectations of the doctor - patient relationship can happen very frequently .
So what kind of doctor do you have ?

The recession is forcing more firms out of business
There has been a huge rise in the number of firms going bust in England and Wales because of the recession .
The Insolvency Service said that in the last three months of 2008 there were 2,428 corporate insolvencies such as administrations and receiverships .
That was a 220 % rise on the same period the year before .
In the same period , 29,444 people were made bankrupt or entered an individual voluntary arrangement ( IVA ) , 19 % more than a year ago .
Of those , 19,100 were bankruptcies while 10,344 were IVAs .
See the trend in personal bankruptcies Corporate liquidations , the end stage of the insolvency process , also rose strongly , with 4,607 firms being wound up in England & Wales in the last three months of 2008 , 52 % more than a year before .
Downturn
The figures from the Insolvency Service highlight the toll that has been taken on companies by the rapid lurch into recession .
We are now seeing victims of the recession - professionals , traders , contractors and people who have been laid off - not just people who have overspent on a credit card
Pat Boyden , PwC
Send us your experiences " For corporate insolvencies , this is almost a direct consequence of the economic downturn , " said Pat Boyden , an insolvency expert at accountants PwC .
Over the whole of 2008 , the number of firms that were liquidated rose by 24 % to 15,535 .
That amounted to one in every 150 trading companies .
" Liquidations in the fourth quarter of 2008 were dramatically up on liquidations in the same quarter of the previous year , " said Alan Tomlinson of Tomlinsons , a licensed insolvency practitioner .
" It is the small and medium - sized business , which forms the backbone of the UK economy , that has suffered the most and I expect this situation to deteriorate even further in 2009 , " he added .
The number of other corporate insolvencies - receiverships , administrations and company voluntary arrangements - also shot up , rising by 92 % to 6,276 .
Personal insolvency
The number of people who were declared insolvent stood at 106,544 in England and Wales , was roughly the same as in 2007 .
FORMS OF INSOLVENCY
Bankruptcy :
The traditional way of escaping overwhelming debt .
Ends after one year , but you are likely to lose all your assets including your house to pay something to the creditors Individual voluntary arrangement ( IVA ) : A deal between you and your creditors , overseen by an insolvency practitioner .
Less stigma , less chance of losing your home , but involves paying some of your debts in one go or over a number of years Debt Relief Orders : Planned for introduction in April 2009 , these should allow consumers with debts of less than £ 15,000 and minimal assets or surplus income to write off debts without a full - blown bankruptcy
But within that , the number of bankruptcies reached a record level , both for a year and a quarter .
" We are now seeing victims of the recession - professionals , traders , contractors and people who have been laid off - not just people who have overspent on a credit card , " said Mr Boyden .
" I think bankruptcies will go much higher in 2009 , " he added .
He explained that it was now more difficult to arrange an IVA , as the recession meant that people in financial trouble were less likely to be able to offer their creditors some repayments .
As a result , more people on the verge of insolvency are likely to go directly into bankruptcy .
" What today 's figures mean is that in 2008 we saw a staggering 350 people becoming insolvent in the UK every day , " said Nick O'Reilly , president of the insolvency professionals ' trade body R3 .
" The outlook is bleak for the next two years , when insolvency practitioners expect to see in excess of 158,000 personal insolvencies annually , " he said .

Even today , there are scientific phenomena that defy explanation .
If history is anything to go by , resolving these anomalies could lead to a great leap forward , so what are the greatest mysteries , and what scientific revolutions might they bring ?
1 The missing universe
Everything in the universe is either mass or energy , but there 's not enough of either .
Scientists think 96 % of the cosmos is missing .
They have come up with names for the missing stuff - " dark energy " and " dark matter " - but that does n't really tell us anything about them .
And it 's not as if they 're not important : dark energy is continually creating new swaths of space and time , while dark matter appears to be holding all the galaxies together .
No wonder cosmologists are searching for clues to their whereabouts .
2 Life
I know you think you 're more than a sack of molecules , but why ?
Next time you see a tree , ask yourself why that is alive when your wooden dining table is not .
The phenomenon we call life is something that biologists have almost given up trying to define - instead they 're investigating ways to make different combinations of molecules come alive .
Bizarrely , the best hope is similar in chemical terms to laundry detergent .
3 Death
Here 's the flip side : in biology , things eventually die , but there 's no good explanation for it .
There are hints that switching genes on and off controls ageing , but if our theory is right , those switches should n't have survived natural selection .
Then there 's the argument that an accumulation of faults does us in .
However , there are plenty of whales and turtles who seem to age ridiculously slowly - if at all .
Of course , if we can work out why , that could be great news for future humans ( if not for the planet ) .
4 Sex
Charles Darwin might have fathered 10 children , but he could n't understand why almost everything in biology uses sexual reproduction rather than asexual cloning - sex is a highly inefficient way to reproduce .
We still do n't know the answer .
The suggestion that sex 's gene shuffling makes us more able to deal with changing environments seems plausible , but the evidence is scarce .
At the moment , sex only seems to exist to give males some role in life .
5 Free will
If you want to keep your sanity , look away now .
Neuroscientists are almost convinced that free will is an illusion .
Their experiments show that our brains allow us to think we are controlling our bodies , but our movements begin before we make a conscious decision to move .
Some researchers have already been approached to testify in court that the defendant is not to blame for anything they did .
A scary legal future awaits .

Anomie in the UK The Steep Decline of the British Economy
As the global economic crisis takes hold , hardly any other country has seen its fortunes wane as brutally as the United Kingdom .
Once a model economy , the country has been overcome by a deep sense of uncertainty .
Another inauguration took place in Washington this week -- Google Inc. officially became a political power player .
In October , Google was only hours from being sued by the Justice Department as a Web - search monopolist .
Today , less than three years after it made its first Washington hire , the Internet giant is poised to capitalize on its backing of President Obama and pursue its agenda in the nation ’s capital .
Google ’s executives and employees overwhelmingly supported Obama ’s candidacy , contributing more money than all but three companies or universities .
And only DreamWorks employees gave more toward inauguration festivities .
Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt campaigned for Obama and was one of four Googlers on his transition team .
He is now as likely as any corporate chieftain to get his calls to the White House returned .

At the top of the company ’s policy priorities are two that consumer advocates largely champion .
First , it wants to expand high - speed Internet access so people can use its
Web services more often .
It also is pushing for so - called network neutrality : prohibitions on telecommunications companies charging websites for faster delivery of their content .
“ Google is not just a benign corporate entity .
It has a variety of special interests , ” said Jeff Chester , the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy , who has sparred with Google over data - privacy issues .
“ They ’re in a great position to push their agenda through with the support of the president and the Democrats in Congress . ”
But Google ’s newfound political ties heighten concerns about its grip on the online advertising market .
The company could play better defense against strong competitors trying to curb its influence .
Last fall , Justice Department lawyers , who had been lobbied heavily by Microsoft Corp. and large telecommunications companies , were about to sue Google on antitrust grounds .
They wanted to block its controversial search - advertising partnership with Yahoo Inc. , but Google abandoned the deal rather than fight in court .

Competitors worry about Google ’s close relationship with the Obama administration , said Bill Whalen , a research fellow at Stanford University ’s Hoover Institution .
“ The question going forward is : Will Google turn into just another business entity looking for favors in Washington , or will it manage to keep the 767 flying at 30,000 feet above the political din ? ” he said , a reference to the Google founders ’ private plane .
White House officials did not respond to requests for comment .
Obama vowed generally this week that his administration would not be beholden to anyone .
Google says the main reason it has improved its standing in Washington is that Obama ’s tech priorities mirror its own .
He has endorsed network neutrality .
His technology agenda also calls for expanding broadband Internet access to rural areas and appointing the first government - wide chief technology officer ( Schmidt has been mentioned for the position but reiterated this week that he was not interested ) .
Advertisement
“ This administration is more focused on science and technology , ” Schmidt said in an interview .
“ That ’s positive for all of technology , and particularly Google . ”
Symbolizing its new stature , the company co-hosted a glitzy Inauguration Day party here .
The event was studded with celebrities , including Ben Affleck , Jessica Alba and Glenn Close .
Though Obama did not make an appearance , the event drew influential political figures such as Obama transition chief John Podesta and Sens.
Charles E. Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) and John F. Kerry ( D - Mass . ) .
“ A lot of people are united to create a grass - roots service democracy , and Google is playing a bigger role in that than anyone knows , ” Craigslist founder Craig Newmark said as dance music echoed through the grand Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium .
Obama ’s campaign and administration have already embraced Google products .
Video of his weekly address is available on YouTube .
During the shift from the transition office to the White House , Obama ’s press office staff created free e-mail accounts on Gmail until their government accounts were activated .
Advertisement
In November 2007 , Obama unveiled his “ innovation agenda ” during a visit to Google ’s Silicon Valley campus .
And at an economic forum in Florida two weeks before the presidential election , Obama praised the company as “ a cutting - edge innovator . ”
On stage with him in Florida was Schmidt , who had publicly endorsed Obama days before .
( He said that the support was personal and that the company remained officially neutral . )
Schmidt also appeared in a 30 - minute infomercial for Obama , and he was appointed to the Transition Economic Advisory Board after the election .
Google ’s spokesman in Washington , Adam Kovacevich , said that despite Schmidt ’s personal support for Obama , the company has a bipartisan strategy .
“ We know that the incoming administration supports a lot of things that we like , ” he said .
“ But we also know you can not get anything done here unless you have relationships on both sides of the aisle . ”

The company ’s political action committee gave 57 % of its $ 264,000 in contributions during the 2008 campaign cycle to Democrats , and 43 % to Republicans .
Google also had a presence at both parties ’ national conventions last summer .
But Google ’s employees left little doubt whom they supported .
They contributed $ 782,964 to Obama ’s campaign and $ 20,800 to John McCain ’s , according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics .
Googlers also donated $ 166,000 for Obama ’s inauguration .
Still , the company does n’t have a clear path in Washington .
Its biggest rival , Microsoft , came in third on the list of top Obama contributors .
( It has more than three times as many employees as Google . )
And Microsoft ’s PAC handed out nearly three times as much money in 2008 as Google ’s did .
Advertisement
Microsoft is an old hand here after facing down the government in an antitrust battle a decade ago .
And its savvy shows : Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Jeffrey Lindsay said Microsoft outmaneuvered Google last year , drumming up opposition that helped derail the Yahoo search deal .
Gigi Sohn , president of Public Knowledge , a digital rights group that has worked with Google to advance network neutrality , downplayed concerns about the Web giant ’s new clout .
“ They can put things on the radar screen that might not otherwise be on the radar screen . . . but it ’s a long way from being on the radar screen to being put into law , ” she said .
“ There are people on the opposite side of what Google wants who can pick up the phone too . ”

Italy : A proliferation of forbidden behaviour
Italy : A proliferation of forbidden behaviour
New powers given to local councils in the “ security package ” approved on 23 May 2008 , under article 5 of law decree no .
92 ( which came into force on 5 August and was converted into a law on 9 August 2008 ) , allow them to issue orders in the fields of public order and security , to carry out security and judicial police functions and to monitor anything that is relevant for public order and security .
The summer months have seen a number of councils adopting sanctions
against all manner of behaviour ( see Statewatch Vol 18 no 2 ) .
The following is a translated extract from an article entitled “ L’estate dei divieti .
Spiagge , parchi e strade come caserme ” ( “ The summer of prohibitions .
Beaches , parks and streets like barracks ” ) , published in the weekly anarchist bulletin Umanità Nova no. 27 of 7 September 2008 :
" In the past , the first citizen [ the mayor ] could issue ‘ acts that are attributed to him / her by laws and regulations in the field of public order and security ’ .
Now the mayor is responsible for the surveillance ‘ of anything that may concern public order and security , informing the prefetto [ the police chief in a given town ] in advance ’ .
In this way , the mayors have the power to issue ordinances on anything that may concern “ security and urban decorum ” , imposing administrative sanctions , that is , fines and judicial seizures , on offenders .
The Maroni [ the interior minister ] decree became law on 9 August and was immediately followed by a plethora of ordinances by mayors in cities and towns throughout the peninsula .
The first victims of the ordinances were migrants and vagrants .
In many cities ( including Rimini , Alassio and Venice ) , street - selling by foreigners , including those with a license , was forbidden .
In several places , such as Rome , Venice or Florence , it was prohibited to carry merchandise in a big sports bag , plastic bag or similar items .
In some cases , local traffic police officers ( as happened several times in Rimini ) unleashed veritable manhunts on the beach to ensure that prohibitions were respected .
In Ostia , one of the most frequented beaches on the Tyrrhenian , a hunt targeting hawkers was “ strengthened ” with the help of surveillance by helicopters flying over the coast at low altitude to detect “ sellers of counterfeit labels ” .
After Chinese masseuses were banned from the coasts in Tuscany and Romagna ( with regional laws approved for this purpose by the ‘ red ’ Emilia - Romagna and Tuscany ) through a circular order by Francesca Martini , the under - secretary for Welfare , throughout the national territory , massages given by migrants were forbidden due to the risk that the “ aesthetic or therapeutic services ” are offered by people who “ may not possess adequate experience ” .
However , the hunting of vagrants and beggars ( something not seen since the first half of the 1800s ) was the main dish served up in the summer of “ ordinances ” .
First off the mark was the mayor of Assisi , who immediately forbade begging and “ nomadism ” , drawing praise from the monks as beggars are perceived as driving tourists away from the basilica and the tomb of Saint Francis .
Meanwhile , on 10 August , following the Maroni decree , 2,412 homeless people were identified in a single day in Milan .
In Pescara , Bologna , Florence , Padua , Verona , Turin , Trieste and Cortina , the council authorities decided to impose very heavy fines on those begging to raise enough money to get through the day .
In Verona , the proceeds of begging are confiscated as well , as is any other money found on beggars .
Then , there is a series of other ordinances that concern so - called “ urban decorum ” .
The frontrunner in this specialty is Florence , which has always been riven by the feuding of the PCI / PDS / DS / PD [ the leading Communist and then centre - left parties ] .
On 11 August , the urban police ’s regulation , euphemistically entitled “ Norms for civil coexistence in the city ” , came into force .
Among other things , it stipulates that it is forbidden to lie down in the street , wash one ’s armpits in public fountains , tie a bicycle to a bench , feed pigeons , play with a ball or frisbee in the street and public parks , beating towels on balconies , cleaning windscreens or asking to have one ’s windscreen cleaned at traffic lights , “ indecorously ” eating a meal in public , throwing cigarette butts on the ground ( although there are n’t any ashtrays in the street yet , etc. ) .
Such imagination has had its imitators in several other parts of the peninsula .
In Viareggio , Capri , Amalfi , Riccione , Forte dei Marmi , Venezia , Alassio and Taormina , it is forbidden to wander with one ’s top off , other than on the beach .
Drinks in glass containers are prohibited in the evening in Pisa , Ravenna , Genova , Monza , and Brescia .
[ There is ] zero tolerance for smokers in Is Aruttas , in the province of Oristano , and whoever smokes on the beach risks a 360 Euro fine .
Beaches in general have become places that are not easy to visit .
Across Tuscany it is forbidden to lay down one ’s towel less than 5 metres away from the shore and sand castles are also forbidden because “ they obstruct the passageway ” and this is also the case for playing with a ball or bats and a tennis ball .
In Ravenna , meanwhile , whoever bathes in the sea after eight pm is to be punished with a 1,000 euro fine .
All public spaces are regulated .
In Novara , access to parks and gardens is forbidden : to groups comprising more than two people between 23:30 and 6 in the morning ” , and those transgressing are to be punished with a fine of up to 500 Euros .
In Voghera , the ordinance proposed by the local police council officer , Vincenzo Giugliano ( of Alleanza Nazionale ) , limits itself to prohibiting the use of benches to groups of more than three people .
But there is no limit to this frenzy of limits .
In Eboli , the mayor has introduced a fine of 500 Euros for effusive behaviour in a car .
Cortina will clear its city centre streets of “ false social promoters ” .
To counter paedophiles , the Trento town council has prohibited the filming of children in swimming pools .
Finally , close to Milan , Trezzano sul Naviglio has established a Sex Tax ( 500 Euros ) , applying it to those drivers who stop for a moment or carry out sudden manoeuvres in areas where prostitution is practised . ”
Umanità Nova , no.27 of 7 September 2008
This article first appeared in Statewatch Supplement , November 2008 .
( CNN ) -- President Obama 's address to Congress was full of lofty promises to make unprecedented investments in government programs , even as he aims to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term .
President Obama on Tuesday outlined an ambitious agenda to help revive the economy .
But it takes more than a proposal to bring about real change .
Will Obama be able to meet his goals ?
CNN political analyst David Gergen says the answer will be " one of the greatest political dramas of our time . "
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs says the budget Obama sends to Capitol Hill Thursday will help show how the president plans to tackle his ambitious agenda .
Here 's a look at some of Obama 's goals , and what experts are saying about them .
Economy
Promise : " To ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again , I ask Congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system . "
Promise : " I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office . "
Promise : " My administration has also begun to go line by line through the federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs .
As you can imagine , this is a process that will take some time , but we have already identified $ 2 trillion in savings over the next decade . "
Analysis : Democratic strategist Lisa Caputo said so far , Obama is taking the right steps to revive the economy , but the country needs to see his plans put into action .
He 's already passed a massive stimulus bill , and he has a housing bill and a banking regulatory reform bill in the works .
" He 's doing all the right things .
Hopefully he 'll come forth with a balanced budget .
...
He 's saying all of the right things .
He 's got to do them , " she said .
Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ed Rollins pointed out that what Obama did was put forth proposals , not an action plan .
" This was a speech about aspirations .
There was not a strategy or the details .
They may come later , but it's an overly ambitious program , and if he can accomplish just the financial part of it , he 'll move the country forward , " he said .
The success of Obama 's budget goals will fall heavily on Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , Rollins said .
" Can she control her members ?
The last two years the Congress has controlled the spending , it 's been a Democrat Congress .
It 's still a Democrat Congress and will be for the foreseeable future .
There 's a lot of pet projects these people want , there 's a lot of entitlements that people are n't willing to cut , " he said .
Larry Winget , a personal finance expert , said he agrees with everything that Obama said needs to be done , but said he does n't agree that the country can borrow or spend its way out of debt .
" If you came to me and said , ' I 'm in a financial crisis , I 've screwed up everything based on all of my bad decisions , what should I do ? ' the last thing in the world I would tell you is to go borrow more money or go try to spend something that -- money you do n't have on something you do n't need , " he said .
Winget said instead , the country should work its way out of debt .
" The practical thing would be to put more money in the hands of people , which would always go back to , we need to give bigger ... tax cuts , " he said .
Education
Promise : " By 2020 , America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world .
That is a goal we can meet . "
Promise : " It will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every child has access to a complete and competitive education , from the day they are born to the day they begin a career .
That is a promise we have to make to the children of America . "
Analysis : Rollins pointed out that this is the first time the federal government is taking a such a major role in education .
" We have $ 59 billion in this year 's education budget .
We added another $ 100 billion to build schools and do those things .
That 's never been the role of the federal government .
So it 's a whole new way to go , and obviously if it works , it may benefit the country , " he said .
CNN Senior Political Correspondent Candy Crowley said Obama 's proposals are just the start of a new direction .
" It is the beginning of shaping the country differently when it comes to a lot of these programs .
And the different shape , again , is a more liberal shape of the country , than really the conservative country it has been since Ronald Reagan , " she said .
Energy
Promise : " We will invest $ 15 billion a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power , advanced biofuels , clean coal , and more efficient cars and trucks built right here in America . "
Promise : " Thanks to our recovery plan , we will double this nation 's supply of renewable energy in the next three years . "
Watch Obama say , ' It begins with energy ' »
Analysis : Lakshman Achuthan , managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute , said Obama laid out a " tall order " of what needs to be done , and tried to show how everything is connected .
" So he showed , here 's the short term , which is stimulus , banking , housing .
Here 's the longer term :
If we want to own the century , we have to deal with energy , education , health , for example , and connecting those things , " he said .
" And one of the critical things is that it 's not clear -- you know , the stimulus is great , we passed it , but it does n't work unless the banks lend .
The banks wo n't lend unless the housing sector stabilizes .
So , it 's -- this is much tougher than chewing gum and walking at the same time , " he said .
Health care
Promise : " [ The recovery plan ] makes the largest investment ever in preventive care , because that 's one of the best ways to keep our people healthy and our costs under control . "
Promise : " To preserve our long - term fiscal health , we must also address the growing cost in Medicare and Social Security .
Comprehensive health care reform is the best way to strengthen Medicare for years to come , and we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for Social Security , while creating tax - free universal savings accounts for all Americans . "
Watch Obama explain his plans for health care reform »
Analysis : Larry Elder , a libertarian commentator , thought that Obama gave a " great political speech " but Elder questioned the president 's economics .
" I just wish he was a limited - government , personal - responsibility , hard - core - fiscal - responsibility Republican , which , of course , he is n't .
Look , he 's got a faith in government that I do n't share , " he said .
" Whenever I hear somebody talk about investing in health care , investing in education , investing in energy , I put my hand on my wallet and I say , ' These guys are not good stewards of your money the way you are of your own money . ' "
Pamela Gentry , a senior political analyst with BET , said Obama 's big promises will keep people watching because they play to the drama of this presidency .
Health care , she said , will be the issue to watch .
" Health care has got to be one of the toughest ones .
I mean , Medicare is the second largest budget after defense .
So , if he can pull this off , it would be remarkable , " she said .
Gibbs said Wednesday that the president is well aware of the difficulty of reforming health care .
" But he understands the only way to do that is bring together the stakeholders on both sides of the aisle , business and labor , doctors , providers .
That process will begin next week here to discuss health care reform , " he said .
But , Gibbs said , the president does n't plan on setting any " artificial deadlines " to pass health care reform .
Military
Promise : " To relieve the strain on our forces , my budget increases the number of our soldiers and Marines .
And to keep our sacred trust with those who serve , we will raise their pay and give our veterans the expanded health care and benefits that they have earned . "
Analysis : Patricia Murphy , editor of Citizen Jane Politics , said she thought Obama 's speech was strong , but she did n't follow Obama 's math .
Watch :
How to cut defense spending »
" The problem in this speech , I think , is his promise to cut the deficit in half and layering on program after program after program , saying we 'll pull the troops out of Iraq , but we 'll increase the size of the military .
Those numbers do n't add up , " she said .
CNN contributor Roland Martin on Tuesday compared Obama to rapper Kanye West .
Martin : Obama 's ambitious agenda is a good thing
All of the president 's promises -- fixing health care , fixing the economy , halving the deficit , boosting funds to troops , curing cancer , achieving energy independence and solving Pakistan 's problems , to name a few -- are just the markers in terms of his presidency , Martin said .
" Sort of when like Kanye West had his new album , and he said , ' I want to make it as bad as Stevie Wonder 's [ Songs in the Key of Life ] . ' ...
He said , ' If it does n't get to that , it 's still a great album . '
" [ Obama ] is a guy who is saying , a president who 's saying , ' Look , I want to raise the stakes . '
And , so , is n't it amazing that we 're sitting here , saying , ' Wow , an ambitious president ' ?
Well , should n't we have an ambitious president ?
Should n't we have a president saying , ' We can do more ' ? "

The “ Masters of the Universe ” on Wall Street – through their greed , recklessness and illegal behavior – have plunged this country into a deep recession causing millions of Americans to lose their jobs , their homes , their savings and their hope for the future .
In order to fully understand the cause of this fiasco , I have introduced legislation calling for a thorough investigation of the financial meltdown and the prosecution of those CEOs who broke the law .
The culture of greed , fraud and excessive speculation must come to an end .
In the midst of this financial disaster , one of the great frustrations that I hear from my constituents is that while taxpayers are spending hundreds of billions bailing out major financial institutions , and while these big banks are getting near - zero interest rate loans from the Fed , these very same financial institutions are now charging Americans 20 percent or 30 percent interest rates on their credit cards .
In fact , one - third of all credit card holders in this country are now paying interest rates above 20 percent and as high as 41 percent – more than double what they paid in interest in 1990 .
Recently , some major institutions such as Bank of America have informed responsible cardholders that their interest rates would be doubled to as high as 28 percent , without explaining why the increase was taking place .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Three former Atlanta police officers were sentenced Tuesday to prison terms ranging from five to 10 years for covering up a botched drug raid in which a 92 - year - old woman was killed .
Kathryn Johnston was shot five times in a botched drug raid on her Atlanta home two years ago .
Jason Smith was sentenced to 10 years in the November 2006 raid that left Kathryn Johnston dead in a hail of bullets .
Former officers Greg Junnier and Arthur Tesler were sentenced to six and five years , respectively , said Patrick Crosby , spokesman for the U.S. attorney 's office for the Northern District of Georgia .
Investigators determined the raid at Johnston 's home was based on falsified paperwork stating that illegal drugs were present .
The incident prompted a major overhaul of the Atlanta Police Department 's drug unit .
" Officers who think , as these defendants once did , that the ends justify the means or that ' taking shortcuts ' and telling lies will not be discovered and punished should realize that they are risking their careers and their liberty . "
U.S. Attorney David Nahmias said in a written statement .
" Officers who try to obstruct justice when their misconduct faces exposure , rather than cooperating in the investigation , should realize that they will face even more severe punishment . "
All three men pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to violate civil rights resulting in death .
Smith and Junnier also pleaded guilty to state charges of voluntary manslaughter and making false statements , and Smith admitted to planting bags of marijuana in Johnston 's home after her death .
U.S. District Judge Julie Carnes ordered all three men to serve three years of supervised release after their prison terms , and to split Johnston 's funeral costs , which totaled $ 8,180 , authorities said .
On Monday , Junnier broke down on the witness stand during a sentencing hearing , WXIA reported , saying , " I used to think I was a good person . "
Smith said , " I pray daily for Ms. Johnston .
I also pray other officers in Atlanta will have the moral fortitude I did n't have , " according to WXIA .
Tesler was convicted on one state count of making false statements after filling out an affidavit saying that an informant had purchased crack cocaine at Johnston 's home in a crime - plagued neighborhood near downtown Atlanta .
The informant , however , denied ever having been to Johnston 's home , leading to probes by local and federal authorities as well as the breakup and reorganization of the Atlanta police narcotics unit .
The raid occurred as police were executing a so - called " no - knock " search warrant based on the faulty information .
Police said Johnston fired at them with an old pistol during the raid , and they returned fire in self - defense .
Johnston 's one shot went through her front door and over the officers ' heads ; they responded with 39 shots , hitting the elderly woman five times .
Tesler 's state conviction was reversed on appeal , but he pleaded guilty to the federal charge .
Junnier and Smith face sentencing March 5 on state charges including voluntary manslaughter , but according to their plea agreement , their sentence will be served at the same time as the federal sentence , authorities said .
Shortly after the federal probe began , however , Junnier began cooperating with authorities , providing " valuable assistance in the investigation and prosecution of Smith and Tesler , " according to the statement issued by Nahmias ' office .
Smith also cooperated " to a more limited extent , " the statement said , adding that both Junnier and Smith 's sentences were reduced because of their cooperation .
Prosecutors have said that the officers regularly presented false information to obtain warrants and that they cut corners to make more time for lucrative side jobs providing additional security to businesses , often while on duty , and receiving cash payments .
" As Atlanta police narcotics officers , these three defendants repeatedly failed to follow proper procedures and then lied under oath to obtain search warrants , " Nahmias said .
" Their routine violations of the Fourth Amendment led to the death of an innocent citizen . "
The investigation into the raid at Johnston 's home also led to guilty pleas from the police sergeant in charge of the narcotics unit and another officer who admitted to extortion , prosecutors said .

( CNN ) -- Nearly two centuries ago Wednesday , Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge
Gerry signed an obscure redistricting law that helped his party stay in office and , more importantly , codified one of the most enduring legacies in U.S. politics : gerrymandering .
The U.S. House of Represenatives , home to many beneficiaries of gerrymandering .
Now a part of an American lexicon often heard in Washington 's K Street bars and among " inside - the - beltway " crowds , the term is seen as a combination of the governor 's name and the word " salamander , " because of the salamander - like shape one electoral district took on after the redistricting .
Elected governor in 1810 , Gerry signed the redistricting bill two years later , enabling greater and perhaps disproportionate Republican representation in the Massachusetts legislature .
The controversial move has become a favorite across the country among incumbent parties , which pack opposition voters into districts already lost in an effort to minimize the opposition 's influence over the state 's broader electorate .
But some political analysts cry foul .
" In the end , democracy comes out the big loser , " former federal prosecutor Edward Lazarus wrote in a 2004 column for CNN .
" The effect of such partisan gerrymandering is to block new entrants into high political office and to make the result of almost every congressional election a foregone conclusion .
This , in turn , effectively disenfranchises all those voters who do n't support the preordained winner , " he wrote .
In 2006 , the Supreme Court threw out part of a Texas congressional map , but found the overall redistricting plan orchestrated by House Republicans acceptable .
The redistricting helped Republicans in Texas defeat four Democratic congressmen in the 2004 elections .
The court ruled that the redistricting plan , promoted by then - U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay , unfairly weakened the voting strength of Latinos in two congressional districts .
" A state may not trade off the rights of some members of a racial group against the rights of other members of that group , " wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy .
" The question is therefore not whether line - drawing in the challenged area as a whole dilutes minority voting strength , but whether line - drawing dilutes the voting strength of the Latinos in [ Texas ' ] District 23 . "
The court ordered that District 23 be redrawn .
States are constitutionally required to redraw congressional districts every 10 years in line with population shifts documented by the U.S. Census Bureau , a part of the Department of Commerce .
This year , controversy re-emerged when President Barack Obama announced a decision to cross party lines and nominate U.S. Sen .
Judd Gregg , R - New Hampshire , to run the Commerce Department .
The move sparked criticism from leaders of minority groups concerned that the Census Bureau under Gregg , who voted to abolish the Commerce Department in 1995 , might lack the resources needed to accurately count minorities .
The White House promised to work directly with bureau 's director to assuage those concerns , but that response drew further criticism from House Republicans concerned about greater executive influence in the Census Bureau .
In a letter to the president , House Republicans Patrick McHenry and Darrell Issa described the White House as " circumventing the secretary of commerce " and called it " both outrageous and unprecedented , " suggesting the Obama administration could affect U.S. census results and congressional districting due out in 2010 .
The move , they say , could insulate Democratic congressional power .
The White House said it recognizes the importance of an accurate census count " free from politicization " and added it " has not proposed removing the census from the Department of Commerce . "
" From the first days of the transition , the census has been a priority for the president , and a process he wanted to re-evaluate , " it said in an earlier statement .
The method through which the Census Bureau collects data has long been a topic of partisan bickering .
Republicans have generally favored the " door - to - door " approach , which actually is done primarily by self - enumeration through the U.S. mail .
Democrats commonly prefer a statistical sampling method meant to fill in " population gaps " they say occur because some members of minority groups and homeless populations are missed by the door - to - door approach .
A 1999 Supreme Court ruling said statistical sampling could not be applied to the redistribution of congressional seats , but it did not put gerrymandering of the political landscape entirely off limits .
So , almost 200 years after Elbridge Gerry helped coin the term , gerrymandering remains a key part of American politics .

Introduction
Optimization of code is the term that was applied to a process in which a code is tuned to be better in some respects : either speed , memory consumption , Input / Output ( disk read and writes or network reads and writes ) , etc .
In Mathematics , Optimization means a process in which one finds the values with the best performance .
In Computing where programs are very complex , usually optimizing for speed in the mathematical sense is impossible .
Instead the term has come to mean just advancing in the direction of better performance in one or more respects .
This document will focus on optimizing code to run faster .
However , as you will see later , doing this may involve having to optimize the code in a different aspect .
Furthermore , often when programmers are trying to optimize one aspect of a program , they are doing so in order to increase speed .
In which programs is optimization required ?
There are several type of programs in which optimization is required .
One type of them is real time programs .
Despite common misconception , these are not necessarily programs that need to be very fast .
Instead real time programs are programs that must respond to certain events within a certain time limit that was dedicated to the event .
So for example , if the user presses a keyboard key while inside a word processor window , it should display the character relatively promptly .
A 5 seconds delay will be unacceptable and as such a word processor is a kind of application that has some real - time constraints .
Some parts of real - time systems may need optimization .
However , once the time falls below the required delay , no other optimization is necessary .
( At least not until testing proves it is again exceeding the limit . )
Other programs that require optimization are programs that can not be fast enough .
Examples for such programs are Artificial Intelligence programs , games , multimedia programs , virtual machines and interpreters for programming languages , or any type of publicly available library or module whose use " in the wild " may necessitate it to be very fast .
And naturally another type of programs are programs that are too slow or perceived to be too slow .
While programs of some problem domains are very slow due to the complexity of the calculations involved , that is usually not the case , and nothing prevents a program from being fast .
Such programs that are considered too slow should be optimized to make them run faster .
When to optimize ?
The rule of the thumb is that one should optimize if the program is not fast enough compared to the desired speed .
A common misconception is that if a program is not fast enough now , it will run faster as hardware gets faster .
However that is not always the case .
If your program is slow , it is usually because the code is not optimized ( such as due to the fact it uses sub- optimal algorithms ) .
While better hardware will usually improve performance , it does not guarantee a noticeable speed increase .
Furthermore the progress in hardware speed has allowed programmers to write more wasteful code ( see Paul Graham 's " The Hundred Years Language " essay ) , but some programs are still excessively slow .
When writing a program on a modern hardware , one should make it fast enough already .
Some people have claimed that we have already reached the end of Moore 's First Law in regards to uni-core processors , and we cannot expect single - processed single - threaded program to run faster .
In any case , even if the program runs well on a high - end platform , it may still need to run on older hardware .
We 've all seen the fact that while computers got faster , software has often become slower to run unless the hardware is upgraded .
The so - called " Gates ' Law " claims that commercial programs decrease in speed by half every 18 months , due to various reasons .
It is well known that the various versions of the DOS operating system ran adequately on a PC XT's and 286's and that a Intel 386 was a " lean and mean DOS machine " as a certain journalist claimed back then .
On the other hand , Microsoft Windows 3.0 and Microsoft Windows 3.1 already required a fast 486 computer to be ran comfortably , while Windows 95 was barely usable there and needed a Pentium computer .
Windows XP already ran slowly on a Pentium machine and required a high end Pentium III or Pentium 4 computer .
Windows Vista requires even more hardware resources than Windows XP , up to the point that many computers in use today cannot run it comfortably .
Now , while software simulations that run directly against the CPU and memory ( and possibly hard - disk ) are still running much faster than before , the responsiveness of the system itself does not seem to improve much .
When not to optimize ?
One should not optimize when the program in question runs fast enough .
However , if it also has to run adequately on slower hardware , handle a greater load , or work well with fewer resources at its disposal , then the program might need to be optimized further based on such requirements .
Optimization vs. Modularity and Readability
Optimization may have a bad influence on such code- quality factors as modularity and readability .
Consider for example , what the developers of GMP ( GNU Multi- precision ) , wrote in their manual :
The speed of GMP is achieved by using fullwords as the basic arithmetic type , by using sophisticated algorithms , by including carefully optimized assembly code for the most common inner loops for many different CPUs , and by a general emphasis on speed ( as opposed to simplicity or elegance ) .
Also consider that short functions and methods are considered preferable over longer methods , to allow for greater code re-use , testing , and self - documentation .
( See the " Extract Method " refactoring pattern ) .
However , function or method calls are considered a relatively costly operation , and so this extra code - quality , will probably make the program slower .
Therefore , it 's not hard to imagine that a developer who wishes to save some extra cycles will merge a function that gets used only once or a few times into its caller code ( or incorporating its code using a macro , or a preprocessing stage if possible ) , and therefore making the code less modular .
Similarly , highly optimized code may also become much more unreadable .
For example , the C Preprocessor 's macros are notorious for making code that uses them unreadable .
I heard some complaints that mentioned that OpenSSL 's code , which is based on the preprocessor macros , identically named static functions and lots of code - generation is very hard to understand and follow due to these facts .
Similar complaints are constantly voiced against perl5's XS , its interface for creating subroutines in ANSI C and other lower - level languages .
The API was designed to be as efficient and fast as possible and , as a result , is hard to learn , understand and follow .
Strategy for Optimization
The first thing you need to do before optimizing is make sure that your code has many automated tests with a good test coverage .
Optimizing the code ( or any other kind of modification ) may break something , and the automated tests will catch that .
The next thing you need to do is to make sure your code is modular .
Duplicate code and other properties that make a code non-modular can prevent a clear analysis of the code 's bottlenecks by profiling it .
Afterwards , it is important to profile your code using a good software profiler .
Profiling will help show which code does not take a lot of time to run and therefore it would be best not to invest a lot of optimization effort in it .
One should start by optimizing the most time - consuming tasks first .
It takes some expertise to knowing how to properly analyze the results given by the profiler , and seeing what needs to be optimized .
For example , some IO - intensive routines may appear to consume a lot of time , while in fact that time cannot be effectively eliminated because the amount of IO is minimal ( while still being relatively time consuming ) .
I feel that discussing this aspect of profiling further is orthogonal to the mission of this article , so I 'm not going to cover it here .
Finally , it is a good idea that someone will review the code and and give general remarks on speed bottlenecks found there .
To quote Eric Raymond from " The Cathedral and the Bazaar " " Given enough eyeballs , all bugs become shallow " .
Order of Complexity Optimizations
What is order of complexity ?
Generally , an algorithm has an asymptotic computational complexity .
Assuming the input is of size N , we can say that the algorithm will finish at O ( N ) , O ( N^2 ) , O( N^3 ) , O ( N*log ( N ) ) etc .
This means that it is a certain mathematical expression of the size of the input , and the algorithm finishes between two factors of it .
Generally , the smaller the order of complexity of the program 's underlying algorithm , the faster it will run and the better it will scale as the input gets larger .
Thus , we should often seek more efficient algorithms in order to reduce the order of complexity .
Some examples for reducing Order of Complexity
Lookup
Let 's suppose we 're looking for a certain item in a collection of N items .
A naïve algorithm for looking for such an item would be to go over all the items one after the other , and see if they match this item .
Then we can stop when we found this item , or declare that it was n't found if we did not find it .
This is called a linear search , and has an average ( and worst - case ) complexity of O ( N ) .
Now , if we 're going to do such a naïve lookup many times , then it will cost us O ( N ) every time .
And this is usually unacceptable .
A better idea would be to use a more efficient lookup .
For example , a Binary search is O ( log ( N ) ) .
It assumes we keep the existing items in a sorted array , or in a balanced tree .
A Hash table is a heuristic that with a good design of its underlying parameters provides an average O ( 1 ) lookup , but often O ( log ( N ) ) is good enough .
Case study for Lookup - the Freecell Solver States Collection
Freecell Solver is a library written in ANSI C that solves deals of FreeCell and similar " full - knowledge " Solitaire games .
Freecell Solver used traditional Game artificial intelligence heuristics from the beginning such as Depth First Search and Best First Search .
As a result , there was a need to maintain a collection of the previously encountered board positions ( or " states " ) so they wo n't be checked twice .
The very first version of the solver ( written in Perl ) used a linear search over an array .
That proved to be too slow to be effective to solve even the most elementary deals .
Afterwards , the program was re-implemented in C , and used a sorted array , with a " sort margin " that was sorted using ANSI C's qsort 's function , which performs the Quick Sort algorithm at an average complexity of O ( N* log ( N ) ) , giving the program an average lookup of O ( log ( N ) ) and an accumulated addition of between O ( N*log ( N ) ) and O ( N^2 ) .
Later versions made optional use of two Balanced Binary Trees libraries : libavl and libredblack , which have a maximal O ( log ( N ) ) lookup and insertion and an accumulative O ( N*log ( N ) ) run-time .
Sometimes later , a custom hash table was coded , whose run-time was even somewhat faster than the balanced binary trees , and had an average run-time of O ( N ) .
This hash was later further optimized using micro-optimizations .
Counting Sort instead of Comparison - Based Sort
Normal comparison - based sort algorithms such as Quick Sort , Merge Sort or Heap Sort run at O ( N*log ( N ) ) .
This is much better than naïve comparison - based algorithms such as " Insertion Sort " , or " Bubble Sort " which run at O ( N^2 ) .
However , we can improve upon O ( N*log ( N ) ) too , in some cases .
One of them is if the keys in question are , or can be mapped to integers in a certain range .
In this case , we can use an algorithm such as " Counting Sort " , to sort at a time of roughly O ( N ) .
We can also try using " Radix sort " along with counting sort , if we have more than one such " digit " in the radix ( as long as their number remain constant ) .
On the other hand , sometimes using Insertion Sort is preferable over Merge Sort or Quick Sort , if the number of elements being sorted is very small , as the latter algorithms have a lot of overhead .
Joel Spolsky 's Schlemiel the Painter 's Syndrome
In his article " Back to Basics " , Joel Spolsky illustrates a common ( and unnecessary ) pattern that increases the complexity of programs .
Essentially , when one does in C :
char string [ 1000 ] ; strcpy ( string , " One " ) ; strcat ( string , " Two " ) ; strcat ( string , " Three " ) ; strcat ( string , " Four " ) ; . . .
And so forth , then the strcat calls will keep starting from the beginning of the string and seek the ( increasing ) end times and again .
As a result , the complexity of appending N strings each with a limited length , becomes O ( N^2 ) instead of O ( N ) .
Eliminating such problematic misimplementations in the code can yield a substantial speed - increase .
Note about Order - of - Complexity Reduction
It should be noted that some algorithms with a proven lower Big - O notation than equivalent ones , are either too complicated to be effectively implemented or have a huge runtime factor that will make them impractical for most reasonable data - sets , or both .
For example , there 's an algorithm for finding the Median ( = middle element ) of an array in linear ( O ( N ) ) time , that was discovered in the nineties , but it 's very complex and is a very " big " linear time ( with a huge factor ) , that an efficient O ( N * Log ( N ) ) sorting would normally be more efficient .
That and we are very often interested in the Median for optimizing sorting , and so it would make sense not to use this algorithm in the first place .
Factor Optimizations
What are Factor Optimizations ?
Factor Optimizations are the opposite of order of complexity optimizations : they do n't change the overall complexity of the algorithm , but rather make it run faster by a certain factor .
As an extreme ( but not so unrealistic ) example , I may increase the formula for calculating the time that my program runs from 5 seconds times N^2 ( where N is the length of the input ) to 1 second times N^2 .
One can see that we increase the optimization by a certain factor , and still do n't handle potential scalability problems .
The Motivation for Factor Optimizations
Are factor optimizations worth - your - time ?
Some people do n't seem to think so .
For example Eric Raymond has this to say in " The Art of Unix Programming " :
One is the exponential effect of Moore 's Law — the smartest , cheapest , and often fastest way to collect performance gains is to wait a few months for your target hardware to become more capable .
Given the cost ratio between hardware and programmer time , there are almost always better things to do with your time than to optimize a working system .
We can get mathematically specific about this .
It is almost never worth doing optimizations that reduce resource use by merely a constant factor ; it 's smarter to concentrate effort on cases in which you can reduce average - case running time or space use from O( n ^ 2 ) to O ( n ) or O( n log n ) , [ 112 ] or similarly reduce from a higher order .
Linear performance gains tend to be rapidly swamped by Moore 's Law . [ 113 ]
Randall
Hyde presents an opposing view in his OnLAMP.com feature , " Why Learning Assembly Language is Still a Good Idea " :
Most of the time you can achieve very good performance boosts by simply improving the implementation of an existing algorithm .
A computer scientist may argue that a constant improvement in performance is n't as good as , say , going from an algorithm with O( n ^ 2 ) performance to one with O( n lg n ) performance , but the truth is that most of the time a constant factor of two or three times improvement , applied throughout a piece of software , can make the difference between a practical application and one that is simply too slow to comfortably use .
And it is exactly this type of optimization with which most modern programmers have little experience .
So which viewpoint is correct ?
I tend to think that Raymond is wrong , while Hyde is correct .
The factors in which your program is running are still important , and can make a world of difference .
Some factor optimizations may yield huge benefits and will make you and your users happier .
Raymond is also misled because one cannot expect their end -users to upgrade their machines .
Furthermore , it seems that we 've hit the end of the linear CPU speed increase for Semiconductor - based CPUs , and that we cannot expect a linear code to become faster with new hardware .
Highly parallelized code may become faster , but parallelization is not always possible , or desirable .
Another illustrative story about why it's not a good idea to depend on Moore 's law to speed up your code was posted by Gilboa Davara to the Linux - IL mailing list .
Quoting from there while editing for coherency :
A couple of years ago I worked for a medical software development company .
I was working on the database development side .
( We had our own proprietary object oriented database )
Our database was pretty cool ; it could handle an hospital level load on a dual Pentium Pro machine .
( Which was a far cry from most big iron machines that were used back then . )
Our medical software side used PowerBuilder ( and later VB ) to develop the medical applications .
To put it mildly , the medical application itself , was by far , slower and heavier then the medical database that it was built upon .
While 50 clients could run easily on a Pentium I 90 MHz with 32 MB of RAM , the medical application ran like shit on a Pentium I 166 MHz with 64MB of RAM machine !
And every - time we pointed this anomaly to the med team , they claimed that " new machines are bound , new CPUs ; by the time we are out , CPU power wo n't be an issue . "
You know what , that med software now runs slower than a dead dog on a top - level Pentium 3 / Pentium 4 / Athlon machine … nothing has changed .
Examples for Factor Optimizations
Managing Pointers to Structs Instead of the Structs Themselves
If we have a collection of many C/C++- structs ( structures that contain an adjacent number of elements of possibly different data types ) , then swapping two such structs ( say for re-ordering or sorting ) will require a lot of memory access .
On the other hand if we manage pointers to such structures , with permanent addresses , then swapping two 32 - bit or 64 - bit pointers will be relatively cheap .
The first ANSI C release ( 0.2.0 ) of Freecell Solver allocated a direct array of large C - structs , and then sorted them and binary searched them .
In the 0.4.0 release , an array of pointers to individually - malloc ( ) - ed structs was implemented instead , which resulted in a huge boost of speed .
This taught me a valuable lesson on how to make a smart use of pointers as an optimization tool .
Reducing Memory Consumption
The more memory an application , or its individual elements consumes , the more cache misses it has , the more page swapping it requires , and it becomes more probable for data to require more than one cache line .
As a result , reducing the size of a program can often lead to speed benefits .
As documented in a post to Linux - IL , when Freecell Solver was converted from representing cards as 32 - bit values , and converted to representing them using 8 - bit octets , it became much faster .
This is likely due to less swapping , due to less cache misses , and because more cards could fit in the Pentium 's 32 - byte cache row .
The " Cost of Inline Functions " LWN.
net story is also illustrative .
When one function in the Linux kernel was un-inlined , it made the kernel somewhat faster .
The reason was that all of the inlined instances of it occupied a ( relatively ) large amount of memory per-instance , and as a result , the kernel was larger , and there were more cache misses .
Note about the Memory - Speed Tradeoff
After reading what was written here , you may think this contradicts the common Memory - Speed Trade - off " truism " .
The Memory / Speed Trade - off has its origins in theoretical computer science , where it is shown that for certain tasks , one can reduce the run-time 's asymptotic complexity by increasing the asymptotic amount of memory used ( and vice versa ) .
For example , we can sometimes reduce the asymptotic run-time from O ( N^2 ) to O ( N ) by increasing the memory from O ( 1 ) to O ( N ) .
This is all nice and true , but it does n't contradict the fact that given the architecture of contemporary computer hardware and operating systems , the less memory a program uses ( while the logic of the algorithm remains the same ) - the faster it will probably run .
It 's not an asymptotic trade - off , but rather a gain - gain situation .
Parallelization
By parallelizing a task , one can split it into several lines - of - executions ( processes , threads , tasks on different computers in the cluster , etc. ) that each will run in parallel .
As a result , the complete task itself will hopefully finish faster .
A good example for parallelization is performing the same time - consuming operation on a lot of inputs .
If we assign different processes subsets of the inputs , then they will likely finish it faster .
Lately , parallelization has become especially attractive for making code run faster due to the advancement of multi-core CPUs .
However , it should be noted that parallelization is still limited by some factors such as locking , serialization and de-serialization of the inter - process data , context - switching , CPU and operating system - constraints , and the fact that often the number of tasks will exceed the number of available processors .
Most importantly , Amdahl 's law rules that the serial part of the task ( by definition ) cannot be parallelized , and so limits the amount of gain from the parallelization .
Putting the Most Important struct Members First
In the Linux kernel the order of the struct members is ordered so the most important members fit within the Pentium architecture 's 32 - byte cache line size .
This way , access to the struct in general is sped up because all of its members remain in the cache line most of the time and can be accessed more quickly .
Copy - on - write
Another useful optimization is known as copy - on - write .
A good example for this is when implementing a virtual machine for a programming language , and where we assign a variable to another one .
While we can duplicate the contents of the variable each time , it would be cheaper to just increase the reference count , and wait for one of the variables to change before they are separated .
If the contents of the copies are significant , then copy - on - write can yield significant savings in time .
Caching
If we perform many costly queries , then caching commonly - issued queries along with the results we got in memory is likely to increase the overall performance of the program .
Caching is implemented in all kinds of software - from operating system kernels that hold recently - accessed file - system entries in cache , to database servers that keep caches of the various stages of the queries given to them .
There 's a variation on caching called Memoization , in which we never relieve of our results .
It can be demonstrated that by memoizing the naïve ( tree - recursive ) Fibonacci - number calculation , one can actually reduce its complexity from an exponential one to a linear one .
One should note that caching or memoization cannot be done in many cases , for example , if the queries have most kinds of side - effects .
Avoiding Copying Altogether
This Hackers - IL
Post gave the case for avoiding unnecessary copying of objects in order to increase performance .
Calling copy constructors excessively can have a negative impact on performance , and reducing the number of calls to a minimum can improve performance .
Just copying a large contiguous area in memory , several times , may have a negative effect on performance and eliminating it , may also turn out to be beneficial .
Inline Functions
Despite what was said earlier , in the context of reducing memory consumption , inlining functions in languages such as C or C++ can often have a positive effect on performance .
Function calls are costly operations , and have a lot of overhead , and avoiding the function call by inserting the code in - place whenever the function is used , can increase performance .
Inline functions become more and more beneficial the shorter they are , and if the memory occupied by the in - place calls is smaller than the memory used without inlining .
If you are unsure whether inlining a certain function has a positive or negative effect , then benchmark and see .
The Schwartzian Transform
The Schwartzian transform is a way to optimize certain kinds of comparison - based sort operations .
If the keys of the function that we want to compare take a lot of time to calculate ( such as if they require access to the hard - disk ) , then we can first prepare an equivalent array with pairs of the inputs and their keys , then sort the pairs based on the keys , and finally filter only the original inputs from the pairs .
It should be noted that the Schwartzian transform actually reduced the order of complexity of the number of times the keys are calculated from O ( N* log ( N ) ) to O ( N ) .
However , the overall order of complexity of the sort remains O ( N*log ( N ) ) .
Call for a Catalog of Optimizations
I believe it would be a good idea to concentrate all the known optimizations in one place , in a similar fashion to the Catalog of Refactorings and the Portland Pattern Repository .
This would be a list that people can read for completeness , and to realize where their code can be improved , and for general inspiration , and to facilitate communication .
I 'm not aware of a similar effort as of the time of this writing , and it will be useful .
This section only covered a very small subset of the possible optimization strategies , just to give a taste of them , and did not aim to be comprehensive .
Optimization by Changing the Dependencies
Often the original choice of programming languages , or libraries can affect the execution speed , because they are not very optimized , too bloated , or otherwise too slow .
Moving to a different programming language or library , including possibly replacing third - party code with your own , may have a positive effect on one 's program 's speed .
For example , if you 're doing a lot of number - crunching code in dynamic , P - code languages such as Perl , Python or Ruby ( at least without utilizing such APIs as PDL or SciPy ) or otherwise your code involves many loops and conditionals , then you can expect it to run slower than if it was written in C or Assembler .
Similarly , I found that GLib 's balanced binary trees performed more poorly than those of libavl and libredblack , and that its hash performed more poorly than my own custom hash ( which was since then optimized further ) .
As a result , eliminating a dependency on GLib 's data structures may improve the performance of the program .
Optimizing by Reducing Feature - Set
" There ai n't no such thing as a free lunch " .
The more features your program has , the more code is required to implement them , which in turn consumes more memory , and slows things down .
Furthermore , it requires more conditionals and often even loops , which also require extra processing .
Thus , by removing features from one 's application , one can have faster code .
For example , in " How Microsoft Lost the API War " , Joel Spolsky tells that Microsoft has gone to great lengths to maintain bug - to - bug ( binary ) backward compatibility for their Windows - line of operating system .
As a result , buggy software that relied on API quirks that got changed , often could still work in later versions of Windows , because Microsoft made sure that Windows supplied them with a similar environment .
As a result of maintaining all of this backward compatibility , there was more code in Microsoft 's products , which may have contributed to the common and notorious perception that they became slower with each release .
Optimizing by Compromising on Security
I can go further than that , and claim that one can often optimize one 's code by compromising on its security .
The less sanity checks , input checks , etc. a code has - the faster it will run .
For example , a code that does not have a lot of checking for the failure ( and graceful handling ) of dynamic memory allocation calls ( in languages such as C without managed programming ) such as malloc ( ) , will run faster .
( Until and if it runs out of memory and then crashes . )
I read somewhere that programmers complained that checking and handling errors in their programs made them have to write about 4 times more code , which makes sense .
All this code slows the program down when everything runs as expected .
Note that " Here be dragons " .
It 's probably never a good idea to compromise on security in order to increase speed .
But I 've mentioned it here for completeness sake .
Conclusion
When I mentioned this article to some people on IRC ( while it was still incomplete ) , someone said that " The first rule of optimization is ' Don't ! ' " .
I think such attitude is harmful .
While I agree that " premature optimization is the root of all evil " , sometimes one 's code is just too slow and needs to be optimized .
And if your code is what Joel Spolsky calls " Shrinkwrap " ( i.e : code that is sold or otherwise distributed and made available for public consumption ) then you can often not make assumptions on how fast it needs to be , and the faster it is - the better .
Speed and optimizing other resources are one important factor in the general , abstract quality of programs .
If your program is slow , it is likely going to make your users frustrated and unhappy , which will be a failure in your mission as a software developer .
So it is important that your program is fast enough , if not very much so .
My aim in this document was to explain the " why " 's , " what " 's and to a lesser extent " how " 's of optimization .
I hope I was successful , and that people who read it will be more willing to optimize their software and more clueful in how to do so .

The war of words between Peter Mandelson and Howard Schultz pits The Prince of Darkness against the King of the Coffee Bean .
But how do the two 55 - year - olds stack up ?
Background
Mandelson Born into Labour party royalty in 1953 as the grandson of Herbert Morrison , and grew up in north London .
Schultz Born in 1953 in Brooklyn , New York , where he was raised in a subsidised housing project .
Education
Mandelson Hendon County Grammar School and St Catherine 's College , Oxford .
Schultz Became the first member of his family to go to college when he won a football scholarship to Northern Michigan University .
Big breaks
Mandelson
After a spell as a producer on the influential LWT current affairs programme Weekend World , he became Labour leader Neil Kinnock 's communications guru and is credited with setting the party on the long road to recovery .
Schultz Started out in the marketing department of Xerox , before joining Hammarplast , a Swedish housewares company .
Then in 1982 he paid a sales call to a Starbucks Coffee , Tea , and Spice store and got hooked .
Opened his own store after his vision for a chain of cafes was rejected by Starbucks ' management , and then took Starbucks over in 1987 .
Highlights …
Mandelson Along with Tony Blair , Gordon Brown and Alastair Campbell , Mandelson was part of the immensely disciplined cabal that created New Labour and won back power in 1997 .
He made his stint as European trade commissioner an opportunity to restore his profile and develop elder - statesman - like gravitas and global clout .
Schultz Under his leadership , Starbucks grew at a rapid rate through the 1990s and floated on the stockmarket in 1992 .
By 2000 , Starbucks had 3,501 stores , and it opened its 10,000th in 2005 , the year he stepped back from running the company .
The charity Aids Action gave him a National Leadership Award for his philanthropic and educational efforts to battle HIV / Aids .
… and lowlights
Mandelson
Had to resign not once but twice from the cabinet , first over failing to declare a home loan from Geoffrey Robinson and then over the row about the Hinduja brothers ' passport application .
Despite his " I'm a fighter , not a quitter " declaration on election night in 2001 , he had to spend the next three years in the wilderness , though he continued to advise Blair .
Schultz Since being parachuted back in to run Starbucks last year , he has closed hundreds of underperforming stores – " the most angst - ridden decision we have made " .
Analysts fear that the company overreached in the good times , and that the $ 5 latte is another victim of the recession .
Friends
Mandelson Tony Blair , of course .
The novelist Robert Harris and City PR supremo Roland Rudd are also close to the fabulously well - connected Mandelson , as is John Birt , the former BBC director general who became a friend back in the Weekend World days .
Over the summer he was a guest of the hedge fund manager Nathaniel Rothschild in Corfu , a stay that later became the source of controversy when details emerged of a private meeting with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and shadow chancellor George Osborne .
Schultz Keeps his private life private , but did reveal this week that he has been secretly giving his friends Starbucks ' soon - to - be - launched instant coffee and was delighted they did n't notice ( or were too well - mannered to mention if they did ) .
Admired in the charity world for his efforts to boost literacy and his Aids work .
Enemies
Mandelson
Where to start ?
Old Labour loyalists have never learned to love the arch - moderniser , while political opponents have underestimated his ruthless skills at their peril .
Gordon Brown used to figure high on the list , but the two men are brothers in arms since Mandelson 's recall to the cabinet in October .
Osborne quickly dropped off the Christmas card list when he appeared to have been the source of claims that Mandelson had " dripped pure poison " about Brown on board Deripaska 's yacht .
Many saw the hand of Mandelson in the subsequent claims – denied by the Tories – that Osborne used the meeting to solicit a party donation from Deripaska .
Schultz Starbucks has picked up plenty of critics along the way .
Some people see the company as the shiny face of global capitalism , crushing independent coffee houses around the world , while others just want it to take its fair - trade obligations more seriously .
One customer even paid for four full - page adverts in the Wall Street Journal savaging the company , and several Starbucks stores in Seattle were attacked during the World Trade Organisation talks in 1999 .
In those quieter moments …
Mandelson Enjoys few things more than watching Strictly Come Dancing , and dreaming of gracing the stage himself .
Schultz A sports nut , particularly keen on basketball and baseball .
What they said yesterday
Mandelson
" Why should I have this guy running down the country ?
Who the fuck is he ?
How the hell are they [ Starbucks ] doing ? "
Schultz " The place that concerns us the most is western Europe , and specifically the UK .
The UK is in a spiral . "
There 's an old saying in the insurance business :
If you have enough money , you can purchase insurance for just about anything -- that 's something that Lloyd's of London has been doing for years .
YouPlayOrWePay.com is no Lloyd's , but it is now offering insurance for something that until now seemed to be uninsurable : your World of Warcraft ( WoW ) downtime .
YouPlayOrWePay.com does n't actually call it " insurance , " but instead refers to it as " third party compensation " -- which is also another way of saying that this downtime compensation is not coming from WoW 's Blizzard Entertainment .
YouPlayOrWePay.com actually promises to compensate WoW players for more than just downtime , but also for busy and crowded servers .
The YouPlayOrWePay.com homepage states : " YouPlayorWePay.com aims to compensate you with CASH for the problems MMORPG players know all too well : waiting queues , system outages and laggy game play .
It does n’t matter if you ’re a level 10 Warlock or a level 70 Warrior .
It does n't matter if you ’re on a new realm with little population or an old realm with a high population !
We aim to compensate you if you experience waiting queues , system outages or laggy game play . "
The YouPlayOrWePay.com site is a bit unclear exactly how the pricing and compensation work , but WoW Insider was able to get at least some clarification from YouPlayorWePay.com 's founders , George Tung and Milos Golubovic .
The amount you pay depends on how many characters you register , the character 's respective levels , and how busy the character 's realms have been , historically .
You can register up to 10 characters per account , from different realms .
Higher - level characters and more crowded realms will cost more .
Golubovic claims that the average price users will pay should be " close to five or six dollars " per month .
Tung adds , " but the lowest is much lower than that . "
According to Golubovic the most any user could spend is 11 dollars per month .
It is important to note , that the fee paid to YouPlayOrWePay.com is on top of your monthly ( $ 12.99 , $ 13.99 , or $ 14.99 ) WoW subscription you already pay to Blizzard .
As to how users are compensated , the YouPlayOrWePay.com site explains that it monitors " all WOW realms 24/ 7 for population size and status " directly from Blizzard 's World Of Warcraft Realm Status page , " and data log all the information . "
Users are compensated when a " character 's realm is either in High or Max population or if the realm is down . "
High and Max populations can mean " potential laggy game play " and waiting queues upwards of 30 minutes .
" The amount of compensation a character earns is dependant [ sic ] on how long that character 's realm has been at each of the above statuses , as well as the compensation level of the realm , and the character 's level . "
The most you can be compensated is equal to 1.75 - times your monthly fee to YouPlayOrWePay.com
That compensation can come as a refund towards your monthly fee , as a check , or to pay for the next month 's YouPlayOrWePay fee .
The YouPlayOrWePay.com homepage offers a number of examples of the type of compensation a user with an 80 - level character might receive in the month of January ; one example shows a $ 25 compensation for a user who has a character in the Dawnbringer realm , which YouPlayOrWePay.com claims has already experienced 26 hours of downtime , 228 hours of time at max , and 272 hours at time at high for January .
As coincidence would have it , at the time this news post was written , both YouPlayOrWePay.com and the official WoW Realm Status are reporting that all realms are down .
A quick check over on the WoW forums show that " realm maintenance " was taking place and that WoW would be down for at least ten hours .
As to whether YouPlayOrWePay.com offers any real value or not , we are going to keep our journalist 's hats on and remain objective on this one , and not state an opinion either way .
The true test will be if users actually sign up and use the service .
The Inglewood Police Department announced today that the Department of Justice is investigating the agency in the wake of several officer - involved shootings of unarmed suspects and other incidents .
According to the department 's website , the investigation would include " past procedures and tactics used by Inglewood police officers involving use of force . "
It 's at least the second ongoing investigation into the department .
Already , the L.A. Sheriff 's Office of Independent Review is probing the department 's tactics .
( For the record :
An earlier version of this post said that in addition to the investigation by the Department of Justice , the state attorney general 's office and L.A. Sheriff 's Office of Independent Review were probing the Inglewood Police Department 's tactics .
The attorney general 's office is not investigating the Inglewood department . )
The Justice Department told the city in March that it was beginning an investigation , and Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks said she would cooperate fully , the website said .
Officials at the Justice Department could not immediately be reached for comment .
A Times investigation found that over the last six years , Inglewood police officers have repeatedly resorted to physical or deadly force against suspects who were unarmed or accused of minor offenses .
On the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Fourth International
By David North
3 November 2008
Published below is a report given by David North , national chairman of the Socialist Equality Party and chairman of the international editorial board of the World Socialist Web Site , to a meeting entitled “ Socialism and the Future of Humanity ” held November 1 in Ann Arbor , Michigan to mark the 70th anniversary of the Fourth International .
Just over 70 years ago , on September 3 , 1938 , the Fourth International held its founding congress in a suburb of Paris .
The conference agenda allowed for only one day of official proceedings , owing to — according to the minutes — " the illegal circumstances under which the congress was held ... "
The " illegal circumstances " to which the minutes referred were those created by the relentless persecution of the Trotskyist movement by the police of the bourgeois - democratic state in France , the armed gangs of fascists acting with legal impunity in much of Europe , and above all , the ruthless assassins of the Soviet secret police , the GPU , working to carry out Stalin 's instructions that Leon Trotsky and his closest collaborators be physically eliminated .
The siege conditions under which the congress was held were reflected in the remarks with which Pierre Naville , then a supporter of the Fourth International , opened the meeting :
Owing to the tragic death of Klement there would be no formal report : Klement had had a detailed , written report in preparation which was to have been circulated , but it had disappeared with the rest of his papers .
The present report would be only a summary . [ 1 ]
The deceased to whom Naville was referring was Rudolf Klement , the late secretary of the Fourth International who had been abducted and murdered by Stalinist agents in July 1938 , less than two months before the conference .
He was the fourth leading figure in the Trotskyist movement to have been murdered in the year immediately preceding the founding congress : ( 1 ) Erwin Wolf in July 1937 in Spain ; ( 2 ) Ignace Reiss in September 1937 in Switzerland ; ( 3 ) Leon Sedov , the son of Trotsky , in February 1938 in Paris ; and , ( 4 ) Klement .
What Naville did not , and could not , know was that a GPU agent who had played a key role in the organization of these four assassinations —
Mark Zborowski — was in attendance at the congress , acting as the representative of the Russian section of the Fourth International .
These assassinations were inextricably linked to the campaign of political genocide directed against the remnants of revolutionary workers , socialist intellectuals and Bolshevik leaders who had played a decisive role in the October 1917 Revolution .
Directed by Stalin , the three frame - up trials held in Moscow between August 1936 and March 1938 were the public manifestation of a massive operation aimed at the total destruction of Trotskyist , i.e. , Marxist , influence in the USSR .
Contemporary bourgeois historians insist , with few exceptions , that the Stalinist terror had little to do with Trotsky and Trotskyism .
Stalin , they claim , had no reason to fear Trotsky , whom he had expelled from the USSR in 1929 , and whose influence was negligible .
This superficial appraisal has been challenged by the late Soviet / Russian historian , General Dmitri Volkogonov , who , despite his own hostility to Trotsky , emphasized that Stalin was tormented by the " ghost " of the exiled revolutionary :
Trotsky was no longer present , yet Stalin grew to hate him even more in his absence , and Trotsky 's spectre frequently returned to haunt the usurper ...
He thought of Trotsky when he had to sit and listen to Molotov , Kaganovich , Khrushchev and Zhdanov .
Trotsky was of a different caliber intellectually , with his grasp of organization and his talents as a speaker and writer .
In every way he was far superior to this bunch of bureaucrats , but he was also superior to Stalin and Stalin knew it .
" How could I have let such an enemy slip through my fingers ? " he almost wailed .
On one occasion he confessed to his small circle that this had been one of the biggest mistakes of his life ...
The thought that Trotsky was speaking not only for himself , but for all his silent supporters and oppositionists inside the USSR , was particularly painful to Stalin .
When he read Trotsky 's works , such as The Stalin School of Falsification , An Open Letter to Members of the Bolshevik Party , or The Stalinist Thermidor , the Leader almost lost his self - control ...
Stalin read the translation of The Revolution Betrayed in a single night , seething with bile .
It was the last straw .
For some years he had been nurturing two decisions in his mind , and now he proposed to have them carried out .
First , he must at all costs remove Trotsky from the political arena ...
Second , he was now even more convinced on the need for a determined and final liquidation of all potential enemies inside the country . [ 2 ]
Trotsky understood very well the physical power of his enemies and the scale of the dangers that confronted him and his supporters .
But he conducted his work with extraordinary confidence in the ultimate victory : the Fourth International as the instrument of world socialist revolution .
Celebrating the founding of the Fourth International , he declared on October 18 , 1938 :
The hangmen think in their obtuseness and cynicism that it is possible to frighten us .
They err !
Under blows we become stronger .
The bestial politics of Stalin are only politics of despair .
It is possible to kill individual soldiers of our army , but not to frighten them .
Friends , we will repeat again in this day of celebration ... it is not possible to frighten us . [ 3 ]
The origins of the Fourth International lay in the struggle initiated by Trotsky and the Left Opposition in October 1923 against the increasing bureaucratization of the Soviet state and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union .
This political struggle began even before Stalin emerged as Trotsky 's principal opponent and the leader of the Communist Party .
For Trotsky , Stalin 's rise to power was not the cause of the degeneration of the Soviet state and the Communist Party , but rather , a political manifestation of the strengthening of political reaction within the USSR as a result of the defeats suffered by the working class in Western Europe in the aftermath of the October Revolution .
For Lenin and Trotsky , the fate of socialism within the Soviet Union depended upon the victory of the world socialist revolution .
The idea that socialism could develop within Russia alone , an isolated and economically backward state , was incompatible with the most basic premises of Marxist theory .
Stalin 's claim , in late 1924 , that socialism could be built in one country — that is , that the Soviet Union could achieve socialism apart from the outcome of the struggles of the international working class beyond the borders of the USSR , especially in Western Europe and North America — revealed the essentially nationalist orientation , perspective and program of the ruling bureaucracy .
By " socialism " the bureaucracy — led by Joseph Stalin — meant a system of national economic autarchy which safeguarded the income and privileges it enjoyed on the basis of state ownership of the means of production .
The bureaucracy 's persecution of Trotsky and the Left Opposition entailed the falsification and repudiation of the Marxist and internationalist foundations of the Bolshevik Party .
Ever more openly and crassly , the Stalinist regime subordinated the interests of the international revolutionary movement to the needs of the bureaucracy .
The result of its betrayal of the program of world socialist revolution was a series of political defeats for the international working class — in Britain in 1926 , in China in 1927 , and , most disastrously , in Germany in 1933 .
Stalin 's catastrophic misdirection of the German Communist Party made possible Hitler 's rise to power in January 1933 .
This event , in turn , set into motion the chain of events which led to World War II and the deaths of tens of millions of people .
In the aftermath of Hitler 's victory , Trotsky and the International Left Opposition altered their previous policy , which had been oriented toward the reform of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Third ( Communist ) International .
Trotsky now called for the construction of a new International and for a political revolution in the USSR .
He defined the Stalinist bureaucracy within the USSR as an agency of imperialism within the workers ' movement .
The years between 1933 and 1938 were devoted primarily to the theoretical and political preparation of the founding congress of the Fourth International .
Writing in 1935 , Trotsky evaluated this work as the most important of his life — even more important than his role in the organization of the October Revolution and the founding and leadership of the Red Army .
In justifying this assessment , Trotsky argued that if he had been absent in 1917 , Lenin 's leadership would have been sufficient to overcome the political opposition in the Bolshevik Party and carry through the decision to take power .
But now ( in the 1930s ) there was no one else capable of educating a new cadre of revolutionaries and preserving the continuity of the Marxist movement .
Trotsky acknowledged that he was , at this point in time , indispensable — and that he would need five years to ensure the continuity of the heritage of Marxism .
Trotsky , when he made that assessment , had exactly five years to live — and he succeeded in realizing this goal .
It is necessary to understand why Trotsky 's work was indispensable .
Reference to his genius is insufficient .
Three elements of his intellectual and political personality must be stressed .
First , Trotsky was the last great representative of " classical Marxism " — that is , the representative of a theoretical and political school and tradition that traced itself directly back to Marx and Engels , and which trained and inspired the mass revolutionary workers ' movement that emerged in the last decades of the 19th century .
As explained in The Historical and International Foundations of the Socialist Equality Party , Trotsky embodied " a conception of revolutionary theory , rooted philosophically in materialism , directed outward toward the cognition of objective reality , oriented to the education and political mobilization of the working class , and strategically preoccupied with the revolutionary struggle against capitalism . " [ 4 ]
Second , Trotsky grasped more profoundly than any other political thinker of the 20th century the global dimensions and dynamics of the socialist revolution , the dialectical interaction of international socioeconomic processes and historically - determined national conditions .
This understanding found expression in the theory of permanent revolution , first formulated by Trotsky in response to the problems raised by the 1905 Revolution in Russia — in which the relation between traditional bourgeois - democratic tasks and the implicitly socialist strivings of the working class , in a backward country , emerged in a manner that contradicted existing conceptions and required a new theoretical paradigm .
Third , Trotsky assimilated the essential political lessons of Lenin 's struggle against Menshevik opportunism and centrism in the years between the split of 1903 and the revolutionary denouement of 1917 .
Having crossed swords with Lenin over questions of political principle in that crucial formative period , Trotsky came to understand and appreciate Lenin 's extraordinary foresight in opposing all forms of opportunism in the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party and , later , after the outbreak of the imperialist war in 1914 , within the Second International .
The lessons that Trotsky drew from this historical experience formed an essential political foundation for the struggle to build the Fourth International .
Each of these elements of Trotsky 's intellectual and political itinerary are deserving of detailed elaboration .
But time demands a more concentrated approach .
Let us , therefore , focus on the question of " classical " Marxism .
Even among those who are familiar with and place high value on Trotsky 's powers as a revolutionary strategist , it is all too rare that one finds sufficient appreciation of the theoretical foundations of his political thought .
Notwithstanding Trotsky 's insistence on dialectical materialism as the mainspring of revolutionary thought , even sympathetic commentators view such professions of philosophical commitment to be arcane and insubstantial .
For example , a noted scholar and specialist on Trotsky 's social and political thought , after citing a passage in which Trotsky expounds the basic elements of dialectical materialism , asks with evident exasperation : " What , however , did all this have to do with the study of society and the formulation of Marxist revolutionary policy and strategy ? " [ 5 ]
The question betrays inadequate understanding of the relationship between philosophical outlook and method , on the one hand , and political thought and practice on the other .
It also indicates a limited appreciation of the content and implications of the confrontation , with which Trotsky was extremely familiar , between Marxian materialism and various schools of philosophical idealism .
While a great deal has been written about the political struggles within the many conflicting tendencies of the European ( and especially Russian ) socialist movement prior to World War I , far less attention has been paid to the theoretical conflicts .
Even the conflict against the revisionism of Eduard Bernstein has been examined largely from the standpoint of political program and perspective .
The differences in these spheres were , of course , of immense and enduring significance .
But another aspect of this crucial conflict between Marxism and revisionism needs to be stressed — that is , the philosophical dimensions of the struggle .
Examined from this standpoint , Bernstein — a neo-Kantian — was part of a broader intellectual tendency whose opposition to Marxism was rooted philosophically in various currents of subjective idealism .
Briefly stated , these tendencies rejected philosophical and historical materialism , which asserts the primacy of matter over consciousness .
On this basis , they rejected the conception that the development of human society , including its intellectual development , proceeded in accordance with laws related to the economic structure of society .
There was no more determined advocate of the materialist conception of history than Trotsky , whose theoretical education — beginning in the late 1890s — proceeded in constant conflict with the increasingly influential schools of subjective idealist and irrationalist thought .
Near the end of his long revolutionary career , Trotsky offered the following explanation of Marx 's materialist outlook :
Having established science as cognition of the objective recurrences of nature , man has tried stubbornly and persistently to exclude himself from science , reserving for himself special privileges in the shape of alleged intercourse with supersensory forces ( religion ) , or with timeless moral precepts ( idealism ) .
Marx deprived man of these odious privileges definitely and forever , looking upon him as a natural link in the evolutionary process of material nature ; upon human society as the organization of production and distribution ; upon capitalism as a stage in the development of human society ...
It is utterly impossible to seek the causes for the recurrences in capitalist society in the subjective consciousness — in the intentions or plans — of its members .
The objective recurrences of capitalism were formulated before science began to think about them seriously .
To this day the preponderant majority of men know nothing about the laws that govern capitalist economy .
The whole strength of Marx 's method was in his approach to economic phenomena , not from the subjective point of view of certain persons , but from the objective point of view of the development of society as a whole , just as an experimental natural scientist approaches a beehive or an ant - hill .
For economic science the decisive significance is how people act , not what they themselves think about their actions .
At the base of society is not religion and morality , but nature and labor .
Marx 's method is materialistic , because it proceeds from existence to consciousness , not the other way around .
Marx 's method is dialectic , because it regards both nature and society as they evolve , and evolution itself as the constant struggle of conflicting forces . [ 6 ]
In the world of political struggle , the application of Marx 's materialist outlook required that revolutionary policy be based , first and foremost , upon an analysis of objective socio-economic conditions .
The revolutionary party had to base its actions not on the prevailing moods and illusions of the masses , but on the really existing level of the socio-economic contradictions of capitalism .
The moods of the masses were themselves a distorted reflection of objective conditions .
The revolutionary party could overcome these moods only to the extent that it fought within the working class for a correct understanding of the capitalist crisis and its political implications .
In discussions between Trotsky and his American supporters , held in May 1938 on the eve of the founding congress of the Fourth International , Trotsky stressed this objective starting point of the revolutionary program :
... The political backwardness of the American working class is very great .
This signifies that the danger of a fascist catastrophe is very great .
This is the point of departure for all our activity .
The program must express the objective tasks of the working class rather than the backwardness of the workers .
It must reflect society as it is , and not the backwardness of the working class .
It is an instrument to overcome and vanquish the backwardness .
That is why we must express in our program the whole acuteness of the social crises of the capitalist society , including in the first line the United States .
We cannot postpone or modify objective conditions which do n't depend on us .
We cannot guarantee that the masses will solve the crisis ; but we must express the situation as it is , and that is the task of the program . [ 7 ]
These words are invested with acute relevance in the present situation .
What should be the starting point of revolutionary politics today — the objective nature and implications of the unfolding crisis of American and world capitalism , whose depth and severity are without equal since the Great Depression of the 1930s — or the prevailing and confused state of political consciousness that exists among masses of workers ?
Should we adapt our program to the present - day illusions among workers in the electoral rhetoric of Barack Obama ?
Or should we expose the poison hidden within the honeyed phrases , and prepare the masses for the great social conflicts that will inevitably be generated by the intensification of the economic crisis ?
The election will be concluded in three days .
Whichever of the two bourgeois parties wins the presidential and congressional elections will then confront the consequences of the spiraling economic disaster .
If , as now seems likely , Obama emerges as president - elect , he will assume central responsibility for pursuing the national and international interests of the American ruling class .
How long , do you imagine , will he be able to preserve the illusion that the crisis affects all classes of the population in the same way , that the " American people are in this together , " that " sacrifices " can and will be " shared , " and that the interests of the poor are the same as the interests of the rich ?
How long will it be before the irrepressible determination of the financial aristocracy to exploit the opportunities created by the crisis for its own maximum enrichment becomes painfully obvious to the masses of workers ?
Or , for that matter , the powerlessness of a President Obama to control these strivings , even if he wanted to ?
It is worth recalling Trotsky 's comments in 1939 on the Roosevelt administration 's New Deal , which is generally portrayed by historians as the apex of governmental radicalism .
Trotsky noted rather sardonically the generally ineffectual character of Roosevelt 's confrontations with the American bourgeoisie :
Today , monopolists are the strongest section of the ruling class .
The government is in no position to fight against monopoly in general , i.e. , against the class by whose will it rules .
While attacking one phase of monopoly , it is obliged to seek an ally in other phases of monopoly .
In union with banks and light industry it can deliver occasional blows against the trusts of heavy industry , which , by the way , do not stop earning fantastic profits because of that .
[ 8 ]
Will the same fate befall President Obama ?
Will the walls of American capitalism tumble before the rhetorical trumpets of Mr. " Yes We Can " ?
No they wo n't .
As a matter of fact , his performance , not to mention that of Senator McCain , during the infamous bank bailout crisis provided an indication of how an Obama administration will react when confronted with the demands of the ruling aristocracy .
In the final analysis , the policies of an Obama administration will be determined by the objective conditions confronting American capitalism .
And it is at this point that a clear distinction must be made between the United States in the era of Roosevelt and the United States in the era of Obama .
Three quarters of a century have passed since Franklin Roosevelt first took the oath of office and proclaimed that the United States had nothing to fear but fear itself .
He spoke as the leader of a capitalist nation which , for all its economic problems , still retained at its disposal colossal resources .
In comparison to the industrial might of the United States , all other nations were dwarfs .
Those days have long passed .
The United States has been for decades in economic decline .
It has accumulated massive debts as its industries have decayed .
Indeed , the essential source of the economic crisis can be located in the separation of the process of wealth accumulation from the material processes of production .
On the eve of the explosion of the economic crisis , the US financial industry accounted for 40 percent of all profits !
A President Obama will not have a " New Deal " to offer the American working class — though one should recall that Roosevelt 's New Deal proved incapable of ending the Depression .
The economic crisis was " solved " by World War II .
Moreover , whatever gains were achieved during the 1930s were the product not of government reforms and handouts , but of immense social struggles by the working class — such as the Toledo Auto - Lite strike , the Minneapolis and San Francisco general strikes , the Flint sit - down strike and other powerful and bloody battles .
What , then , are the prospects for socialism in the United States ?
This was a question about which Trotsky , a keen observer of American society and its economic and political structures , thought a great deal .
He understood very well the power and influence of capitalist ideology in the so - called " Land of Unlimited Opportunity . "
He wrote in 1939 :
In the United States , where a man who owns a million is referred to as being " worth " a million , market concepts have sunk in deeper than anywhere else .
Until quite recently Americans gave very little thought to the nature of economic relations .
In the land of the most powerful economic system , economic theory continued to be exceedingly barren .
Only the present deep - going crisis of American economy has bluntly confronted public opinion with the fundamental problems of capitalist society . [ 9 ]
The process of economic , social and political enlightenment was preempted by the Second World War , from which the United States emerged victorious — not only militarily and politically , but also economically .
What need was there to continue questioning the legitimacy of capitalism when 75 percent of industrial production was located in the United States and where the dollar was " as good as gold . "
Moreover , the post - war anti-communist witch - hunts were aimed at constricting intellectual life in the United States and delegitimizing , if not completely criminalizing , the Marxist critique of American capitalism .
More recently , the collapse of the Stalinist regimes in the USSR and Eastern Europe , in the late 1980s and early 1990s , were hailed as definite proof of the irrevocable triumph of capitalism , and even of the " End of History . "
But what remains of capitalist triumphalism today , in the aftermath of the catastrophic failure of the economic system ?
Little more than a month ago , pleading for public support for a bailout of the banks , President Bush declared before a nationwide audience that the capitalist system in the United States stood on the brink of collapse .
Two days later , he told members of his cabinet and congressional leaders that " This sucker is going down " !
The entire ideology of American capitalism — of the infallibility of the market , of the absolute independence of the market from the state — lost all credibility .
The high prophet of the cult of the market , Alan Greenspan — hailed as the " Maestro " of the Federal Reserve — appeared before a congressional committee as a shuffling and bewildered old man , on the verge of senility , confessing amazement that markets had failed to behave as he believed they would .
And against the backdrop of this crisis , the dreaded " S " word has made its reappearance in American political life .
An unguarded reference by Obama to sharing the wealth , by which he meant absolutely no harm , has been seized upon by McCain and Palin as proof that Obama is planning to introduce socialism into America .
Senator Biden was asked on television whether Obama was , in fact , a closet - Marxist !
These episodes reveal the fears lurking within the ruling class .
Obama and Biden are taunted by their desperate Republican opponents for planning to " share the wealth . "
The Democratic candidates indignantly deny the accusation .
But will masses of American workers , under conditions of mounting unemployment and mass foreclosures , agree that " sharing the wealth " is really such a bad idea ?
Social being determines social consciousness .
Conditions of crisis not only discredit old ideologies .
They give rise to conceptions that are in alignment with objective reality .
It will not be possible to maintain the semi-official ban on Marxism in discussions of the crisis of American and world capitalism .
As Trotsky foresaw , objective events will force a profound shift in political life .
What he wrote in 1939 acquires in the present situation extraordinary relevance :
Partial reforms and patchwork will do no good .
Historical development has come to one of those decisive stages when only the direct intervention of the masses is able to sweep away the reactionary obstructions and lay the foundations of a new regime .
Abolition of private ownership of the means of production is the first prerequisite to planned economy , i.e. , the introduction of reason into the sphere of human relations , first on a national and eventually on a world scale ...
Liberated humanity will draw itself up to its full height . [ 10 ]

UNITED NATIONS , Feb 5 ( Reuters ) - Sudan's U.N. envoy on Thursday blasted Costa Rica as a " banana republic " after its ambassador said there was no justification for suspending any war crimes indictment of the Sudanese president over Darfur .
" The issue here is bigger than the small minds ... of some ambassador who talked with you just some minutes ago , " Sudanese Ambassador Abdalmahmoud Abdalhaleem told reporters after a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Sudan .
He said the Costa Rican envoy was trying " to inflame and inflict damage " on the stalled Darfur peace process .
Speaking afterward to Reuters about Costa Rica , Abdalhaleem said , " It is a banana republic . "
His Costa Rican counterpart , Jorge Urbina , who is in his second year as an elected member of the 15 - nation council , told reporters he saw no justification for Security Council intervention to suspend any indictment of Sudanese President Omar Hassan al - Bashir for suspected war crimes in Darfur .
The chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court in The Hague , Luis Moreno Ocampo , asked the court 's judges last year to issue an arrest warrant for Bashir on suspicion of orchestrating a campaign of genocide in Darfur .
U.N. diplomats say the judges will most likely decide in favor of indicting Bashir and expect the decision to be announced later this month .
If Bashir is indicted , Sudan has urged the council to use its power to suspend the prosecution in the interest of getting a lasting peace deal for Darfur .
Urbina said the idea that peace and justice might be incompatible was " absolutely false . "
He compared the discussion of Bashir and Darfur to the war in the former Yugoslavia when some argued against indicting suspected war criminals .
" At that time , very often politicians , diplomats and analysts were arguing that justice was interfering in the path to peace , " he said .
" We learned that it was different . "
' CRAZY PROSECUTOR '
Abdalhaleem was clearly furious about the comparison .
" We need no lessons and lectures from ambassadors like the Costa Rican , " he said .
" He has no ... justification whatsoever to appear before you and to talk about Article 16 and the need to leave this crazy prosecutor do what he 's planning to do . "
He was referring to Article 16 of the ICC statute , which gives the council the right to suspend ICC prosecutions .
U.N. officials have repeatedly expressed concern there might be a spike in violence in Darfur if the ICC indicts Bashir .
Sudan has promised to continue cooperating with U.N. peacekeepers but has warned the world body there might be widespread public outrage across the country .
Abdalhaleem said permanent Security Council members Russia and China and other non-permanent members support invoking Article 16 .
Diplomats say the council is divided on the issue .
The Sudanese envoy also spoke disparagingly about any future indictment of Bashir , saying it would be like giving " birth to a dead rat that is smelling and no use at all . "
U.N. officials say as many as 300,000 people have died and more than 2.5 million have been driven from their homes since mostly non-Arab rebels took up arms against Khartoum in 2003 , accusing it of neglecting the development of the region .

This book is in fact two short books for the price of one .
The second half comprises a selection drawn from these articles Cook published over the last six years in a variety of websites and newspapers .
The first half is an outstanding essay that seeks to distill the so - called “ Israeli - Palestinian conflict ” and to trace within it the overarching principle that guides Israel ’s policies .
Cook ’s thesis is that “ the goal of Israeli policy is to make Palestine and the Palestinians disappear for good . ”
Proving such a strong thesis is not an easy task .
Many historians , and many laypersons with a liberal education , tend to be suspicious of plans and purposes .
History , when examined closely enough , often looks like a patchwork of accidents .
No doubt chance had a substantial impact on the history of Zionism .
Few of the colonizers who laid the ground for the future State of Israel in the 1920s imagined the coming holocaust in Europe , or the massive influx of Jews from Arab countries .
The most fateful decisions taken by the state were the result of intense internal debates and can be easily imagined resolving the other way .
For example , the decisions to attack Egypt in 1956 and 1967 required the no small feat of isolating a sitting prime minister , Moshe Sharett in 1955 and Levi Eshkol in 1967 .
Ariel Sharon ’s provocation that ignited the second Palestinian intifada in September 2000 was an election campaign ploy , and so were the recent massacres in Gaza .
However , when a driver has an accident every year , it is not enough to note that each accident was different — here the street lighting was faulty , there the brakes malfunctioned , one time happened during a snow storm ; we are at fault if we ignore the pattern .
Cook synthesizes a voluminous array of books relating to both the ideology and practices of the Israeli state , in order to present a compelling and appalling pattern of actions and words leading , planning and driving in one inexorable direction , the disappearance of Palestine and Palestinians .
He does this in a lean and matter - of - fact prose , with a style that keeps the inevitable pull of ironic language in check , and with effortless narrative guidance that acquaints the reader along the way with the main historical and geographical signposts .
The first chapter covers Zionism ’s early beginnings and the erasure of Palestinian history , the colonial imagination of the “ empty land , ” the emergence of active plans for getting rid of the inhabitants of Palestinian villages ( transfer ) , followed by the actual massive ethnic cleansing that took place in 1948 .
A battered Palestinian minority remained under Israeli control , mainly in the Galilee and the Negev .
Cook then describes and traces the common denominator of the various policies adopted vis-a - vis this minority after 1948 , from land confiscations and “ judaization ” campaigns to explicit calls for transfer , revealing the persistence and consistency of the overarching Israeli purpose : disappearing Palestinians .
The bulk of the main essay is devoted to the history of the colonization of the West Bank and Gaza , from the war of 1967 and the pursuant occupation , through the various strategic phases of the settlements enterprise , up to the Oslo accords of the mid-1990s , the second Palestinian intifada , the building of the apartheid wall and Sharon ’s “ disengagement ” from Gaza .
It is in the Occupied Palestinian Territories , where demographic constraints make Palestinian presence so much more of a threat to Zionism , that the single - minded pursuit of the goal of disappearance assumes its most monstrous forms so far , fully justifying the book ’s subtitle , “ Israel ’s experiments in human despair . ”
Cook weaves into the historical swipe copious evidence about the planning and thinking behind the settlement project .
This thinking appears most clearly in the Kafka - esque legal subterfuges that Israel devised in order to give ethnic cleansing the patina of legality .
The chapters about the law is a must - read primer into one of the most chilling aspects of Palestinian life under Israeli rule , chilling precisely because of its seemingly aseptic calm and the invisibility of violence .
Political theorist Hannah Arendt ’s phrase , “ the banality of evil , ” both resonates in and is questioned by this account : the banality of the local commanders and petty bureaucrats who make the occupation happen cannot exist without the sadistic creativity of its lawyers .
The final pages of the essay assess the implications of this story .
Cook uses the late Israeli sociologist Baruch Kimmerling ’s concept of “ politicide ” to call attention to the careful ways in which Israel constructs and describes its policies in order to dodge an accusation of genocide , when in fact the accusation is fully merited :
“ So long as Israeli outrages can be presented as spontaneous , unsystematic and related to security needs , the international community will turn a blind eye .
As long as Israel ensures that politicide — a subtle incremental , war of attrition against the Palestinian public and private life — does not look much like the popular notion of genocide ( concentration camps and butchery )
Israel will be able to continue its policies unchecked .
The ultimate goal , however will be the same : the disappearance of a Palestinian nation for good . ”
Being proven right by events is not conclusive evidence of a thesis , but it is nonetheless a useful reminder that understanding matters .
Cook writes in the last paragraph , “ Gaza ’s inmates are staring at a future in which they are supposed to return to the Stone Age , without fuel , electricity , medicines , and even basic foodstuffs . ”
That future is here , making Cook ’s other dire predictions all the more alarming .
Part of what the essay reveals , although Cook does not make it explicit , is how much the Israeli dependence on constructed historical narratives also translates into an almost “ literary ” sensitivity to the power of narration that is itself harnessed to the goals of disappearing Palestinians .
Not only does Israel seek to erase the Palestinian presence in the land , and with it that historical memory , but its strategies of erasure are constrained by narrative rules , and designed with a view of fragmenting the potential national narrative that emerges from the erasure itself .
Israel seeks not only to erase , but , borrowing from the language of architecture , to erase the erasure of Palestine , thus satisfying both internal needs for a clear conscience as well as the demands of Western amnesia to depict every new phase of this genocide as “ spontaneous , unsystematic and related to security needs . ”
History and journalism with memory , writing that insists on un-erasing the erasure , defragmenting the accidental and the spontaneous and tracing its patterns back to the bureaucrats , ideologues and politicians behind it and simultaneously to the resistance in front of it , is not just a matter of accuracy and knowledge , but also of survival .
Cook not only seeks to meet this requirement , but also exposes the complicity of those writers for whose consumption Israel tailors its genocide the way it does .
This is done in the second half of the book .
The reprinted articles are a useful series of “ snapshots ” from different moments in the war of disappearance .
They tackle a variety of topics , from the persecution of Palestinian political leader Azmi Bishara , the rise of the Russian right - winger Avigdor Lieberman , the difference between left and right in Israeli politics , the siege of Gaza and more .
An important number deal with analyzing the way various narrators of the events in question play an active role in the erasure of the disappearance of Palestine .
Here , Cook takes to task Israeli writers Uri Avnery and David Grossman , as well as the rights organizations B’Tselem and Human Rights Watch for the complicit ways they represent the Palestinian struggle and Israeli actions .
Cook ’s book is a timely and useful contribution to the urgent work of countering the hegemonic discourse in the West as it seeks to accept and legitimize the disappearance of Palestine .
There are however two lacunae in this exposition of Israel to Western audiences .
First , Palestinian resistance appears in it only en passant , in a fragmented way .
In un-erasing the erasure , Cook reconstructs Israel as a subject carrying out genocide against Palestinians , but leaves Palestinian agency fragmented and to a large extent erased .
This fragmentation is no doubt the result of successful Israeli repression , but part of the task of writing the story of this repression is to resist and recover from it .
For a Western audience , this lacuna means that the book ultimately sustains a humanitarian appeal more than a demand for solidarity and support for Palestinian resistance .
The second lacuna is the concentration on the surface of Israeli policies .
The coherent portrayal of Israel as it perpetrates genocide against Palestinians is not false .
Without a doubt Israel is persistent in a slow drive to disappear Palestine .
But beneath this coherence lay internal struggles and fractures that matter to the success of the work of stopping and undoing that disappearance .
In the late 1980s , a dominant section of Israeli elites was eager , for reasons of self - interest , to move from a colonial to a post - colonial relation with Palestinians .
To be sure , that would not have ended the repression , and it would not have meant the end of the Palestinian liberation struggle .
However , the results of that failed transformation , doomed by the interplay between the global neo-liberal reaction and the internal fractures of Jewish Israeli society , were fundamental to the reinvigorated genocidal policies adopted by Israel in the ’90s and beyond .
As vital as it is to reconstruct Palestinian agency in the face of fragmentation , it is also vital to deconstruct Israeli agency to both its local internal components and to the global structures that co-opt and use it .
By attributing to Israel a level of coherence that it does n’t actually possess we risk echoing uncritically the false claims of its leadership to represent Jews and Jewish interest , supposedly against Palestinians , a hostile region and a hostile world .
Especially today , amidst a collapsing neo-liberal globalization and the inchoate possibilities opened by this collapse , it is crucial to de-exceptionalize the story of Israel and to integrate its analysis within larger frameworks that can facilitate dismantling its genocidal structures before they fulfill their apocalyptic potential .
I am well aware that addressing both issues would have required a much beefier volume than Cook intended .
It would have been useful however to call attention to the lack and make the reader aware of what is left untold .

If a correspondence theory of truth is correct , and if thus for a sentence to be truth it has to correspond to the world in a way that mirrors the structure and matches parts of the sentence properly with parts of the world , then the structure of a true sentence would have to be mirrored in the world .
But if , on the other extreme , a coherence theory of truth is correct then the truth of a sentence does not require a structural correspondence to the world , but merely a coherence with other sentences .
One way to understand logic is as the study of the most general forms of thought or judgment , what we called [ a type of logic ] .
One way to understand ontology is as the study of the most general features of what there is , our [ a type of ontology ] .
Now , there is a striking similarity between the most general forms of thought and the most general features of what there is .
Take one example .
Many thoughts have a subject of which they predicate something .
What there is contains individuals that have properties .
It seems that there is the same structure in thought as well as in reality .
And similarly for other structural features .
If there is an explanation of this similarity to be given it seems it could go in one of two ways : either the structure of thought explains the structure of reality , or the other way round .
An explanation of the latter kind , where the structure of reality explains that of thought , could go as follows : the world has a certain basic structure , being constituted by objects which have properties , which other objects can have as well .
To properly represent a world like this the creatures from which we evolved had to develop minds that mirror this structure .
Those who developed a different kind of mind died out .
Therefore we have a mind whose thoughts have a structure which mirrors the structure of the world .

When the Steels Creek community met on Saturday , the main question they grappled with was whether to rebuild now or to wait for the recommendations from the upcoming royal commission on how to fireproof their house .
Nobody knows better how to answer that question than Mr Twentyman .
An electrician by trade , he has spent the past four years building his house and planning how to survive a fire .
He spent thousands on aluminium insulation and concrete - rendered walls .
He bought sealant by the carton , rather than by the tube , to make sure that embers could never penetrate a nook of his place .
His two large water tanks were placed outside , in between his house and where the fire approached .
He installed a sprinkler system on his house , which was only days off being completed but managed to water the exterior of the property with an industrial pump he had bought .
He cleared trees in his immediate vicinity - much to the dismay of his neighbours , who objected .
John Sutherland never made good on his promise to eat Salman Rushdie 's The Enchantress of Florence if it failed to win the Booker prize , so here 's hoping America 's National Endowment for the Arts literature director David Kipen will prove more honourable .
Kipen , programme director of American community reading scheme The Big Read , has vowed to eat a copy of To Kill a Mockingbird if any one of the 128 residents of Kelleys Island in Ohio fails to read the book .
Weighing in at 309 pages , it is at least likely that Harper Lee 's classic tale of racial prejudice will prove more digestible than Rushdie 's 464 - page novel .
So far , according to local paper the Sandusky Register , 70 residents have pledged to read the book , but Kipen , an author and book critic , needs the remaining 58 to sign up , or he 'll be facing a nasty case of indigestion .
If everyone living on the island reads To Kill a Mockingbird , and signs an affidavit promising they 've done so , Kipen has said he 'll buy them all a pizza .
Kipen said he had long wanted to find a town " small enough and brave enough to accept the challenge of dragooning every last literate resident , without exception , into tackling its chosen book " , when Kelleys Island , a four square mile island in Lake Erie , was suggested to him .
He did n't say whether he'd be tackling the hardback or the paperback edition of the novel if he fails to convince the island to get reading .
Sutherland said last year that if The Enchantress of Florence did n't win the Booker , he'd " curry [ his ] proof copy and eat it " .
It did n't .
And he did n't .
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - Ventilation and some sunshine could go a long way to reduce tuberculosis risks in hospitals and prisons , two strongholds of the contagious lung disease , the World Health Organization said .

In its latest Global Tuberculosis Control report , released on Tuesday , the United Nations agency also doubled its estimate of how many HIV - infected people catch and die from tuberculosis , and warned especially deadly strains are continuing to spread in all corners of the world .
Mario Raviglione , director of the WHO ’s Stop TB department , said that because tuberculosis bacteria thrive in stagnant air , “ simply opening the doors ” can reduce the chances that patients , inmates and others will become infected with the disease that killed about 1.8 million people in 2007 .
That global tuberculosis death toll includes 1.3 million HIV - negative people and 456,000 who were also infected with the AIDS virus , deaths from which are strictly classified in health statistics as HIV fatalities .
“ You can only die once , ” explained Kevin De Cock , the WHO ’s HIV / AIDS Director , who estimated HIV patients whose immunity levels are weak are more than 20 times more likely to catch tuberculosis than the rest of the population .
BETTER DATA
The WHO ’s large revision of the number of people with both HIV and tuberculosis reflected “ better analyses , better data , and better methodology ” and not a real increase in the twin infections between 2006 and 2007 , De Cock told a Geneva news briefing .
HIV patients should be screened for tuberculosis and given drugs to reduce their risks of developing the disease , which can be caught by breathing in air droplets from a cough or sneeze of an infected person , the Belgian infectious - disease expert said .
About a third of the world ’s population is infected with the bacterium that causes tuberculosis , but only a small percentage of people develop the disease , which normally arises when immune levels are weakened due to pregnancy or illness .
The global prevalence of tuberculosis was nearly stable in 2007 , with 9.27 million new cases reported compared to 9.24 million in 2006 .
Although antibiotics can cure tuberculosis , drug - resistant strains of the disease have proliferated in recent years as a result of medical errors and the failure of patients to take the full six - to nine - month drug treatment course .
The WHO said that about 500,000 people worldwide have been diagnosed with multi- drug - resistant strains of tuberculosis , which cannot be treated with two or more front - line drugs .
And 55 countries and territories worldwide have reported at least one case of “ extensively drug- resistant ” tuberculosis or XDR - TB , which is virtually untreatable with today ’s medicines , according to the WHO study .
The actual prevalence of that lethal strain is probably even higher , as few poor countries are currently doing the series of tests required to evaluate the extent of drug resistance in their patients , Raviglione told the Geneva briefing .
AEROPLANES SAFER THAN BUILDINGS
In 2007 an Atlanta lawyer infected with drug - resistant tuberculosis flew to and from Europe for his wedding and honeymoon , and then entered the United States from Canada , triggering an international health scare about the disease .
The same year , a Mexican traveler flew across the U.S. - Mexico border 21 times despite warnings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to U.S. border officials that he also had a drug - resistant tuberculosis strain .
Raviglione , who has led the WHO ’s tuberculosis fight since 2003 , said that transmission risks were only highly acute on flights lasting more than eight hours , and for people sitting within five rows of an infected person .
“ In airplanes the ventilation system is actually better than in most buildings , ” he said .
Citing research showing that ultra-violet light can zap tuberculosis bacteria , Raviglione said all efforts to improve natural light in prisons and hospitals could help reduce threats from contagious droplets .
Better air flow through ventilation systems or open windows and doors , and the use of masks in stagnant areas , would also help supplement screenings and antibiotic courses to accomplish the U.N. ’s goal of halting and reversing the spread of tuberculosis by 2015 .
“ It is feasible .
What it needs is commitment , some money , and people who know what they are doing , ” Raviglione said .
